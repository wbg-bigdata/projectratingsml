REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAYS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of $68.0 million.
The loan would be for a term of 24 years including a four year grace period
with interes: of 7.25 percent per annum to help finance a project fot the
improvement of highways.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
the Philippines"' (78-PH dated April 20, 1973) was circulated to the Executive
Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85). Since the previous economic report in
May 1972, the Philippines has suffered one of the worst floods of the
century in the Central Luzon area, President Marcos has imposed martial
law, and a new constitution, establishing a parliamentary system of govern-
ment, has been promulgated. The President has announced that martial law
will continue under the new constitution and that elections for a national
assembly will be postponed for six or seven years. The President is under-
taking social and economic reforms and has announced that implementation of
an agrarian reform program is a high priority in the Philippine development
program for the immediate future. This would involve transferring title
to about a million tenants in rice anc corn areas over the next five years
as well as improving supporting services for them. In addition to decrees
on agrarian reform, the President has promulgated decrees on tax reform
and on a number of bills which had been awaiting Congressional approval,
including the customs and tariff bill and the government reorganization
bill.
3.        In the past three years the authorities have pursued policies of
monetary and fiscal restraint and have succeeded in improving substantially
the maturity structure of the external public debt. In spite of this,
during the period 1970-72, the performance of the Philippine economy had
been somewhat disappointing, with real GNP increasing by about 5 percent
a year. Expansion of the economy has been hampered by a combination of
factors. First, a series of disruptions to agricultural output since 1970
that was capped by the severe f:loods in July 1972, has seriously retarded
the growth of food production, irL particular rice. Second, there was a
30 percent deterioration in the external terms of trade during 1971 and
1972. Because of this decline, real gross national income per capita
remained unchanged at about $20t) curing 1971 and 1972. Third, the
economy has experienced a periodl of rapid inflation with consumer prices
rising by more than 50 percent during the three years 1970-72 due to the
combined effects of devaluation, imported inflation and shortfalls in
domestic food production. These adverse trends have been especially
serious for t:he wage earning group. There has been a 20 percent fall in
real wages and a further rise in unemployment over the past three years.



4.        The floods in july 1972, which caused extensive damage, made the
economic situation in the Philippines more difficult. Public infrastructure,
in particular roads, flood control dikes, irrigation works and schools,
were damaged. Including production losses and damage to private property,
the total cost of the flood damage was estimated at about $200 million.
Because of t.ae extensive damage to the rice crop in 1972 and the recent
world-wide rice shortage, the Philippines was not able to import sufficient
rice for its needs.   This led to a rice shortage and rationing was
introduced. The rice import requirements for 1973/74 will depend on
the main cro- which is now being harvested, but the amount could exceed
600,000 tons.
5.        The administrative, fiscal and monetary reforms that the Marcos
administration has begun to implement under martial law could lead to
improved economic 'performance in the years ahead. There can be little
question tha: thie Philippines has the resources - both physical and human -
to achieve broadly based economic improvements, given the right policies
and adequate support for development within the country and from outside.
The main elements of the Government's development strategy include: (a) im-
provement of agriculture and rural living conditions; (b) faster industrial
and mineral development, including a large increase in manufactured exports;
(c) a national investment pragram that complements the sector development
programs by balancing the allocation of resources among agriculture, industry
and infrastructure; (d) financial management to encourage exports, limit
inflation and its aggravation of income maldistribution, and further improve
the maturity pattern of external debt; and (e) increased government revenues
and better public sector management.
6.        Capital formation in the Philippines is quite high, and the
problem will be to ensure that investment outlays are more effective in
future. This would involve better use of industrial capacity than was
achieved 'during the sixties. Sharply accelerated public development outlays
will also be needed if bottlenecks in production are to be avoided and if
the deterioriation in social services is to be reversed. Public investment
spending in real terms increased dramatically in FY 1973, expenditures for
flood rehabi'litation accounting for a large portion of the increase. The
next four-year development plan (FY 1974-77) calls for an infrastructure
program of almost 13 billion pesos, as compared with P 3.3 billion in
FY 1968-72 when low tax revenues were a major constraint on public invest-
ment. Outlays would thus rise from about 1.7 percent of GNP in FY 1968-72
to between 3 and 4 percent in Ff 1974-77.
7.        Substantial additionaL taxation will be needed to finance the
proposed pub:ic investment program.   The tax reforms introduced since
martial law have resulted in a substantial increase in revenue collections.
But if the Government is to undertake its ambitious development program
successfully, real revenues wou'ld have. to expand by about 8 percent a year
during 1974-77, which in turn means that the Government's fiscal effort
will have to be intensified fur:-her.
8.        If the sectoral growth indicated evolves as planned, incomes,
employment and the balance of payments should all improve. In the first



-3-
half of 1973 there have been some unexpectedly favorable developments in
the Philippine's export earnings which suggest that the balance of payments
both this year and next will be mnore comfortable than the economic report
suggests. For the period 1973-77 as a whole, merchandise exports are still
projected tc increase by about 50 percent. Provided rice imports can be
reduced after FY 1973/74, imports of raw materials, intermediate goods
and capital goods could be allowed to rise at a rate sufficient to provide for
a 6 to 8 percent growth in GNF.
9.        The economic report projects that the foreign capital inflow would
need to be almost $3 billion during 1973-77. Of this about $2 billion would
be provided by transfers, direct investment and private medium- and long-
term loans. The remaining $1 billion would have to come from official
development loans. During the period, total disbursements of project
assistance could amount to $550 million. The balance of about $450 million
would be needed in the form of quick disbursing commodity assistance. The
recent and unexpected improvement in export earnings, if sustained through
1974, however, would reduce this required level of commodity assistance
and allow it to be phased out faster than the report's estimate. This
matter was discussed at the meeting of the Philippine Consultative Group
in late May and it was agreed that the improvement in export earnings could
be used to increase reserves, reduce the debt burden to more tolerable
levels and support an appropriate level of imports for development purposes.
It was accepted that some official commodity aid would still be needed. The
members of the Conrsultative Group welcomed the economic and social reforms
which had been announced in recent months and were particularly encouraged
by the success of the program to raise Government revenues. In addition to
continuing their commodity aid, members also indicated rising levels of
commitments for development projects to support the Philippines' increased
development program.
10.       Provided that adequate levels of official aid for commodity imports
and project assistance are forthcoming, and particularly if the recent
improvement in export prices is maintained, management of the Philippines'
external debt and debt servicing, while difficult, would not present serious
problems. The debt service racio on public and private debt would improve
from about 23 percent in 1972 to about 18 percent by 1977. Even with the
expected official assistance program, total service payments would offset
the inflow of medium- and long-term loan capital during 1973-77. Thus
even with the proposed levels of foreign assistance there will be virtually
no net transfer of resources to the Philippines in the next five years.
however, a more tolerable debt service ratio combined with a better
international reserve position, gives the Philippines more room for maneuver.
11.       TiLe Philippines' development program will continue to require
resources i:A excess of the foreign capital which will become available
for financiig the import component of development projects. Part of these
resources wtill be provicd.e from commodity assistance. In addition some
financing of local currency expenditures will be justified especially for
projects of econom.ic and social importance which need only limited amounts
oi foreign axchange.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
12.       The Philippines has received 19 Bank loans and two IDA credits
totalling $308 million, net of cancellations. Half of the Bank Group's
lending, about $156 million, has been for infrastructure projects in
power, transportation, water supply and education. The remainder has
been divided about equally between agriculture and industry. About $85 mil-
lion of this has been for irrigarion, livestock, rice processing and rural
credit and about $65 million for industry in three loans to the Private
Development Corporation of the Philippines.   A first highways loan to
finance the construction of the 160 km Cotabato-Digos road in Mindanao
was made in 1971. Although work was suspended in March 1973 because of
disturbances in the Cotabato area, the contractor has resumed work from
the Digos end, which is outside the area affected by the fighting.
13.       Of total Bank/IDA lending for the Philippines of $308 million,
four loans and two credits totalling $69.9 million were made since the
beginning of 1972. Disbursements on four of these have just begun while
the fifth and sixth are not yet effective. Of the remaining $238 million
the undisbursed balance of October 31, 1973 was about $38 million, almost
all of which was accounted for by five loans made since the beginning
of 1969. Disbursements on two of these, both agricultural credit projects,
are behind schedule due in part to the general economic slowdown in the
Philippines following the February 1970 devaluation and the subsequent
stabilization program. however, disbursements on these loans began to
pick up last year. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of October 31, 1973, and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
14.       Future Bank/IDA lending will continue to concentrate on public
infrastructure and agriculture. The Bank will also continue to help
industry and provide more assistance for projects in the social sectors.
The Government is giving high priority to rural development and agrarian
reform. A recent Bank Agricultural Sector Study noted that expanding and
improving irrigation was essential to support agrarian reform and to permit
agricultural production and rural incomes to increase. The Upper Pampanga
project at present under way, will make a vital contribution In the heavily
tenanted areas of Central Luzon. Several additional irrigation projects
are being prepared, the first of which will probably be ready for approval
late in FY 1974. A rural development project is being prepared and should
be ready for appraisal next year. Further loans are also likely to be made
over the next two or three years for rural credit and livestock.
15.       Bank/IDA infrastructure lencing will continue to emphasize
transportation and power ',rojects. Further proiects for highways, ports,
power and first projects for shipping and urbanization are being prepared
for Bank financing.  Ir. the social sec_-ors an IDA credit was signed in
January 1973 for a seconc  education project and a population project is
being prepared.



-5-
16.       Bank Group lending to the Philippines could rise substantially
above present levels provided that the economy is managed reasonably well
and that the Philippines continues to improve its capacity to prepare and
implement projects. The Bank Group's present share in total debt outstanding
is about 8 percent, and its share in debt service is about 5.5 percent. If
present trends continue, as expected, the Bank Group's share in total debt
outstanding would rise to about 17 percent by 1978 while its share in debt
service would be about 10 percent.
17.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $66.0 mil-
lion for investments in nine companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of October 31, 1973, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $1.3 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $46.1 million. On the
same date $17.9 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
18.       In the past, ports and shipping played a dominant role in the
transport sector of the Philippines. They continue to provide an essential
means of transport and communication among the islands of the archipelago
and account for probably 40 percent of total freight traffic. In recent
years, however, an expanding highway network has provided access to the
interiors of the larger islands. Today road transport is dominant in the
main islands of Luzon and Mindanao and accounts for nearly 60 percent of
total freight traffic and over 80 percent of total passenger traffic. The
relatively short inland distances have limited railways to a small fraction
of total traffic.
19.       Lack of funds, weak statistical data, poor planning and organiza-
tion as well as natural obstacles have compounded the problems of providing
the necessary transport infrastructure. The present inadequacies reflect
the small proportion of national resources devoted to public investment in
the past. Although transport investment absorbed one half of total public
investment during the past decade, it represented barely 1 percent of GNP.
The rate of investment in the sector has been insufficIent to meet the
traffic growth of close to 10 percent a year. Further, the resources for
maintenance have been poorly administered, and as a result existing transport
facilities have deteriorated considerably.
20.       Tax reforms introduced over the last year have increased notably
the funds available for public infrastructure investment. The Government's
large transport investment program for FY 1974-77, reflects the urgent
need to make good the results of past neglect. It calls for expenditures
over the four years of about $790 million, including $220 million from
foreign sources, and represents about 43 percent of the total public



infrastructure program or 1.4 percent of GNP. Of total transport investment,
73 percent is for highways, 10 percent for ports, 10 percent for railways
and the remaining 7 percent for airports. Highway projects receiving foreign
financial assistance are expected to absorb about 60 percent of the foreign
exchange expenditures of the Government transport investment program. In
addition to this project, these include the Japanese financed Pan-Philippine
highway, the General Santos-Cotabato, the Iligan-Cagayan de Oro-Butuan and
the Tarlac-Sta. Rosa roads financed by the ADB and the Digos-Cotabato road
in Mindanao, financed by IBERD.
21.       The transport investment program is ambitious, and it may be
constrained by the Government's administrative capacity to execute it.
However, tne recent sweeping government reorganization which covered
agencies dealing with the transport sector should lead to improved per-
formance compared with the past. Under the government reorganization
responsibility for transport planning is shared between the National
Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and the Department of Public
Works, Transportation and Communications (DPWTC). Within the DPWTC, two
units are to be set up; a Board of Transportation which will set rates,
schedules and regulations and grant routes, and a Bureau of Transportation,
which will be the enforcement agency for all modes of transport except
railways. Railways will remain under the Office of the President.
22.       The total highway network consists of about 81 ,o0o km, of which
about 18 percent (15,000 km) is paved, 52 percent (42,000 km) gravelled
and 30 percent (24,000 km) unimproved roads. The road density is generally
sufficient but most of the national paved roads are at present deteriorating
owing to poor original design and construction, compounded by inadequate
maintenance over the years. Some are damaged to the point where major
repair or rehabilitation of pavements is needed. Inadequate maintenance
has been caused principally by insufficient maintenance funds and poor
utilization of road maintenance equipment.    Overloading of trucks is a
common practice and makes the roads deteriorate faster. The condition
of the extensive network of gravel and earth roads (nati-onal, provincial
and urban) is poor and only a small proportion of them are all-weather
roads. In Luzon, the country's most densely populated area, the situation
is seriously aggravated by recurring typhoons and floods. Especially
damaging was the flood disaster in 1972. Although emergency repairs made
roads passable again they still need to be brought up to proper standards.
23.       The motor vehicle fleet grew from about 200,000 units in 1962 to
about 500,000 units at the end of ,972, an average annual rate of growth of
9.6 percent, although the growth rate fell to about 4 percent between
1970-72 as a result of Government exchange and credit restrictions and the
devaluation of the peso.   Fuel consumption has growm at an average annual
rate of 8.8 percent a year over the same period, although falling to
3.4 percent between 1970 and 1972.   Eighty percent of all motor vehicles
were registered in Luzon   (of which half were in the Greater Manila area),
10 percent were in Mindanao and the remainder distributed over the other
islands. Registration generally reflects traffic densities. There are
about 78 inhabitants per vehicle throughout the country. This compares



with 50 in Thailand and 206 in Korea. The growth of demand for road
transport in recent years is difficult to estimate because of the lack of
data, but the slowdown in the rate of growth of both the motor vehicle fleet
and fuel consumption suggests that there has been a fall in the growth of
demand for road transport compared with the 1962-70 period. It is expected
tc increase again as the economy continues to recover from recent setbacks.
24.       The responsibility for administering, constructing and maintaining
national hig:hways is vested in the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH), which is
a part of DPWTC.  For highway construction and maintenance the country is
divided into 11 regions, each headed by a regional director. These are again
sub-divided into districts or cities, 133 in all, each headed by a district
or city engineer. The mechanical services division of the BPH is responsible
for maintenance and repair of equipment. It has its own regional organization
and rents equipment to the regions and divisions. Both the highway and
equipment maintenance divisions of BPH need to be further strengthened.
25.       The Highway Special Fund (HSF), to which 90 percent of all road
user revenues go, has been used in the past to finance improvement and
construction of national roads, maintenance of all types of roads, and
administrative expenses. During the period FY 1962-71 revenues from
road users increased by only 9 percent a year and since FY 1966 have
covered only between 50 and 70 percent of annual expenditures.    The balance
was met from general revenues. Beginning in FY 1974, the HSF will be used
to finance only maintenance and minor improvements, while all construction
will be financed from the general budget. The revenue of the HSF has been
inadequate since FY 1966 because road user charges in the Philippines, In
particular the gasoline tax, have been among the lowest in the world. However,
the Government has recently increased all fuel oil taxes by substantial amounts
and the taxes on gasolines, by about 75 percent. This should ensure a more
adequate level of funds for maintenance and minor improvements, although a
further increase may be needed in the future.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The proposed project is one of a number identified in the 1970
UNDP financed Philippine Transport Survey for which the Bank was executing
agency. It is the third of a series of transport projects proposed for Bank
financing and which include futire ports and highways projects and an inter-
island shipping project. The project was prepared with the help of con-
sultants financed by the JNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency. A Bank
mission appraised the project in June 1973 and negotiations were held in
Novembe: 1973.  The leader of the Government's negotiating team was
Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez. The Appraisal Report (No. 258-PH) on the
proposed project is being circula.ed separately to the Executive Directors.
Annex III provides a loan and pro4ect summary.



-8-
Description of the Project
27.       The proposed project would provide for the construction, improve-
ment and rehabilitation of about 1,400 km of roads in the island of Luzon,
thus assisting its economic development by reducing inland transport costs.
The project consists of (i) construction of a 51 km expressway and 6 km of
access roads from Burol to Angeles, north of Manila, (ii) reconstruction and
improvement of nine national roads in Central Luzon, totalling about 640 km
and (iii) rehabilitation of about 700 km of flood damaged minor roads leading
to the nine national roads, and (iv) the provision and installation of
weighbridges to enable the Government to enforce its axle load control laws
more effectively. It includes consulting services for construction super-
vision of all the above roads, feasibility studies and detailed engineering
of 137 km of national roads included above and to be financed retroactively,
detailed engineering for roads which may be included in future highway projects,
continuation of the ongoing technical assistance program and assessment of the
training requirements of the Bureau of Public Highways' (BPH) administrative
and technical staff at various levels. It also includes the services of an
expert to set up a project office to strengthen the capacity of the BPH to
prepare and administer externally assisted highway projects. It includes
consulting services for reconnaissance and feasibility studies of an addi-
tional 1,800 km of national and contiguous minor roads, which the UNDP would
finance.
Project Execution
28.       The Bureau of Public 'Jighways (BPH), in the Department of Public
Works, Transportation and Communications (DPWTC), would execute the project.
Supervision of construction would be carried out by consultants working
with counterparts, except for two roads which would be supervised by the
BPH with the assistance of foreign technical personnel.   The establishment
of a project office, the continued technical assistance program and the
reorganization of the BPH would give it the capacity to execute this
project. The staff training component of the project and the future
improvement of statistical methods anu procedures for highway planning
should help to improve the preparation of future projects. All road con-
struction would be carried out by contractors.
Cost of the Project
29.       The estimated total cost of the project is $128.2 million with a
foreign exchange component of $65.9 million (51 percent of total project
costs). The proposed Bank loan would finance $65.0 million of the foreign
exchange costs plust $3 million of local costs for the flood damaged minor
roads.  The UNDP would finance 30.9 million, and the Government the balance
of $59.3 million. The estimates include a 10 percent al'lowance on all items
for physical contingencies and an allowance for price increases in domestic
and foreign prices for construc_ion of the expressway and nine national roads,
estimated on the basis of an annual increase of 12 percent. The project is
scheduled for completion by .nid-1977.

Procurement
30.       Civil works contracts for the expressway and the nine national
roads, together with the contracts for the weighbridges would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding. The road construction
and improvement works would be divided into 14 contracts. Some are suffi-
ciently small to enable local contractors to bid on them. Contractors
may also bid on a combination of works. The minor roads to be rehabilitated
do not lend themselves to international competitive bidding because the
works are scattered and small. These roads were proposed for inclusilon in the
project as a result of the 1972 floods and constitute less than 6 percent
of the total project cost. Contracts would be negotiated with contractors
carrying out major project roadworks nearby, with a view to obtaining the
lowest possible price.   If contracts cannot be negotiated at reasonable
rates, they will be put to local competitive bidding.
Disbursement
31.       For construction of the expressway and improvement of the national
roads, disbursement would be made on the basis of 55 percent of the total
cost, the estimated foreign exchange component. For the minor roads, dis-
bursement would be on the basis of 70 percent of the estimated cost of
rehabilitation up to a total of $5.5 million. Disbursement would be made
against actual foreign expenditures for consultants' services and against the
c.i.f. cost of the weighbridges.
32.       Retroactive financing is recommended for about $650,000 equivalent
for feasiblity studies and detailed engineering carried out in 1973 on
137 km of national roads, which were added to the project after the severe



- 10 -
flood damage in 1972; it would also include the operation of the Project
Office in the BPH from September 1, 1973 and other small items.
Economic Justification
33.       The project would assist the Government of the Philippines to
improve and mnodernize the road transport system of the island of Luzon
and would fu-ther economic growth in the areas to be served by the roads
included in the project. The project would reduce the present high road
transport costs by lowering vehicle operating costs and by saving passengers'
travelling time. It would provide year-round and flood-free access from
agricultural areas to the Greater Manila area, much the largest and most
important market in the Philippines, and it would relieve congested roads
in the urban areas surrounding Manila.
34.       The construction of the Burol-Angeles expressway extension would
greatly reduce traffic congestion on the parallel Tabang-Angeles section
of the Manila north road. The latter now carries an average traffic volume
in excess of 9,000 vpd north of Tabang and this is expected to rise to
15,000 vpd in 1976. It would also open a fast reliable access route for
through traffic to the urban market of Manila for agricultural produce, with
some of the transport cost savings being passed on to urban constumers and
farmers. The economic return for the expressway extension is estimated at
18 percent assuming an equal division of traffic between the expressway
and the Manila north road. Tolls would be charged and progress will be
watched so that if it appears that the tolls are diverting traffic, adjustments
in their level will be made.
35.       The nine national roads to be reconstructed or improved under
the project constitute the most heavily travelled part of the road network
on the island of Luzon. They all converge on the Greater Manila area,
with the exception of two, which run east-west and serve Central Luzon.
Their improvement would benefit densely populated areas which are essentially
dependent on agriculture and also serve the Laguna de Bay area which has
important industrial development potenuial.   Road transport costs per km
would be reduced by amounts varying from 5 percent to 30 percent for cars
and jeepneys and from 8 percent to 32 percent for trucks and buses depend-
ing on the degree to which each road would be improved. In addition, the
improved roads would provide faster, flood-free access to markets, and
reduce accidents. The estimatec economic returns on these roads range
between 19 percent and 29 percent, including passenger time savings, and
between 12 and 18 percent without.
36.       The project includes the rehabilitation of about 700 km of minor
roads which were severely damaged :by the 1972 floods.   The roads would be
chosen from 1,100 ons identif-ec bny consultants which were ranked by taking
into account contiguity w-t-A the national roads included in the project,
traffic levels and population density. The rural population which suffered
heavily from the 1972 floods would benefit directly from the expected
transport cost savings, improved access to markets and fewer accidents.
Neither the benefits of repairing these roads nor the cost of rehabilitating

them could be assessed with accuracy slnce no traffic counts have been carried
out in the past and the present lack of traffic is often due to the very poor
conditions of the roads. Although not quantified, the benefits from repairing
these roads would be considerable.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. The draft agreement conforms to
the normal pattern for loans for highway projects.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   Projects in Execution -
Ln No. 491-1'  Fourth Power; US$12.0 million Loan of April 5, 1967
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
This project was to assist the National Power Corporation (NPC)
in financing the construction of a 75-MW thermal plant on the Bataan
Peninsula and a 50-MW addition to the Maria Christina Hydroelectric Plant
in Mindanao. The Maria Christina addition was completed in 1970. The
Bataan thermal unit was commissioned in Decenber 1972, about two years
behind schedule. The delay was due initially to slow government approval
of contract awards and subsequently to financial difficulties of the civil
works contractor and mechanical failures. The undisbursed balance of
$0.6 million of the Bank loan represents the retention requirements for
equipment supplied under the project. The Closing Date has been further
postponed by 18 months to December 31, 1973.
Ln No. 607-PH Second Rural Credit; US$12.5 million Loan of June 4, 1969
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The slow progress of the project at the beginning was mainly due
to the steep rise in the prices of farm machinery after the peso was
allowed to float in February 1970. TEhe subsequent increases in prices of
farm produce together with decentralization of loan approvals, strengthening
of staff and promotional efforts have helped improve the pace of disburse-
ment.  This has particularly quickened over the last five months.   The
Closing Date, originally March 31, 1973 has been postponed to June 30, 1974
when present projections indicate that the loan will be fully disbursed.
Ln No. 630-PH  Development Finance Company; US$24.2 million Loan of July
10, 1969 - Closing Date:  September 30, 1973
The loan to the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
(PDCP) has been fully committed for sub-projects and as of October 23, 1973,
US$0.5 million of the Loan remained undisbursed and was cancelled. The
Closing Date had been postponed tc. September 30, 1973, by which date the
loan was fully disbursed agains. commitments for sub-projects.
I/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
tne progress of projects iLi execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being e-.ccuntered, and the action being taken to
remedy t:hem.  They sh.ould oe read in this sense, and with the understanding
tnat they do not purpor: to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln '.Vo. 637-PF  Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969
Closina Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation proJect in the Philippines and
will supply water year-round to nearly 77,000 hectares. The project's
au-farn davelopment scheme is setting a pattern for future irrigation
Jeve olnmenc in the counzry.  So-me delays were caused by the 1972 floods but
.onos-ruction is now progress-Lng satisfactorily. All work is expected to
be comrleted arLd the loan fully disbursed by June 30, 1976, the original
oouletion date.   Project costs have increased 34 percent over appraisal
fS:.,mates Largely due to infL ation, devaluation of the peso and design
&rLanges i[ the dam.  However  as a result of close coordination established
se ween irrigation and agricultural supporting services, the project is
exDected to reach full developmen-t in 7 years after completion of con-
St-^-accion instead of 13 years as; appraised. The project remains economically
viable.
Ln No. 720-PiH Rice Processirng and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971 - Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project was designed to provide long-term credit to the
Dprivate sector through the Development bank of the Philippines for the
establishment of modern integ,rated rice processing and storage facilities.
T1he project encountered difficulties from the beginning owing to the lack of
demLand for sub-lcans. The major reasons for the disappointin.g sub-loan
demand were set out in the Prasident's mnemorandum to the Executive Directors
dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40) which proposed amendments to the loar, agreement
to shift the emphasis on lending to rehabilitation of existing facilitties
and to streamline the procurement procedures.    in spite of the subsequent
amendments of the ioan agreemcnt, the project has so far made very l_ttle
progress so taat by the end of October 1973 only 7JS$0.3 million was disbursed
andL t'.sL was entirely for the consultant services.  The Government has now
proposed furtfter amendments to tne loan agreement to expanid the scope of the
project.  These amendr.e.ts, designed to facilitate speedy and full implement-
ation without com?romising the objeccives of the project, are being considered.
Lui N.o. 731-PH Highway; US$8.u million Loan of April 14, 1971

Ln No. 809-PH and   Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million
Cr No. 296-PB       Loan and Credit of April 3, 1972
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected. Although a further tariff
increase was imposed in January 1973, a proposed surcharge to cover
increased fuel costs was not approved by the Government. As a result NPC
is still not achieving the convenanted financial rate of return, but no
remedial action is proposed since the fuel surcharge should be implemented
in the latter part of FY 1974.
Ln No. 823-Ph       Livestock;  US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the
Philippines. The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 349-PH      Second Education; US$12.7 million; Credit of January 5. 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project will assist Government to improve such areas as
education planning, management and curriculum development, science teacher
training, and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and farmers.
Although no disbursements have been made the project is progressing on
schedule.
Ln No. 891-PH       Fisheries; US$11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the
private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine
and inland fisheries development. The loan was to become effective by
September 25, 1973. All conditions for effectiveness have been met except
the appointment by the Development Bank of the Philippines of a marine
specialist and a naval architect. DBP is making bilateral arrangements
for these appointments but a delay of at least a few months appears unavoid-
able.  The Bank has agreed to postpone the final date of effectiveness to
December 31, 1973. The demand for loans appears adequate and the organiza-
tion to implement them has been properly established.
Ln No. 939-P.'JI    Second Ports; US$6.1 million Loan of October 24, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of
the ports of General Santos and Cagayar. de Oro in the island of Mindanao.
The loan is to become effective by December 31, 1974 and no delay is
anticipated.
