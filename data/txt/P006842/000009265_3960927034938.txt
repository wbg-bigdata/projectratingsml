MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANE FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
04 A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A SECOND SUBSECTOR PROJECT FOR PRIMARY EDUCATION
1.       The following memorandum and recommenlation on a proposed loan of
US$100.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Colombia is submitted for
approval.  The proposed loan would be repayable over a period of 17 years,
including 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and
would help finance a second subsector project for primary education.
2.       Background.  Over the past two decades, Colombia has experienced
significant economic growth and recent performance has been strong, with a 5S
increase in 1987. Social progress, aided by a decline in the population growth
rate from 3.7? during 1964-78 to less than 1.8? during 1978-85, has also been
steady. Nonetheless, the distribution of the benefits of growth remains highly
skewed, and severe poverty continues to affect a quarter of the population. The
Government recognizes that sustained growth with equity depends in significant
degree on actions to raise the productivity and income-earning potential of the
poor. Among supporting measures, the expansion and upgrading of education
services, through appropriate policies of management and finance, is, in all
likelihood, the most cost-effective.
3.       Colombia's education system has grown impressively since the early
1960s. Enrollments in primary education (grades 1-5) doubled and the
participation rate reached 902 (including over-aged children), divided about
equally between males and females. Enrollments in secondary education (lower
secondary, grades 6-8; upper secondary, grades 9-11) increased by a factor of
six and incorporate nearly 502 of the age-group; and enrollments in higher
education (universities and a few institutions offering programs at the
subprofessional level) increased some fifteen-fold and cover about 102 of the
age-group. The private sector contributed to this growth and accounts for 15S
of primary, 40? of secondary and 60? of higher education enrollments.
4.       Despite these quantitative gains, education in Colombia remains, by and
large, of low quality; suffers from uneven development; and continues to face
major obstacles. Though no nationwide achievement tests exist at the primary
and secondary levels, results on secondary and university admissions
examinations indicate that children are acquiring, on average, less than 40? of
expected knowledge; primary participation rates as low as 602 are reported in
some rural areas and only 20Z of rural (compared with 602 of urban) students
complete the cycle; secondary education is still largely available only in urban
areas. More positively, a revised rural primary curriculum, the Escuela Nueva,
used in about half of rural schools by 1987, has proved effective in raising
both student achievement and completion rates. Across the system, however,
policies for resource use and management continue to conflict with objectives
for improving quality and coverage of education. The personnel-related share
(99?) in recurrent expenditures for primary and secondary education, and the
central government share in total public expenditures (97?) at these levels are
excessive; the costs per graduate are high owing mainly to frequent repetition
(30? per year in the prima_-y cycle) and dropout (15? per year in the first four
primary grades); mobilization of resources, both public and private, is



-2-
inadequate to meet requirements; and the share of public resources available for
basic education (primary and lower secondary) has suffered a modest decline over
the past decade. Despite recent improvements in planning, weaknesses in
budgeting, financial management, and program implementation reinforce
inefficiencies in resource use.
5.       A major objective of the Government that assumed power in 1986 is to
raise the standard of living of the poor by, among other measures, improving and
expanding access to basic social services, including education. Decentra-
lization of responsibility for education, accompanied by administrative and
financial strengthening of the municipalities, are important corollary
priorities. The plan for educational development gives top priority to
strengthening and expanding basic edrication. Corresponding adjustments in
financing policies -- to improve the composition and use of recurrent resources,
to increase the share of local financing in educational expenditures, and to
raise investment levels -- are also proposed.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project forms an integral
part of the Bank's overall country strategy, which assigns priority to poverty
alleviation investments and to improved efficiency in key sectors. The project
not only supports increased investments in the education sector, but also
addresses sector-specific issues of financing and management, including
expenditure composition, central-local cost sharing and development of key
sector institutions for planning, administration and evaluation. Bank
involvement has been instrumental in the elaboration of key sector policies and
tasks (many of which were jointly defined and documented in a recent sector
review, Report No. 6587-CO of April 1987). The Bank has previously extended
three loans for development of upper secondary education in Colombia. The
proposed project is based on a fourth, and more recent loan (2192-CO), which
expanded the Escuela Nueva program in primary education in rural areas. Lessons
of implementation experience, which highlight needs to clarify project
implementation responsibilities and simplify processes, to improve financial
management and control and to strengthen support for central as well as
decentralized implementation, are incorporated in the proposed project.
7.       Proiect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project, which
focuses mainly on rural areas, are to improve resource management and
mobilization for primary education, and to raise educational quality at this
level while further expanding access to school-aged children. These objectives
form the focus of a six-year investment program (1989-94) planned by the
Government for the subsector. Specific policy targats for primary education aim
to: increase (to 32) the share of recurrent expenditures for non-personnel
items; reduce costs per graduate (by nearly 302); and increase local cost-
sharing for primary education (from about 3? to 10? of school investments).
In addition, the project would increase from about 20S to 35? the share of
public education investment for the primary level during 1988-94, and direct 75?
of investment for primary education to disadvantaged rural areas.
8.       ProJect Description.  The subsector project incorporates the planned
investment program for primary education and consists of three main components.
The policy component (23? of total costs) centers on measures to achieve
improvements in resource use and mobilization. These include: (a) transfering
about 5,000 vacant and excess urban teachers' posts to deficit (mainly rural),
areas and providing incentives (housing loans and health insurance) to retain
teachers in remote areas; (b) raising the share of non-personnel inputs in
recurrent expenditures; (c) introducing a flexible student promotion policy to
reduce repetition, dropouts and costs per graduate; (d) introducing a cost-
sharing scheme for facilities upgrading to raise municipal and departmental



-3-
contributions for investment to the targetted level, based mainly on additional
revenues from a value added tax to be allocated to the municipalities; and (e)
undertaking studies on the future financing of higher education, with emphasis
on cost-recovery. The management development component (22 of costs) would
finance consultant services and staff training to (a) complete an improved
management information system and to strengthen planning and policy monitoring
for education; (b) develop budgeting and financial management skills within the
Ministry of Education (MEN) system; and (c) develop central technical support
capacity and decentralized implementation capabilities, including municipal
capacity for management of civil works to correspond with recen%. laws. The
primary education development component (75? of costs) would provide financing
for (a) provision of learning materials and school libraries for about 4,000
rural schools, and in-service training for about 20,000 rural teachers to
introduce, or complete the introduction of, the Escuela Nueva program; and
replacement of educational materials at about 25,000 rural schools; (b) basic
school furniture for about 13,000 rural schools and upgrading of facilities for
about 4,300 rural schools to support the new curriculum and improve access; (c)
about 3.3 million textbooks, training for about 6,500 teachers, materials for
about 30,000 classrooms, and furniture for about 2,100 schools to support an
improved primary curriculum in marginal urban areas; and (d) a system to assess
student achievement in .iimary education and a pilot project and study related
to the future expansion and development of secondary education.
9.       The MEN would be responsible for overall management of the project;
experienced semi-autonomous entities (primarily the Banco Central Hipotecario)
would generally be responsible for administering the civil works component;
works would be carried out under contract by corstruction firms or individuals.
The professional staff of existing project coordinating units at the center,
including the National Executive Secretariat and the Development Fund of the MEN
(FONDO/MEN), has been increased from about 13 to 30 to strengthen procurement,
financial and implementation support capabilities. With these additions, and a
new system for accounts introduced in September 1988, the MEN would have
adequate capacity to manage the project. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$169.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$23
million (142). To facilitate project start-up, the project incorporates
retroactive financing for eligible school investments incurred after June 1,
1988 and not exceeding US$5 million in value. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A, and amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Colombia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7265-CO, dated November 2, 1988, are also attached.
10. Actions Agreed: Annual reviews of progress would be conducted jointly by
the Bank and the Government by September 30 each year. These reviews would aim
to ensure appropriate investment levels for primary education overall and by
department in light of available resources and implementation advances; they
would include assessment of progress towards meeting the project's policy and
institutional objectives as reflected in a letter on subsector policy and a
related action plan, dated October 7, 1988, and signed by the Minister of
Education. Based on these annual reviews, a detailed investment program for
Bank approval would tnen be prepared by November 30 each year. Investment
criteria and limits, guidelines and procedures for project implementation, as
well as draft terms of reference for project studies, were reviewed by the Bank
and incorporated in a project operating manual. The planning and project
management components of the MEN's management information system would be
introduced by December 31, 1989; the system for evaluating student achievement



- 4 -
in primary education would be put in place by December 31, 1991, and results
would be used to strengthen primary education; and directors with qualifications
and experience satisfactory to the Bank would be maintained in the National
Executive Secretariat and the FONDOIMEN throughout project implementation. As
conditions for disbursement, the Government would provide evidence of completed
project contracts between the HEN and participating departments in the case of
provision of materials, furniture and teacher training, and among the HEN, the
departments, and the municipalities in the case of provision of civil works.
11.      Proiect Benefits.   The project would raise the overall ecolomic and
social prospects of Colombian youth by substantially improving the quality of
primary education, particularly in rural areas where the completion rates for
students should rise from 2O2 to 60S. The project's focus on improved use and
mobilization of resources for primary education would not only contribute to
long-term gains in efficiency and quality in the sector, but should also help to
ensure the availability of adequate public resources for the videspread
extension of basic education beyond the primary cycle. In addition, the planned
improvements in sector management would help build decentralized plamning and
implementation capacity, including municipal capacity to manage educational
investments.
12.      Project Risks. 'While the project counands a high level of coumitment,
it faces a risk of implementation delays owing to the magnitude of planned
investment and the addition of municipal participation in civil works. To
reduce this risk. the build-up of implementation activities would be gradual,
with investments peaking during the middle of implementation (years three
through five) at about twice the current level. The central project management
team and implementation responsibilities and processes have already been
substantially strengthened, and management contracts with experienced semi-
autonomous entities would be used to support the execution of civil works.
There is a related risk that the cost-sharing ; krget established for the
municipalities and the departments may prove difficult to achieve due to
variations in financing capacity. To minimize this risk, targetted
contributions have been conservatively e',timated, amounting to less than 102 of
munir'-al revenues from the value-added tax, and would be continuously
monitored.
13.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
