F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objectives are: (i) accelerating the use of modern energy in rural and peri-
urban areas in order to increase productivity of small and medium enterprises, to enhance the
quality and efficiency of health and education centers, and to improve living standards; (ii)
promoting further community-based woodland management to reduce un-sustainable pressure
on forest resources while simultaneously encouraging interfuel substitution and energy
efficiency initiatives; and, (iii) strengthening energy sector reform processes and related
institutions to create a favorable investment environment for increased private sector
participation in decentralized energy services delivery in rural and peri-urban areas.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Context

1.       At the time of project preparation, Mali with its 11.3 million inhabitants was one of the
poorest countries in the world due to its limited resource base, land-locked status, vulnerability to
external shocks, poor infrastructure, low levels of human development and weak administrative
capacity. Over the previous decade and despite these constraints, Mali had made commendable
progress on the economic, political and social fronts. Annual real growth rates for 1994-2002 averaged
about 5 percent. The private sector was increasingly playing a much larger role in the economy, and
civil society and stakeholders were strengthening partnerships with Government of Mali (GoM) and
having a more active role in development activities.

2.       In parallel with this progress, Mali achieved a remarkable political transformation with an
increasingly strong democratic process, taking root throughout the 1990s, culminating in the peaceful
transfer of power between two democratically elected leaders in 2002. While governance, capacity and
institutions still needed strengthening, the overall framework for a more effective, transparent and
decentralized administration seemed to be gradually taking shape.

Sector Context

3.       In the early 2000´s when the project was prepared, the limited reach of the electric grid was a
major constraint for business expansion in Mali. Tariffs were also below the economic cost of supply.
Moreover, the state-owned power utility, Energie du Mali (EDM), was poorly managed and lacked
investment funds to ensure adequate quality and reliability of service to consumers as well as extend
access to a growing number of households in need of electricity. The GoM undertook important
reforms to improve the efficiency and management of the grid-based electricity sector with the
privatization of EDM and the privately managed Manantali Dam. Under the closed IDA-financed
Selingue Rehabilitation Project, the Government set up a new legal and regulatory framework,
establishing an independent regulatory authority, Commission de Regulation d'Eau et d'Electricité
(CREE), in March 2000, prior to transferring EDM's assets to a private concessionaire selected
through competitive bidding.

4.       Energy in Rural Areas. In Mali, barely 1 percent of the rural population had access to
electricity at the time of appraisal in 2003. Most rural households met their lighting and small energy
needs with kerosene, dry cell and car batteries. The government planned to create national institutions
with responsibility for scaling up successful programs (such as the private decentralized services
companies (DSCs), multi-functional platforms, and household energy initiatives). The Government
was also aware that any rural energy program had to address severe technical and economic
constraints, which were a direct consequence of the intrinsic characteristics of rural areas and
hampered the profitability prospects of such programs. These constraints were the high investment
costs and wide dispersion of loads, which discouraged power network expansion, the low capacity-to-
pay, and irregular income of rural populations.

5.       Moreover, reform processes and institutions that provided energy for rural populations still
needed to be strengthened in order to foster a competitive business environment that was attractive to
private investors and operators. To accelerate energy access in rural areas in a sustainable manner, it

                                                   1
was thus critical to develop a good combination of an institutional (legal and regulatory) framework
and tools (technical, economic and financial) - in order to address the above-listed constraints as well
as to attract private investors/operators. The GoM had already taken steps towards this goal and had
decided to create: (i) a rural energy services agency, l´Agence Malienne pour le Développement de
I´Energie Domestique et de l´Electrification Rurale (AMADER); and (ii) a financial instrument, a
rural energy fund, Fonds d' Electrification Rurale (REF).

6.      Wood Energy. Traditional biomass energy in the form of fuelwood, charcoal, and dung
represented about 90 percent of the final energy consumption in Mali. The use of charcoal for cooking
was widespread in rural as well as urban areas and growing rapidly, unhampered by urbanization. The
use of firewood and charcoal by households had substantial detrimental effects on health and on the
environment affecting mostly women and children. Increasing use of wood for energy also constituted
a serious threat to the environment, especially in fragile ecosystems such as those found in Mali.
Pressure on forest resources was exacerbated due to the growing reliance of urban populations on
charcoal for cooking. Community-based forest management initiatives and the introduction of efficient
charcoal kilns and improved wood and charcoal stoves which increase fuel efficiency by at least 30
percent and 25 percent respectively were deemed necessary since they provided health and
environmental benefits in the short to medium term, as well as social and economic benefits.
Moreover, by improving income levels in communities such initiatives were likely to prepare the
ground for the affordability of modern energy services.

Rationale for Bank Assistance:

7.       At the time of appraisal, the World Bank Group’s work in Mali was focused on the following
strategic axes in line with the PRSP adopted in May 2002 and reconfirmed in October 2002 by the new
Government, including: (i) accelerated and re-distributive growth to continue macroeconomic and
structural reforms to facilitate diversification of production and exports; (ii) institutional development
while improving governance and participation in a context of decentralization; (iii) human resources
development and improvement of access to quality basic services; and (iv) development of basic
infrastructure services. The objectives of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (FY04-06) in Mali
were aligned to support the PRSP pillars. The CAS intended to help the Government improve
economic competitiveness and to carry out key legal, regulatory and institutional reforms to create an
enabling environment for an increased private sector participation in productive economic sectors.

8.       The Bank was in a unique position to assist the government as it had been a major partner in
the energy sector with support for the Selingue Rehabilitation Project and the Household Energy
Project (HEP). Its continued support was considered crucial in revitalizing the rural electrification
efforts, which were showing obvious signs of stagnation as donor funding was depleted. The Bank’s
involvement not only would bring its international experience and knowledge in supporting rural
energy and household energy programs in over 30 developing countries but it would also help leverage
new commitments from the international donor community.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

9.       As stated in the Credit Agreement, “The objective of the Project is to support the Borrower’s
efforts in increasing access to modern energy services for its population through: (a) increasing energy
supply to small and medium enterprises and health and education centers in rural and peri-urban areas;
(b) promoting community based woodland management; and (c) strengthening of energy sector reform
processes towards increased private sector participation in decentralized energy services delivery."
This PDO is a simplified version of the PDO included in the project appraisal document “ (i)
accelerating the use of modern energy in rural and peri-urban areas in order to increase productivity of

                                                    2
small and medium enterprises, to enhance the quality and efficiency of health and education centers,
and to improve living standards; (ii) promoting further community-based woodland management to
reduce un-sustainable pressure on forest resources while simultaneously encouraging interfuel
substitution and energy efficiency initiatives; and, (iii) strengthening energy sector reform processes
and related institutions to create a favorable investment environment for increased private sector
participation in decentralized energy services delivery in rural and peri-urban areas.? This evaluation
is based on the simplified PDO reflected in the Credit Agreement.

10.     Key outcome indicators were: (i) increased employment in rural areas facilitated through the
provision of decentralized delivery services to small productive enterprises; (ii) increased hours spent
in education and productive activities due to improved access to energy; and (iii) increased rural
awareness of energy, health, and environment-related issues. These key outcomes defined in the
original PAD were not monitored through the results framework. However, the impact assessment
study carried out in 2009/2010 gives evidence of the sizeable beneficial impact of electricity provision
on income-generating activities and employment creation.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

11.      The Global Environment Objective (GEO) was to initiate a program aimed at removing the
barriers to adoption of renewable energy technologies (RETs) under GEF Operational Program 6 in
order to reduce gross calculated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily those of carbon dioxide
(CO2).

12.     The key output indicator for the GEO was the number of Solar Photovoltaic Systems Installed.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

13.      The PDO, as stated in the legal agreement, remained unchanged and relevant throughout
project implementation. In the preparation of the Additional Financing in September 2008 it was
agreed that the original outcome indicators in the Project’s results framework for the Capacity
Development and Institutional Strengthening Component were not sufficiently result-oriented and
precisely formulated. Emphasis was then placed on the quality of Capacity Development and
Institutional Strengthening rather than the quantity of training outputs and equipment.

14.      Most of the indicators of Energy Services Delivery Component showed that they were on track
to reach their targets when the Additional Financing was being prepared; however, they were revised
to reflect the expected results from the Additional Financing. Regarding the Household Energy
Component some indicators of the original project revealed overly ambitious and unrealistic target
values in view of the complexity of the activities and the number of stakeholders involved – such as
numerous community stakeholders as well as central and regional government directorates. Therefore,
the targets of this component were revised to be more realistic.

15.     With the approval of the Trust Funded Additional Financing in 2011 some of the outcome
indicators related to components 1 and 2 were revised to include the new targets to be funded with the
new financing and the new energy core indicators were introduced.

16.     See Annex 2 for a description of the changes and results achieved in the Results Framework.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

17.     The GEO and key indicator remained unchanged throughout project implementation.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

18.      As stated in the PAD, the project was expected to have direct and indirect benefits associated
with different project interventions that would have a positive impact on poverty reduction targets as
well as links to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

19.      Direct benefits. These included access to, and an improved quality of, energy services that
would directly increase the ability to generate income, and enhance the well-being and sense of
empowerment of the poor; enhancing labor productivity; improving illumination; reducing health
risks; improving access to information and markets; and empowerment of village communities by
transferring control of local wood fuel resources to them, thereby helping them become independent
players in the market while ensuring environmental sustainability of the forest resources.

20.      Indirect Benefits. These included improvements in the availability and quality of energy
services to small enterprises and communities which could indirectly benefit the poor by creating jobs
and easing pressures on destructive natural resource exploitation, particularly depletion of natural
forests for wood fuel.

21.     Empowerment of Women: Women are major actors in fuelwood production, transformation
and trade. Interventions in these areas were likely to change their working habits by providing them
with more time to devote to other productive and educational activities. Household energy
interventions focused on improved cook stoves would also provide direct benefits to women and
children given their traditional roles in cooking and woodfuel collection. Women’s associations are
also playing an important role in remote communities as providers of energy services.

22.      Communes: By recognizing their key role in energy services delivery processes and woodfuel
management, the project was expected to contribute significantly to the empowerment of communes,
in their relationship with government bodies as well as with their local constituents.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

23.      The project had three main components - which were financed by IDA with US$35.65 million,
GEF with US$3.5 million, the GoM with US$5.25 million and the private sector with US$8.95
million:

24.      Component 1: Capacity Development and Institutional Strengthening (US$ 11.64
million). Component 1 included four sub-components aimed at (A) supporting the capacity
development of the Regulatory Commission staff (CREE) to enable them to carry out their
responsibilities of contract oversight, monitoring and compliance more effectively; (B) supporting
institutional strengthening of the National Directorate of Energy (DNE) to monitor implementation
progress of energy sector strategy and reform; (C) supporting institutional strengthening of the
National Directorate of Nature Conservation (DNCN) to play an active role in the management of the
household energy sector; and (D) supporting the capacity development of the Rural Energy Agency

                                                  4
(AMADER) to become an operational institution.

25.     At appraisal, the CREE, the DNE, and the DNCN were poorly equipped and lacked the critical
expertise needed to carry out their functions. AMADER, as a newly created institutional, needed
support to become operational and efficient.

26.   Component 2: Energy Services Delivery (US$ 28.24). This component had 3 sub-
components:

27.      A. Promotion of Rural Electrification Investments (US$24.64 million). This sub-component
included: (i) establishment of Rural Electrification Fund (REF) - to be used to promote rural
electrification investments undertaken by private operators; as well as related studies to prepare and
evaluate bids; (ii) study to assess the need for the special financing instruments to help mobilize the
required financing from commercial banks; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation studies of individual
investments.

28.      B. Promotion of Multi-functional Platforms (US$1.55 million). This sub-component financed
(i) a study to assess the sustainability of existing multifunctional platforms; and (ii) provided micro-
financing to support the equipment start-up costs of multifunctional platforms to be operated by
community associations, women's associations, NGOs, and the private sector.

29.      C. Information, Education, and Communication (US$2.05 million). This sub-component was
aimed at helping communities to be aware of energy services schemes by providing support to
extensive information and promotional campaigns through existing media in rural areas; field trips to
neighboring villages where services are installed and working; organization of focus groups to have
feedback from users and to register concerns from prospective users; and organization of workshops
for private operators, NGOs, and other civil society.

30.      Component 3: Household Energy (US$13.47 million). The household energy component
was built on achievements of the previous Household Energy Project (HEP) and supported the scaling-
up of initiatives of the national strategy on household energy. It had three main subcomponents:

31.     A. Community-based Woodland Management (US$8.31). The subcomponent, which was
developed in coordination with the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation, supported the
development of standard contracts for use by communities and local governments for management and
exploitation of wood resources.

32.      B. Interfuel Substitution and Energy Efficiency (US$2.89). The promotion of efficient wood
energy and alternative products was a continuation and extension of the HEP project demand-side
component. Its main thrust was the promotion of efficient charcoal stoves and substitution by
kerosene, LPG and alternative biomass fuels and the penetration of low-energy consumption lamps
and energy efficient evaporative air-coolers to reduce the peak power demand curve and to reduce the
electricity bill for end-users.

33.      C. Information, Education, and Communication (US$2.27). This sub-component financed (i)
extensive information and promotional campaigns through existing media in rural areas (radio,
institutional, grassroots) in order to raise interest and formal requests from rural communities in
support of the community-based woodland management, interfuel substitution and household energy
efficiency activities; and (ii) woodfuel sector training, planning and monitoring.



                                                   5
1.8 Revised Components

34.     The components remained the same throughout project implementation.

1.9 Other significant changes

35.      The HEURA project, in the amount of SDR 25.20 million (US$35.65 million equivalent) with
a GEF Trust Fund of US$3.50 million was approved on November 4, 2003. The Credit became
effective on October 13, 2004. The project benefited from an additional IDA credit in the amount of
SDR21.60 million (US$35.00 million equivalent) which became effective on January 5, 2009 and a
Trust Funded Additional Financing in an amount of US$8.50 million approved by the Country
Director in August, 2011.

36.     These additional financings did not change the development objectives and implementation
modalities of the HEURA but were intended to facilitate the scaling-up of activities aimed at achieving
a greater impact on the ground.
37.     Additional Financing: With the additional financing which was signed on October 3, 2008
and became effective on January 6, 2009, the following additional activities were financed under the
three components:

38.    Component 1: Capacity Development and Institutional Strengthening (US$2.4 million).
This component included additional capacity building and institutional strengthening support to
CREE, DNE, DNCN, and AMADER to better perform their responsibilities and mandates.

39.     Component 2: Energy Services Delivery (US$30.3 million). The Energy Services Delivery
Component financed the scale up of rural electrification projects. The successful experience of the
spontaneous bottom up projects proposed by local private sector operators during the implementation
of the HEURA demonstrated the potential of a large-scale energy access project in Mali.

40.      Sub-component A: Scale up of Rural Electrification Projects. The original project attracted an
impressive number of local private sector operators through small-scale projects. Therefore, through
the Additional Financing, the energy services delivery investments were scaled up through the
extension of existing bottom up projects, the development of new bottom up projects, and the
development of one top down project. The original project envisaged support to larger rural
electrification schemes. The concerned areas had already been identified through a planned “top-
down? approach. It was anticipated that the larger size of the areas could attract international operators
and as such develop five to seven large schemes, including the extension of two pre-existing rural
electrification concessions. It turned out that the development of these top-down projects was difficult
and very slow. In addition, they required the participation of foreign private sector investors to engage
in ventures in rural areas of Mali. The extension of the two existing larger decentralized concessions
was eventually implemented through a separate financing from KfW.

41.      Sub-component B: Scale up of Multi-Functional Platforms Investments. The original project
demonstrated that the multifunctional platforms were helping communities have access to basic pre-
electrification and helping to develop productive uses of energy. The additional financing aimed at
scaling-up the number of multi-functional platforms in remote communities. A particular emphasis
was placed on partnerships with the local banking system to develop micro-financing schemes to
support the women’s associations managing these platforms.



                                                    6
42.     Sub-component C: Information, Education, and Communication (IEC). Implementation
experience with IEC through the original project indicated that a deepening of the initiatives, their
relevance to local communities, and demonstration workshops were important. The Additional
financing supported tailor-made IEC initiatives mostly in remote communities to support energy
services delivery initiatives.

43.      Component 3: Household Energy (US$2.3 million). The rate of physical progress of the
woodland management initiatives of the original project was slow as many actors both local and
central were involved and considerable amount of time was needed to build and maintain participatory
consensus on activities. Moreover, sustainability of these initiatives was linked to the enforcement of
forestry legislation. A strategic choice was made to consolidate initiatives of the original project and to
scale up only those that have proven satisfactory in their implementation.

44.      Sub-component A: Community-based Woodland Management. This sub-component financed:
(i) the consolidation of woodland management plans; (ii) small woodfuels management activities by
local communities and private operators; and (iii) a forestry information system. This sub-component
also financed specific activities initiated in partnership with the DNCN to strengthen the legal and
regulatory framework sustaining the woodfuel sector.

45.     Sub-component B: Interfuel Substitution and Household Energy Efficiency. This sub-
component financed: (i) the scale up of improved stoves dissemination; (ii) the scale up of low
consumption lamps; and (iii) an information system on energy efficiency. A review of the
implementation of the original project indicated that initiatives on kerosene stoves, LPG, wood
briquettes, and evaporative air-coolers did not get an adequate response from users. The additional
financing funded studies to further understand barriers to the adoption of these devices.

46.      Sub-component C: Information, Education, and Communication. This sub-component
financed promotional campaigns to support the consolidation of woodland energy management
initiatives, interfuel substitution and energy efficiency initiatives.

47.     Trust Funded Additional Financing: Financing for the Trust Funded Additional Financing
were provided from the following two trust funds: (i) US$2.00 million from the AFREA TF (Africa
Renewable Energy Access Trust Fund) from the Kingdom of the Netherlands contribution to the
ESMAP Clean Energy Investment Framework Multi Donor Trust Fund, and (ii) US$6.50 million from
the recipient executed window of the ESME TF (Trust Fund to support Energy Small and Medium
Size Enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa) donated by the Government of Russia. These funds were
accompanied by two parallel co-financings in the amount of US$0.9 million 1 . The Trust Funded
Additional Financing was aimed at strengthening Component 1 (US$1.60 million) and Component 2
(US$6.90 million) of the original project. No new trust funded activities were planned under
Component 3.

48.    Results Framework. As mentioned in section 1.4 above, at the time of the preparation of the
Additional Financing in 2009, the original outcome indicators in some of the project components were
modified to better capture the expected results and be more realistic or were revised to reflect the


1
  This included a parallel co-financing in the amount of US$0.5 million provided from the ESME TF through a
recipient executed grant to Global Village Energy Partnership International (GVEP-I) for technical assistance. A
second parallel co-financing in the amount of US$0.4 million was provided from the AFREA TF in the context
of the ESMAP Gender & Energy Development Strategies Program.


                                                       7
expected results from the Additional Financing. With the Trust Funded Additional Financing in 2011,
some indicators were revised to reflect the expected outcomes from the additional financing and to
include the new energy core indicators. See Annex 2 for a summary of the changes undertaken in the
Results Framework.

49.    Other changes. The legal agreement for the Additional Financing amended the legal
agreement for the original Credit in the following manner:

    •   It extended the closing date of the original Credit from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2012
        resulting in a cumulative project lifetime of about 8 years from Board approval in November
        4, 2003;
    •   The percentage of expenditures financed under the table in Part A of Schedule 1 of the
        Original Financing Agreement was increased to a 100 percent for categories (1), (2), and (4) of
        said table; and
    •   It reallocated the original Credit disbursement categories to reflect the financing requirements
        of the project. The GoM requested this reallocation to mainly allow adequate financing to the
        Energy Services Delivery Component consistent with its performance and to keep momentum
        generated among local private operators.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

50.    There was no Quality at Entry assessment undertaken by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group
(QAG).

51.     Project preparation: Project preparation was done in close coordination with the Malian
Directorate of Energy, which included staff from the previous Household Energy Project. Key
background analysis consisted of a stocktaking of rural electrification and household energy access
experiences in the country. This stocktaking provided inputs to two main documents: (i) a National
Rural Electrification Framework; and (ii) a National Household Energy Framework. These documents
were formally adopted by the Government in 2003.

52.      A key issue identified in the sector by the project preparation team was the lack of
coordination of many actors involved in rural electrification and household energy in the country. The
project through Component 1 included joint training and coordination between the key players in rural
electrification (i.e. AMADER, CREE, DNE, and DNCN). It was acknowledged that strong
institutional arrangements and funding mechanisms were necessary to support the countries energy
access expansion agenda. The Bank was expected to assist the Government with knowledge in
addition to financing.

53.     Project Design. Based on experience and available information at the time of appraisal,
HEURA can be considered as appropriately designed. The Project Development Objectives,
components, and organization were in general realistic and responded to the needs identified in
previous projects and background analysis, however, for certain sub-components under components 2
and 3, the expected outcomes over-estimated the demand of the stakeholders for some type of
technologies as well as the number of hectares under sustainable woodland management and the
number of new operational wood energy markets. There were also some deficiencies in the design of
the M&E Framework especially lack of clarity (value and definition) on some of the targets to be
measured.

                                                   8
54.      Component 1 successfully identified and supported capacity building activities for key sector
institutions, especially the newly created AMADER and promoted the coordination among those
institutions.

55.      Component 2 promoted an innovative approach to rural electrification based on two main
elements: i) attracting the private sector to invest in and manage different schemes within the
framework of public-private partnerships; and ii) adopting a 'concession' approach for priority rural
electrification schemes but with the flexibility to support smaller initiatives, within the concession
area, proposed by cooperatives, consumer groups, village organizations or local operators. The
commercial and socioeconomic viability of the new approach to rural electrification had been
demonstrated convincingly by two different schemes that were operating successfully in different
regional areas of the country. This component also financed the promotion of multi-functional
platforms that were supported by the local communities under an ongoing UNIDO, IFAD and UNDP
initiative.

56.    Component 3 was designed to scale-up and strengthen activities initiated by the previous
Household Energy Project (HEP) that closed in 2000, in the areas of woodland management and
demand side management. It´s design was based on a thorough analysis of the main issues associated
with household energy in the country and the operational conditions and sustainability of community-
based woodland management.

57.     The project relied on one implementing agency – AMADER – for the overall implementation
of the three components with fiduciary and safeguards responsibility. The team took a cautious
approach to implementation expecting a slow implementation progress during the first year of project
implementation, which proved realistic since AMADER was a newly created institution that required
time and resources to become operational. In that context, emphasis was also placed both on selecting
experienced operators and reaching agreement on sound contractual frameworks for components 2 and
3. The project design met Bank fiduciary, social and environmental safeguard policies, including
public disclosure of all required documents.

58.    Project preparation benefited from the experience gained in the previous projects supported by
the Bank in Mali and made efforts to identify and incorporate key lessons learned, as follows:
    • Regulation: To sustainably bring decentralized energy initiatives in rural areas into effect and
       to create an enabling climate for private sector and local government involvement, the project
       supported the drafting of key legislation and operational policies through various project sub-
       components. Within the new regulatory framework, AMADER was mandated to promote
       electrification in “un-served areas? (i.e. areas outside EDM-SA’s concession areas).
    • Sound Contractual Framework: The project design envisaged a slow initial buildup of new
       operators of decentralized energy services, not only to ensure qualified operators but also to
       ensure that new contracts were satisfactory to all parties and reflected the early operating
       experience of ongoing schemes.
    • Strong Community Ownership, Participation, and Entrepreneurial Contribution:
       Participatory approaches were strongly encouraged in project implementation, especially
       under Components 2 and 3 which in the end resulted in some implementation delays on the
       community based woodland management sub-component under Component 3.
    • Adequate Capacity at Central and Decentralized Levels: The capacity building component of
       the HEURA project addressed existing capacity weaknesses at centralized and decentralized
       levels and organized extensive training activities for private sector operators, NGOs, and staff
       of the concerned ministries and agencies.

                                                  9
    •   Reduce Barriers for the Promotion of renewable energy technologies (RETS): The project
        built on the prior project experience of other donors and developed a coherent and strong
        program of knowledge and financing support for the promotion of these technologies (e.g. the
        subsidies provided by AMADER to bring down up-front costs, support training and awareness
        activities to reduce knowledge barriers, etc.), which for some technologies was very successful
        and for others did not reach the expected outcomes.
    •   Profitability of schemes: From a sustainability perspective, it was important to ensure
        sufficient operating profitability of rural electrification schemes, which justified the choice to
        set them up on a commercially viable basis. At initial stages, capital subsidies were required,
        but recurrent operating cost subsidies would have undermined sustainability. Based on the
        current situation (post-closing), this objective seems to have been achieved and the most of the
        rural electrification concessions supported by the project are operating without operating
        subsidies. However, given that the concessions remain relatively recent, there is still
        uncertainty regarding longer term sustainability, especially at the time were replacement of
        generation equipment will become necessary.

59.    The Government´s commitment to promoting rural electrification, sustainable wood energy
management and energy conservation at the time of project preparation was evident by the conception
and implementation of the legislative and regulatory framework for rural electrification and energy
conservation in the Government’s policy letter of November 1999 and embodied in the new legislative
framework for electricity of 2000. In addition, a decision was taken to allow private generation and
open the possibility of private participation in the national power utility EDM-SA. The new policy
framework also promoted rural electrification, in association with private enterprises and local
governments. Regarding wood energy, the GoM had already changed significantly the woodfuel law
(1996) & decree (1998) governing woodfuel taxation, in order to incorporate concepts such as rural
markets, village wood lots management, and differential taxation depending on the mode of
management and efficiency of commercialization.

60.      Stakeholder involvement and/or participatory processes in project preparation: The process
of validation and adoption of the National Rural Electrification Framework and the National
Household Energy Framework during project preparation involved many stakeholders such as NGOs,
private sector operators, community associations, and consumer associations.

61.     Assessment of risks. The project risk was rated as Substantial at appraisal. Several risk factors
were assessed and mitigation measures considered as follows:
    • Difficult municipal empowerment for rural energy services contracting. Risk was rated as
        modest. This risk did not materialize. AMADER proceeded systematically with an
        involvement of local administrative institutions and ensured that operators worked closely
        with municipalities.
    • Resistance to delegation of tax system to rural communities and privatization of flow control.
        The risk was rated substantial. This risk materialized even though the mitigation measures
        were implemented throughout project implementation. There were delays in the adoption of
        the tax regulation. Most importantly, the enforcement of the regulations was difficult, as the
        forestry department did not always have the necessary equipment and staff to play its role.
    • AMADER not autonomous or not self-financing or not sufficiently efficient. Rated as
        substantial during appraisal. In spite of some minor issues expected from a newly created
        institution, AMADER performed well throughout project implementation and this risk did not
        materialize. Results on the ground earned AMADER its autonomy in executing its assigned
        mandate. However, financial autonomy remains an issue.
    • Financial Sustainability of AMADER. Risk was rated substantial. Delays in mobilization of

                                                   10
        Government counterpart funds at times slowed down project implementation. Despite the
        delays, counterpart funds financed AMADER’s staff costs and part of its operational costs
        throughout project implementation. At the time of approval of the Additional Financing of
        2008, the legal agreement for the original credit was amended to reflect the 100 percent
        financing under the Country Financing Parameters in order to minimize the counterpart risk.
    •   Financial Management of AMADER. Risk was rated as modest. Financial management ratings
        were consistently rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory and recommendations on the
        financial management were followed and implemented by AMADER.
    •   Insufficient private sector interest in decentralized energy schemes. Rated as substantial
        during appraisal. The interest of the local private sector in decentralized rural schemes was
        greater than expected. On the other side, the interest of the international private sector in larger
        scale energy schemes was lower than anticipated.
    •   Difficulty for household and institutional market for solar PV to develop significantly due to
        weak financial markets and small market size for the development of solar PV initiatives.
        These risks were rated as modest but turned out to be significant and resulted in the
        cancellation of a portion of the GEF grant that was financing the solar PV activity - operated
        under a fee-for-service model. Private operators were not as interested as expected in adopting
        solar technologies. Also, consumers wanted multiple uses of energy services that were
        difficult to provide with solar home systems which usually only offer basic electricity services
        adequate for lighting, mobile phone charging, radio and limited TV viewing.
    •   Problems in energy distribution operation and maintenance, political interferences. Rated as
        modest. This risk did not materialize during the implementation of the original project.
        However, during the implementation of the IDA Additional Financing, the growing number of
        rural energy schemes managed by local operators under different tariff regimes, usually much
        higher than regulated tariffs for grid connected customers, created strong political demand for
        (i) electrification of more localities, and (ii) tariff harmonization which would render rural
        concessions immediately non-viable financially. In total, about 10 mini-grids located close to
        the grid around Bamako were connected to the network and incorporated into EDM-SA
        perimeter in 2011/2012.
    •   Insufficient involvement of stakeholders in rural energy schemes. Rated Modest during
        appraisal. This risk did not materialize.
    •   Kerosene, LPG stoves or new biomass fuels not accepted. Risk was rated as modest. This risk
        partially materialized, even though the mitigation measures were implemented. On one side,
        the LPG stoves and low-consumption lamps were a huge success. Interest in kerosene, wood
        briquettes, and evaporative coolers was much lower than expected.

62.     In addition to the risks identified above, the Project Appraisal Document also identified two
constraining elements in the sector context, which had to be taken account during project
implementation, but which the Project was not designed to address or even significantly mitigate:
    • Tariffs. The strategic choice of the GoM to promote rural electrification through local private
        operators, who benefit from investment subsidies, but have to cover their operating costs with
        revenue collected from consumers, has resulted in a very large differential in electricity prices,
        between, on the one hand, areas supplied by private local operators, and on the other hand,
        rural, peri-urban, and urban areas supplied by the utility EDM-SA under regulated national
        uniforms tariffs. The application of differentiated prices is critical to maintain the financial
        viability of electricity provision in rural areas. Micro grids will remain for a long time the only
        viable solution to provide electricity services in most of the Malian territory. For the micro-
        grids, electricity prices will likely remain significantly higher than the regulated grid tariffs
        applied by EDM-SA, even if the regulated tariffs are readjusted to cost-recovering levels. In
        order to achieve a sustained expansion of isolated micro-grids, capital investments subsidies

                                                    11
        are needed. However, putting in place operating subsidies to harmonize prices with the areas
        covered by the national utility would likely prove financially unsustainable and require
        complex and unproven cross-subsidization mechanisms.
    •   Enforcement of tax collection for woodfuels. Woodfuel exploitation, production and trade
        remain largely informal rendering sustainable management and tax-collection difficult. Some
        steps have been taken towards improved structuring and increased professionalization of the
        sector which have contributed to better tax collection enforcement. Examples are the creation
        of associations for the transport of wood and charcoal, and, on the production side, the
        establishment of managing structures in rural areas.

2.2 Implementation

63.      Implementation of the project was consistently rated satisfactory in project ISRs throughout
the eight years of project implementation (except for December 2005 and June 2012). The two
additional financings provided additional resources mainly for the two components (1 and 2) that were
performing well allowing the project to build on the good performance of those components and to
expand on the benefits that they were providing (i.e. additional connections for a larger number of
households). An armed rebellion in Northern Mali in January 2012 increased political instability and
led to the March 2012 Military Coup. The coup triggered Bank policy OP and BP 7.30 (“dealing with
de facto government?). A Management decision was made on May 16, 2012 instructing task managers
to close administratively all operations due to end by June 30, 2012. This situation affected
AMADER´s ability to execute its work program during the first semester of 2012. This was reflected
in the last project ISR which downgraded overall implementation progress from satisfactory to
moderately satisfactory. Similarly the progress towards the achievement of the development objective
was downgraded to moderately satisfactory.

64.     As of December 31, 2012 100 percent of the Original Credit, 72 percent of the GEF Grant, 80
percent of the Additional Financing, and 68 percent of the Trust Funded Additional Financing were
disbursed. While OP 7.30 remained in application for the Mali portfolio, teams were allowed
resumption of disbursement for ongoing projects with specific procedures to address potential
fiduciary risks in September 2012. In the case of the HEURA Project, the August 2012 fiduciary
review of the Mali portfolio recommended to carry out on the ground physical verifications before
processing outstanding requests for payment. To allow for the verification and the processing of
payments, Bank management - in application of OP/BP 12.00 paragraph 9 – approved a two-month
extension of the four-month period after the Closing Date during which eligible applications for
withdrawal could be processed. In that context, outstanding payments for activities undertaken before
the Military Coup were made by the extended end of the grace period on December 31, 2012.

65.     Overall Implementation. The project succeeded in strengthening technical and managerial
capacities at AMADER and in the main sector institutions (DNE, CREE and DNCN) supported by
Component 1. Under the original project and the IDA Additional Financing, DNE, CREE, DNCN, and
AMADER have completed more than 648.2 staff weeks of training (target was 600).

66.     The Energy Services Delivery Component (Component 2) was the driving force of the project
both in terms of outcomes and budget (approximately 67.5% of all project funds). It has succeeded in
developing an adaptive and multi-layered approach to rural energy - combining bottom up spontaneous
small concessions with top down planned large concessions. With the bottom up approach, 83 sub-
projects proposed by local private operators are functional. Local private operators have provided an
average matching co-financing of 25 percent of the financed schemes. As of June 30, 2012, a
cumulative number of about 74,787 connections had been made, exceeding the target of 68,896
connections. A cumulative number of 1,295 public and community institutions and centers have

                                                 12
access to electricity including 218 schools and 168 health centers, achieving 71% of the targeted 1,809
public and community institutions and centers. Also, a significant proportion of the connections (above
10%) supply electricity to revenue-generating activities (broadly defined and including informal
economic activities). This customer category was not identified and reported separately in the original
project. However, the 2009-2010 impact survey revealed the weight of these economic activities in
rural electricity consumption.

67.     Women’s associations also played an important role in remote communities as providers of
energy services. They manage multifunctional platforms 2 electrification initiatives after receiving
training in basic accounting in local languages provided by NGOs financed through the project.
Multifunctional platforms have been installed in 81 communities just shy of the target of 86
communities 3.

68.      Implementation of key activities under the Household Energy Component (Component 3)
occurred at a slower pace. The rate of physical progress of the woodland management initiatives was
slow compared to that of rural electrification initiatives. However, towards the end of the project, an
encouraging trend associated with the household energy component was seen with an increased
collection of forest revenues due to better law enforcement by both forestry officials and local
communities. Through the Wood Fuels Supply Master Plan, about 1.14 million hectares of the planned
1.40 million were placed under sustainable management and 282 rural wood markets of the planned
300 markets were created as of June 30, 2012. The experience with rural wood markets under the
project indicated that emphasis should be placed on ensuring their efficiency and sustainability rather
than increasing their numbers.

69.      Highly satisfactory implementation was made in the dissemination of improved stoves, low
consumption lamps and evaporative coolers. At project closing, 1.29 million (approximately 18%
higher than the target of 1.09 million) improved stoves had been disseminated. Similarly, 1.30 million
efficient light bulbs (CFLs) were disseminated (approximately 186% more than the an initial target of
454,000 4 ). Also, 2,847 evaporative coolers (target was 2,000) have been disseminated. However,
adoption of LPG stoves, briquettes, and kerosene stoves followed a lower than anticipated curve, due
to affordability and convenience reasons (e.g. only a limited number of manufacturers included the
new stoves in their array of products, storage and distribution networks were not as elaborated as
needed and households were not as interested in certain technologies as expected, etc.).

70.     GEO Implementation. The Grant for the Global Environmental Facility became effective in
May 2004 and closed in June 2009, as originally planned. The original grant amount was US$3.5
million but at closing, a portion of the grant was cancelled (US$0.98 million). Total disbursement of
GEF funds was US$2.52 million.

71.     With the installation of 8,141 solar photovoltaic systems, only 69% of the original end target
was achieved. The decision to do not extend the GEF Grant was due to the fact that at that time private
operators were not interested in adopting as much as expected solar technologies and beneficiaries also
wanted multiple uses of energy services that were difficult to be provide with solar home systems. The
team made a strategic decision to concentrate efforts in facilitating the implementation of other project

  A multifunctional platform is composed of a small 10 kW diesel engine coupled to a generator. The platform
can be connected to income generating equipment, such as cereal grinding mills, battery charger, dehuskers, and
water pumps, or generates electricity that can be distributed through a micro-grid to households.

  According to AMADER, no such target was set.

  According to AMADER, the target was 200,000.

                                                      13
activities that had more stakeholder demand and thus, were more likely to materialize.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

72.      The original M&E framework could have been better designed in terms of selecting
appropriate indicators and targets. Not all of the indicators had effective collection methods, available
baselines, or were relevant to monitor progress to achievement of PDOs. In particular, the key
outcome indicators defined in the original PAD (increased employment in rural areas thanks to
connection of small productive enterprises; increased hours spent in education and productive
activities…) could not be monitored during project evaluation. However, this does not imply that the
expected benefits did not materialize. On the contrary, the impact assessment study carried out in
2009/2010 points to sizable beneficial impact of electricity provision on income-generating activities
and employment creation.

73.      As mentioned in section 1.4 above, at the time of the preparation of the Additional Financing,
the original outcome indicators in some of the project components were modified to facilitate more
effective monitoring. Also, the value of targets was revised to reflect actual progress with project
implementation as well as the incremental benefits expected from the Additional Financing. Despite
the changes introduced to the M&E framework, some indicators (i.e. methodology to report on
individual vs. household connections; methodology to provide a summarized indicator of institutions
connected (incl. schools, health centers, other public institutions) still lacked clarity. It should be noted
that indicators and expected targets were not always consistent between the Bank and AMADER
reports.

74.      The M&E was useful for following the progress on the implementation of the different
components and served two main purposes: (i) to target successful activities that would receive
additional funding through the two additional financings, and (ii) to identify under achieving activities
and to take actions that would encourage the progress on the implementation of those activities (as was
the case in Component 3 that had a slow initial progress but improved overtime).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

75.     Safeguards. The original project and the associated additional financings were classified as a
Category B (Partial assessment) project. That is, the potential environmental and social impacts of
envisioned activities, for the most part, were projected to be minimal, site-specific and manageable to
an accepted level. The safeguard policies applicable to these operations were OP/BP 4.01, OP/BP 4.36,
and OP/BP 4.12, defined as Environmental Assessment, Forests and Involuntary Resettlement. An
Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) were prepared and disclosed on May 2, 2003 before the appraisal of the original project. During
the preparation of the IDA Additional Financing, ESMF and RPF were updated, reviewed and
approved by World Bank safeguard specialists in 2008. Both frameworks, the project’s ESMF and
RPF, were re-disclosed in-country and in the Info Shop on April 2009. Before the Trust Funded
Additional Financing for Mali HEURA was approved, as the original project remained a Category B
operation.

76.     The purpose of the ESMF was: (i) to establish the mechanism to determine and assess future
potential environmental and social impacts of sub-projects that were to be identified; and (ii) to set out
mitigation, monitoring and institutional measures to be taken during implementation and operation of
the sub-projects to eliminate adverse environmental and social impacts, offset them, or reduce them to
acceptable levels.

                                                     14
77.     The RPF was prepared to establish the resettlement and compensation principles,
organizational arrangements and design criteria to be applied when compensating people who may
be affected by the project. The scaling up of the activities under the additional financing did not
trigger any new social safeguards policy.

78.     AMADER, through their Environmental and Social Safeguard Unit, was the main entity
responsible for carrying the environmental and social function of this operation. The main
responsibility of AMADER’s Environmental and Social Unit was to ensure that environmental and
social measures were adequately taken into consideration in the processing of business plans proposed
by ESCOs and other local initiatives for rural energy services delivery activities. In addition, the
Direction Nationale des Eaux et Forêts (DNEF) and the Direction Nationale de Contrôle des
Pollutions et des Nuisances (DNACPN) ensured effectiveness of the implementation of proposed
safeguards measures and compliance with national and Bank safeguard policies. Safeguards
compliance is rated moderately satisfactory.

79.     Fiduciary. Financial management and procurement aspects of the project were continuously
rated Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory and the related FM risk was rated moderate throughout
project implementation. Overall, financial management covered adequately the project’s accounting
and reporting arrangements, internal control procedures, planning and budgeting, counterpart funding,
funds flow arrangement, external audit reporting arrangements, and project accounting staff issues.

80.     Staffing remained adequate and proper books of accounts and supporting documents were
kept in respect of all expenditures. Most of the audits were submitted on time, and were
unqualified. The interim un-audited financial reports were also submitted on time and the quality
of those reports improved throughout project implementation.

81.     It is worth noting that in its last semester of implementation, as a result of the political and
security context in Mali, the project faced significant problems restricting its ability to process
disbursements. In application of its rules regarding dealings with de facto government, the Bank
momentarily froze disbursements on the projects in Mali after the Military Coup of which occurred in
March 2012. The freeze on disbursement remained in place until the project closing date on June 30,
2012.

82.     This issue was eventually addressed after Project closing. Following a Bank management
decision to resume disbursement on the Mali portfolio with strengthened fiduciary diligence,
outstanding disbursement requests were all processed in December 2012. The disbursement rate of the
project detailed hereafter is 90 % and the project’s 2012 budget was executed at a satisfactory rate of
88 %.

83.     All project components were implemented following the Bank’s applicable procurement
guidelines for works, goods and services. The procurement unit of AMADER was staffed with a
Procurement Specialist who followed the Bank's procedures since 2002, for the procurement
operations of the HEURA project. Planning problems in the Energy Services Delivery Component
occurred during the last year of project implementation that affected the starting of some contracts.
This posed a risk especially in the case of sub-projects, which included a financial contribution of the
operator that promoted the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

84.       Mainly due to the political situation in the country, there is an important level of uncertainty
on the institutional and financial sustainability of AMADER, which depends significantly on donor
support. It will need to work with the Government to create the necessary conditions and mechanisms
for its sustainability.

85.     Regarding the sustainability of the energy services delivery sub-projects, weak managerial
expertise on the part of certain operators and low return on investment mainly due to the high cost of
diesel could reduce the momentum among local private operators in those schemes. In this respect,
specific capacity reinforcement could help them improve on their business plans preparation and
implementation. Another way to strengthen rural operators would be to encourage the emergence of
larger more professional operators, through a combination of larger individual concessions and
multiple concessions per operators. With regard to the high cost of diesel-based generation, a
promising solution is to diversify the generation mix through the introduction of renewables (see next
paragraph). In addition, the GoM would need to develop a viable electricity tariff mechanism in rural,
peri-urban, and urban areas, to ensure cost recovery and profitability while taking into account
affordability issues.

86.      Follow-up operation. The Climate Investment Funds committee approved in principle in its
November 2011 session the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low Income Countries (SREP)
program for Mali (with comments). The SREP Investment Plan was fully approved in March 2012.
The main objective of SREP-Mali is to develop renewable energies with transformative impacts, to
effectively contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development in Mali – together with
stakeholders and the private sector. Next steps entail the preparation of three project components of
which two are led by the AfDB (Solar Photovoltaic IPP, Micro/Mini Hydroelectricity Development)
and one by the World Bank (Rural Electrification Hybrid Systems). The overall SREP funding
amounts to US$40 million - of which US$15.5 million of SREP funding are designated to the Bank’s
component. Within the restructuring of the Energy Support Project (PASE), US$20-30 million of IDA
could be reallocated to a new rural energy project, to go to the Board in FY14-Q2 which will be
combined with the SREP allocation. This would contribute to a scaling up and increased financial
viability of existing hybrid mini-grid schemes in isolated off-grid areas in Mali. The aim is to increase
renewable energy capacity – mainly solar PV and possibly biofuel – in the existing off-grid rural
concessions and to make existing diesel power isolated grids hybrid through a standardized approach,
so as to gradually increase the penetration of renewable energy in the rural generation mix. This could
be complemented by testing small-scale SHS and modern PV lighting products as well as a well-
designed maintenance and monitoring schedule. The activities will be based on AMADER’s past and
on-going rural electrification program and the lessons learned from the Household Energy and
Universal Access (HEURA) project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

87.      The project is assessed as highly relevant to the development priorities of the Government of
Mali both at outset and at completion. It is considered that the project has made a significant difference
to the country´s poverty reduction strategy and the MDGs by facilitating the increase in the rate of
rural electrification from 1 to 2 percent during appraisal to an estimated 17 percent in 2012. Over the
same period, the number of electricity connections in urban areas more than doubled, increasing the
rate of access above 50% in urban areas. The estimated overall rate of access to electricity services is
above 30% which considering the challenges the country is facing (low density, landlocked location,
reliance on imported oil products, low GDP per capita), is significant.

88.      The project’s objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant to the GoM today.
The project is consistent with the strategic priorities set out in the latest Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS, Report No. 41746, December 12, 2007) for FY08-11 and the PRSP II. An Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) is currently being prepared. The project supported the long-term country development objective
set out in the first pillar of the CAS - “developing infrastructure and strengthening productive sectors?.
The project also fitted well within the CAS and PRSPII objectives by aiming to put in place policy,
institutional and financing frameworks to increase access of energy services in rural and peri-urban
areas with the participation of private entrepreneurs. Indeed, access to energy services was crucial in
the enhancement of quality of social sectors as well as the competitiveness of productive sectors.

89.     The continuing high relevance of the objectives throughout project implementation, as
demonstrated by the GoM’s request for two additional financings, also reflects positively on the
overall design of the project which remained unchanged in the eight years of project implementation.
The innovative approach for the promotion of rural electrification investments that was supported
under Component 2 was highly successful.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

90.      The achievement of the PDO is rated as Moderately Satisfactory considering that some of the
PDO indicators have been achieved or exceeded and significant progress was made on achieving the
targets for the remaining ones. The achievement of the GEO is Moderately Satisfactory considering
that the GEO indicator was only partially achieved, as explained below.

91.      The outcomes achieved with regard to the project’s objective of accelerating the use of
modern energy in rural and peri-urban areas in order to increase productivity of small and medium
enterprises, to enhance the quality and efficiency of health and education centers, and to improve
living standards is rated as moderately satisfactory considering that the target 69,603 new households
with access to modern energy services was exceeded reaching at project closing 74,787 households. At
closing, the project reached 1,295 institutions (including schools and health clinics) achieving 71% of
the revised target value after the two additional financings of 1,809 institutions with access to
electricity services. The number of communities with installed multifunctional platforms was 81 at
project closing which was very close to the end target of 88. Overall, AMADER’s multifunctional
platforms have performed satisfactorily. They were part of a broader national multifunctional
platforms program. AMADER expanded the platforms with a public lighting system of an average of 2
kilometers. The public lighting was developed around market places allowing business hours to be
extended to nighttime. The number of private operators providing energy services was 86 at project
closing, which was below the end target of 125. Based on the above, and considering the high positive

                                                   17
impact on rural and peri-urban electrification achieved through this component, the achievement of
this objective of the project is rated as moderately satisfactory.

92.      The second objective of promoting further community-based woodland management to reduce
un-sustainable pressure on forest resources while simultaneously encouraging interfuel substitution
and energy efficiency initiatives had mixed results. The targeted number of hectares under woodfuel
management program (1,400,000) was partially reached at project closing with 1,142,033 hectares
under sustainable management. The number of new wood energy markets operational with an end
target of 500 was not reached at project closing with 282 operational markets. The targeted number of
improved stoves purchased by households (a total of 1.29 million improved stoves had been
distributed, above the 1.09 million target) and low consumption lamps (1.30 million low consumption
lamps distributed exceeding the target of 454,000) purchased by households and institutions greatly
exceeded the end targets. The achievement of this objective is considered moderately satisfactory.

93.      The third objective of strengthening energy sector reform processes and related institutions to
create a favorable investment environment for increased private sector participation in decentralized
energy services delivery in rural and peri-urban areas was achieved through comprehensive capacity
building activities for key sector institutions, in particular for AMADER, responsible for drafting
and/or operationalizing key legislation (See Annex 2 for a detailed list of outputs reached under this
component). The achievement of this objective is considered satisfactory. The HEURA project has
supported the Government of Mali to establish AMADER as a national institution to design and
manage rural electrification and household energy programs. Two main supporting frameworks were
produced and adopted by the Government: (i) Cadre de Référence pour le Développement de
l’Electrification Rurale au Mali; (ii) Cadre de Référence Pour le Développement de l’Energie
Domestique au Mali. These documents discussed the role and responsibilities of main actors involved
with rural electrification and household energy. They discussed the vision and objectives of the
Government and particularly the importance of public-private partnerships in the development of these
sub-sectors. The significant participation of private sector operators to HEURA is an important result
of the sector reform process.

94.     The achievement of the GEOs is overall rated Moderately Satisfactory. The GEF grant was
closed in 2009 with US$0.98 million of undisbursed funds. The GEO indicator with an end target of
11,736 installed PV systems was partially achieved (8,748 PV systems installed).

3.3 Efficiency

95.      Efficiency is rated as “substantial?. An economic reevaluation of the project has been
performed using the original methodology but updating the assumptions regarding the valuation of the
costs and benefits. On this basis, the revised Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of the project is
17.2% (against 33.2% in the original analysis) and the Net present Value US$ 9.3 million against US$
29.0 million in the PAD (based on a 12% discount rate in both cases). The major factor behind the
reduction in EIRR is the increase in fuel prices which has substantially impacted the profitability of the
Energy services Delivery component (by far the largest). During project implementation, the cost of
diesel fuel more than doubled compared to what was assumed during project preparation,
mechanically increasing the operating costs of electricity provision in rural areas and reducing the net
benefits even though the activities were successfully implemented. The benefits from the smaller
Household Energy Component were also lower than expected, but in this case this is related to the
partial implementation of the activities, compared to the original targets. Overall, the project
economic justifications appear to remain solid in spite of the increase in oil prices. Going forward, the
high cost of diesel fuel should lead to consider the introduction of more solar generation for rural

                                                   18
electrification (probably in hybrid diesel / PV system to provide guaranteed generation). In addition, a
significant portion of project costs is related to capacity building and institutional development, which
for the most part should not be recurrent costs. Future operations would use existing institutions and
capacity and could be implemented with lower upfront costs for capacity building. (See Annex 3 for
the detailed Economic Analysis)

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDO/GEOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

Taking into consideration the high relevance of the project, the moderately satisfactory PDO
achievement, moderately satisfactory GEO achievement and substantial efficiency, the outcome is
rated satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

96.      Poverty impacts. The impressive growth in access to electricity from 2003 to 2012 appears to
have brought concrete benefits to the concerned populations. An impact assessment study was carried
out in 2009-2010 ("Enquête d’Impacts du Projet Energie Domestique et Accès aux Services de Base en
Milieu Rural sur les Conditions de Vie de Populations Bénéficiaires: Composante Fourniture des
Services Energétiques? Rapport final, February 2010) by consultants supervised by AMADER. The
objective of the study was to identify and measure the economic impacts of Component 2 on the
livelihoods of the targeted beneficiaries. The study covered 23 electrified localities in total (including 7
multifunctional platforms) from which a sample of 2000 connected beneficiaries responded.
Predictably, most of the beneficiaries were households (86%) but the proportion of income-generating
activities in the beneficiaries was significant (12%) and in fact higher than previously assumed.
Among the many findings of the impact assessment, the following can be highlighted:
    •     Rural electrification contributed to the creation or expansion of income generating activities
          in many areas (e.g. welding workshops, ice making shop, tailoring workshop, bakery and
          other food processing, internet café, rural telephony, charging stations…).
    •     Based on indications from respondents, rural electrification contributed to the creation of 735
          permanent and 1,689 temporary jobs. Rural electrification contributed to an increase in
          activity and daily working hours in the concerned businesses (4 hours on average per
          productive unit 5 ). The estimates are impressive given the size of the sample (2000
          connections) but should obviously be used with caution and from a methodological
          standpoint cannot be considered as net job creation (additional economic activity in newly
          electrified localities could in part substitute for activities elsewhere).
    •     Education: Electrification of villages resulted in an increased of the time devoted to
          homework especially in the evenings. In this context, all 33 interviewed headmasters
          indicated that attendance improved and that the average academic performance of pupils
          increased significantly. In addition, half of the respondents reported the use of IT equipment.




5
 Examples are internet café 9 additional working hours, Ice-making company 8 hours, public phone 4 hours,
bakery 5 hours, tailor 3 hours.


                                                     19
    •    Public lighting: Villagers are able to carry out whole range activities that were previously
         limited. Shops and markets can be open in the evening for business, social ceremonies and
         events can be extended to the nighttime. On factor appears to be the perception of improved
         public safety: more than 81% of respondents indicated that electrification had reduced the
         frequency of thefts (41% for physical aggressions) facilitating circulation in the evening.
    •    Health Services: In the health facilities surveyed, the number of prenatal visits increased by
         12% after electrification. Given the small sample size and absence of control group, this
         cannot be considered as definite conclusive evidence.

97.       Gender Aspects. Rural electrification benefits all residents but women in particular. The
reduction in the extensive time and effort spent gathering woodfuels spent mainly by women allow
them to devote more time to educational, productive and recreational activities and/or for doing other
household chores. Moreover, women’s associations played an important role in remote communities as
providers of energy services. They manage some multifunctional platforms electrification initiatives
after receiving training in basic accounting in local languages provided by NGOs financed through the
project. At project closing, multifunctional platforms have been installed in 81 communities. As part of
the additional financing, a gender assessment was carried out by the World Bank with support of
ESMAP and AFREA. This included a desk review of AMADER’s projects, field visits and
consultations with the private operators and communities involved in AMADER’s projects in 12
localities. 200 household surveys were collected to provide information on access to energy, household
activities, and perceptions on the access and control of energy services among women and men. This
information could then be used as proxy indicators to assess the impact of interventions. The gender
assessment identified and surveyed several women owned small businesses benefiting from electricity,
such as sewing shops, beauty parlors, restaurants and the selling of chilled drinks or ice through
refrigeration. However, in proportion of total use for income-generating activities, women owned
businesses remained a minority. This points out to a potential for increased direct participation of
women in electrification programs. In this context, integrating gender considerations in the design of
electrification programs, for instance by making sure that both men and women are involved in design
and consultations, and by identifying ways to overcome barriers such as access to credit or technology
for women and men, could further extend the benefits of electrification of rural communities.

98.      Based on the findings and recommendations of the assessment, a time bound gender and
energy action plan for AMADER was developed together with the staff and management to pilot
activities within specific villages and develop capacity within AMADER on gender issues. Within
AMADER a gender focal point was formally appointed in August 2011 to help define the activities
together with staff and serve as the key person to follow up, engage and monitor activities. To help
implement these activities, AMADER developed a partnership with UN WOMEN to work jointly on
promotion of income generating activities for individuals through the rational use of energy sources
and technologies, and on increasing the availability of functional equipment tailored to needs of
women and men. The findings of the gender assessment were also integrated in the preparation of the
SREP investment plan and have served as a case study for knowledge exchange globally and within
the Africa region on how to conduct gender assessments, developing action plans and building the
capacity to implement targeted activities.

99.      Social Development. On the whole, the project was of high significance in terms of social
capital building. The project served as an inclusive tool bringing villages and communities together to
organize themselves around common goals and manage their resources more sustainably. It promoted
collective decision-making at the community level. The participatory approach fostered self-
confidence and a sense of empowerment among beneficiaries and provided them an opportunity to
make their voices heard. Also, organized fuel wood markets are helping beneficiaries to have
additional and predictable income. The use of improved stoves is reducing indoor air pollution

                                                  20
associated with acute respiratory diseases, conjunctivitis, and low birth weight in participating
households.

100.    Benefits of access to modern energy services in rural and peri-urban areas are wide-ranging
and have generated positive impacts not anticipated. The availability of modern energy services in
rural communities is allowing children to do their homework at night, women to be able to deliver
babies in better conditions, villagers to have a security of movement at night, and a whole range of
income generating activities are emerging from ice making, food processing, bakery, tailoring, rural
telephony, and commercial banking. Markets can now be open for business at night and social
ceremonies can be extended to the nighttime.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

101.     The project has succeeded in strengthening technical and managerial capacities in particular at
AMADER and in a more differentiated way in main sector institutions such as DNE, CREE, DNCN
and provided a valuable framework to bring together staff from different agencies to work together on
rural electrification and forestry management issues. By participating in in-country formal and
informal training sessions as well as international study tours and workshops, key implementing
agency staff increased their competencies and know-how in critical areas of energy policy formulation,
energy regulation, energy efficiency, environmental and social aspects, rural electrification, project
evaluation, etc. At the time of project completion, AMADER was a well-functioning Agency with a
clear structure and capable staff in technical, financial management, procurement and environmental
and social areas. This represents a great achievement of the project. The strategic choice of the project
to support the establishment of a new institution was a bold one. By design, it was also agreed with the
Government that core staff of AMADER should be supported by the national budget for sustainability
of the institution. The fact that AMADER is still operational after the closing of the project and the
existing partnerships between AMADER and other donors such as EDF and KfW are encouraging
signs regarding the sustainability of the results achieved in the strengthening of institutions.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

102.    There was neither a beneficiary survey nor a stakeholder workshop done at completion in the
context of this ICR (see above for summary findings of 2009-2010 impact evaluation survey).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Significant

103.     This ICR rates risks to the sustainability of the development outcomes as Significant. This
rating is related to the political situation of the country following the March 2012 Military Coup that
has created an environment of instability and uncertainty. The project‘s accomplishments in key areas
such as strengthening of regulatory aspects, increase in capacity building in key sector institutions and
at the local community level are to some extent irreversible. The main risk is that the political crises
deepen further, or reach a steady state, which would dilute the motivation of the civil service, compel
leading staff to search for opportunities abroad, worsen governance in regulatory agencies, and bring
the reform process that Mali embarked upon in the 1990s to an indefinite standstill. Also, uncertainties
remain with regard to the institutional and financial sustainability of AMADER which depends
significantly on donor support.

104. On capacity building, the establishment and/or the investments in activities to strengthen
AMADER, CREE, DNE, and DNCN have helped build significant technical expertise, mainly at

                                                   21
AMADER. A key challenge for GoM is to continue to improve sector governance, by in particular
clarifying the responsibilities of each institution so as to make them more effective and accountable.

105.    As mentioned in section 2.5, the sustainability of the energy services delivery sub-projects will
depend in part on the diversification of the generation mix through the introduction of renewables to
mitigate the high cost of diesel-based generation.

106.   Finally, the continued enforcement of tax collection on the exploitation, production, and trade
of woodfuels is critical to sustain the achievements under component 3.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

107.     Bank’s performance during preparation was satisfactory. The team built on the good work
already performed under previous projects such as HEP and Selingué Power Rehabilitation project and
reflected the lessons learned in project design. It went a step further by supporting an innovative
approach for rural electrification sought by the government and welcomed by local beneficiaries.
There was adequate due diligence in identifying the project components and sub-components even
though some of the expected end targets were far too ambitious and/or some of the proposed
technologies did not receive the expected interest. There was good cooperation with the counterparts at
the national and local level, which resulted in smooth preparation at every stage. Regular stakeholder
consultations ensured that there were full agreements on project design, scope and activities. Some
shortcomings on the Monitoring and Evaluation were discussed in Section 2.3 above.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

108.     The Bank team closely supervised project implementation, including fiduciary and safeguards
issues. Supervision missions were conducted on average twice a year until January 2012, which
allowed for fairly regular face-to-face interaction on project issues with the implementing agency and
key sector institutions. Next steps and follow up actions were agreed upon in detail with counterparts.
These were included in the mission Aide Memoires, Mid-Terms Reviews (for both the original credit
and the additional financing) and Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) and were closely
tracked. After the Military Coup in March 2012 and until the closing date in June 2012, due to the
political situation of the country, no supervision missions could be conducted.

109.    Throughout the duration of the project, the team maintained a regular and constructive
dialogue with the implementing agency AMADER, and other relevant agencies such as DNE, CREE
and DNCN. Its pro-active approach in managing and resolving issues that arose during implementation
helped to keep project activities on schedule.

110.     As mentioned in other sections, the M&E framework had some deficiencies (also noted by the
project team in various documents and ISRs) that, if adequately addressed, could have further
improved the quality of project supervision. It is important to note that the Results Framework was
partially modified twice - through the Additional Financing and the Trust Funded Additional
Financing – but despite the team´s efforts to address the shortcomings of the original M&E
framework, some gaps in reporting and uncertainties on definitions persisted.

                                                   22
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

111.     Overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The team worked closely with
client counterparts as well as target communities all through preparation and supervision of the project.
Its pragmatic and flexible approach contributed to a well-designed project as well as successful project
implementation. Throughout the project, the task team followed the overall project status, with
attention to the status of the subprojects implemented under component 2. It worked closely with
AMADER to address lagging subcomponents and activities. In addition to regular technical support,
the project had good fiduciary, environment and social safeguards monitoring and compliance
reporting. It is worth noting that the same Task Team Leader was involved in the project throughout
project preparation and implementation ensuring continuity and thorough knowledge of project issues.
The moderately satisfactory rating is related to the shortcomings in the M&E framework which were
not fully addressed by the modification introduced in the two additional financings.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

112.   The government performance hereunder is assessed based on the performance by central
government stakeholders of the project, mainly the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Resources
(MoMEWR) but also the Ministry of Finance (MoF) as borrower on behalf of the Republic of Mali.

113.     At the central level, both the MoMEWR and MoF supported the design, PDO and GEO of the
project. MoMEWR also showed strong commitment to rural electrification through approval and
operationalization of key regulations. Delays in the mobilization of Government counterpart funds
were an issue at some points of project implementation resulting in downgrade of Government
performance from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory. Despite the issues related to counterpart
financing, the commitment of the GoM remained strong during the eight years of project
implementation until January 2012. In the semester preceding the closing date, political instability
derailed project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

114.    AMADER was committed to achieving the PDO and GEO. Focus on capacity building was
apparent as staff often participated in training activities to enhance their skills in carrying out their
financial management and procurement functions. Several shortcomings were noted during early
project implementation, e.g. it had been pointed out that the procurement files were not always
complete and also sometimes introduction of changes to the procurement methods were not
accompanied by corresponding amendments to the plans. Similar issues in financial documentation
were also identified and rectified during the implementation period. However, AMADER’s
performance improved overtime after training, TA and technical support from the Bank in
standardizing the processes and documentation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

115.    As indicated above, rating for the Government Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory
and rating for the Implementing Agency is rated Satisfactory. Hence, the rating for overall Borrower
Performance is moderately satisfactory.

                                                   23
6. Lessons Learned

116.    Need for simple and robust monitoring arrangements to be complemented by one-off
evaluation: Rural energy projects should adopt simple easy to monitor indicators for project
implementation, and to complement this monitoring by a more comprehensive impact evaluation near
the end of the project life.

117.    High engagement of local private sector in rural electrification schemes concessions and low
appetite from international private sector in large concessions. It was initially estimated that under the
HEURA project, 5 “large? rural electricity concessions would be developed. These concessions had
been planned through a top down approach. Two such concessions had started prior to the project. It
turned out that the development of these top-down projects was difficult. In particular, the required
participation of foreign private sector investors in the development of larger concessions proved
problematic and potential foreign operators were slow and reluctant to engage in ventures in rural
areas of Mali. Only the completion and extension of the two existing large decentralized concessions
was effectively implemented. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach to electrification, based on
“spontaneous? proposals presented by private operators, and supported by AMADER after screening
and analysis of the proposals (technical analysis, business plan), was successful, and attracted an
impressive number of local private sector operators.

118.    AMADER’s bottom up rural electrification approach needs to be complemented by projects of
larger scale, including renewable energy technologies. The majority of energy service companies
(ESCOs) have implemented business models based on isolated solar home systems (SHS) and
conventional diesel fueled micro-grids with installed generation capacities mainly below 20kW. While
considerable momentum has been created by these small scale energy service delivery projects, further
interventions are needed which - by delivering higher amounts of power - have a potential to
accelerate rural energy access and productive energy uses and may as well attract new sources of
financing. It is essential for AMADER to start developing - in addition to small-scale energy service
delivery schemes – projects of larger scale in villages where off-grid customers are concentrated
enough to be economically interconnected.

119.    Low demand for stand-alone Photovoltaics (PVs). As explained above, the appetite from the
communities for photovoltaic technology, here solar home systems, was lower than expected and the
main reason identified for this low interest is related to the electricity demand of communities that
could not be satisfied by solar home systems which have a limited electricity generation capacity.
Other issues included the lack of engagement from the industry and technology promoters in
improving the performance of the equipment and the lack of regulation in ensuring a minimum quality
of the equipment. In order to increase the demand for PVs under a fee-for-service model for instance
strengthening and improving maintenance services is needed.

120.     Partnerships with the local banking sector need to be strengthened to stimulate income
generating activities following electrification. Experiences from the HEURA Project have shown that
the availability of energy services rural initiatives are highly interested in expanding economic
activities, resulting in higher revenues. Experiences in rural electrification in Mali have however
demonstrated that productive energy uses are not spontaneously induced, when energy services start to
be delivered in an off-grid area. One main barrier is access to finance for local ESCOs and
microenterprises, in case these do not have sufficient investment capital, and a lack of end-user finance
schemes for households to accelerate access to basic energy services. A financial sector review (World
Bank/IMF 2008) and a study on financing in rural areas of Mali (World Bank, 2008) concluded that
the availability of funds for investments and productive activities is one of the key limitations for rural
households and SMEs.

                                                    24
121.    Active and sustained participation of community leaders are needed for successful
community-based woodfuel management initiatives. The development of community-based woodfuel
management initiatives showed the important role played by community leaders in the mobilization
and the organization of actors to develop and execute woodfuel management plans.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

122.   Draft copies of this ICR were discussed and comments from the Borrower/Implementing
Agency were received and included in this Report.

123.     A Borrower’s Final Report was received. For the Borrower, the outputs of the Components 1
and 2 of the project were rated overall satisfactory, especially regarding the increase in the rural
electrification rates in the country and Component 3 was considered moderately satisfactory (See
annex 7 for detailed comments)..

                                 Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      Component 1: Capacity Development and Institutional Strengthening: This component
supported the Water and Electricity Regulatory Commission (CREE), the Directorate of Energy
(DNE), the National Directorate of Nature Conservation (DNCN) and AMADER. Under the original
IDA project, the IDA additional financing, and the Trust Funded Financing, DNE, CREE, DNCN, and
AMADER have completed more than 640.0 staff weeks of training.

2.       For CREE, the project supported a training and capacity building program for 5
Commissioners and 8 technical specialists in the areas of financial regulation, analytical accounting,
financial management, contract monitoring and tariff design. It also supported the following studies:
(i) tariff study for electricity and water, (ii) preparation of regulatory accounting guidelines for
electricity and water, (iii) the preparation of guidelines to complete the legal and regulatory framework
for electricity and potable water, and (iv) the implementation of the CREE website. Finally, the project
supported CREE by providing office equipment, vehicles, etc. needed for the adequate functioning of
the Commission.

3.      For the DNE, the HEURA project supported a training and capacity building program in the
areas of policy formulation, monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment; and demand side
management and energy efficiency. It also supported key studies such as (i) a demand and master plan
study for the electricity sector, (ii) a feasibility study for the Bily micro hydro, and (iii) the preparation
of operation manuals and administrative and financial guidelines. The project also allowed the
recruitment of key consultants for the PASE. Finally, the project supported DNE by providing office
equipment, vehicles, etc. needed for the adequate functioning of the Directorate.

4.       For DNCN, the HEURA project supported a training and capacity building program in the
areas of policy formulation, monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment; and supply-side wood
energy management. HEURA also funded technical assistance for the preparation of guidelines for
wood management, forest control, evaluation system, the establishment of rural markets and their
evaluation, and support and preparation of regulatory aspects regarding forestry management. The
project supported DNCE by providing key office equipment and vehicles.

5.       The HEURA Project financed capacity development of AMADER and equipment to enable it
to become an operational Agency. The project supported AMADER (i) to improve on its monitoring
of local private sector operators involved in energy services delivery; (ii) to develop more innovative
technical and managerial schemes to promote lower cost electrification solutions; (iii) to promote
additional productive uses of energy services in partnership with the local banking system; (iv) to
continue to remove barriers to the development of renewable energy in line with the objectives of the
GEF co-financed activities of the original project; and (v) to reinforce output based mechanisms
related to the energy services delivery component. This subcomponent also financed outreach and
partnerships initiatives at the national, regional, and global levels to attract more financing for scaling
up in a sustainable manner energy access expansion in Mali. A strategic capacity development
program was financed as well as technical studies, equipment, and workshops.

6.       The project’s strategic capacity development program financed amongst others technical
studies, consultants, equipment, and workshops, with a particular focus on renewable energies and
productive energy uses. This component also financed rural energy outreach and partnerships
initiatives between AMADER and other energy sector institutions at the national, regional, and global
levels to attract future financing to scale up, in a sustainable manner, energy access expansion and
productive energy uses in Mali.


                                                     27
7.       The sustainability of the energy service delivery projects depended on a solid grounding of
economic, technical and management principles. Under the HEURA Project, AMADER’s technical
staff attended training sessions to strengthen economic skills, such as business management and
accounting, and technical skills, such as lay out design, operation, maintenance, and repair of
conventional and renewable energy technologies. Building on these skills, the emphasis of Trust
Funded Additional Financing was on upgrading economic and technical skills to plan, operate, and
repair renewable and hybrid mini-grids as well as managing an increased number of customers.

8.       Component 2: Energy Services Delivery: The Energy Services Delivery Component financed
the scale up of rural electrification projects throughout the country. This component was the driving
force of the project both in terms of outcomes and budget (approximately 67.5% of all project funds).

9.       Sub-component A. Promotion of Rural Electrification Investments. This sub-component
included: (i) establishing of a Rural Electrification Fund (REF) used to promote rural electrification
investments undertaken by private operators; as well as related studies to prepare and evaluate bids;
(ii) study to assess the need for the special financing instruments to help mobilize the required
financing from commercial banks; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation studies of individual
investments. This component succeeded in developing an adaptive and multi-layered approach to rural
energy - combining bottom up spontaneous small concessions 6 with top down planned large
concessions. With the bottom up approach, 83 sub-projects proposed by local private operators are
functional (see table 1 below). Local private operators have provided an average matching co-
financing of 25 percent of the financed schemes.

                                        Table 1: Bottom-up projects
Bottom-up projects                                                 Total (As of June 30, 2012)

10.      With the top-down approach, the country was divided in ten multisectoral electrification zones
for which Request for Proposals are available. Financing was secured for three zones – for Mopti and
Ségou financing is available from KfW and for Bamako financing was secured from IDA, however,
due to problems with the operators in the Mopti and Ségou zones, the projects were cancelled. For the
Bamako zone, the cancellation of the HEURA project also resulted in the non-execution of this sub-
project.

11.     AMADER did an extensive follow-up of the projects being implemented through site visits
and through the recruitment of consultants to follow-up on problematic projects. It is worth noting that
the investment costs for rural electrification projects supported by AMADER is lower than similar



6
  Following the bottom up rural electrification approach spontaneous private initiative projects are selected based
on promoters’ ability to develop and operate a viable project with a fixed investment subsidy (between 75-80
percent, limited to US$500,000). Subsidies are established on the basis of (i) the number of customers to be
connected during the first two years; (ii) the average tariff and (iii) subsidy by customer connected (total
investment per number of customers).

projects executed by other agencies and in other countries. As of June 30, 2012, a cumulative number
of about 74,787 connections had been made, exceeding the target of 68,896 connections. A cumulative
number of 1295 public and community institutions and centers are connected including 218 schools
and 168 health centers. The target of 1,275 for the original Project and Additional financing was
achieved but not the target of 1,809 set for the Trust Funded Additional Financing.

12.      Sub-component B. Promotion of Multi-functional Platforms. This sub-component financed (i)
a study to assess the sustainability of existing multifunctional platforms; and (ii) provided micro-
financing to support the equipment start-up costs of multifunctional platforms 7 that are operated by
community associations, women's associations, NGOs, and the private sector. Initially, women’s
associations played an important role in remote communities as providers of energy services. They
managed multifunctional platforms electrification initiatives after receiving training in basic
accounting in local languages provided by NGOs financed through the project. Multifunctional
platforms have been installed in 81 communities. Approximately 4,700 users are overall connected to
the platforms. However, some difficulties with the communal model of managing the platforms (i.e.
the income received by the associations from the sale of electricity that were supposed to cover for the
costs of diesel, the salary of the technician operating the equipment, and resources for maintenance and
repairs were used for other purposes, illegal connections, etc.) resulted in AMADER transferring the
management of the platforms to the private sector. At present, 61 multi-functional platforms have been
transferred to the private sector.

13.     The HEURA project is one of the pilot projects involved in the Africa region's gender and
energy program, supported by ESMAP/AFREA trust funds. This pilot entailed a gender assessment
carried out within AMADER's project areas - 12 villages were visited, with field data and surveys
conducted. A gender focal point was appointed within AMADER's organizational structure to monitor
and support gender specific activities within both renewable and rural electrification projects. Based
on this assessment, a gender action plan was developed with AMADER to pilot interventions in five
villages in collaboration with UNWomen. Training and sensitization on productive uses of energy
services and access to new energy technologies were going to be conducted at the village level for both
women and men. Due to the military coup, these pilots were put on hold, but the partnership with
AMADER and UNWomen continued which showed the sustainable partnership that was developed.
To capture the efforts and initial results that have taken place within the HEURA project the team
planned to produce several knowledge products - a case study which is under review and a video,
which has since been canceled due to security issues around filming.

14.     Sub-component C. Information, Education, and Communication. This sub-component helped
communities to be aware of energy services schemes by providing support to extensive information
and promotional campaigns through existing media in rural areas; field trips to neighboring villages
where services are installed and working; organization of focus groups to have feedback from users
and to register concerns from prospective users; and organization of workshops for private operators,
NGOs, and other civil society. Below is a list of key outputs of this sub-component:
    • Production of short informational commercials on rural electrification disseminated in

  A multifunctional platform is composed of a small 10 kW diesel engine coupled to a generator. The platform
can be connected to income generating equipment, such as cereal grinding mills, battery charger, dehuskers, and
water pumps, or generate electricity that can be distributed through a micro-grid to households.

        magazines and TV;
    •   Preparation of annual institutional films of AMADER´s activities in three languages (French,
        Bamanan and English);
    •   Regional workshops on rural electrification; and
    •   Participation of AMADER in key public activities that facilitated the promotion of rural
        electrification;

15.     GEO Implementation: The Grant for the Global Environmental Facility became effective in
May 2004 and closed in June 2009, as originally planned. The original grant amount was US$3.5
million but at closing, a portion of the grant was cancelled (US$0.98 million). Total disbursement of
GEF funds was US$2.52 million.

16.      The original end target of installing 11,726 solar photovoltaic systems was partially achieved.
A total of 8,141 systems were installed by the GEF grant closing date of June 30, 2009. The decision
not to extend the GEF Grant was due to the fact that at that time private operators were not interested
in adopting as much as expected solar technologies and beneficiaries also wanted multiple uses of
energy services that were difficult to be provided by solar home systems. The project team made a
strategic decision to concentrate efforts in facilitating the implementation of other project activities
that were more likely to materialize and had more stakeholder demand.

17.      Component 3: Household Energy: The household energy component was built on
achievements of the previous Household Energy Project (HEP) and supported the scaling-up of
initiatives of the national strategy on household energy. It had three main subcomponents:

18.      Sub-component A. Community-based Woodland Management. The subcomponent, which was
developed in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior, supported the
development of standard contracts for use by communities and local governments for management and
exploitation of wood resources. It provided support for (i) the development of rural markets and
village woodland management systems in 10 woodfuels supply basins that were already partly covered
with rural markets as well as in 5 new ones; (ii) created and supported the development of 1000 rural
woodfuel markets; (iii) implemented management systems for community forests in the Bamako,
Ségou, Mopti, Koutiala, Niono, Kayes, and Sikasso basins for a total of approximately 1.14 million
hectares that support approximately 70 percent of the urban woodfuel consumption; (iv) the creation of
more than 282 associations of modem charcoal production with efficient techniques and adequate
management capacity; and (v) provided support to the central and regional government institutions for
the preparation of forestry and water legislation applicable to the communities. The most important
legislative acts supported by AMADER include:
     • Law n° 10.028 of July 2010 establishing the conditions for the management of forestry
         resources at the national level;
     • Decree n° 10-387/P-RM of July 26, 2010 establishing the collection of forest revenues (taxes)
         for the national forests.
     • Decree n° 10-388/P-RM of July 26, 2010 establishing the list of protected areas.

19.      Thanks in part to the activities supported by this sub-component, an increasing collection of
forest revenues occurred in the last years of project implementation, due to better law enforcement by
both forestry officials and local communities.

20.    Sub-component B. Interfuel Substitution and Energy Efficiency. The promotion of efficient
wood energy and alternative products was a continuation and extension of the HEP project demand-
side component. Initially, its main thrust was the promotion of efficient charcoal stoves and


                                                  30
substitution by kerosene, LPG and alternative biomass fuels and the penetration of low-energy
consumption lamps and energy efficient evaporative air-coolers to reduce the peak power demand
curve and to reduce the electricity bill for end-users. By 2008, when the Additional Financing was
being prepared, it was clear than some of the proposed technologies were not as successful as others
among the potential users. In that context, it was decided to consolidate the support on the following
activities: (i) the scale up of improved stoves dissemination; (ii) the scale up of low consumption
lamps; (iii) the scale-up of evaporative air-coolers and (iv) an information system on energy efficiency.
Studies were also conducted to understand barriers to the adoption of kerosene stoves, LPG, wood
briquettes that did not receive enough interest from the potential users.

21.     Highly satisfactory implementation was made in the dissemination of improved stoves (128
percent of initial target), low consumption lamps (651 percent of initial target) and evaporative coolers
(142 percent of initial target. At project closing, 1,296,488 improved stoves, 1,303,004 low
consumption lamps and 2847 evaporative coolers were disseminated.

22.      Sub-component C. Information, Education, and Communication. This sub-component
financed (i) extensive information and promotional campaigns through existing media in rural areas
(radio, institutional, grassroots) in order to raise interest and formal requests from rural communities in
support of the community-based woodland management, interfuel substitution and household energy
efficiency activities; and (ii) woodfuel sector training, planning and monitoring.

23.      It is important to note that the implementation of the household energy component occurred at
a slower pace than the other two components and also resulted in the reallocation of some funds
originally destined for Component 3 to Component 2. However, towards the end of the project, an
encouraging trend associated with the household energy component was seen with an increased
collection of forest revenues due to better law enforcement by both forestry officials and local
communities. Through the woodfuel supply master plan, about 1,142,033 hectares were placed under
sustainable management and 282 rural wood markets were created as of June 30, 2012.

                                 Annex 3. Economic Analysis
                             (including assumptions in the analysis)


1.       The original estimated Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of the entire project was
33.2%. This included the three project components including the Capacity Development and
Institutional Strengthening, Energy Service Delivery and the Household Energy Component. The
economic reevaluation results in a revision of the overall project EIRR to 17.2%. In the case of
Energy Services Delivery, the lower EIRR is mostly the result of higher fuel prices, which have
increased the operating costs of electricity provisions in rural areas. With regard to Household
Energy, the lower EIRR result from the fact that the quantitative objectives of the project have
only been partially achieved, and the expected benefits were therefore reduced proportionally. On
the other hand, the increase in energy prices has actually increased the value of some of benefits
(reduced fuel consumption). The economic reevaluation does not take into consideration the
environmental benefits of the project (reduced CO2 emissions).

2.       Overall, the economic justification for the project remains solid. It should be noted that a
significant portion of project costs is related to capacity building and institutional development,
which for the most part should not be recurrent costs. Future operations would use existing
institutions and capacity and require lower upfront costs.

3.      Any estimated economic rate of return, even ex post, has a speculative element, in the
absence of complete data, especially regarding the economic benefits. Still, most of the activities
supported by the project had concrete and measurable outcomes (e.g. reduced fuel consumption
from woodstoves or efficient lamps). For instance, the diffusion of improved stoves (charcoal
stoves, wood stoves, kerosene stoves) has very tangible benefits under the form of reduced fuel
consumption. Since the diffusion of improved stoves under the project has been implemented
successfully (and energy prices have gone up), the expected economic benefits have logically
materialized.

4.      For other activities (e.g. communication regarding energy efficiency), there is anecdotal
evidence of positive impact but insufficient data to quantify the impact ex post. The economic
return of institutional strengthening and capacity building is also difficult to quantify, and for this
reason, for the purpose of the economic analysis, these costs have been allocated to the two other
components (Energy Service Delivery, Household Energy).


Economic reevaluation methodology

5.    Energy Services Delivery: The majority of project resources were devoted to this
component. Under the original project economic analysis, project costs included:
•     Investments (either financed by the project or the operators)
•     Training, Capacity Building, communication expenses financed under the component.
•     Operating costs borne by the operators (fuel and O&M for the most part).

6.      The project benefits were estimated based on the willingness to pay of energy users,
assessed based on the uses of electricity by rural populations (lighting, water pumping….). The
EIRR for the component was originally estimated at 30.0% and the Economic Net Present Value
(with a 12% discount rate) at US$ 22.0 million.


                                                  34
7.      The project economic reevaluation is based on the original methodology with updated
costs and benefits assumptions as allowed by available data. The significant changes in modeling
assumptions are:
    •    Reevaluation of investments costs
    •    Reevaluation of fuel costs: the increase in oil prices is by far the most significant
         change: the original cost assumption for the economic cost of diesel oil was 0.3 USD per
         liter and has been increased to 0.8USD.
    •    Economic benefits: there was not sufficient basis to re-estimate the willingness to pay
         for each customer category. The original assumptions of economic benefits have
         therefore been left unchanged for 80%. For the remainder 20% of consumption, it was
         assumed that it would come in substitution to petroleum product use (e.g. kerosene
         lamps) and the economic benefits were increased by the same percentage as diesel costs.
    •    The project benefits were considered over a period of 15 years (instead of 30) to reflect
         the uncertainty regarding generation equipment renewal when they become obsolete.

8.      Based on the above, the revised project EIRR is 16.4% and the Net Present Value (base
on the original 12% discount rate which is probably excessive) US$ 6.3 million.

9.       The component economic justifications appear to remain solid in the spite of the increase
in oil prices. Going forward, the increase in diesel cost should lead to consider the introduction of
more solar generation for rural electrification (probably in hybrid diesel / PV system to provide
guaranteed generation).

10.      Household Energy: As per the original economic analysis, the economic benefits from
this component came primarily from reduced energy costs, through reduced energy consumption
or fuel substitution.

11.    The economic reevaluation has adjusted the estimated benefits to reflect the rate of
implementation of the original objectives. The implementation rates used are as follows:
    •   Forestry management: 68% (based on areas under sustainable management and
        functioning wood fuel markets),
    •   Fuel Substitution: 50% (on rate of target achievement for gas stoves and “briquettes?)
    •   Better carbonization: 101% (based on diffusion of improved stoves)
    •   Energy Efficiency-electricity: 150% (estimate reflecting much better than expected
        results for CFLs and better than expected for water coolers).

12.     Energy prices increased considerably after project preparation. For this reason, the
estimated benefits from fuel substitution and improved carbonization have been increased by
50%.

13.     On this basis, the estimated EIRR for Household energy component is 20.6% and the Net
Present Value (with a 12% discount rate) US$ 3.0 million.

     Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.      A Borrower’s Final Report was received. For the Borrower, the outputs of the
Components 1 and 2 of the project were rated overall satisfactory, especially regarding the
increase in the rural electrification rates in the country and Component 3 was considered
moderately satisfactory.

2.      Regarding the difficulties and obstacles faced during the implementation of the project,
the main issues raised by AMADER are:
    • The anticipated closing of the IDA credits due to the military coup of March 2012 that
        resulted in a slowdown of the implementation of the project and not achieving some of
        the targets;
    • The lack of funding from the GoM to continue with the electrification program and the
        household energy program without external financing;
    • The lack of funding from the GoM for the sector institutions such as AMADER;
    • Some approvals by the World Bank on procurement were not granted in time, thus
        contributing to delays in project implementation;
    • For the Energy Services Delivery Component:
             o Lack of human resources in AMADER for an adequate follow-up of the sub-
                 projects;
             o Lack of capacity of some of the private sector operators which affected the
                 technical, commercial and financial operations of the projects;
             o Difficulties in securing fuel in some regions;
             o Mismanagement of funds by some operators;
             o Inadequate maintenance and management of the equipment; and
             o Low number of customers in some areas.
    • For the Household Energy Component:
             o The high cost and difficulty in securing the supply of materials for the fabrication
                 of improved stoves;
             o Low budget allocated for subsidies of butane gas; and
             o Absence of kerosene stoves market.
