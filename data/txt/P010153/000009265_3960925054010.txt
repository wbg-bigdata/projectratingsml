PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND RESEARCH PROJECT
(Credit 1100-NEP)
and
HILL FOOD PRODUCTION PROJECT
(Credit 1101-NEP)
PREFACE
This is a combined Completion Report of the Agricultural Extension and
Research Project (AERP) and the Hill Food Production Project (HFPP) in Nepal.
In addition, this Project Completion Report (PCR) provides, in Part III, an in-
depth analysis of the experience gained in introducing a reoriented extension
service vtnder AERP and HFPP and suggescions for its improvement. IDA credits for
the two projects, amounting to US$17.5 million and US$8.0 million respectively
were approved on February 3, 1981. The two credits closed on July 15, 1990 after
three extensions. A balance of US$3.2 million (SDR 2.52 million) for AERP and
US$2.4 million (SDR 1.88 million) for HFPP remained unspent and was canceled as
of August 29, 1990 for HFPP and January 2, 1991 for AERP.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I, III and IV) was
prepared by an FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme mission which visited Nepal
in February 1991, and revised by the Agriculture Operations Division of the Asia
Region. The format is e departure from the norms in that an in-depth evaluation
and analysis of the extension service common to both projects is inserted as Part
III, while Part IV provides the statistical  information.  The PCR is based on
the respective Staff Appraisal Reports and Reports to the President, the
Development Credit Agreements, supervision reports, a review of project files and
discussions with Bank staff in Washington D.C. and Kathmandu, as well as with
staff of various implementing agencies of His Majesty's Government of Nepal. On
May 31, 1991, the Bank sent the Borrower Parts I, III and IV with the request to
prepare Part II by June 25, 1991, but no reply was received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NEPAL
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND RESEARCH PROJECT
(Credit 1100-NEP)
and
HILL FOOD PRODUCTION PROJECT
(Credit llOl-NEP)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
(i)       The main objective of both projects was to attain early and sustained
improvement in agricultural production, particularly of foodgrains. Increases
in production and productivity were largely to be brought about by the wide
adoption of low-cost, labor-intensive agriculkural practices and use of
appropriate levels of fertilizer. This was to be achieved mainly through the
reorganization of the extension service in line with training and visit (T&V)
principles. The common characteristics of the projects were to appoint full-;ime
Panchayatl' Level Agricultural Assistants (PLAAs) as village extension workers
to work exclusively on extension; establish a single line of command between
PLAAs and extension headquarters in a unified extension system; select contact
farmers (CFs) to disseminate information; establish a fixed and regular cycle of
fortnightly visits by PLAAs; use simple, practical and relevant messages and
concentrate on the most important crops; provide regular in-service training to
extension staff at all levels; initiate a system of feedback from farmers via
extension staff to researchers; and develop monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
procedures (paras 2, 3, 53, 54).
(ii)      The projects made provision for staff and technical assistance, the
construction of related physical facilities, and the provision of funds for the
purchase of fertilizers. In addition, the Agricultural Extension and Research
Project (AERP) included a component to develop and upgrade adaptive research and
strengthen extension-research linkages. Under the Hill Food Production Project
(HFPP) these efforts were complemented by the development and improvement of
irrigation for about 3,000 ha of land, the upgrading of trails and the
construction of bridges.
Implementation Ex9erience
(iii)     Both projects were to be implemented over a period of five years,
starting in January 1982, with an estimated project completion date of December
1986 and Credit closing date of July 1987. Due mainly to the slow progress in
the construction of physical facilities and the need to cover the slippage in
recruitment and training of staff, the Credit closing date of both projects had
I/        Lowest-level administrative unit.



iv
to be extended thrice by one year each, to July 1990.   In spite of these
extensions, neither Credit was fully disbursed and the undisbursed balances of
US$3.2 million [SDR 2.5 million]  (AERP) and US$2.4 million [SDR 1.8 milLion]
(HFPP) were canceled. The shortfall in disbursement was due for the most part
to a considerable depreciatior. of the Nepclese rupee against Lhe U.S. dollar
(paras 11, 59).
(iv)      From the beginning, His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN) attempted
to implement the programs as outlined at appraisal.   However, both projects
suffered from a number of constraints which adversely affected their impact.
(a) The principle of the single line of command was not always adhered to,
particularly at the regional and district levels which suffered from
dual lines of command, as the office of the Project Coordinator was
often directly acting on instruction from the Director-General (DG)
of the Department of Agriculture (DOA), by-passing the Regional
Director of Agriculture (RDA) or the District Agricultural Development
Officer (ADO).   In addition, the Ministry of Local Development had
administrative authority over regional and district agricultural
extension staff and could interfere in staff matters over-ruling DOA
decision (para 10).
(b)  Generally,   the  extension  system  was  not  responsive  to  its
beneficiaries.   Planning of extension activities was not based on
farmer information, and problem/need extension recommendations were
not developed (paras i5, 29, 66, 77).  In addition implemc.:ntation of
the T&V system in the Hill environment has been very complex due to
the extreme rugged topography and the widely scattered settlement
pattern (paca 79).
(c) Under the T&V system of extension, it was assumed that the contact
farmer (CF) approach would enable a rapid diffusion of technology.
This did not materialize, too few farmers were contacted and little
attempt was made to gain active and purposeful participation by
farmers in the identification and prioritizing of their perceived
problems, and to identify reference groups.   Only in the last two
years of both projects was a reference group introduced rather than
a contact farmer ns the focal point of extension (paras 24, 45).
(d) Part of the deficiencies of agricultural extension can be attributed
to inadequate research. A top-down approach to research was prevalent
throughout the projects and most research concentrated on varieties
and fertilizer application, with emphasis on grain erops under
irrigated conditions  (para 29).    For  the special  agro-climatic
conditions of the Hills, hardly any research recommendations were
available (para 61).   Only after 1987, following the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding with the British Government-financed Lumle
Agricultural Center (LAC), was an attempt made to provide the
extension service in a systematic way with research findings and
recommendations, based on the assessment of farmers, actual needs.
The National Agricultural Research Center (NARC), which is responsible
for research planning and coordination at national level, has also
recently started to explore ways and means to base research on the
analysis of farmers' needs under various agro-climatic and socio-
economic conditionE, considering the farming system as a whole.



v
(e)  Due  to  the  limitation  of  research,  most  extension  messages
concentrated on the major food grain crops and were rather simplistic,
not location specific and hardly took financial considerations into
account.    This  affected adoption rates  and undermined  farmers,
confidence in the advice offered by extension staff (paras 29, 41).
(f)  Mass media techniques were under utilized (paras 24, 79).
(g)  The  performance  of  Subject  Matter  Specialiots  (SMS),  Junior
Technicians (jTs) and Junior Technical Assistants (JTAs) was often
unsatisfactory,  dte  in  part  to  lower  than  required  academic
qualifications an.- lack of experience, and in part to a lack of
motivation caused _  the temporary nature of most posts,  lack of
transport, inadequate travel allowances, and inappropriate staff
incentives.    ADOs,  SMSs,  and JTs  experienced particularly high
turnover rates (paras 20, 21, 79).
(h)  The  performance  of  the  PLAAs  (recently  re-named  Agricultural
Assistants - AAs) was, on the contrary, -.mpressive (para 24). Under
the AERP, the fortnightly visits to contact farmers were carried out
regularly. Under HFPP, visits to CFs were not always regular. Due
to the difficult terrain of the Hills, the supervision of MAs by JTs
and JTAs also suffered from communiication difficulties, especially
since most JTs(/JTAs were not outposted by centrally located (para
79).
(i)  A key element of both projects was regular training of staff and AAs.
Training, however, was mostly inadequate as the workshops were used
mainly for discussion of results of on-farm adaptive trials and work
programs rather than training per se. Research staff, especially in
Terai, attending and imparting knowledge at these workshops, were also
generally inexperienced and had the same qualifications   as the
trainees. Because of high staff turrover, many staff did not receive
adequate pre-service on in-service training, further affecting work
quality (para 31).
(j)  Budget  requests  were  substantially  revised  by  Government  and
government policies restricted funding for building and vehicles. In
addition, budget allocations were often insufficient and their release
frequently delayed, thus hampering the procurement of goods and
services,  and resulting  in delays  of  the construction  program,
inadequate maintenance of buildings and vehicles, and operational
difficulties (para 25).
(k)  Supervision was ir-dequate due to lack of transport, inadequate travel
and subsistence allowances and because supervisory staff, especially
ADOs, were overburdened wiL.i administrative duties (paras 26, 79).
(1)  Under the HFPP, Agricultural Service Centers (ASCs) were to serve as
a kingpin for agricultural development, providing, in an integrated
manner, agricultural extension advice, livestock extension/animal
health services, input supply, credit, produce market facilities and
training in the same location. However, construction was seriously
delayed and only partly completed during project extension. Delays
were mostly caused by problems in land acquisition and tendering of



vi
contracts (para 71). In addition, the housing of JTAs at centrally
located ASCs reduced extension effectiveness (para 79),  Due to the
creation of a separate Department of Livestock Development and ;hnimal
Health (DOLD/AH) prior to project start-up, the collaboration between
agricultural and livestock extension did not materialize (para 63).
Even after completion of ASC infrastructure the Sajha (cooperatives)
responsible for input supply and the Agricultural Development Bank of
Nepal (ADBN) have, in most cases, failed to relocate their branches
to the ASC. Produce marketing and storage also dit. not take place at
ASCs, as farmers found more convenient marketing opportunities or did
nct produce the expected marketable surplus. As a result, most of the
ASCs now serve mainly as extension staff housing and training
facilities.
(v)       Both projects were expected to generate a substantial demand for
fertilizer anid improved seed and a concurrent need for institutional credit.
Both provided funds for the purchase of fertilizer to satisfy the needs of
farmers in the 1:o4ect area during the first few years of the project.
Thereafter, the timely availability of the right types of fertilizer in adequate
quantities became a major constraint, due mainly to limited availability of funds
for fertilizer importation and deficiencies in distribution by the Agricultural
Input Jorporation and Saja. Improved seeds were seldom available and farmers had
to rely mainly on exchange with neighbors (para 35).  Although credit volume
expanded considerably during the project period, access to ADBN credit still
remained a major problem for many farmers due to remote location, cumbersome
credit procedures and lack of collateral (para 35).
Results
(vi)      As a result of the projects, a reorganized extension service is now
in place in eight Terai and four Hill districts together with the required staff
housing and training facilities.   However, both projects failed to provide
farmers with recommendations best suited to their specific conditions and
problems (paras 15, 41, 66), and the quality of training was poor (paras 21, 76).
The increased agricultural production observed in both project areas can be
attributed only in part to improved extension and research activities as
increases in irrigated areas and improved availability of farm inputs and credit
also played a major role in increasing production and productivity.   Project
evaluation was insufficient to assess separately the impact of the reorganized
extension service and the role of research on production and yield.
(vii)     Due to the substantiql delays in ASC construction under the HFPP, only
limited experience could be gained in their operation and no evaluation of their
role and utility has been carried out during the project implementation period.
Results, however, are not very encouraging as the centers have so far failed to
become a focal point for the provision of services, inputs and credit for the
majority of farmers.   In addition, the stationing of JTs/JTAs at centrally
located ASCs moved them away from the farming communities and reduced extensior
effectiveness (paras 71, 74, 79).
(viii)    In line with the approach in other projects aimed at improving
agricultural extension and research, no Economic Rate of Return (ERR) calculation
was carried out at appraisal of the AERP. For the HFPP, the ERR for the whole
project was estimated at over 57% and over 15% for the irrigation component. Due
to insufficient project evaluation data, it was impossible to determine with any



vii
degree of accuracy the production increases that could be attributed to the
project.   Therefore,  the ERR has been re-estimated only for the irrigation
component of HFPP and amounts to over 50%.
Sustainability
(ix)      The projects have resulted in structural changes in the organization
and management of extension. As staff strength of the conventional agricultural
extension system previously operating in the districts was estimated to be
insufficient to cater to the needs of the reorganized system, staff and
agricultural assistants numbers were increased considerably. The most marked
increases were S.equired at the AA level, which due to the low allowance paid,
however, did not have serious budgetary implications. The recently demonstrated
unwillingness of AAs to contiitue as paid volunteer workers, but demanding civil
servant status and pay, makes it doubtful whether the field operation can be
continued in its present form (para 40). In addition the high numbers of JTs and
JTAs, which placed a heavy strain on the budget, seriously put the sustainability
of thie system in question (paras xii(b), 19, 73).
(x)       The substantial construction cost of ASCs established under the HFPP
and subsequent high maintenance cost, together with considerable staffing
requirements and cost, raise doubts about the capacity of HMGN to sustain this
approach in the Hills (para 74).  The failure so far to elaborate a workable
water management program causes concern about the maintenance of the individual
irrigation schemes improved or established under HFPP (para 85).
(xi)      Effective  from Credit closing,  all activities  initiated by both
projects wer- brought under the umbrella of the on-going Agricultural Extension
II Project [iszP II] (Cr. 1570-NEP), which was redesigned accordingly and will
also complete the few remaining unfinished civil works. This step has ensured
uniformity and continuity (para 44).
Findings and Lessons Learned
(xii)     Both projects suffered from a number of shortcomings, from design
through implementation.   The project period was set too short to implement
complex institution-building projects, and the phasing of the substantial
construction programs was unrealistic.   To little attention was paid to the
availability of suitably qualified technical staff, lines of command were not
clearly delineated, administrative and budgetary problems were not properly
identified, the availability of relevant technology was ill-assessed, and farmers
did not participate in the identification and prioritizing of their perceived
problems and needs. The implementation experience suggests a number of specific
lessons (paras 45, 46, 96). The most important are the following:
(a)  During the first five yeazs of an extension project little more can
be achieved than the establishment of an administrative framewc_k for
extension and the provision of an information service focused on
existing technology (p&ras 6, 18, 20, 21, 29).
(b) In systems operation, a single line of command has to be maintained
and management performance monitored (para 10).



v! I I
(c) A bottom-up approach to extension and research is essential to
adequately cater for the needs of heterogenous farming systems and
farming communities (paras 15, 29, 41, 45).
(d) Staff have to be provided with adequate incentives such as permanent
positions, promotions and fellowships, and allowances and mobility to
ensure motivation and staff continuity (paras 20, 26, 79).
(e) Staff recruitment procedures and training require adequate standards
to ensure staff quality (paras 21, 22).
(f)  An appropriate mechanism for project M&E has to be in place from
project start-up, to assess project progress and impact, and take
early corrective measures (paras 38, 91).
(g) It is quite unrealistic to believe that a low agent/farmer ratio is
a sine qua non condition for an improved extension service (para 19).
A large number of low-level extension personnel, albeit highly
supervised with regularly scheduled farm visits, does not necessarily
enhance  the  process  of  change.    Extension  agents  should have
professional competence to understand the farming system as a whole.
This argues for fewer but better qualified and trained agricultural
extension agents and fox agents who have actual farming experience as
well as a fair level of academic training (para 40).   There are also
other alternatives, such as modern communications and cost sharing
arrangements   with   beneficiaries   that   provide   cost-effective
complementarities for accomplishing extension objectives without the
long-run budgetary implications of large numbers of government
employees (para 46[e]).
(h) Implementation of the T&V system in the Hill environment has been more
complex and difficult than first envisaged due to the extremely rugged
topography and the widelv scattered settlement pattern of its
population. General technical recommendations are not appropriate in
the Hills in view of the multitude of agro-ecological zones; emphasis
should be given to the diagnostic phase (para 45) and adaptive
research (paras 77, 78). In addition, in limited access areas, money
can be saved and the coverage of scarce staff extended by taking
advantage of media and other modern communication methods (para 96).

AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND tZESEARCH PROJECT
(Cr. 1100-NEP)
and
HILL FOOD PRODUCTION PROJECT
(Cr. llOl-NEP)
PART I. REVIEW OF PROJECTS FROM IDA'S PERSPECTIVE
I. Background
1.        Agriculture continues to be the key sector for Nepal's economic
development, providing almost 90% of employment and contributing more than 60%
of GDP. In 1979/80, foodgrains accounted for about 90% of the cropped area, rice
being the most important (50%) followed by maize, wheat, other cereals and
pulses.   The remaining cropped area was planted to oilseeds, jute, potato,
tobacco, sugarcane and horticultural crops.   During the 1970s, a decline in
yields for most crops with the main exception of wheat was observed. This was
attributed partly to erratic monsoon conditions and distribution; higher cost of
fertilizer; and inadequate extension, research and other supporting services.
In addition, a decline in soil fertility was observed in the Hills. To arrest
the declining trend in prod?ACtivity and ensure adequate food supply for an
increasing population, His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN) requested the
International Development Association (IDA) assistance for the development of
food production through the strengthening of agricultural extension services and
adaptive research facilities in eight districts of the Terai (Cr. 1100-NEP) and
provision of improved agricultural support services in four Hill districts in the
Western Development Region (Cr. 1101-NEP).

Proiect Obiectives e'nd Description
2.        Obiectives.  The main objective of the project was to achieve early
and sustained improvement in agricultural production, particularly of foodgrains,
in eight administrative districts of the Terai, namely Jhapa, Sarlahi, Dhanusa,
Mahottari, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Kapilbastu and Banke. Increases in production
were largely to be brought about by the wide adoption of low-cost, labor-
intensive agricultural practices and use of appropriate levels of fertilizer.
3.        Component3.  The project included the following components:
(a) Reorganization and strengthening of agricultural extension services.
Provision of additional staff, housing, offices, equipment,
transportation and staff training designed to consolidate the
reorganization.
(b) Strengthening and reorientation of applied and adaptive research.
Development and upgrading of four regional research stations, and one
sub-station through farm development and provision of staff,
machinery, equipment, laboratory facilities, housing and vehicles.
(c)  Project  monitoring  and  evaluation.    Establishment  of  regular
monitoring and evaluation (H&E) procedures.
(d)  Technical  assistance.    Overseas  training  of project  staff  and
provision of consultants.
(e)  Fertilizer.   Provision of 22,100 tons of fertilizer to be used in
project districts.
4.        The project was to be implemented over a period of five years at a
total cost of US$20.85 million.  The major components, as percentages of total
project cost, were: fertilizer (40%); civil works, vehicles,  equipment and
furniture (25%); miscellaneous costs including technical assistance (9%); and
incremental extension and research staff (3%).  Physical and price contingencies
made up an additional 23%. Overall responsibility for project implementation was
vested with the Director-General (DG) of the Department of Agriculture (DOA).
Prolect DesiQn and Organization
5.        DeLgi.  The concept of the project was consistent with Governmentfs
development strategy which emphasized the need for enhancing self-sufficiency and
to arrest the decline in export earnings from foodgrains. Recognizing that the
Terai would have to continue to play a major role in the generation of domestic
and exportable foodgrain surpluses, the project was designed to strengthen the
agricultural production system in the project districts. Since the potential for
area expansion was limited, emphasis was given to increasing yields, mainly by
improving extension services and input supply to farmers. The project concept
was not innovative as it followed the approach of previous IDA-assisted projects
which had already introduced the Training and Visit (T&V) system of extension in
other districts of the country, including six other districts of the Terai
contiguous with the project area.



3
6.        The project was identified by an IDA mission in July 1979.  It was
prepared by the Agricultural Projects Services Center (APROSC), Nepal, with the
assistance of the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme in December 1979.  It was
appraised by IDA in June 1980.   The project was prepared satisfactorily.
However, the initial time frame of five years was too short to implement the
substantial organizational changes and the extensive construction program. Also,
the Government's implementing capacity, financial resources and availability of
manpower were not adequately assessed. Furthermore, it was over-optimistic to
assume that applied and adaptive research would be able to develop improved
cultivation practices fast enough to have an impact on production during the
project period.
7.        Organization.    Overall  responsibility  for  implementation  of the
project was vested with the DG of DOA, assisted by two Deputy Director-Generals
(DDGs), one each for Extension and Research,  respectively.   As planned, at
national level, a Project Coordinator (PC) was appointed and made responsible for
ensuring implementation and coordination of all project activities.   At the
regional level, the Regional Director of Agriculture (RDA) was responsible for
supervision of all district extension activities.
8.        Research efforts were decentralized and carried out in the Regional
Research Stations (RRSs), one for each of the four development regions of the
Terai.   The linkage between these research stations and extension was the
responsibility of the District Technical Committees (DTCs) which were established
under the project in each of the eight project districts.
9.        The design and supervision of construction and/or maintenance of
departmental buildings at headquarters and in research stations and farms, were
the responsibility of the Agricultural Engineering Division (AED) of DOA, which
was modestly strengthened by the project. Fertilizer imports financed by the
project were to be channelled through the Agricultural Inputs Corporation (AIC)
and fertilizer storage at district level was the responsibility of AIC and the
cooperatives.   The latter were to be provided with twenty Panchayat-Level
warehouses.   Loans for smallholders were to be made available through the
Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (AD3N) from its own resources.
10.       The project provided for the reorganization of extension staff into
a single line of command from the DG down to the Panchayat-Level Agricultural
Assistants (PLAAs) through the district-level Agricultural Development Officer
(ADO).  However, the principle of a single line of command was often broken
during implementation due to conflict between administrative and technical lines,
especially at regional levels.   In retrospect, this weakness could have been
avoided if the roles and responsibilities of staff in the various institutions
and agencies involved in project implementation had been clearly defined at
appraisal.

Proiect Implementation
11.       Critical variances in proiect implementation.  The project was to be
implemented over a period of five years, starting in January 1982. Total costs
were estimated at US$20.85 million (NRs 250.6 million) and an IDA credit of
US$17.5 million (SDR 13.8 million) was made available, together with a UNDP
technical assistance grant of US$0.65 million, the latter mostly for
consultancies  and  staff  training.    Due mainly  to  slow progress  in  the
construction of physical facilities and the need to cover the slippage in the
recruitment and training of staff, Credit closing had to be extended thrice, in
one-year ilncrements, to July 15, 1990. At the time of Credit closing, a balance
of US$3.2 million (SDR 2.5 million) remained unspent, mainly due to the
substantial depreciation of the Nepalese rupee against the U.S. dollar.   The
undisbursed balance was canceled in January 1991.
12.       Due to the reorganization of the Panchayat system in 1982, the number
of village and town Panchayats in the eight project districts increased from 500
to 573, and the number of PLAA, Junior Technician (JT) and Junior Technical
Assistant (JTA) positions was increased resulting in a better coverage of the
project area but requiring substantially higher resource allocations (para 19).
With the establishment of the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC) in
1985 and its becoming operational in 1987, research was separated from DOA and
subsequently all research activities fell under the auspices of NARC and were
coordinated by the Center.
13.       Prolect risks.  The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) did not anticipate
any major project risks due to the fact that the T&V system of agricultural
extension had been introduced earlier in other districts and had shown promising
results in terms of farmers' responsiveness and the professional ability of
extension agents to promote innovations, and that some farmers in the project
area had already obtained, without project support, twice the average yields.
It was further assumed that the extension service would be able to develop and
disseminate recommendations leading to substantial yield increases and that the
availability of a suitable technology for different conditions would not be a
constraint. Although data available on production and yields are not adequately
conclusive (para 16), yield increases were rather moderate (para 17), indicating
that the project risk of low adoption rates of improved technology by farmers was
under-estimated and/or that research findings were not fully tailored to farmers'
needs (para 29). The SAR failed to identify the linkage between extension and
research- *s a project risk and although the formal linkage mechanism established
under the project functioned adequately (para 30), the transfer of technology to
the extension service remained weak throughout implementation. Also, the risk
of unavailability of suitably qualified technical staff, construction delays and
budgetary problems were not properly identified and no corrective measures were
incorporated to ensure smooth implementation (paras 21, 22, 25, 26).
14.       Unforeseen factors affecting project implementation.  The Indo-Nepal
trade and transit crisis adversely affected the availability and cost of
construction material and other supplies which contributed to the delay in
construction work of staff housing during 1989/90 (para 25). Two of the project
districts (Jhapa and Sarlahi) suffered from severe floods in 1987, especially
affecting rice production.



5
Proiect Results
15.       The overall project result was barely satisfactory.  It has resulted
in structural changes in the organization and management of extension services
in the districts covered (paras 18, 21, 30, 31). However, the extension system
was generally not responsive to its beneficiaries, planning of extension
activities was not based on farmer information, and problems/needs extension
recommendations were not developed. Also, the quality of training was poor and
the high numbers of extension agents recruited u.nder the project placed a heavy
strain on the budget (paras 19, 21, 22, 29, 31, 40, 41).
16.       Crop production.  The main effect expected from the project was an
increase in agricultural production, especially in foodgrains.  Data on crop
area, yield and production in the eight project districts in the Terai were not
given in the SAR and hence it is not possible to compare pre- and post-project
performance. In addition, agricultural statistics in the project area were not
monitored during the project period. Based on data published by the Agricultural
Statistics Division (ASD) of MOA, it appears that there was considerable annual
fluctuation in cropped areas and yields during the project period (1981/82 to
1989/90), due probably to drought and seasonal flooding.  Since 1980/81, the
wheat area has increased by 10,000 ha, maize by 4,000 ha and oilseeds by 15,000
ha, while the paddy and millet area has decreased by about 2,000 ha and 4,000 ha,
respectively. There were no published data on pulses prior to 1984/85, but the
cropped area during the period 1984/85-1989/90 has remained more or less static.
17.       As the table below shows, production of major foodgrains such as
paddy, wheat and maize and of oilseeds has increased, while production of millet,
and pulses has decreased.   Although yields for the major foodgrains have
increased, it is virtually impossible to distinguish between the effects of
extension and the effects of research on production and yields since they are
only two of the many factors involved in the production process. The yields of
pulses and oilseeds have remained stable.

18.       Reorganization of extension.  The main effect of the project was to
reorganize the extension service in line with T&V principles by ensuring
comprehensive extension coverage through the appointment of full-time PLAAsll
who would worlk. in close collaboration with contact farmers (CFs) to disseminate
information.   Acceptance of the CF approach implied that this particular
approach, rather than other techniques such as working with groups, and mass
media techniques, was the most effective way to dissem'-nate technology (para 24).
The PLAAs were to carry out fortnightly farm visits and be supervised and guided
by JTAs who, in turn, were to be supervised and guided by JTs. Technical support
was to be provided by research staff and Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs). A
single line of command was to be established from the DC through ADO at district
level down to the PLAAs.
19.       At appraisal, it was envisaged to appoint one PLAA per Panchayat and
one JTA would be responsible for an average of four PLAAs.   One JT would
supervise and guide about three JTAs.  The ratio of SMS to JT/JTA was fixed at
1:10.  Furthermore, it was envisaged that each district would have a separate ADO
to supervise all extension activities. As this system required more staff than
already employed, the project provided for the incremental recruitment of 500
PLAAs, 10 SMSs and 4 ADOs, in addition to 2 Training Officers (TO) and 1 Project
Coordinator. As foreseen at appraisal, staff recruitment was to follow a phased
implementation approach whereby two districts would be covered in the first year
and three in each of the second and third year.   However, some delays were
encountered in the recruitment of ADOs and TOs. Following the reorganization of
the Panchayat structure in 1982/83, the number of Panchayats increased from 500
to 575. Accordingly, the number of PLAAs needed increasing to 575. Besides,
'nstead of maintaining a JT/PLAAs ratio of 1:4 and a JT/JTAs ratio of 1:3,
.overnment substantially increased the JT and JTA numbers over and beyond the
numbers recommended in the SAR, to the level of the respective ratios of about
1:3 and 1:2.5 as follows:

The excessive loading of the system with middle-level technical staff has added
substantially to the cost of the extension service.  As the number of SMSs
remained unchanged, the SMS to JTs/JTAs ratio deteriorated from the proposed 1:10
to the actual level of 1:1.6, imposing a workload extremely difficult to cope
with, even for a well-trained and motivated SMS.
20.       There was also a high turnover of ADO, SMS and JT staff because of the
temporary nature of their posts. Although assurances were obtained from HMGN at
A/ At appraisal, the cadre of village-level extension workers consisted of
progressive farmers and retired servicemen who were employed on a part-time
basis as agricultural assistants and received minimal training.

negotiations to create permanent positions for all incremental professional
staff, Government did not adhere to this covenant.   Several IDA supervision
missions raised and discussed this issue, but to no avail (para 49). By the end
of the extended project period, only half of the incremental staff in the officer
category had been made permanent. This resulted in a number of vacant positions
as project staff took permanent positions elsewhere, with a disruptitng effect on
project activities and a loss of valuable experience for the project. It should,
however, be mentioned that the last IDA supervision mission urged cautioni in
converting all JT and JTA positions into permanent positions, due to the
excessive numbers employed, and suggested a review of the extension organization
to determine exact staff numbers required in these cadres,
21.       Staff quality was to be enhanced through local and international
training and funds for the latter were made available under a UNDP technical
assistance project (para 36). As planned, local training consisted mostly of
pre-service and in-service training courses for PLAA, JTA and JT staff,
supplemented by continuous fortnightly training of these staff by SMSs. Local
training was undertaken close to schedule. However, there were wide fluctuations
in quality, especially of the bi-monthly workshops. Hardly any training sessions
were complemented with practical field work.   Many of the deficiencies  in
training could be attributed to the low educational standard of most SMSs, who
at best have a B.Sc. degree, lack specialized technical know-how and a clear
perception of farmers, problems, and are poorly motivated. As the SMSs are of
critical importance as resource persons for the PLAAs and JTs/JTAs, and also
serve as linkage between extension and rwsearch, more attention should have been
given to selecting higher calibre staff.
22.       As a result, the quality of work performed by the JT/JTA staff left
much to be desired throughout the project period.  The capacity of JTs/JTAs to
analyze farmers' problems and work out solutions was very limited, as were their
interest and motivation to carry out effective agricultural extension. Their
educational background was mostly inadequate (generally only high school diploma
followed by a one-year course in agriculture), and nearly all of them have an
urban background which has hampered their acceptance by the farming community.
Frequent staff turnover of SMSs, JTs and JTAs, due to inadequate job security,
housing problems (para 20) and better job opportunities elsewhere, further
reduced staff effectiveness,
23.       To complement local training, funds were also provided under the UNDF
technical assistance project for training of research and extension staff abroad
(mainly in India) amounting to 386 staff-months. Subsequent to a review of the
SAR training proposal, starting in 1983/84, a total of 42 staff participated in
training courses (approximately 113 staff-months) held mainly in the Philippines,
UK and USA, utilizing the entire training allocation (para 36). Due to the late
start of this training program, the project lost the benefit of trained staff for
a period of two to three years. It was reported that at Credit closing, many of
the staff who had been trained under the project but placed on a temporary basis,
had resigned and found permanent staff positions elsewhere.
24.       Contrary to the generally unsatisfactory performance of the JTs/JTAs,
the performance of PLAAs was impressive.   Being farmers themselves,  their
understanding of farmers, problems was much better, and as educated members of
the community (some have a high school diploma), their advice was readily
accepted.   As the result of the SAR proposal to recruit them with specified
responsibilities and on an intensive work plan and providing them with small



8
regular allowances, the PLAAs themselves and the farming community perceive them
as underpaid civil servants.   The Government, however, considers PLAAs (now
renamed Agricultural Assistant [AAs]) as volunteer workers; they are treated like
staff, as specified in the appraisal report. This conflicting perception has
recently led to a strike of the PLAAs, demanding recognition as civil servants
and entitlement to government salary and related benefits. HMGN is presently
working to resolve this issue. Finally, the selection of a contact farmer (CF)
as the main mechanism to influence neighbors was not satisfactory.   Too few
farmers were contacted, little attempt was made to encourage active and
purposeful participation of the farming community in the identification and
prioritizing of their perceived problems, and no attempt was made to adopt the
technical recommendations to reference groups with similar resources, concerns
and problems except during the last two years (para 45).   Mass media were
generally ineffective.  Radio has the greatest potential but is limited to a
single station covering the whole country. Written materials were also under-
utilized.
25.       To ensure that extension staff make regular and frequent visits to
farmers' fields, it was found necessary for them to live in or near their working
areas. The project therefore made provision for housing for 125 JTAs, 35 JTs,
5 AADOs, 5 ADOs, 16 SMSs and 24 support staff. In addition, eight sub-centers
were to be constructed, each with a small office for JTs and a training hall, and
two Regional Training Centers (RTC) were to be upgraded. The housing and sub-
center construction program was expected to be completed in Project Year 4 (1985)
and civil works for the two RTCs in 1984. By end-1985, only 36 staff houses were
in various stages of completion (between 10 and 80%) as against 210 planned, and
only tenders had been floated for the balance, none of the sub-centers were
constructed and progress on both RTC was negligible. Progress of construction
remained slow throughout the implementation period, although by Credit closing
all houses, with the exception of JT. houses, were completed.  Of the latter,
only 38 of the 125 units planned were built, as HMGN issued guidelines in 1985/86
halting JTA housing, in order to reduce construction and further maintenance
costs. Of eight sub-centers planned, only one was built and limited improvements
(fencing and water supply) were made to the two Regional Training Centers (RTCs)
(Part IV, para 3).   The main reason for slow progress was delays in the
sanctioning of budgets, and in tendering and approving contracts; during the last
two years, difficulties in obtaining building materials were aggravated by rapid
cost escalations (para 14).
26.       To allow the mobility of extension staff,  the project had made
provision for the procurement of 59 motorcycles for JT and SMS staff, four 4-WD
vehicles for district-level use and funds for loans to JTAs for the purchase of
bicycles, plus a small monthly allowance to ensure their maintenance.   The
procurement of vehicles was completed as scheduled by end-1985. It is however
noted that in spite of the increase of JT staff from 43 to 74 (para 19), no
corresponding adjustment in motorcycle numbers was made. Furthermore, many of
the project vehicles were often used by other agencies for non-project activities
for extended periods, and maintenance of vehicles was mostly poor due to lack of
adequate budget allocations.   In some locations, JTAs found it difficult to
obtain a loan for bicycles. However, all loans were disbursed. In 1989, the
monthly allowances for bicycle maintenance were suspended but resumed later in
that year with an increase from Rs2O to Rs3O. The above factors affected staff
mobility and thus had a negative influence on the effectiveness of the extension
service as a whole.

27.       Strengtheniny  of  research.        The  project  also  included  the
strengthening of applied and adaptive research to provide practical answers to
farmers' problems. Towards that end, research efforts were to be decentralized
by designating four of the then existing research stations (Nepalganj, Bhairawa,
Parwanipur and Tarahara) as RRSs to develop and upgrade them. In addition, two
sub-stations were to be developed in Sarlahi and Hardinath to ensure coverage of
all major agro-climatic variations found in the eight new project districts and
the six on-going extension districts. Project support focused on the provision
of incremental staff, improvement of staff quality and research facilities,
housing and transport.
28.       Professional  staff strength  (Classes  I,  II and III)  was  to be
increased from 76 to 86 and four new positions of Regional Outreach Officers
(ROOs) were t._ be filled with Class II staff. Although Classes I and II
(including ROO staff) were recruited as planned, only three incremental Class III
staff (out of eight) were in place at project closing. One office-cum-laboratory
and two field laboratories, as well as three rest houses and a number of
auxiliary facilities, were to be constructed together with 106 staff houses. As
in  the  case  of  civil  works  for  the  extension  service  (para  25),  the
implementation of the construction program suffered from serious delays.   By
1986, only 87 of the 106 staff houses were constructed, although all facilities
were completed (Part IV, para 4) by Credit closing date. Most of the civil works
were found to be of rather poor quality and suffering from a lack of proper
maintenance (para 25). All vehicles consisting of six jeeps, two pick-up vans
and f:ve motorcycles were procured as scheduled, but their frequent misuse
affected research work (para 26).
29.       Research  was  to  concentrate  on  developing  improved  cultivation
practices, varietal improvement, pest and disease control, testing and
modification of farming implements and, in general, on improving and adjusting
the cropping and farming systems to the agro-climatic conditions and requirements
of farmers.   The research program concentrated on varieties and fertilizer
application, and to a limited extent, on cropping patterns and pest and disease
control, neglecting tillage and water management practices. During the project
period, emphasis was on irrigated agriculture and mainly on grain crops, while
oilseeds and legumes were given inadequate attention. Although greater emphasis
was given to outreach programs or on-farm adaptive trials towards the end of the
project period, the immediate needs and the financial constraints of subsistence
farmers were not given adequate consideration in the design of these trials.
Research also concentrated on the low-lying or flat areas of the Terai and gave
only limited attention to the special needs of the higher elevation areas. For
these reasons, most of the technology generated has not been widely adopted by
farmers. Only recently, has there been a move towards rainfed farming research,
and ways by which a cropping system approach could be developed is now being
explored by the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC).
30.       The linkage between extension and research was formalized under the
project through the establishment of a Central Technical Committee (CTC), with
the Deputy Director-General (DDG) Research as its Secretary. The committee was
to  review  research  and  field  trials  and  future  research  and  extension
recommendations made by District Technical Committees (DTCs) and at Regional
Workshops.  The DTCs, chaired by the ADO of each district, were to review and
suggest recommendations for agricultural practices, including the identification
of research priorities and adaptive trial needs, for discussion at the Regional



10
Workshops. These workshops were to be organized at each of the RRSs to discuss
the implications of recommendations of DTCs on extension activities, adaptive
trials and research priorities, and finalize them after ccnsidering research data
and field experience. The commitcee meetings and workshops/training sessions
were to be organized twice a year, the latter well in advance of the summer and
winter crop seasons.
31.       Generally, the linkage mechanism functioned adequately.  However, the
quality of training was mostly unsatisfactory as the workshops were used mainly
for discussions on results of on-farm adaptive trials and farmers, problems,
rather than training per se. Also, the research staff conducting these workshops
were generally inexperienced, lacked the specialized technical know-how, and had
difficulty in imparting new technology and stimulating meaningful discussions.
The impact points presented at the meeting were too numerous and too general to
be applicable to the specific location of the respective SMSs. Furthermore, pre-
season workshops/training sessions for PLAAs/JTs/JTAs were sometimes delayed,
reducing their relevance as they lagged behind farmers, planting schedules.
32.       StrenathenLng of the ftricultura. Engineeging Division (AED). The AED
had the responsibility for construction of departmental buildings. In order to
strengthen the AED, the SAR provided for an incremental Assistant Engineer at
headquarters and ar. Overseer for each project district, as well as funds for
purchase of equipment and fees for consulting architects. Due to the substantial
workload, an additional Agricultural Engineer and one more Assistant Agricultural
Engineer were approved. Some delays occurred in the recruitment of overseers,
but the other positions were filled as planned. Despite its strengthening, AED
did not succeed in coping adequately with the workload in a timely manner.
Partly due to the inadequacy of preparation work by AED, the construction program
suffered from serious delays, and lack of supervision of contractors affected
construction  quality.    The  AED  was  furthermore  entrusted  to  carry  out
agricultural machinery research and de-7elopment. However, due to lack of
specialist know-how and the heavy burden of the construction program, no efforts
were made to test and improve farming implements. Since the SAR had specified
this as an important activity, the required specialists should have been made
available.
33.       Fertilizer import and mtorage.  Funds for the purchase of 22,100 tons
of fertilizer, equivalent to the total e-rpected consumption by farmers in the
project districts for the first two years, were made available by the project.
The total amount of 7ertiliwers purchased with project funds exceeded SAR target:
~~~... . ,       .  -.-!*:  198/8            29-8---         196/8             Ttarlrl_t

34.       To ensure timely availability within easy reach of the farmers, the
project provided for the construction of twenty Panchayat-level warehouses with
a capacity of 50 tons each, to be managed by the Sajha (cooperative movement).
Initially, these stores were not buil; due to delays in decisions on location and
appropriate capacity, as well as budget allocation. Subsequently, stores were



11
built in most locations under other aid programs and the component was deleted
from the project.
35.       The total amount of fertilizer used in the project districts increased
from 24,500 tons in 1984/85Z' to 41,150 tons in 1989/90.  This fertilizer was
used almost exclusively on irrigated paddy and wheat, with some on maize,
Complexal3/ was the most commonly used fertilizer (for basal application)
followed by urea (for top-dressing), Fertilizer application was well below the
rate recommended by DOA even for paddy, wheat and maize. This was due mainly to
the unavailability and/or untimely supply of fertilizers, as well as the
financial constraints of farmers, most of whom were at subsistence level.  A
further constraint was the unavailability of good quality seeds. AIC, the sole
agency for provision of imr A d and high-yielding varieties of cereal seeds, was
unable to provide more than about 2% of potential demand and farmers had to
depend on exchange with neighbors. Many of the existing crop varieties are old
and degenerating. Masuli, which was released long ago, remains the most popular
paddy variety, although the occurrence of paddy blast disease is widespread.
36.       Technical assistance.   In conjunction with the project, UNDP had
provided a technical assistance grant of US$0.65 million (which was increased to
US$0.82 million) to meet the cost of training project staff outside Nepal and
short-term  consultancies  designed  to improve  project  implementation.    As
indicated (para 23) the external training program was revised and a total of 42
staff went abroad, fully utilizing the fellowship allocation. Almost all of tne
42 staff-months of consultancies, covering extension and research, and especially
extension management and extension communications were utilized. Tn support of
the latter activity, it was however necessary to recruit a local communication
expert for three months, mainly to translate and adjust the messages to local
conditions. The farm development consultancy was not found to be very useful as
the consultant was not familiar with, and could not adjust to, local farming
practices.
37.       Both consultancies providing management advice to AIC (six months) and
to ADBN (five months) were not utilized as such assistance was provided under
other projects.
38.       Monitoring and evaluation.   Project monitoring concentrated on the
gathering. of quantitative information on project inputs and activities but
qualitative monitoring of project objectives remained extremely weak. Project
evaluation, which was entrusted to APROSC suffered from serious shortcomings.
Although APROSC carried out a number of Household Baseline Studies in the various
project districts, no follow-up studies were undertaken to assess the project's
effect and impact.   Other studies (Part IV, para 6) were found to be rather
academic and were not used for project management purposes.
39.       Economic rate of return (ERRT.  In line with the approach in other
projects aiming to improve agricultural extension and research services, no ERR

calculation was carried out at appraisal. The SAR, however, stated that the
project would be able to generate a 50X rate of return, if by 1988, yields of
foodgrains would increase by only 12 kg/ha. Even considering the limitations of
the available agricultural statistics, it can be assumed that at least this
irterease has been achieved.
40.       Proiect impact.  The project has resulted in structural changes in the
reorganization and management of extension. However, difficulty was experienced
in maintaining a single line of command (para 10) as the function and
responsibilities of departmental staff were not clearly defined and the
administrative command not clearly separate from line of technical communication.
As staff strength of the conventional agricultural extension system previously
operating in the districts was estimated to be insufficient to meet the needs of
the reorganized extension system, staff and extension agent numbers were
considerably increased. The greatest increase was in AAs. As AA allowances are
relatively low, the increase in AA numbers did not have serious budgetary
implications. AAs' performance was impressive (para 24), but the payment of a
fixed allowance to AAs has created a political problem. AAs have petitioned HMGN
for consideration as government civil servants. A decision is pending although
there is indication that HMGN would be reluctant to accept this demand as this
would substantially increase the civil service nu.nbers resulting in a
considerable budgetary burden. Nevertheless, there is also indication that HMGN
would significantly increase AA allowances. This will have serious budgetary
implications unless cost-sharing arrangements with beneficiary groups are
developed simultaneously and progressively as recommended by the last two IDA
supervision missions. Cost-sharing arrangements should provide for an incentive
structure for AAs and ensure AAs' responsiveness to the client group. Finally,
the high numbers of JTs and JTAs place also a heavy strain on the budget
(para 19).
41.       A major  objective  of the  project  was  to provide  farmers  with
recomm-dations best suited to their specific conditions and problems.  This did
not ma  rialize.  Researchers and extension agents did not secure the active
participation of farmers in the identification and prioritizing of their
perceived problems. As a result, technical recommendations were too general or
input-dependent. Input-dependent technology was uneconomical for subsistence
farmers or those with unfavorable tenancy agreements.
42.       Another objective of the project was to improve the quality of staff
through regular training.   Although a system of training was established as
recommended, the quality of training was poor and adversely affected the quality
of extension advice (para 21). Recommended extension/research linkage is also
in place.  However, improvements are required to increase the pressure on the
traditional research body to adjust its interests and priorities to become more
responsive to the requirements of major farming systems.
43.       Agricultural production has substantially increased in the project
area. This, however, can be attributed only in part to improved extension and
research activities as increases in irrigated areas, improved availability of
fertilizer and credit have played a major role in improving production and
productivity (para 35).



13
Proiect Sustainabilitv
44.       Effective from project closing, all activities initiated by the AERP
and the HFPP (para 94) were brought under the umbrella of the on-going
Agricultural Extension II Project [AEPII] (Cr. 1570-NEP). This step has provided
uniformity and continuity.  The research and extension system, however, needs
considerable improvement and further adaptation, including cost saving measures
to make it sustainable and replicable (paras 15, 21, 22, 24, 29, 40, 41). Under
the reformulated AEPII, changes that are likely to improve sustainability of AERP
and HFPP are progressively introduced: (i) greater mobilization of the farm
community's use of sociological principles in designing and managing the
extension program; (ii) introduction of the village-level situational analysis
to gain information on the farm, farm household,  and infrastructure of the
community, and to ensure that any forward plan  ng relating to research and/or
extension is based on farmer information; (c) introduction of the problem census
and problem-solving technique4l in the extension system to develop problem/need-
oriented extension activities; and (d) cost sharing arrangements with beneficiary
groups to provide an incentive structure for AAs and ensure AAs' responsiveness
to the client group.
IDA's Performance
45.       IDA's performance during the early stage of the project cycle and the
appraisal process was satisfactory. There were, however, some weaknesses in the
project design related to (a) the time frame needed to fully implement
institutional changes; (b) Government's implemention capacity, financial
resources and availability of manpower; and (c) the time frame needed to develop
improved  cultivation  practices  (para  6).    IDA's  performance  during  the
supervision phase was mixed. After appraisal, a mission was launched to assist
with project start-up and a total of 17 supervision missions were fielded with
a considerable  degree  of  staff  continuity.    However,  missions  concerned
themselves mainly with disbursement, construction of physical infrastructure and
staffing disregarding the analysis of project output, effects and impact.
Although there were indications during the project period that adjustments would
be required to improve the effectiveness of the extension system and to focus it
more on farmers' needs, it was only during the last two years of the project that
an attempt was made to assess its impact on production. Some suggestions for
improvement were made, especially on the ise of a farmer group rather than a CF
as the focal point of extension and of the problem census technique for securing
the active participation of farmers in the identification and prioritizing of
their perceived problems and needs.   A detailed impact study covering all
districts in which the reoriented extension service had been operational should
have been carried out and a remedial action plan formulated and implemented.
46.       In short, the main lessons learned from project implementation that
may be relevanz to other IDA-financed projects are:
4/   Extension method which is both farmer- and problem-centered.   It is a
dynamic educational process aimed at changing the values and behavior of
farmers or a village community, so that they can successfully adapt to
continually changing situations.



14
(a)  At  project  preparation  and  appraisal,  both  the  technical  and
administrative lines of command have to be clearly identified and the
institutional responsibilities delineated (para 10).
(b)  During the first five years of an extension project little more can
be achieved than the establishment of an administrative framework for
extension and the provision of an information service focused on
existing technology (paras 6, 18, 20, 21, 29). Experience has also
shown that farmers need a more completely trained and equipped
extension service capable of addressing all aspects of the farm
community (paras 22, 24).
(c)  Constraints  in  the  form  of  availability  of  trained  staff,
administrative and budgetary problems have to be thoroughly assessed
and addressed at appraisal (paras 22, 25, 40).
(d)  It is desirable  to make applied/adaptive research and extension
systems more responsive to their beneficiaries (paras 15, 41).  To
achieve this objective, applied/adaptive research and extension
systems should include (i) greater mobilization of the farm community
use of sociological principles in designing and managing the
research/extension program; (ii) introduction of the village-level
situational analysis to gain information on the farm, farm household,
and infrastructure of the community, and to ensure that any forward
planning relating to research and/or extension is based on farmer
information; (iii) introduction of the farmer group rather than a CF
as the focal point of extension; and (iv) introduction of the problem
census and problem-solving technique in the extension system to
develop problem/need extension recommendations and activities (paras
29, 45).
(e)  It is quite unrealistic to believe that a low agent/farmer ratio is
a sine qua non condition for ar. improved extension service (para 19).
Extension agents should have professional competence to understand the
farming system as a whole. This argues for fewer but better qualified
and trained agricultural extension agents (paras 21, 22) and for
agents who have actual farming experience as well as a fair level of
.academic training (para 24).  There are other alternatives, such as
modern  communication  media  and  cost-sharing  arrangements  with
beneficiaries,  which provide cost-effective complementarities  for
accomplishing extension objectives without the long-run budgetary
implications of large numbers of government employees (para 40).
(f)  Supervision missions  should give more emphasis  to assessing the
achievement of project objectives so that early corrective measures
can be taken; a comprehensive mid-term review should have been carried
out (para 45).
Borrower' s Performance
47.       Generally, the Borrower's performance during project implementation
was adequate; however, during the first five years of the project, audited
accounts were not submitted in a timely manner and, more importantly, the
Borrower failed to establish permanent staffing positions for DOA staff,
resulting in high turnover and poor motivation (para 20).  The Borrower also



15
substantially increased the numbers of middle-level technical staff which has
added substantially to the cost of the extension service without increasing its
performance (para 19). In addition, staff recruitment was often delayed and the
construction of physical facilities fell much behind schedule (paras 25, 28).
48.       Other main lessons o  experience for the Borrower are:
(a)  Staff selection for overseas training programs has to be initiated at
an early stage, to ensure maximum benefits to the project, and staff
trained should be given high priority in the allocation of permanent
posts to ensure their continuity with the project (para 23).
(b)  There is a need to simplify MOA contracting procedures for procurement
and construction, to allow timely execution and to avoid cost over-
runs (para 25).
(c)  In order to avoid delays in project implementation, it is necessary
to streamline budget sanctioning and to allocate the full amount
required to complete each task (paras 25, 26).
(d)  Project management should pay particular attentian to the evaluation
of project impact, including the establishment of a reliable field
data collection system (para 38).
Borrower/IDA Relationshlp under the Prolect
49.       The relationship between the Borrower and MDA was basically sound
throughout project implementation, although the Borrower did not always adopt the
recommendations made by supervision missions  (para 20).   At the Borrower's
request, the project period was extended thrice by one year each time, and IDA
swiftly authorized these extensions thus allowing uninterrupted disbursement.
Consulting Services
50.       Consulting services were provided under a technical assistant grant
from UNDP, as described in paras 23, 36 and 37. The performance of building
contractors was mixed and numerous disputes with contractors occurred over poor
quality resulting in delayed hand-over of buildings; some contracts had to be
terminated half-way through, causing the necessity of identifying substitute
contractors consequently leading to delays and additional cost.   Often the
quality of construction and/or finishing was poor, partly due to lack of
supervision (para 32) and partly due to a cost squeeze as a result of price
escalations between the initial tendering for the works and the actual start of
construction. The suppliers of fertilizer and vehicles performed well.

51.       The Credit Agreement was adequate and appropriate  for achieving
project objectives in key organizational and financial areas. The SAR provided
a useful framework for IDA and the Borrower to monitor the project implementation
process. However, it suffered some flaws regarding project design (para 6) and
project risks (para 13). In addition, the three extensions and the depreciation
of the Rupee reduced the SAR's usefulness in providing financial guidance.
During extension, the project should have been re-phased, and implementation
targets and project costs revised. The UNDP project document, which covered the



16
provision of the technical assistance grant for overseas training and consulting
services,   s well prepared to serve its purposes.
52.       Although the Project Office maintained project implementaticn records
in a satisfactory way, not all data relevant to the preparation of the PCR,
especially  data  on project  costs  and  impact  on  agricultural  production/
productivity, were readily available. This was mainly due to the fact that the
data were not collected and processed to serve as a basis for a broad ex-post
evaluation, but rather for short-term monitoring of project results against
targets.

Proiect Oblectives and Description
53.       Objectives.  The main objective of the project was to increase food
production in four Western Hill districts of Gorkha, Lamjung, Syanja and Tanahu.
Since project area farmers did not have the means to invest in costly
agricultural inputs, the project's focus was on providing these farmers with
appropriate advice and increased support services for undertaking low-cost
farming practices, selected to have an immediate impact on food production,
increased availability of livestock feed and better animal health.
54.       Components.  The project included the following components:
(a) construction of 20 Agricultural Services Centers (ASCs);
(b)  improvement of agricultural extension and livestock services through
provision of staff;
(c)  strengthening of the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN),
Agricultural Inputs Corporation (AIC) and cooperatives by providing
training for staff;
(d)  provision of funds for the purchase of 3,200 tons of fertilizer;
(e)  improvemert to marketing, through introduction of regular market days;
(f)  development and improvement of irrigation service to about 3,000 ha
of land;



17
(g)  upgrading of about 70 km of trails and construction of about 3-
bridges   to   facilitate  movement  of  agricultural   inruts  at,;'
communication in the project area; and
(h)  establishment  of  a monitoring  and evaluation  (M&E)  program  ai.
provision of technical assistance.
55.       The project was to be implemented over a period of five years, at
total cost of US$9.7 million.   The major components, as percentage of total
project cost, were:  development of minor irrigation (28%); development of ASCs
(13%); purchase of fertilizer (12%);  incremental agricultural and livestock
extension staff (9%); technical assistance (7%); construction of trails and
bridges (5%); and physical and price contingencies (25%). Project management was
vested in the then Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MFA) which was renamed
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) during the project implementation period. Overall
responsibility for project implementation rested with the Regional Director of
Agriculture (RDA), Western Region, assisted by a Project Coordinator (PC) anid
four Agricultural Development Officers (ADOs), one in each project district.
Proiect Design and Organization
56.       Design.  Two successive FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme (FAO/CP)
missions assisted HMGN during 1979 in project identification and preparation.
The project was appraised by an IDA appraisal mission in May/June 1980 (Part IV
page 11). Overall, the project was well designed. In view of the shortage os
arable land, the project's focus on yield increases through improvement of
services, infrastructure and supplies,  was appropriate and fitted with the
Government's development strategy. The use of ASCs as focal points for promoting
development activities in remote rural areas had shown positive results under the
first IDA-financed Rural Development Project (Cr. 617-NEP) and, therefore, the
ASC concept was adopted for the HFPP project area.
57.       It was however over-optimistic to assume that a newly restructuretI
extension service be in position and have an immediate and strong impact on
farming practices, especially in view of the then limited availability of
improved extension recommendations. Considering the difficult terrain of the
project area and slow bureaucratic procedures, the original project period of
five years proved insufficient for the implementation of the rather complex
construction program and the required systemic changes to occur. Finally, the
project did not provide for the use of media and other modern communications
methods as supplements to the regular field contact. This was a major flaw ir
the design of the project given the limited access to rural areas and thE
scattered settlement pattern in the Hills (paras 79, 80).
58.       Organization.   Overall responsibility for project management wa:
vested in the MFA, with the RDA, Western Region overseeing day-to-da-
implementation. Regional and District Coordinating Committees were to coordinate
project activities undertaken by the various agencies. A full-time PC was to b-
appointed, reporting directly to the RDA. In order to reorganize the extensioi
service following the T&V system of agricultural extension (para 18), the projeci
financed the provision of incremental agricultural and livestock extension staff
and assurances were obtained from HMGN at negotiations, to create permanent
positions for all additional professional staff to ensure proper incentives ane



18
staff continuity. Generally, the organizational arrangements were adhered to.
Unfortunately,   the  Coordinatin;  Committees  concentrated  mainly  on  the
implementation of quantitative targets rather than achievement of the overall
project objective. Weak project coordination during the first two years, and the
failure of Government to establish most of the required staffing positions on a
permanent basis, adversely influenced project implementation (para 62).
Proiect Implementation
59.       Critical variances in proiect implementation.  Proje'zt implementation
was initially phased over a five-year period (January 1982 1:o December 1986).
Total project costs were estimated at US$9.7 million (NRsllE.5 million) and an
IDA Credit of US$8.0 million (SDR 6.3 million) was made available, together with
a UNDP technical assistance grant of US$0.85 million for staff training and
consultancy services.   Project implementation, however, did not progress as
anticipated and the Credit closing date of July 15, 1987 had to be extended
thrice by one year each time, to July 15, 1990. At the time of Credit closing,
the balance of US$2.4 million (SDR 1.8 million), mainly due to a considerable
depreciation of the Nepalese rupee against the U.S. dollar, was canceled. The
undisbursed balance was canceled in August 1990.
60.       Initially disbursements were more or less in line with SAR estimates
due mainly to the bulk purchase of fertilizer for the first two years.
Subsequently, slippages in starting construction of ASCs, trails and bridges and
in maintaining momentum in implementing the minor irrigation schemes resulted in
disbursements falling behind schedule and reaching only 36% (in US$ terms -Part
IV, page 1.1) at the end of the original Credit closing date. The slow build-up
of ASCs as operational bases for the extension service affected, inter alia, the
effectiveness of the service and also hampered input supply and credit
availability.
61.       The linkage between extension and research was also weak throughout
most of the project period and technical recommendations tailored to the needs
of small farmers in the project area were scarce.   The situation partially
improved in 1987, when research support arrangements between the Lumle research
station and the extension service were formalized in a Memorandum of
Understanding.   Government's  failure to establish permanent positions  for
incremental extension staff led to high staff turnover, resulting in lower
quality service. Throughout implementation, the project suffered from slow and
often inadequate release of budgetary allocations.
62.       The project was designed to cover 194 Panchayats in the four Hill
districts (partial coverage).   Following the reorganization of the Panchayat
system in 1982, the number of Panchayats in the four project districts increased;
it was then decided to extend the reoriented extension service to all Panchayats.
As a result, the project covered a total of 248 Panchayats.
63.       At the time of preparation,  both crop production and livestock
development/animal health were the respunsibility of the Department of
Agriculture of MFA.  Following the Ministry's reorganization in 1979/80, two
separate departments, the Department of Agriculture (DOA) and the Department of
Livestock Development and Animal Health (DOLD/AH), were created. Throughout the
project period, collaboration between the two Departments remained weak and
DOLD/AH activities were carried out generally by-passing the Project



19
Coordinator's Office.   In fact, all activities of the project's  livestock
component were discontinued in FY87.
64.       Project risks.   The SAR correctly identified the availability and
willingniess of government staff to live and work at the ASCs and visit farmers
in the nearby areas as a major project risk.   The project was designed to
minimize this risk by providing housing and facilitating communications. Delays
in the construction of ASCs and bridges, however, negatively affected staff
performance and even by the end of the extended project period only 16 ASCs (out
of 20) were completed and only 5 bridges out of the revised target of 14 (instead
of 34) were built.
65.       Unforeseen  factors  affecting proiect  implementation.    Uncertain
rainfall and weather patterns and the occurrence of hail and seasonal frosts were
also identified in the SAR as project risks.  However, the unprecedented and
severe hailstorms of 1985 and 1986, and the extensive rainfall of 1987, in
particular, adversely affected the paddy and late wheat crops and damaged some
of the newly-established irrigation schemes and trails. The Indo-Nepal trade and
transit crisis also severely constrained the availability of construction
materials and other supplies and accounted for escalation of their costs which
together contributed to the delay in construction work of ASCs and bridges during
the last project years (paras 71, 89).
Project Results
66.       The overall project result was not satisfactory.  Structural changes
in the organization and management of extension services in the districts covered
occurred, but the promotion of low-cost, labor-intensive agricultural practices
failed (para 77). General technical recommendations were inappropriate because
of the multitude of agro-ecological zones that characterize HFPP districts. The
construction of ASCs (para 70) and bridges (para 89) lagged behind. Only the
development of irrigation schemes and the trail programs were satisfactory
(paras 86, 89).
67.       Crop production.  The principal benefit envisaged by the project was
increased food production to be achieved by modest increases in cropped areas,
but mostly by yield increases in existing areas. Unfortunately, no system was
in place to monitor the impact of the project on productivity and production.
A review of data, published by various agencies including the Central Bureau of
Statistics,  the Resource Mapping Project of the Survey Department and the
Agricultural Statistics Division (ASD) of the Department of Food and Agricultural
Marketing Services (DFAMS), shows considerable differences. However, all reports
indicate increased trends for the main foodgrains.   Due to the lack of an
alternative, data on cropped area, yield and production over the last decade
given in this report were derived from those published by ASD, which are also
used by Government.
68.       According to ASD estimates,  incremental production of all crops,
except oilseeds, has apparently far exceeded appraisal estimates as summarized
below:



20
I       Inc~~lrewenital Production
Crops                SAR (1979)         PCR (1990)
('000 tons)
Paddy                  11.6              62.7
Maize                   9.0              91.5
Millet                  0.3               36.1
Wheat                   2.3              10.4
Potato                  9.2               10.2
Putees                  0.7               2.3
Oilseeds                0.5               0.4
These increments are due mainly to increases in cropped area and cropping
intensity, mostly as a result of the considerable expansion of the area under
irrigation from less than 35,000 ha in 1980 to over 128,000 ha in 1990. These
benefits, however, cannot be attributed to the project, as only 3,200 ha were
brought under irrigation by HFPP (para 84).
69.       Crop yields, however, have not increased appreciably under the project
and, except for potatoes and pulses, are lower than appraisal estimates:

Crops               SAR (1979)       PCR (1990)

Oijleds                1.0              0.6  
This situation is due to numerous factors such as unavailability and untimely
supply of physical inputs (seeds and fertilizer) and inaccessibility of
production credit (para 81), an expanded but still inadequate extension service
(paras 73, 76, 80), and the unavailability of relevant low-cost technologies that
could be readily adopted by subsistence farmers (paras 79, 80).
70.       Strengthening of institutions. The agricultural support services were
to be brought closer to farmers by the construction of 20 ASCs (6 in Project Year
1, 6 in PY2 and 8 in PY3). Each ASC was to serve four to six village Panchayats
and cover an area of about 200 km2 and an average population of some 7,000 farm
families. Each center, constructed by the Agricultural Engineering Division of
DOA with local materials and of simple design, comprised offices and housing for
staff of the Agricultural, Livestock Development Departments, ADBN and Sajhas.
In addition, a veterinary dispensary, a 20-ton warehouse and a multi-purpose
building to be used for support staff training and other group activities were
to be included. The warehouse was to provide storage and serve as a sales point



21
for agricultural inputs and simple agricultural implements and as temporary
storage for surplus grains purchased by the National Food Cooperation or Sajhas.
71.       The construction of ASCs lagged much behind schedule due initially to
problems in land acquisition and the tendering of contracts, and subsequently to
difficulties in obtaining building materials (para.65).   By the end of the
originally planned three-year construction period (1985), work on the ASCs had
not even started. By mid-1986, twelve units were under construction and
gradually completed over the following two years. At Credit closing (July 1990),
16 ASCs were completed and 4 others were still under construction. Completion
of outstanding works will be carried out under the restructured AEPII Project
(Cr.  1570-NEP).   Delays in the construction program adversely affected the
performance of extension services, due to difficulties in posting JTs and JTAs
in the area, and in availability of inputs and credit services.
72.       Each ASC was to be staffed with a JT (as officer-in-charge), three
JTAs responsible for agricultural and livestock extension, and a representative
of ADBN, and the local Sajha. Ten AAs responsible for agriculture and five AAs
for livestock extension activities were to work in the area served by each ASC.
In order to provide adequate staff strength following the above pattern, a total
of 20 JTs, 60 JTAs, 200 AAs (agriculture) and 100 AAs (livestock) were required
in addition to 20 staff each  for ADBN and Sajha.    Furthermore,  project
implementation required a Project Coordinator (PC), two program officers (PO),
a monitoring and evaluation officer and support staff, as well as one
Agricultural Development Officer (ADO) and one Assistant Agricultural Development
Officer (AADO) for each of the four project districts.
73.       Existing staff strength, under the conventional system in place at
appraisal, was insufficient for the project requirements, and at district level,
staff for agricultural and livestock services had to be increased to a total of
400, as shown in the following table:
Staff       SAR              Actual (1990)
ADO           4                     4
AADO          4                     4
SMS          12                    10
JT           20                    14
JTA          60                    21
AA          300                   243
TOTAL       400                   296
Although by FY 1985/86, none of the ASCs were completed, staff recruitment had
made good progress.  All JTs in charge of an ASC area, 56 JTAs (agriculture) and
19 JTAs (livestock), as well as 204 AAs (agriculture) and 100 AAs (livestock) had
been recruited. Also, 7 ADBN and 17 Sajha representatives were operating out of
their respective areas. Due to the non-availability of ASC premises, extension



22
staff (JTs and JTAs) had to be housed in rented premises and ADBN and Sajha staff
operated from ADBN sub-branches or Sajha stores near the selected ASC location.
74,       By the end of the extended project period, the 16 completed ASCs were
fully staffed by the extension service. However, most ADBN and Sajha operations
were still not carried out from ASC premises, which undermined the concept of the
centers   It appears that the ASCs have been reduced to serve as an extension
service living compound, which is hardly visited by farmers. The March 1989 IDA
supervision mission recommended that an independent review of the ASCs be
contracted; however, this was not followed up by Government (para 98). At the
end of the extended project period, a total of 296 staff were in place in the
project area. The reduction in staff numbers, vis-a-vis the appraisal estimate,
is due mainly to the exclusion of staff recruited under the livestock component
(para 73).
75.       Due to the separation of the DOLD/AH from DOA, the integration of
livestock extension did not function as anticipated (para 63). Also, the animal
health sub-component made only limited progress. It was anticipated that 120,000
doses each of vaccines and drenches would be administered for immunizing buffalo
and cattle against rinderpest and hemorrhagic septicemia, and antihelmics for
treatment of internal parasites.   Difficulties in posting JTAs to ASCs, and
problems in recruiting and training AAs resulted in a vaccination and drenching
program of only 194,678 treatments in total; project support was discontinued
after the original closing date. The project-funded development of fodders and
forage resources also made limited progress and only 3 tons of fodder seed were
produced against the target of 244 tons. Cooperation between agriculture and
livestock  extension  remained  extremely  weak  throughout  the  project.
Unfortunately, information on the sub-component is rather sketchy, as monitoring
by the PC office and IDA supervision missions was inadequate.
76.       In order to enhance staff quality, the training of extension workers
was an important aspect of the project. A schedule of detailed training programs
was outlined in the SAR. Although most training courses were held as planned,
the impact of training was limited, as knowledge of SMS and research staff was
generally not much superior to that of JT and JTA staff, and most of the meeting
time was spent on discussions of research findings and trial work. As a result,
the extension messages given to AAs were mostly recommendations of a gei:eral
nature and not geared to the specific needs of the farmers.
77.       As indicated in the SAR, the project depended on outside sources for
research guidance. Unfortunately, most of the research findings available were
not always suited to the specific conditions of the Hills and were mostly based
on high input use, without giving adequate consideration to farmers, socio-
economic conditions and input availability; they applied mostly to irrigated
conditions. Due to the prevailing top-down approach to research, efforts to
improve research and outreach programs remained ineffective throughout most of
the project period.
78.       The Lumle Agricultural Center (LAC), a British Government-financed
research and training institution near Pokhara, had developed a research approach
based  on  the  identification  of  farmers'  needs.   Research  findings  were
subsequently translated into extension messages for the special extension service
operated by the center.   This research/extension approach has yielded very
positive results.   In 1987, a Memorandum of Understanding between the RDA
Pokhara, the Coordinator of HFPP and the Director of LAC was signed, ensuring the



23
provision of research findings by LAC to the project and entrusting coordination
of research work in the Hills to LAC.  This was a major step in streamlining
research and in providing a flow of relevant information to the extension service
in the project area. Reportedly, the quality of extension advice in the project
districts has improved. It should, however, be noted that LAC activities are
confined to a relatively small area and that the Center relies heavily on foreign
funding to cover the salaries of 16 expatriate staff and over 177 local staff,
with a salary level two to three times above the corresponding government pay
scale. Similar centers could therefore not be introduced and/or sustained by
HMGN. NARC, which is entrusted to guide and coordinate all agricultural research
at the national level, is exploring ways to reorient agricultural research
following the LAC example, but in a lower-cost sustainable manner.
79.       Throughout  implementation,  a number  of  constraints  limited  the
effectiveness of the extension system.   Besides the lack of facilities,  the
temporary nature of posts resulted in frequent transfers and low motivation of
project ADO, SMS, and JT-level staff.  The stationing of JTs/JTAs at ASCs had
moved them away from the farming community and insufficient travel allowances did
not permit regular supervision of AAs by JTAs. Because of high staff turnover,
new SMSs and JTs often did not receive adequate in-service training and/or missed
pre-season training. Furthermore, inadequate government subsistence and travel
allowances made staff reluctant to participate in local training activities as
they had to finance the shortfall from their own pocket. As a result, less than
20% of the local training funds were utilized (para 90).  The contact farmer
concept was also not satisfactory xpara 24). Finally, the use of mass media was
not developed (para 80).
80.       Nevertheless,  as a result of the project, a reorganized extension
service is now in place in the project area. Although some progress was made,
especially during the last two project years, to improve the effectiveness of the
system through the introduction of reference groups as the focal point of
extension, a lot remains to be done. Especially the performance of SMS, JT and
JTA staff still requires considerable strengthenirng.  Research and trial work
would have to be further improved and give specific consideration to the economic
feasibility of the proposed innovation to gain farmers, acceptance. Finally, the
use of media should be fostered as mobility of extension agents is a serious
constraint in the Hills.
81.       Agricultural inputs and credit.  Provision was made for the purchase
of 3,200 tons of fertilizer, i.e., the entire fertilizer requirements for the
first two years. Procurement was carried out in a timely manner and the entire
amount was distributed by AIC and Sajha in the four project districts.
Distribution, however, suffered from delays in ASC construction as fertilizer had
to be stored in rented warehouses which were not always well located.   Once
fertilizer supplied by the project was exhausted, timely availability of the
right types in sufficient quantities became an additional problem. As a result
of the improved extension service, most farmers are now aware of the benefits of
fertilizer use. Supply of fertilizer has now emerged as a critical bottleneck
to increasing production, and major efforts will be required to adjust supply to
increasing demand, including the privatization of fertilizer retailing.
82.       The project expected to generate an increased demand for credit and
at negotiations HMGN agreed to provide adequate funds to ADBN to make loans to
farmers in the project area.   This covenant was later deleted as ADBN had



24
sufficient funds to finance loan requirements from its own resources.   Crop
production loans in the project area have increased from NRs5.5 million in
1980/81 to NRsl4.2 million in 1989/90. In spite of these substantial increases,
credit availability is still reported to be a constraint due to inaccessibility,
cumbersome loan procedures and the lack of collateral by most tenant farmers.
Overdues increased from less than 40% during that period to 59%. About half of
these high overdues is the result of poor repayment performance by the Sajha, who
had received loans from ADBN for fertilizer procurement for on-lending to member
farmers.   ADBN has therefore withdraw-n credit facilities from many Sajhas,
further constraining the sales of fertilizer and seed.
83.       Marketing  problems,  especially  the  price  slumps  of  grains  at
harvesting, already recognized at appraisal as a constraint to increased
production, led to holding regular market days at ASCs.   In addition, close
collaboration with the National Food Corporation (NFC) was proposed and marketing
studies were to be carried out. However, these proposals were not implemented
because no major marketing problems occurred during the project. Marketing is
now emerging as a critical constraint, in particular affecting wheat, maize and
vegetable production, and therefore should receive more attention in the future.
84.       Irrigation schemes.   Irrigation services were to be improved or
developed for 3,000 ha of land. To carry out the required tasks, provision was
made to strengthen the Farm Irrigation and Water Utilization Unit (FIWU) of MOA,
'fin charge of implementing this component) through the recruitment of a chief
engineer, a water management specialist, four junior engineers, eight overseers
and 32 other support staff, including sub-overseers and a draftsman. Full staff
strength was never achieved. Neither the chief engineer nor the water management
specialist was recruited, and the number of sub-overseers was limited to six
against an appraisal estimate of 16 (Part IV, page 12). Progress was slow and
by mid-1985 irrigation schemes covered only about 1,600 ha. Initially, schemes
were selected and designed by Government, and improvement works were carried out
under contract. Under-staffing and lack of survey equipment led to poor design
and supervision of contractors, resulting in inadequate construction of
irrigation works.
85.       The failure to actively involve beneficiaries in the planning and
construction process resulted in poor site selection, layout and utilization of
schemes; and farmers refused to contribute to maintenance. From 1986/87, all
schemes were undertaken by involving the beneficiaries directly in the design and
construction process and by requiring them to make a small financi al contribution
towards construction cost and the establishment of a fund for minor maintenance.
Besides, as there was no water management specialist, even though recruitment had
been strongly recommended by successive IDA supervision missions, no effective
water distribution or maintenance arrangements were in place.
86.       Notwithstanding  the  above  implementation  difficulties,  the  sub-
component was a success in physical terms since appraisal targets were exceeded:

87.       Particulars about the utilization of the above 'rrigated areas to be
developed under the project, in terms of crop types, areas and yields, croppi-ig
intensity and production impact in the without and with project situation, were
not indicated in the SAR.  Data on these aspects provided below are based on
mission estimates and their findings during iield visits and interviews with
farmers, and on information compiled by the Project Office during mission visits.
88.       Cropping intensity is estimated to have increased from 125% to 228%,
with corresponding changes in the cropping pattern. Under the without project
situation, maize (60%) was the most important crop followed by paddy (19X),
pulses (16%) and oilseeds (5%). With the proj;ct, paddy (37%), along with maize
(36%) and newly introduced wheat (26%), have emerged as important crops with
oilseeds and pulses (2%, relegated as minor crops. However, the introduction of
whieat was not a success in the sense that farmers were not familiar with bread-
making.  Moreover, since market prices for wheat have not been attractive to
farmers in recent years, whLeat has been replaced with oilseeds and other crops.
Crop yields have increased with irrigation as summarized below:
Paddy   Maize   Wheat   Oilseeds
(tons/ha)
Without Project   1.41    0.81         -       0.33
With Project       1.97     1.66    1.24       0.62
89.       Infrastructure.  A total of 70 km of trails and 34 suspension bridges
(30 minor and 4 major) were to be constructed under the project.  Although with
some delay, the trail program proceeded well and a total of 79 km were completed
by mid-1989. The bridge program on the other hand has fallen considerably behind
schedule. Until end-1988, construction had not even started and subsequently the
target was revised to 14 major bridges. By Credit closing, only five bridges
were completed and one was under construction.  The partial failure of this
component can be attributed to various factors such as the long delay in the
recruitment of a bridge engineer, delays in awards of contracts for design and
construction, administrative problems, difficulties to import construction
material from India (para 65), and a generally excessive workload on the
Department of Suspension Bridges.
90.       Training and technical assistance.  Training and technical assistance
were financed through a UNDP-financed project (NEP/80/019 Hill Food Production)
which provided funds to recruit international and local consultants as well as



26
for strengthening Government's agricultural trairing capacity and for other
training, including in-service training and international fellowships and study
tours. A total of 90 staff-months of consultancy services were envisaged, of
which only 78 were utilized (Part IV, page 13).  External training progressed
satisfactorily.   Although originally only 20 staff-months of international
training were foreseen, at project cloFing a total of 36 staff-monthls of training
had been provided. Unfortunately, only six of the 25 DOA staff trained were
still employed by the HFPP at project completion. This can mainly be attributed
to the delay or failure to establish permanent staff positions. Also, inadequate
government subsistence and travel allowances prevented field staff from
participating in local training activities.   Less than 20% of local training
funds were utilized (para 79).
91.       Monitorins and evaluation.  Monitoring of project implementation was
to be conducted by PC and ADO, and a monitoring unit (KU) was to be attached to
the PC's office; provision of 6 staff-months was made for a local monitoring and
evaluation consultant under the UNDP-financed TA project. Due to considerable
delays in identification/recruitment of the consultant, no consistent M&E system
was developed.    Several  semi-annual  progress  reports were  submitted with
considerable delays. Evaluation of the impact of the project was entrusted to
the Agricultural Project Services Center (APROSC) which completed a baseline
survey covering some of the project districts in December 1982 and a Household
Baseline Study in December 1984 (Part IV, page 5). However, only limited survey
work was carried out and no mid-term or final impact study was provided.
92.       Economic rate of return.  At appraisal, the ERR for the whole project
was estimated at over 57% and at over 15% for the irrigation component. Due to
insufficient project evaluation, it was impossible to determine accurately the
production increases attributable to the project. Trerefore, the ERR has been
re-estimated only for the irrigation component and amounts to over 50% (Tables
1-5). Unfortunately, the underlying assumptions for the ERR calculation of the
irrigation component at appraisal were not available to the mission. From the
cost and benefit streams given in the SAR, it appears, however, that the
extremely conservative estimates were used for the benefits accrued at farm
level.
93.       Project impact.  As a result of the project, a reorganized extension
service is now in place.  The Project impact on extension service has common
features with that of AERP (para 40), especially regarding the line of command,
AAs performance (though to a lesser extent due to lack of supervision/guidance),
irrelevant technical recommendations, and poor training (except for the last two
years [para 78]).  However, the implementation of the T&V system in the Hill
environment has been more complex and difficult than first envisaged, and
numerous institutional and operational impediments have been identified (paras
71, 79, 80). In addition, the Hill's extremely rugged topography and the widely
scattered settlement pattern of its population pose enormous difficulties in the
provision of extension services. Notwithstanding these problems, considerable
experience was gained in operating the reoriented extension service introduced
in the project and lessons learned for the design, management and operation of
future projects under similar conditions (paras 44, 46, 80, 96). Agricultural
production has substantially increased in the project area. However, this can
mostly be attributed to non-project related activities such as the substantial
increases of cropped area under irrigation and also to a slightly improved
availability of modern farm inputs and credit. Yield, however, has only slightly



27
improved, which reflects persisting deficiencies in extension and research (para
77). The impact of ASCs on farmers' attitudes, farming methods and their general
utility to farmers, has riot been properly evaluated.  Indications are that their
present operation is not entirely satisfactory. The establishment/improvement
of irrigation schemes has resulted in a better production base and in a
corresponding increase in food production, while improved infrastructure (t. .Als
and bridges) has facilitated communications, input supply and produce evacuation.
Proiect Sustainability
94.       At project completion, a fully staffed reoriented extension service
was in place. In order to ensure continuity, effective from project closing, all
activities initiated by this project and by the Agricultural Extension and
Research Project (para 41) were brought under the umbrella of the on-going
Agricultural Extension II Project (Cr. 1570-NEP) which was redesigned accordingly
and will also complete the unfinished civil works (i.e., four ACSs and one
suspension bridge) [para 441. However, increasing staff and other operational
costs make it questionable whether present staff levels and frequent T&V programs
can be maintained. The substantial construction costs of ASCs and subsequent
high maintenance costs, together with considerable staffing requirements and
costs, raise doubts whether this approach can be replicated or even sustained by
HMGN. Further studies are required to make the ASC concept more cost-effective
or develop alternative approaches. The failure, so far, to establish a workable
water management program raises some doubts about the maintenance of the
irrigation schemes improved or established under the project (para 85).   In
general, it can be assumed that the irrigation component will maintain an
acceptable level of net benefits throughout its economic life.
IDA's Pierformance
95.       IDA's performance during the early stage of the project cycle and the
appraisal process was satisfactory. However, more attention should have been
paid  to  project  design  and  organizational  matters  (para  56).    During
implementation, a total of 18 supervision missions were fielded with a
considerable degree of staff continuity.   Considering, however, the apparent
weakness in project monitoring and evaluation, more supervision time should have
been devoted to that aspect and especially to the project's impact on producti-n
and productivity. The supervision missions' general neglect of the livestock
component may have contributed to its poor performance.   IDA also failed to
realize that the project was implemented in a rather mechanical way without due
regard to project output and impact on production and farm income.
96.       Only during the last two years were new ideas progressively developed
to adjust the prevailing top-down approach of extension/research towards a more
effective demand-driven system. However, no major adjustment to the system has
been made since then and this is due mainly to the absence of concise and
comprehensive proposals for improvement. The other main general lessons learned
from pro'ect implementation are identical to those of the AERP project (para 46).
Additional lessons are:
(a) Thtere is need for incorporation of specific proposals to ensure proper
evaluation of project results in order to facilitate impact assessment
(paras 67, 91).



28
(b)  Where implementation deper.ds on the provision of research findings and
recommendations, generated by sources outside the project's sphere of
control, a strong linkage mechanism between the project and research
institutions has to be establi.shed and the availability of appropriate
technology ensured (para 78).
(c)  It should be a basic principle, particularly in areas of difficult
mobility, that extension agents be posted as near the center of their
area of responsibility as possible (para 79).
(d)  Money can be  saved arnd the coverage  of scarce  staff extended,
especially in areas with limited access, by taking advantage of media
and other modern communications methods (para 80).
(e)  Strong project coordination has to be in place from the beginning of
the project (para 97).
Borrower's Performance
97.       The Borrower's performance during project implementation was not
always satisfactory. Initial weaknesses in project coordination led to delays
in project start-up and the slow release of funds hampered implementation
throughout.   The Borrower adopted most of the agreed covenants  (Part IV,
page 10), except for those requiring regular submission of audited accounts, and
more seriously, the establishment of permanent posts for extension staff; also,
monitoring and evaluation requirements were not adequately covered. The main
experiences gained by the Borrower are similar to those found during the
implementation of AERP (para 47). Additional lessons are:
(a)  sufficient travel and subsistence allowances have to be provided to
staff, to ensure regular field visits and participation in training
programs outside their duty stations (para 79); and
(b)  particular attention should be paid to input and produce marketing
constraints, including high transport costs under the particular Hill
conditions (para 83).
Borrower/IDAIUNDP Relationship under the Proiect
98.       Three main parties were involved in the execution of the project, i.e.
the Borrower,  IDA and UNDP.   Generally,  the Borrower-IDA relationship was
satisfactory, although the Borrower frequently disregarded suggestions for
improvements made by supervision missions (paras 74, 85) or acted upon them with
substantial delays. The working relation of the Borrower with UNDP was positive
and the operational interaction between IDA and UNDP was timely and efficient.
Consulting Services
99.       Under the UNDP technical assistance project, international consultants
in agronomy (44 staff-months). extension training and communications (20 staff-
months) and irrigation engineering (20 staff-months) were provided. Utilization
of consultancies fell short of target in all areas and only 49 staff-months were
utilized (Part IV, page 13). The consultancies also did not have the expected
impact. Although technically highly qualified, all consultants lacked experience
with the special conditions of the Hills, which reduced their effectiveness.



29
This is especially true of the irrigation specialist.   Allocation for local
consultants was increased from 6 staff-months to 40, of which a total of 29
months were utilized. Consultancies in agronomy and extension communication have
proven to be useful and cost-effective.
100.      The performance of contractors was mostly satisfactory.  Shortfalls
in the quality of ASC construction were observed, and this can partly be
attributed to steeply escalating cost of construction materials, especially
during the last three project years, which made it difficult for contractors to
maintain quality within the financial framework of contracts negotiated earlier.
The irrigation facilities constructed under contract arrangements suffered from
major problems, and six out of ten required costly repairs. Some delays occurred
also in the provision of prefabricated iron structures for suspension bridges and
this could be attributed mainly to shortages in the supply of steel in the
country. The international suppliers of fertilizer and vehicles performed well.
Project Documentation and Data
101.      The Credit Agreement was adequate and appropriate  for achieving
project objectives in key organizational and financial areas. The SAR suffered
from some design flaws (paras 56, 57) and a lack of clarity on organizational
matters.   Nevertheless, the SAR provided a useful framework for IDA and the
Borrower to monitor project implementation progress. The UNDP Proj _t Document
covering the technical assistance component was well prepared to serve its
purpose. Three consecutive extensions and a considerable depreciation of the
Nepalese Rupee against the U.S. dollar, however, reduced somewhat the usefulness
of the documents to monitor the progress of the project, especially with regard
to financial targets.  During extension, the project should have bee  re-phased
and implementation targets and project costs should have been revised.
102.      Data on crop areas, yields and output prices were either lacking or
incomplete and when available, they varied widely from source to source (para
67). During the short stay of the PCR preparation mission in the country, it was
not possible to collect and generate data for the economic analysis (para 92) for
the project as a whole; the evaluation of the irrigation component was based on
mission estimates whenever data were unavailable.

PART III. EVALUATION OF THE EXTENSION SERVICE
A. Or2anization and Administration
Review of Extension Approaches
104.      Nepal used numerous approaches for agricultural extension, which have
been introduced by donor agencies rather than through evolutionary development.
The DeRartment of Agriculture's Standard Approach
105.      The Ministry of Agriculture still uses a standard approach in many
districts, particularly in the Hills. This approach has a single line of command
from Regional Directors of Agriculture (RDAs) to Agriculture Development Officers
(ADOs), Junior Technicians (JTs) and Junior Technical Assistants (JTAs) who are
the grassroots-level workers; it uses model farmers called Agricultural
Assistants  (AAs).    Coordination  at  district  level  is  through  District
Coordination Committees (DCCs), but they are ineffective. Besides performing
their regular extension duties, JTs and JTAs collect farmers' requests for credit
and inputs, help them to obtain credit and sometimes to procure inputs. Each
district has 10 to 12 JTs and 15 to 20 JTAs, depending on its potential, and one
AA for every 2,000 to 3,000 farm families (about 3 villages).
106.      DOA distinguished between "special" (large areas of good, fertile,
usually irrigated land), "pocket" (small areas of high potential land), and
"ordinary" areas. Separate production programs are formulated for each type of
land, but they tend to be only a set of numerical extension activity targets.
107.      There is no institutional provision to ensure that information travels
from grassroots upwards, or institutionalized linkage between extension and
research, except through field reports and mini-kit trials. The approach also
suffers from extension staff having multiple duties, with no mechanism for
regular recurrent training. Farmer training courses are ill-planned and often
untimely and irrelevant.



37
The Block Production Approach
108.      This  approach  is used  in  integrated  development  programs  aimed
exclusively at farm families in blocks of 1,000 ha.   A program office was
established within MOA to coordinate activities and instruct and control block
Production Officers  (POs) through ADOs, by-passing RDAs.   JTs and JTAs are
responsible for extension activities but also collect requests for inputs and
credit.   Loans are processed at block level and the Agricultural  Inputs
Corporation (AIC) arranges delivery through cooperatives or private dealers. The
supply of inputs and credit is an important part of the program, and
responsibility is vested equally between ADO, AIC, ADBN and Sajha.   Monthly
coordination meetings are held and visits are made to production blocks to solve
problems in situ.
109.      POs are responsible for extension work within each block.  In a full
1,000 ha block, a PO is assisted by 2 JTs and 10 AAs. Agricultural and socio-
economic analyses are used to determine levels and types of agricultural
development, followed by pre-production verification trials. Extension work is
multi-disciplinary, and the block is expected to act as a demonstration to
farmers in surkounding areas.  Block programs have their own budgets financed
either through HMGN or external assistance and are separate from the regular
district budget.
110.      Agricultural and socio-economic analyses and a multi-disciplinary
approach should have made block extension programs more responsive to farmers'
needs, but the focus placed on credit and inputs restricted their relevance.
Farmers within the block benefited, often dramatically, from the approach, but
the expected dissemination to farmers outside the block did not materialize.
While constraints related to credit and input availability were eased within the
block, little was done to minimize constraints outside the block. These programs
being integrated, they required separate management, staff and finance, resulting
in duplication of efforts and conflict over resources at district level.
111.      The more recent Fertilizer and Related Inputs Program (FRIP) uses a
modified approach with small blocks of 5 to 50 ha. The emphasis is again on
input provision with a revolving interest-free fund established for input
purchase.   The program is integrated into the normal district program and
controlled by the ADO, with a JT working for FRIP as part of regular extension
duties.
The Tuki System
112.      Tukis are unpaid,  multi-purpose extension workers selected among
progressive farmers.  They were first used in 1977 under the Integrated Hill
Development Project (IHDP). The system has now fallen into disrepute, mainly
because of the costs involved in providing Tukis with inputs on credit. Project
funding came mainly through Swiss Technical Assistance.
113.      Within the Tuki project area, regular extension activities were also
carried out by the ADO and staff according to DOA's standard approach, leading
to overlap, conflicting advice and confusion among farmers.
114.      A "Project Coordinator" coordinated the integrated elements of the
project and an "Agricultural Development Officer" managed input supply.



38
Extension focused on the provision of inputs and, as an incentive, Tukis were
paid a 20% commission on all inputs sold plus 0.5 NR/kg for inputs carried to
farmers. They were also expected to provide technical advice and solve farmers'
problems. Tukis were trained every three months in input handling, pricing and
technical dissemination.   The project encouraged development of seed growers
associations,  private  nurseries  and  seed  sales  outlets.           Mini-kits,
demonstrations, farmers meetings, farmers training courses and printed materials
were used to promote input utilization.
115.      At district level, coordination among the various agencies was carried
out through the DCC, but the only formal linkage between extension and research
was provided through project headquarters.
116.      Because Tukis obtained financial reward solely from the sale of
inputs, they became commercial salesmen rather than extensinn workers and
concentrated their efforts in areas where farmers could afford inputs. In these
areas, there was considerable overlap with extension. Often, the advice they
gave was to promote sales rather than to help farmers, generating conflict with
regular extension staff. In the absence of a commercial sector, however, the
Tuki system provided active services and inputs to at least a fragment of the
farming population.
The Lumle Agricultural Center Approach
117.      Since 1975, the Lumle Agricultural Center (LAC) has been responsible
for extension in three districts (Kaski, Parbat and Myagdi).   LAC has strong
links with research and holds local verification trials of promising cereal,
legume, oilseed and vegetable crops and fruits.   It investigates husbandry
practices for locally important livestock and the management of forest and
pasture to increase productivity and improve conservation.
118.      Research and extension are both performed by LAC.   Its extension
approach is based on Farming Systems Research (FSR), by which the technical
potential of specific localities and the needs, problems and expectations of
farmers are identified by researchers, extensionists and farmers together, and
translated into research and extension programs. Packets of location-specific
technologies are extended to integrate agronomy, horticulture, livestock, pasture
and forestry. Because of the complex nature of agriculture in the Hills, LAC has
four off-station research sites at different elevations where technical packages
are developed for recommendation in altitude-ba.ed domains.    Field  staff
undertake regular extension activities and distribution of seeds, saplings, agro-
chemicals and equipment; thev also help farmers with credit applications. Field
staff are regularly trained at LAC and senior staff are sent for training at
B.Sc. degree level in Nepal, and overseas for short courses and post-graduate
training.
119.      LAC is manned by 178 staff, including 19 graduates.  Most junior staff
are mature, many ex-military, and all are trained by LAC before starting
extension activities.   The AAs (called Field Assistants) are local farmers,
usually selected by their community at a ratio of 1 AA to 500 farm families. All
staff receive higher pay than their counterparts in government service (MAs
receive NRsl,014 compared to the normal NRs300) and a higher daily subsistence
allowance when they are away from their station (NRs15O against NRs35). LAC is
fully financed by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), United Kingdom.



39
120.      Although LAC's approach appears sound, it cannot be sustained without
outside financial support and thus cannot be expanded nationwide. NARC, USAID
and IDA are investigating ways to reduce the cost of the LAC approach, making it
replicable and sustainable from Government's own resources.
The Community-Based Approach
121.      This approach is based on village-level user groups and mainly usod
in integrated development and community forestry projects in Hill areas.
Extension is used to facilitate group decision-making. Dialogue is established
with separate sub-groups: women, people of low caste, business people, etc., so
that their differing needs, expectations and priorities can be equally aired, and
disputes debated and resolved. Each user group is helped to reach consensus on
objectives and priorities, and a joint work plan for the user group and the
supporting technical department is established.
122.      The technical department facilitates local plans through technical
assistance in practical activities sucn as setting up village nurseries,
training elected villagers in specific skills (for them to use on behalf of the
user group, or to teach them to other group members), providing technical advice
and information through a JT stationed in the locality and the provision of
simple inputs such as seeds and seedlings.   In community forestry, villagers
often employ their own forest guards, each villager paying an equal amount in
kind, usually grain.
123.      Training is a vital part of the approach and takes the form of
frequent in-service refresher courses for all field staff, including forest
guards or assistants employed by the group (high priority is given to training
in extension methods and communication skills); workshops and seminars for user
groups and village leaders; and training in special skills for group members.
124.      This approach is user-driven and focuses on fulfilling the needs and
expectations of the group according to its priorities. It does not depend on
highly qualified staff, which makes it simple and inexpensive to operate, but
without the assistance of experienced extension or research staff in the planning
process, potential opportunities may be overlooked and wrong decisions can be
made.
The Training and Visit System
125.      The T&V system was first introduced in Nepal in 1975 as a component
of the Narayani Irrigation Project. It was designed to maintain the single line
of DOA's standard approach, and to improve it by:
(a)  Providing adequate numbers of staff to ensure effective services to
farmers and sufficient technical and managerial support to staff.
(b)  Giving  extension  the  single  function  of  transmitting  technical
information to and from farmers.
(c)  Developing strong links between extension and research so that farmers
problems would be taken to research for solution, appropriate research
programs designed, and app,:opriate technologies taken from research
to farmers.



40
(d) Establishing a regular system of training so that research staff
expertise would be taught to SMSs, who would pass it through key
messages to junior field staff for their work with farmers.
(e) Establishing strong linkages with the farming community through the
employment of local volunteer farmers as full-time Panchayat-Level
Assistants (PLAs) and the use of contact farmers visited by AAs
regularly at a fixed time and day in a 2-week schedule.
126.      These changes brought comparatively high early benefits.   In an
evaluation study carried out by the Ministry of Food, .griculture and Irrigation
(MFAI), 95Z of farmers indicated that the program had increased production.
127.      The T&V system was therefore extended through the Bhairahawa-Lumbini
Groundwater Project (1976), the Sunsari-Morang Irrigation Project (1978), and the
Mahakali Irrigation Project (1981).   AERP and HFPP followed these projects,
employing the same extension management principles. HFPP's principles differed
from AERP's in that 20 Agricultural Service Centers (ASCs) were to be built and
JTs were made responsible for ASCs and JTAs housed there, away from their
villages.
Advantages and Disadvantages of T&V Over Other Approaches
128.      DOA's standard approach has a single line of command,  is multi-
disciplinary and inexpensive in terms of total extension cost per household (see
table below).  Hiowever,  its cost per contact is the greatest.   The block
production approach stimulates development for the privileged farmers within the
block, but does little for the majority of farmru'rs outside the block. The Tuki
system motivates volunteer extension workers, but only as commercial salesmen.
The Lumle approach has closely integrated extension and re3earch activities as
well as agriculture, horticulture, livestock and forestry extension activities;
its programming is based on farming systems, but the whole approach is expensive.
The community-based approach is under investigation and looks as though it might
provide an inexpensive method of identifying farmers, needs, but it has no link
with research and requires well-trained field staff.
129.      The T&V system had several advantages over the other approaches.  It
is superior to the standard, the Tuki and the block production approaches in that
it enables a two-way flow of information, provides regular staff training and has
strong research-extension linkages.  Moreover, its activities are focused on
extension alone.
130.      The T&V system's advantages over the standard approach is that it
concentrates on extension staff at the village level and over the community
approach it links with research.  However, many of the advantages of the system
did not materialize and although the system had lower costs per contactV/ than
any of the other approaches (see table below), and lower operating costs per
household than the block or Lumle approaches, it had the highest total cost of
all and is therefore too expensive for HMGN to sustain without external
assistance.

Analysis of AERP and HFPP Appg oaches
Structure
131.      Immediately prior to the launching of HFPP, DOLD/AH was formed with
staff down to Veterinary Assistant. However, this improved animal health and
veterinary services led to a deterioration in services related to animal
husbandry and, particularly, pasture and fodder crops. Advice became fragmented
as crop and livestock inter-relationships were ignored, and information
concerning pasture and fodder crops was omitted by DOLD/AH and DOA.
132.      In AERP, the PC was directly responsible to the Director-General but
expected to work through RDAs. In practice, the PC dealt immediately with ADOs
(Chart 1, page 65).  In HFPP, the PC was responsible to RDO in the line of
command above ADOs, but in practice, the RDO was again by-passed by DDG and PC
communicating directly with ADOs.
133.      Project management was therefore external to the regional extension
management system and did little to reorganize or strengthen it.   It also
reinforced the concept that both projects were short-term and time bound, and
that staff and systems would be dismantled at project completion.
134.      In 1982, a decentralization policy was put into effect thriugh the
Ministry of Panchayats and Local Development (MPLD) which had a powerful impact
on regional and district extension. Panchayats were executive bodies of village
and district assemblies.  District-level Panchayats prepared and implemented
their own plans, funded through village donations and grants from MPLD, and
coordinated and supervised programs of other ministries, including agriculture.
The Local Development Officer (LDO), who was secretary to the Panchayat and civil



42
servant of MPLD, implemented the Panchayat's decisions. Considerable control was
exerted by LDOs, even to the extent that ADOs had to obtain their permission to
go to the field. The Chief District Officer, who is responsible for district law
and order, also expected to direct ADOs, particularly over transport.  These
separate lines of command led to ADOs receiving a multiplicity of instructions,
many conflicting, and spending a great deal of time at meetings, and dealing with
extra administrative work. Although the Panchayat system has now fallen into
disrepute, it is expected that a decentralization policy based on fully elected
local bodies will be establist-d after the national elections of May 1991.
135.      With the creation of NARC in 1985 and its separation from DOA, NARC
and DOA objectives and priorities do not necessarily coincide. Con.equently, the
objectives and priorities of Regional Research Stations do not always match those
of local extension, or those of farmers. This separation made researchers feel
that their work was distinct from, and superior to, local extension needs, and
that the outreach program impeded their "real work" at the station.
Staffing
136.      Staff numbers.  Appraisal staff ratios and actual achievements are
given below. The SAR for AERP provided an average ratio of one AA to 726 farm
families, which is acceptable; this ratio narrowed to 1:632 after Panchayat
reorganization.

TJTA*SMS          10.5       16.2        1.7        3S    |
The SAR provided generous JTA:AA and JT:JTA ratios.  Yet, as travel is easy and
supervisory distances are short in the Terai, there was no justification for
increasing JTA/JT numbers when AAs increased, as the JTA:AA ratio would still
have been only 1:4.6, compared with the more normal ratio of 1:6 to 1:8.
137.      No additional SMSs were recruited after the Panchayat reorganization,
hence the widened SMS:JT/JTA ratio. This means that SMSs were overloaded, as the
extension approach involved large numbers of trials and demonstrations needing
close SMS supervision.
138.      In contrast, in HFPP districts where mobility is extremely difficult
and limited to arduous travel by foot, and villages and farms are widely
dispersed, the farm family to MA ratio widened after Panchayat reorganization.
The SAR provision was realistic, as it may take an MA four to six hours to reach
the farthest contact farmer.
139.      The JT/JTA ratio at project completion is unacceptable, but distorted
by staff losses. If the SAR AA:JTA target ratio of 5:1 had been maintained,



43
there would have been 49 JTAs in post, giving a JT/JTA ratio of 3.5, which is
still generous but appropriate to Hill areas. The SMS to JT/JTA ratio was also
generous but determined by the minimum number of SMSs (3) allocated to a
district. However, as SMSs are generalists and have limited opportunity to visic
farmers with problems, there is little reason to stick to this allocation.
140.      Staff location.  As a result of HMGN's guidelines to halt  .nstruction
of all JTA housing, most JTAs were provided with temporary ac. modations,
usually  with  local  farm  families.    This  situation  had  several  adverse
implications on JTAs performance:
(a)  farmers providing accommodations expected a tangible return for their
hospitality: JTAs working on their farms, and/or provision of inputs
intended for demonstrations; and
(b)  low JTA motivation and high staff turnover.
141.      In HFPP, JTs and JTAs were to be housed in ASCs to give greater
managerial control over JTAs, and JTAs the incentive of free housing; but by
being housed at ASCs, they were several hours walking distance away from their
AAs, which meant that they regularly stayed in villages overnight. This should
have been beneficial because of closer contact between JTAs and farmers; but
potential benefits were negated by poor daily subsistence allowances and dislike
of too many nights spent away from home, sometimes under uncomfortable
conditions.
142.      Staff recruitment procedure.  For senior posts down to SMS level, the
Public Service Commission (PSC) announced vacancies and requested applications.
Applicants had to sit a civil service examination in Kathmandu. Appointments
were made on the basis of examination grades, with little regard to experience,
specialization or interests. This procedure reduced staff quality, particularly
of researchers and SMSs, whose special knowledge and experience, problem solving
ability and communication skills are essential.
143.      JTs and JTAs were selected by Regional Directors, on the basis of both
paper qualifications and experience. Quality was low, due partly to increased
demands for JT/JTAs, and partly to poor training.
144.      AAs were recruited by ADOs, often on the advice of JTs/JTAs and
community leaders. Each AA was recruited for a single year, but if performance
was satisfactory recruitment was extended, often throughout the project.
Selections were usually appropriate; poor selections arose when community leaders
based recommendations on political expediency, social obligations or family
relationships.
145.      There were two forms of temporary posts, one created for the life of
the program, the other for a single year. Most s-enior staff, ADOs and above,
were in temporary positiov - c-eated for the life of the project. This situation
led to insecurity and concei.. -'out satisfying superior officers requirements
rather than fulfilling programs or farmers, needs. Junior staff were usually
employed in temporary posts created for a single year, and offered contracts for
six months, extended by three-month periods, resulting in staff discontent and
dissension.



44
146.      Staff incentives.  In theory, JTAs could be promoted to JTs and J'Ts
to Ar)Os while graduate ADOs could be promoted through the hierarchy.   In
practice, promotion was very slow and seemed determined more by patronage than
by quality of work or commitment. ADOs could give up additional grades (up to
three years) to staff performing better than average (equivalent to NRs9O/month),
but this often created disputes over the fairness of selection procedures and is
therefore no longer widely practiced.
Program Planning
147.      In AERP, ADOs collected information from JTs/JTAs about farmers,
needs, compared it with departmental guidelines and budget, and prepared a draft
district program. The draft was discussed at a regional seminar by staff from
various disciplines, including research, modified accordingly and sent to RDA
who, in turn, prepared and submitted a regional program to the Agricultural
Extension and Training Division (AETD). AETD compiled the program for all five
regions and prepared a national budget, keeping the overall program within the
budget ceiling and in line with government guidelines.  DOA passed it to the
Planning Commission, for finalization after consultation with the Ministry of
Finance.
148.      Although the procedure was satisfactory,  there were a numbe; of
operational deficiencies:
(a)  Farmers, needs were presented by JTs/JTAs.  In practice, these staff
seldom consulted farmers and presented their own perceptions (and
prejudiced views). If they did consult, they sought the views of AAs
and community leaders - focusing on wealthier farmers without
attempting to identify the needs of women, subsistence farmers or
minority groups.
(b)  F'armers' needs were expressed in the form of requests for inputs,
ir.creased irrigation, etc., rather than behavioral objectives leading
to increased farmer knowledge and understanding, and the improved use
of agrici&ltural teclnology.
(c)  The  Planning  Commission  sometimes  modified  the program  without
consulting field staff, or accepted the program but cut the budget.
Both interventions weakened program effectiveness.
(d)  Programs were based on numerical targets:  for research outreach
activities   (number  of  farmers'   field  trials,   pre-production
verification trials, demonstrations, and mini-kits); and for extension
activities (number of farmer training sessions, field days, visits,
competitions and farmers' fairs).  This approach made programming a
mechanical process, during which practical constraints limiting
agricultural progress were usually ignored; research and extension
were monitored according to target achievement, and control mechanisms
reacted to below-target achievement. Research workers and extension
staff thus worked to achieve targets, not to reach objectives based
on farmers' needs or react to changing needs. Having started with a
bottom-up approach, the system ended up top-down.



45
149.      HFPP program planning initially followed the same process, but since
1987 it determines farmers' priorities through farm systems research undertaken
by LAC. Despite this preliminary work, draft programs are still presenlted the
old way, as a series of targets.
Budgeting and Finance
150.      Detailed budgets were formulated during the program planning procetAure
and funds allocated to the respective ADOs who were responsible for keeping
detailed accounts for salaries and general expenditures (staff salaries, travel
and daily allowances, vehicle and office costs), and program costs, divided into
12 heads. ADOs made monthly expenditure reports and their accounts were checked
quarterly by the District Auditor (an officer of the Ministry of Finance) and
annually by the Central Auditor.
151.      ADOs also had to account for expenditures on construction programs,
which not only involved high levels of funding, but also were complex and subject
to delay, causing many budgetary problems. This placed a heavy burden on ADOs.
Ideally, ADOs should be provided with an administrative assistant with expertise
in accounting but, according to HMGN regulations, this assistant would have to
be a member of the Ministry of Finance, increasing institutional complexity.
Monitoring and Evaluation
152.      As DOA objectives and extension programs were given as numerical sets
of target activities, monitoring focused on the achievement of these numerical
targets, ignoring their effect on farmers and their agriculture. The monitoring
procedure was as follows:
(a) Each month JTs and JTAs reported their activities, according to a pre-
determined format, to M&E Division of DOA via the ADO and RDA; at bi-
monthly meetings, SMSs reported on their activities. The reports were
also sent to DOA through the ADO and RDA.   As there was little
supervision of SMSs, JTs or JTAs, their reports had to be taken on
trust, but were frequently considered unreliable.
(b) Evaluation was made according to a sample defined by DOA and based on
different target levels for special, pocket and general areas and for
irrigated and rainfed land.   Data included total production, area
under specific crops, and quantity of specific inputs used. All were
influenced by many factors other than extension, but these factors
were not measured.
(c) No baseline survey was made so it was difficult to compare
achievement.      The   sample   defined  by  DOA  was   frequently
unrepresentative.    Data  presented by  many  JTs  were  considered
unreliable, based more on past recordings than field investigations.
Evaluations were therefore of little practical use.
(d) APROSC was contracted to perform specific studies and evaluations.
Much of the work was narrow in scope with inflexible contracts
preventing exploration of important lines of enquiry. Most were over-
academic but with weak research methodologies.   Results were often
thought unreliable. Even though data were collected, they were seldom



46
used for managerial purposes other than the mechanical control of
staff not achieving targets.
Findin2s and Recommendations
153.      Except for staff numbers being increased in AERP after the Panchayat
reorganization, and delays in construction work, the structure and processes of
the extension system were laid down as stated in the SARs, out they did not
function well.
154.      Phasing.  Evaluation of the organization and administration identified
certain crucial  issues.   Infrastructure components  important  to extension
operations should have been in place before extension work started. Phasing has
to allow for construction delays which hinder extension work, as most project
efforts are then concentrated on construction instead of extension.
155.      Staff quality.  Staff selection and recruitment should be based on the
knowledge and skills needed to perform the functions expected of them. If staff
of sufficient quality cannot be found, intensive pre-service and/or in-service
training must be provided. If quality is too low, the system itself may have to
be changed.
156.      Staff numbers.  Staff numbers were generous. In the Terai, there was
no justification for narrowing JTA:AAs or JT:JTAs ratios. It would have been
better, and cheaper, to have had fewer staff of better quality, and to have
provided them with suitable transport.
157.      Line management.  MOA seemed to disregard the need for single line
management. Senior managers needed to be convinced of the advantages of single
lines and develop the discipline of maintaining a single line of command,
distinguishing  it  from  lines  of  technical  communication.        Roles  and
responsibilities should have been clearly assigned to staff at all levels.
158.      Position of JTAs.   In HFPP, the housing of JTAs at ASCs reduced
extension effectiveness. It should be a basic principle, particularly in areas
of difficult mobility, that JTAs be housed as near the center of their area of
responsibility as possible.
159.      Use of data by management.   Senior managers  in DOA do not use
monitoring and evaluation data when making decisions. Monitoring and evaluation,
and the use of data by managers, need to be developed together.
160.      Targets.  Using the number of extension activities to be performed as
targets in program planning, monitoring and control, reduces extension to a
mechanical process.   Instead, focus should be placed on the effect of those
activities.

B. Oualitv and Relevance of AERP and HFPP Extension Services
Relevance of Strategies Used by AERP and HFPP
161.     Two main strategies were used:  a series of trials and demonstrations
to develop appropriate technologies and convince farmers of their benefit; and
providing technical advice to farmers. Other strategies used in a minor way were
the building of social institutions and facilitation.
Trials and Demonstrations Strategy
162.     The main thrust of extension activity was  through trials and
demonstrations (see following tables). These included "Farmers' Field Trials,"
held on a few selected farms under research supervision, pre-production
verification trials (PPVT) hcld under normal farm conditions, mini-kits used as
a continuation of verification (farmers being asked to report opinions) and a
means of introducing and spreading new seed varieties and technologies, and
result demonstrations  for farmers to compare recommended and traditional
practices.

This strategy was highly appropriate as new technologies needed to be tested,
particularly under the various Hill agro-ecological conditions, and farmers
needed to assess performance within their localities and in farming systems
similar to their own.
163.       Implementation was generally poor:  trials and demonstrations were
seldom based on farmers' perceptions of needs and priorities; they concentrated
too much on varieties, heavy fertilizer usage, and irrigated agriculture. Too
little attention was given to crops such as oilseeds and pulses, rainfed farming
or subsistence agriculture, the development of farming systems, improved crop
management, or cultivation practices. In HFPP, more attention was given to these
latter subjects after the inclusion of LAC in 1987. AERP did not fulfill the
SAR objective of increasing agricultural production through "low cost, labor-
Intensive practices."
164.       Large numbers of mini-kits were distributed as part of research
commodity programs and research outreach programs, by the FSR section of NARC,
and as part of extension programs (see table below).

49
Too many mini-kits were distributed for them to be effectively supervised by
extension staff. Similarly, too many demonstrations were planned for staff to
implement and supervise them effectively.
Advisory Strategy
165.      SMSs, JTs, JTAs and AAs were all expected to advise farmers through
personal contact during field visits and at farmers, meetings.   In general,
field-level staff had too little knowledge or experience to advise farmers in
more than the most general way. Fortnightly training sessions helped as farmers'
problems and solutions were discussed, but little time was devoted to training
staff in problem identification and diagnosis and, because they lacked local
experience, SMSs could not forecast potential problems.
166.      Mass media were generally  ineffective.    Radio has  the greatest
potential but is limited to a single station for the whole country.  Written
materials could be useful, particularly in the Hills, as school enrolment figures
indicate that literacy might be reasonably high.
Institution Building
167.      DOA's policy was that whenever major infrastructure was put in place,
the farming community should establish an association, or "users group" to help
in its planning, implementation and management. Most groups failed, as extension
staff were not trained in institution building and merely advised the community
to form an association and collected the names of chairman, secretary, and
members; they could not help in its establishment or management.
Facilitation Strategy
168.      Only LAC's research and extension staff involved farmers in the
analysis of their own problems and opportunities so that research, and therefore
extension messages, were relevant to farmers needs. Yet, identifying farmers'
problems and opportunities, and transmitting them to policy makers and
researchers, are basic principles underlying both projects. DOA is interested
in LAG's methodology, but in a modified form that is not so demanding of highly
skilled personnel and finance. It is considered only for the outreach program,
whereas it could be used most effectively by extension.
Conclusions and Recommendations
169.      The combination of these four extension strategies is appropriate to
Nepal, and DOA was right to give precedence to trials and demonstrations, but the
other three, particularly the facilitation strategy, should have been
strengthened.
170.      Although procedures for the trials and demonstrations strategy should
have resulted in a bottom-up approach, they did not, and in practice, the main
extension thrust was top-down. To rectify this, researchers, extension staff and
farmers should be involved in diagnostic studies identifying farmers' real needs,
opportunities and constraints. To avoid dominance by the more powerful owner-
farmers, these studies should identify and distinguish between the differing
technical and socio-economic needs of sub-categories of farmers, including wome i.



50
171.      Diagnostic studies should not be left solely to junior researchers of
outreach programs. Senior research staff and economists should be involved so
that RRS work programs reflect the real needs and poter.tials of the farming
community. Diagnostic study findings should also be used by extension staff to
formulate developmental objectives for extension programs. Farmers should be at
the center of diagnostic studies so that they have a direct influence on research
and extension programming.   The greatest difficulty will be to change the
attitudes of senior research and extension staff to make this possible.
Quality of Field Level ODerations
Work Assignments
172.      In AERP, JTAs were expected to supervise AAs and visit contact
farmers; supervise trials and demonstrations; and provide advice to farmers,
discuss their problems and seek solutions at fortnightly training sessions. In
HFPP, the JTA was expected to collect requests from farmers for saplings and
seed, visit farmers, fields, and supervise demonstrations. The JT was expected
to head the Agricultural Service Center and train AAs at the fortnightly training
sessions.
173.      In reality, little work of any quality was expected of JTAs.  They
seemed most useful acting as information conduits, conveying information from the
ADO, SMSs and JTs to farmers, and farmers' input requests; however, they were
still expected to fulfill their target quota of adaptive trials and extension
activities, even if they did them badly. Technical limitations preventing most
JTAs from being effective technical advisers lowered their self-confidence and
deterred them from visiting farmers.
174.      AAs were supposed to be volunteers, yet they were recruited by ADOs,
given full-time work schedules and expected to be accountable to DOA.  In AERP,
the AAs' work schedule was basically the standard T&V fortnightly series of
visits, except that they visited a different block on each ninth day of a
fortnight  (instead of the usual eight).   They held only one field staff
meeting/training session each fortnight resulting in it being used mainly for
bureaucratic matters and thus reducing its effectiveness as part of the training
and technical information transfer system.
175.      When HFPP started, AAs' schedules were similar to those in AERP, but
reduced to six blocks during the fortnight because of the time needed to travel
by foot to meet contact farmers. In some cases, MAs visited "contact points"
where contact farmers were supposed to gather. This approach failed as farmers
were not prepared to walk to meeting places.
176.      These schedules expected too much of true volunteers.  AAs are now
demanding to be recognized and paid as civil servants.
Use of Contact Farmers
177.      Contact farmers seem to have been reasonably representative  (see
following table). Although it is unlikely that all AAs kept strictly to their
work program, the vast majority of contact farmers (97% in AERP and 88% in



51
HFPP7/) could at least name their AA. The majority of non-contact farmers also
knew their AA (80% in AERP and 68% in HFPP), but only few knew their JTA or JT.

Soutce: APROSC. Sustainability of Training and Visit Syecm of Agriculural Extension Approach in Nepal, 1987.
Since the failure of "contact points," staff in both projects, but particularly
in HFPP, have recently started using contact groups of 10 to 15 farmers, each
with a common objective.
178.      In general, contact farmers were not used effectively.  They were seen
mainly as the end-point of extension activity rather than the starting point of
information transfer through the farming community. Little attempt was made to
upgrade their knowledge or develop their skills in any systematic way, limiting
their ability to transmit useful information to other farmers. Little attempt
was made to tap contact farmers' knowledge about local farming, discover what new
ideas they (or other local farmers) were trying for themselves, or identify their
needs and aspirations. The recent introduction of contact groups should increase
level of contact, improve farmer participation and make extension more farmer-
oriented.
Use of Trials and Demonstrations
179.      Most trials and demonstrations were not relevant to farmers' needs as
they gave little consideration to actual and perceived constraints. Too many
different types were planned to be managed effectively, and frequently JTs/JTAs
had little real understanding of what they were supposed to achieve or to
demonstrate.
180.      These weaknesses did not mean that the trials and demonstrations were
useless.    Contact  farmers  learned  from varietal  trials  and  comparative
demonstrations, simply by having them on their farms.  Many farmers visited
demonstration points informally, and field days enabled others to see and compare
different varieties and practices.
Use of Extension Aids
181.      In AERP, staff were issued a basic set of audio-visual aids but not
taught how to use them, so they remained largely unused. Sub-centers usually had
a blackboard and, in HFPP, most ASCs had a flip chart, but few staff made their
own series of flip charts to use as teaching or extension aids.  SMSs provided
AAs with guidelines after fortnightly training sessions but these were usually
general and  theoretical, sometimes based on SMSs' old university notes.  They
v/ APROSC Survey, 1987.



52
seldom dealt with the practical issues AAs would face over the following two
weeks.
Su2ervision
182.      Supervision was generally weak.  ADOs were technically competent and
experienced and should have spent most of their time supervising and assisting
junior staff. However, they were in general overburdened with administrative
duties, and transport was frequently commandeered by police or the Chief District
Officer.   In AERP, SMSs became major supervisors, yet they did not have the
expertise to help on technical matters, had no training in extension to assist
staff in professional communication skills, and were frequently constrained by
lack of transport. JTAs should have been able to supervise their AAs regularly
but many lacked the motivation to do so. In HFPP, JTAs were physically unable
to supervise their AAs on a regular basis being based at ASCs, and ADOs could not
regularly supervise any JT or JTA who worked any distance from the road.
Control
183.      As  extension programs  were  simply  target  numbers  of  extension
activities, performance was monitored relative to target achievement.   Any
shortfall from the target required an explanation to DOA by the relevant member
of staff.   This was largely ineffective:  conscientious   members of staff
fulfilled their target obligations whether there was need to do so or not; those
not so conscientious reported false target achievements.   Also, despite the
procedure, there was no disincentive for poor work. Control should be based on
developmental objectives, not numerical targets.
General Conclusions and Recommendations
184.      Field level operations were generally poor.  It is recommended that:
(a)  DOA reappraise its recruitment policy and training to upgrade the
quality of staff entering the service.
(b)  Thorough in-service training be provided so that field staff have the
knowledge and skills to implement all strategies employed by DOA.
(c)  Trials and demonstrations be reduced in number and priorities assigned
so that they can be properly managed by appropriately trained field
staff.
(d)  Supervision be given higher priority and be seen as a means of
assisting and training field staff.  It should concentrate on work
quality and therefore take place when staff are involved in actual
extension activities.
(e)  ADOs be released from excessive administrative duties.

Relevance of APRlied Research and Extension
Commercial Agriculture
185.      Regional Research Stations are mainly located in the Terai and are
commodity specific. Their work concentrates on varietal improvements, fertilizer
usage and, to a lesser extent, plant protection and simple cropping patterns.
Findings used as extension recommendations were mostly for grain crops grown
under irrigated conditions, relying heavily on the use of modern farm inputs and
thus mainly applicable to commercial production.
186.      Because station objectives were based on target achievements, research
was undertaken in a limited range of topics, particularly those that were quick
and easy to study. This led to repetition of standard topics and the neglect of
investigations that would have been complex, costly or time-consuming, including
cultural practices, particularly minimal input systems, mechanization, on-farm
storage and processing. Because topics focused on individual commodities, they
ignored issues related to farm management, diversification, water management and
farming systems. Rainfed agriculture received little attention, even though it
constitutes 80% of Nepalese agriculture.
187.      The   outreach   program  being   initiated  by  NARC,   which   is
multidisciplinary, should help resolve many of these weaknesses. Non-government
institutions, notably LAC and Phumbi Bhumbi, investigating farm systems for the
Hill areas and basing their research programs on diagnostic surveys, should be
closely linked to DOA extension activity in Hill districts (as in HFPP).
Subsistence Agriculture
188.      l'.st research and almost all recommendations were for cash crops.  In
general subsistence agriculture was neglected; even recommendations for vegetable
cultivation were primarily aimed at the growing of vegetables as a cash crop.
189.      In most HFPP areas, holdings are too far from potential markets for
commercial  agriculture  to  be  viable.        Nevertheless,  the  majority  of
recommendations were input-dependent, going against the SAR objective to promote
low-cost, labor-intensive agricultural practices.
Women Farmers
190.      Both AERP and HFPP  tended to ignore women farmers,  yet a high
proportion of women were left to manage farms when men obtained off-farm
employment (see following table).

Women in general were more active in agriculture and involved in preparing the
land, planting, weeding, harvesting and storing crops, while men participated
only in planting and harvesting. However, extension staff contacted mainly male
farmers and did not consider female needs, e.g., time and labor reduction.
191.      While farming was female-dominated the extension service was male-
dominated (DOA employs only 40 female JT/JTAs out of a total complement of
2,290).   MOA has now appointed a woman as coordinator to increase female
participation and specified that 10% of all national training programs and
seminars be specifically for women, and that local training courses should be 25%
women.  Women seldom attend courses because of social constraints and their
already heavy work burden, although attendance at single-day training courses is
slowly increasing in Hill districts where women are normally more outgoing than
women in Terai. In HFPP districts, women are more likely to ask the advice of
male extension workers - but male extension agents do not make a point to visit
women farmers or farm families.
Farmers' Financial Situation
192.      Farms in both AERP and HFPP districts are small (see table below), and
many produce only food for subsistence.

The financial situation of holdings often makes it uneconomic for farmers to use
input-dependent technology.   A high proportion are tenants, reported to be
between 20% and 80%, according to the district. In high potential areas of HFPP,
tenants commonly purchased all inputs, yet they paid landlords 50% of gross
production. In areas of low potential, landlords expected 60%.
193.      Most institutional credit in Nepal is captured by large farmers while
medium and small farmers rely heavily on friends and moneylenders; yet, they do
not use credit for income-generating activities.

These conditions, with a probable high rate of indebtedness (among most farmers),
reduced the validity of input-dependent technology to many farmers - yet most
research, and the vast majority of recommendations in both projects, were input
dependent, often demanding relatively high rates of cash investment. Recently,
LAC started investigations into minimal input technology for Hill areas.
Recommendation Specificity
194.      There was a tendency in both AERP and HFPP to provide farmers with
single specific recommendations.   In the lowland areas of AERP, this seems
appropriate as recommendation domains based on geo-agricultural criteria are
wide. However, farmers, requirements differed considerably on economic grounds;
subsistence farmers, those with unfavorable tenancy agreements, or heavy debt
repayment burdens, required different recommendations. A range should have been
provided varying from high cost/optimal production, to secure low-risk production
from minimal  inputs.   Farmers could then have selected the option most
appropriate for them. Research findings and recommendations should have been
judged by economic, as well as technical criteria; however, research stations did
not employ agricultural economists.
Fertilizer Recommendations
195.      Fertilizer  recommendations  usually  specified  NPK  ratios,  but
frequently the recommended type of fertilizer was unavailable, often leading to
inappropriate use and loss of extension worker credibility.   Government's
procurement and distribution policy requires adjustment to ensure that
recommended types are available.
196.      In contrast to the Terai, HFPP districts consist of a multitude of
micro-zones. In such conditions, general recommendations are inappropriate.
Farmers have to be offered a choice of options, ideally devised after some form
of diagnostic study in collaboration with local farmers.
Conclusions
197.      Relevance of research activity and recommendations in AERP.  In AERP,
research  and  thus  extension  recommendations  concentrated  on  irrigated
agriculture, particularly on new varieties, mainly cereal crops. Some were taken
up by farmers, particularly those that enabled an additional crop to be grown,
but adoption rates were generally poor.



56
198.      Little effort seemed to have been made to match research work to
farmers' needs  or  to  SAR  objectives.    Most  research  investigations  and
recommendations were input-dependent, thus benefitting the larger owner farmer
and those with irrigation,  to the detriment of the majority.   Even though
researchers were acquainted with farmers, problems at monthly training sessions,
they seemed unprepared to investigate them.
199.      DOA's planning and control procedures, which were based on targets
(usually a percentage increase o-er the previous year's work in the numbers of
all types of investigations), enLoiraged researchers to build a program of quick
and simple investigations, whereas most farmers' problems are complex and need
long-term investigation.
200.      Research stations did not produce long-term research strategies, and
investigation work was piecemeal and rather superficial, not a driving force
towards a common goal. The combined requirements of large numbers of
investigations with low budget allocation, together with attitudes that held
research separate from farmers problems, and the lack of research strategies,
resulted in the selection of investigations that fitted low-cost/fast-result
criteria rather than farmers, needs.
201.      Relevance of research activity and recommendations in HFPP.  When HFPP
started, the situation was even worse, for many of the recomnended practices had
been  developed  for  the  Terai.    Since  the  inclusion  of  LAC  in  1987,
recommendations have become more relevant and more specific to altitude.
Investigations have been undertaken in farming systems, in rainfed and irrigated
agriculture, in zero tillage and in minimal input technologies.  Results will
take time but should be highly relevant to farmers    Slow adoption was not
usually caused by lack of information, but by recommended technology that did not
respond to the needs of most farmers. Many farmers activelv sought their own
ways of improvement,  but  their developments  usually went  unrecognized by
extension staff and were not incorporated into research or extension programs.
General Recommendations
202.      In neither AERP nor HFPP did research, and consequently extension
recommendations, match general farming requirements. Some improvements were made
in HFPP after 1987 through the inclusion of LAC.  To amend this, HMGN could
consider the following:
(a)  Researchers should involve the active participation of farmers in
diagnostic field investigations.
(b)  Extension staff should find out why farmers do not accept recommended
practices and report the reasons to researchers via SMSs at bi-monthly
workshops.
(c)  Senior researchers should be involved in bi-monthly workshops so that
they are made aware of farmers' problems and expectations, and the
constraints they face in adopting recommendations.
(d)  Research programs should abandon numerical target figures as their
objective, and use objectives aimed at improving commodity production,



57
whole-farm development and/or profitability according to the
priorities of various farmer categories.
(e)  When  socially  acceptable,  extension  staff should  increase  their
contacts with women farmers.
Ouality of Staff
Qualifications and Experience
203.      ADOs were generally well qualified, most with a Master's degree,
specializing in extension. All were experienced (in AERP averaging 14 years) but
mainly in other districts (see following table).

ADOs were generally competent and interested in assisting their farmers but
overwhelmed by administrative duties; their high level of professionalism and
leadership was not adequately utilized.
204.      The majority of AADOs had a B.Sc. degree while a few had a M.Sc. in
general studies.   None was specialized in extension.   They were young and
recruited fresh to the project.  Researchers and SMSs had a B.Sc. degree in
general agriculture which was of too low a standard and too theoretical for



58
practical use, particularly by SMSs. Researchers had no time to develop research
portfolios so they had nothing new to teach SMSs - which meant that SMSs had
little to teach the JTs, JTAs and AAs. SMSs were not specialists but general
agriculturalists posted to fill vacant positions.
205.     JTs were secondary school graduates who had generally two year's of
additional agricultural training (see table below).   This training was too
theoretical for the work expected of them.  Most JTAs were secondary school.
graduates with one year's additional training in agriculture, but many only had
a basic secondary school qualificatio:i with a pass mark in the secondary
agricultural examination.

The majority of AAs were pr-actical and experienced farmers, well able to assist
their farming communities.  Most of them had completed 6-10 years secondary
schooling plus a one-month induction course in agriculture.
Quality of Training Within the Extension Program
206.     Training was structured along standard T&V lines.  Differences were:
(a)  SMSs were taught at bi-monthly rather than monthly workshops.  This
longer time interval was acceptable, given the quality of teaching
staff and farmers' needs for most information during two relatively
short periods of the year -- before planting their summer and winter
crops; SMSs needed concentrated training prior to these periods (see
(d) below).
(b)  ADOs attended bi-monthly workshops.   This increased the value of
workshops, as it utilized ADOs' high level of qualification and
expertise, enabling them to share their knowledge about the farming
population and local applicability of agricultural technology.
(c)  One field-staff meeting was held each fortnight instead of two.  As
there was only one, both training and administration were compressed
into tt.e one meeting, with most time spent on reporting activities and
on general administration, to the detriment of training.
(d)  Two pre-season workshops, classified as training sessions were held
each year. They were part of the research outreach program planning
process, not training sessions.   There was, however, a need for
concentrated training of staff at this same time, oni topics of special
importance to the coming season's extension activity (see (a) above).



59
(e)  In HFPP, JTAs and AAs were trained by JTs.  This practical adjustment
was introduced to meet the difficulties SMSs had in travelling by foot
over long distances and difficult terrain.
207.      Quality of training was mixed.  At fortnightly and bi-monthly meetings
much time was spent discussing the past program, diagnosing past problems, and
formulating possible solutions. This should have been very valuable, but the
sessions tended to be superficial and routine, and staff indicated that they
learned little of practical use.
208.      Impact points  selected by   researchers  for bi-monthly  training
sessions were meant to be transmitted by SMSs to JTs, JTAs and AAs at fortnightly
training sessions. They were produced prior to the workshop, before discussion
of the current situation and farmers problems, but few were sufficiently specific
to be useful.
209.      Quality of bi-monthly workshops depended on the researchers having a
high level of knowledge and experience to share with SMSs to transmit to JTs,
JTAs and AAs. Because this factor was missing, the flow of information did not
occur.   Some specialists spoke at bi-monthly workshops on general subjects
usually not related to specific current extension activity. Normally, SMSs could
not use these sessions as a basis for teaching junior staff.
Conclusions and Recommendations
210.      ADOs' knowledge and skills were under-utilized, but with the necessary
administrative assistance, ADOs could provide leadership, guidance and
supervision to field szaff.
211.      AAs were generally experienced farmers well respected in the farming
community.   They did not achieve their full potential as they were poorly
supervised and guided, poorly trained, and did nor receive sufficieat technical
backstopping.    Pre-service  training  of  all  staff  does  not  meet  DOA's
requirements.   It is recommended that this training be reviewed by MOA as a
matter of urgency, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education.
212.      SMSs, JTs and JTAs had a low level of technical knowledge.   Good,
regular,  in-service training was needed for project success,  but was not
provided. It is recommended that senior researchers with practical experience
of their locality be made responsible for planning training programs on technical
topics emphasizing the practical aspects of topics especially important over the
next two months of extension work.
213.      SMSs also need to be taught practical technical skills, and trained
in extension methodology and communication skills.  An experienced extension
worker, probably an ADO, should be responsible for planning these programs.
C. Linkages of Extension and Research
Linkage Mechanism
214.      Central and District Technical Committees were established to link
extension and research activities. SMSs and ADOs attended bi-monthly training
sessions at regional research stations and six monthly regional workshops.



60
Structures were provided to take farmers, problems to research and to transmit
new technology and solutions to farmers. Extension staff were also involved in
decisions about adaptive field trial programs, and research staff were involved
in their implementation.
215.      In both AERP and HFPP, the basic linkage mechanism was established as
per their respective SAR, but it did not function effectively.
216.      Outreach programs were established and usually delegated to junior
research staff, often on temporary employment.  Therefore they spent much of
their time seeking permanent employment elsewhere, leading to a high turnover of
staff and disruption of the program. As junior staff were normally involved in
bi-monthly workshops, while senior researchers planned the research program, the
l_nkage mechanism between farmers and research programming was broken.
217.      NARC's objectives and priorities did not necessarily coincide with
DOA's, resulting in regional research objectives not always matching those of
extension. They also led researchers to feel that their main work was separate
and distinct from local extension needs and farmers' requirements. Because of
this attitude, plus the low motivation of junior researchers, and lack of
transport, few researchers spent much time working with extension staff on
adaptive field trials, and that link was also weakened.
Bi-Monthly Workshops
218.      Bi-monthly workshops should have provided the greatest opportunity for
linkage but because of the problems discussed earlier (para 209), linkage was
weak.
The Research Program Plan
219.      Regional on-station and off-station research programs were planned by
senior researchers prior to regional workshops, where only minor modifications
were made to the olitreach program, usually limited to negotiating the number of
trials that extension staff were expected to supervise. Senior researchers who
planned research programs were often unaware of farmers' problems raised at bi-
monthly workshops, and frequently felt that research was, in any case, above
problems facing farmers.
220.      These weaknesses should be partially resolved now that all regional
research stations are mandated to have outreach programs, coordinated by the
Farming System Research Division of NARC. The major difficulty will be to change
the attitudes of researchers who believe that the outreach program and time
spent on farms and with farmers hinder their "real" research work at the station.
The Research Outreach Program
221.      The present program of adaptive trials has many weaknesses and NARC
has stipulated that all RRSs have an outreach program based on a system similar
to that used by LAC but are seeking cheaper alternatives.
222.      The community-based approach being tested by the Nepal-Australia
Forest Project is much cheaper, with the initial analytical work being
facilitated by field-level extension staff. It is recommended that NARC use this



61
approach and investigate why current recommendations are not being adopted.
Different emphasis would be used for the Terai and the Hills.
223.      As there are relatively few technical recommendation domains in the
Terai, a small number of LAC-type investigations (based on initial analyses of
problems, potentials and priorities of different categories of farmers) would
probably be sufficiertly representative. Where appropriate technologies have
been developed, they could be disseminated through the normal program of trials
and demonstrations, but with uptake closely monitored for each sub-group, and
reasons for non-adoption collated and analyzed.
224.      In  the  Hills,  where  agriculture  is  much  more  complex  and
recommendation domains are very narrow, large numbers of diagnostic studies will
be needed.  They will have to be inexpensive and of such nature that regular
field staff can undertake them. The community-based approach, or problem census
or simplified "Rapid Rural Appraisal" could first be used to identify problems,
potentials and priorities of clusters of farmers with similar farming systems and
financial resources.
225.      Farmers should then decide, with the assistance of extension staff and
researchers, what might be an appropriate step forward - and simply try it on a
small scale.   It would be carefully appraised by the farming group and by
extension and researchers to identify any weaknesses. It could be rejected, or,
if promising, it could be modified (or constraints countered) and tried again,
until it fits the group's requirements. This is a rough and ready approach, one
that closely links research, extension and farmers, with the farmers playing an
equal role in most activities but a dominant role in decision making. It does,
however, depend on extension and research staff being willing to accept farmers
playing a lead role in the process.
SuDDortina Azencies
226.      As the system developed by AERP and HFPP was solely for extension,
other agencies were needed to provide essential services. Linkages were complex
(Chart 2, page 66) and meant to be achieved through the National, Regional and
District Coordination Committee (DCC) Meetings. This linkage was very weak and
coordination was poor.  Committee members saw themselves as equal in status;
there was no recognized senior person to call the meeting, encourage
participation, or direct and control discussion. At meetings, members told the
others what their organization had achieved and what they intended to do in the
coming period. They came with finalized plans and had no intention to modify
them. The only time when DCCs were said to function well was when one agency had
a problem it asked the others to help resolve.
Commercial Organizations
227.      Linkage with commercial organizations is limited.   In the Terai,
dealership networks are spreading, but they are not yet sufficiently developed
to employ technicians to advise farmers; this will probably come soon. Marketing
networks are well established in the Terai, but need to be encouraged in the
Hills. Occasionally, Sajhas have allowed buyers to use their warehouses. This
should be encouraged as marketing should be given first priority. Input sales
could similarly be encouraged in the Hills by allowing traders to hire AFC
buildings for limited per.ods, or use AFC sites as local sales points.



62
228.      In order that traders can stock recommended items, they need to be
informed of expected increases in input use, especially when a new product is to
be recommended, or brands or types (e.g., insecticide) specified.
229.      Managers of retail outlets need to be trained so that they can give
appropriate advice to farmers.   As there is no one else able to give this
training, it is recommended that DOA consider providing it.   If it is good
enough, traders would probably pay at least the cost.
D. Issues and.Follow-Up
Issues
230.      The basic infrastructure and systems of AERP and HFPP have been
established as specified in the SARs but are functioning well below expectation.
Key reasons are:
(a)  Failure to manage the system as a whole.  It is recommended that the
PC (now coordinating all projects) and new assistant, visit similar
projects in other countries to investigate systematic management, and
attend intensive short courses of training on organizational
management and main management.   Coordinators of future projects
should be recruited according to managerial ability, receive training
and be provided with technical assistance to operationalize the
system.
(b)  Poor staff quality.  It is recommended that MOA:
(i) Review pre-service training with the Ministry of Education.
(ii) Reconsider its recruitment policy.
(iii) Provide additional experienced trainers and operational funds to
training centers.
(iv) Examine reasons for staff's low motivation and rectify problems.
a. Negative attitudes towards coordination and cooperation, and
attitudes of sup, tority towards farmers.
b. AERP and HFPP regarded as time-bound projects, not programs
for the development of sustainable systems of extension
management.
(c)  Project management's concentration on achieving targets for individual
components rather than on the system as a whole.
(d)  Failure to introduce a farm management perspective in extension and
research establishments which are dominated by a purely technical
perspective.
(e)  Program planning, monitoring and evaluation, and control  based on
achievement of numerical targets instead of developmental objectives.



63
(f)  In its implementation, the systen, remained top-down.
(g)  Feedback to research has not been effective in focusing research, and
consequently recommendations, on farmers' problems.
(h)  Senior researchers' negative attitude towards extension and farming
problems.
(i)  Ineffective supervision, particularly in HFPP by JTAs who were housed
at ASCs, away from their villages.
231.      Staff salaries, particularly for junior staff, are a major cost burden
in all projects. HMGN needs v.o reconsider JTA:AA and JT:JTA ratios, which were
very generous in AERP and HFPP. New ratios will depend on the future role of
AAs, but in the Terai both ratios could be closer to the normal 8:1, and in the
Uills nearer 5:1.
232.      HMGN is facing additional  large  increases  to its  salary burden
through:
(a)  AAs demanding full government salary, pension rights and regular civil
servant privileges.   It is believed that HMGN will reject their
demands, with the result that DOA will have to abandon its present
method of using AAs.  If this happens it is recommended that, after
a suitable lapse, communities be encouraged to select volunteers to
work for them (and not paid by DOA).
(b)  Ideally,  the AAs' main incentive would be status/pride in being
selected by the community to help in its development.
233.      Other incentives would include:
(a)  The belief that knowledge and skills gained as part of AAs' volunteer
work would resuit in them improving their own farming methods and
increasing their profits.
(b)  DOA providing, at the end of training courses, materials and small
tools for lead farmers to practice what has been taught - with them
being free to hire out the tools at their own price.
(c)  Lead farmers being provided with large mini-kits of foundation seeds
when new varieties show promise, for them to multiply and sell at
their own price.
234.      If additional cash incentives from DOA are essential, they should be
channelled through a traditional or democratically elected local authority who
might also make a contribution, possibly in kind. This should be done to avoid
the belief that they are paid government employees.
235.      Separation of livestock and horticulture  from the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries. If each line has extension staff down to field level,
it will increase MOA costs considerably, probably to unsustainable levels, and
reduce efficiency. HMGN should:



64
(a)  Promote cooperative activity between DOA and DOLD/AH, so that pasture
and fodder crops can be covered by DOA staff.
(b)  Consider whether all three lines should go to field level or only to
SMSs, leaving ADOs, JTs, JTAs and AAs as generalists dealing with all
subject matters, except animal health, on a "whole farm" basis.
236.      Research and extension did not fulfill the needs of major categories
of farmers, particularly subsistence farmers and women farmers. FSR, combined
with Rapid Rural Appraisal is being more accepted for diagnostic purposes, and
NARC is exploring methods that are not too expensive and can be implemented by
present field staff. The need is to develop a participatory approach to planning
which promotes analysis, programming and evaluation by farmers, supported by
researchers and extension staff.   If this is done by homogenous groups of
farmers, it should result in research and recommendations more relevant to the
needs of all important sub-categories of farmers.
237.      At present, Regional Directorates are weak and often by-passed or
their decisions over-ruled. HMGN should consider their functions and determine
how they might be strengthened.
238.      In both AERP and HFPP, there were multiple lines of command.  Project
coordinators should be within the normal line of command. As projects deal with
horticulture, agriculture, livestock and, in the Hills, forestry, this position
needs careful consideration.
239.      Decentralization and control by local authorities created multiple
lines of command. If, after the elections of May 1991, local authorities are
given responsibility for local development activities, the respective roles of
local authority, DOA, the Project Manager and Regional Director, will have to be
clarified so that the single line of command is clearly distinguished from lines
of technical communication.
240.      Project time was too short and had to be extended thrice.  Essential
basic infrastructure was not in place when extension work started.   It is
recommended that the project period be increased to at least eight years and the
lead-in period lengthened to allow infrastructure to be in place and staff
trained when extension work commences.
Follow-Up
241.      It is recommended that future action programs be phased as follows:
Phase 1   Improve the extension service (and related research) in the 23 project
districts,  in line with the recommendations given above.   Since
structures are established, what is needed now is functional
improvement -- which depends as much on the willingness of staff to
use the system as on their ability to do so.
Phase 2   Expand the improved system to the remaining districts of the Terai
(except Deng District which is being developed through USAID), plus
one district in the Eastern Hills. The Terai needs to be developed
first, as it has the greatest potential for return on investment. One
Hill District is included in this phase, in which to test the new



65
systems of diagnostic research and to improve and develop management
systems specific to Hill conditions.
Phase 3   Extend the project to the remaining Western Hill Districts.
Phase 4   Based on the experience gained under Phase II in the selected Easterr
Hill district, expand the project to all districts in the Easterr
Hills. This region is considered more suitable for the introduction
of a reoriented extension service because infrastructure, facilities
and communication are considerably more developed there than in the
Mid-Western and Far Western Development .egions.

The number of beneficiaries has not been sufficiently well monitored to give exact figures. The increase is due
to population increase during the project period.
B. Economic Impact
In line with the approach of other agricultural extension/research projects, no ERR calculation was carried out
at appraisal. The SAR states, however, that the project would be able to generate a 50% rate of return if, by
1988, foodgrain yields increase by only 13 kg/ha. Even considering the limitation of the available agricultural
statistics, it can be assumed that this increase has been achieved.

Comments: Due to the lack of impact evaluation, it was found impossible to determine a sufficiently
accurate benefit stream for the project as a whole. Therefore, the ERR has been re-estimated for the
irrigation component only.
