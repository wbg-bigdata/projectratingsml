REPORT AND RECOiThENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORST ON A
PROPOSED DEVEL:9,P iiT CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A FLUE-CURED TOBACCO PROJECT
I submit the followlring report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an anount in various currencies equivalent to $9.0 million to
the United Republic of Tanzania for a flue-cured tobacco project.
PAR'T I - HISTORICAL
2.        Although flue-cured tobacco has been grown successfully in
Tanzania since the early 1950's it has only been in the past few years
that, wfith support from the Government, the crop has gained importance
as a useful contributor to foreign exchange earnings. During this period
the Government has been endeavoring to devise a strategy for the systematic
developmnent of flue-cured tobacco production in Tanzania and its sale on
world mairkets. The proposed project is the result of this endeavor.  It
7as prepared by the Government w;ith assistance from the Bank's Permanent
Mission in East Africa (PIEA) and was appraised for possible IDA financing
at the Covernment's request in October/November 1969.
3.        Forrial negotiations for the proposed credit took place in lH7ash-
ington in April 1970. The Tanzania delegation consisted of Miessrs. E. A.
Iulokozi, Principal Secretary, Iviinistry of Agriculture, Food and Coopera-
tives; I. M. Kaduma, at that time Deputy Principal Secretary, Hinistry
of Finance; R. A. Lyatuu, Chief .`gricultural Officer, Iiiinistry of Agri-
culture, Food and Cooperatives; S. T. MaJiti, Senior State Attorney,
Attorney General's Chambers; 0. S. Niaundi, Assistant Secretary, Miinistry
of Finance; V1. INakame, Manager, Nation-l Development Credit .gency (NDCA);
P. J. H. Linsey, Chief Accountant, NECA: and G. P. H.Lugissa, Executive
Officer, Tang anyika Tobacco Board.
4.        The proposed credit would be the eighth credit provided by the
Association to Tanzania., which has also received twro Bank loans. The
position of these loans and credits as of A'.ugust 31, 1970, wjas as follows:

1/  This credit, ori-inally $38.0 million, wias increased to $'5.5 million
in November, 1969.
.The Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No. 80 TA) encountered
initial delays, principally due to staffin- shortages and organizational
problems affecting the National Eevelopment Credit AEency, the channel for
the Credit.  Action to resolve these difficulties has been taken and
performance has since improved. Steps have also recently been taken to
strengthen NDCA's financial structure.  The 4ssociation has agreed to
postpone the closing date for the Credit frora December 31, 1969 to
June 30, 1971. Since NDCA would also be the channel for credit under the
presently proposed project, its position is discussed in more detail
below (paras. 18-21).
6.        Implementation of the Second Education Project (Credit No.
149 TA) was held up by a C-overnment request for amendments to the Project,
to which the Association agreed in May 1970 (IDA/R70-8 dated March 19, 1970).
The Ranch Development Project (Credit No. 132 TA) also started slow,,ly,
mainly because of a reorganization of parastatal organizations in Tanzania,
which necessitated amending the Development Credit Agreement, and delays
in obtaining satisfactory land titles for the Project Ranches. TIore rapid
progress should be achieved in the future.  Delays occurred in recruiting
experts to be financed under Credit No. 115 TA for the staffing and training
program of the Roads and Aerodrome Division of the Niinistry of Commaunica-
tions, Labour and WJorks. Satisfactory arrangements for the recruitment
of the required experts have now been made.

7.        Further projects in Tanzania under active consideration for
Bank/IDA financing during fiscal year 1971 include an agricultural
education project and a major hydro-electric power project.
8.        In addition to the lending set out in paragraph 4 above, the
Bank has made six loans for common services in East Africa. All of these
loans are guaranteed jointly and severally bv Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda;
the United Kingdom is also a guarantor of the first loan for the East
African Railways. The following is a summary of Bank loans for common
services as of August 31, 1970:

PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       An appraisal report entitled "Tanzania - Flue-Cured Tobacco
Project" (No. PA-42A) is attached. The project consists of a comprehensive,
integrated program supported by substantial technical assistance, especially
at farm level, to increase smallholder flue-cured tobacco production in
Tanzania and provide satisfactory marketing arrangements for the enlarged
national crop. Institution - building is an essential part of the project,
the main components of which are:
(a)  the establishlment of some 15,000 new growers in 150 new
village communities, arranged in complexes of about ten villages each,
cultivating at full development 30,000 acres of tobacco;
(b) the construction of villar:e and on-farrmi infrastructure
comprising access roads, village water supplies, baling centers, curing
barns and grading sheds;



- 5 -
(c)  the establishment of some 15 cooperative societies, of
about 1,000 farmers each, to act as channels for the distribution of
farm credit and other inputs and to supervise baling;
(d) the provision of credit for on-farm seasonal inputs and
infrastructure and for working capital for the cooperatives;
(e) the provision of staff for project planning and management,
for extension services for farmers and cooperatives, for training and
research and for NDCA and the Tanganyika Tobacco Board, together with
necessary facilities;
(f) the introduction of a system of tobacco auctions and
construction of an auction floor and additional tobacco storage and
processing facilities, following a study of these proposed new marketing
arrangeaents.
12.       The estimated cost of the project is $14.7 million, of which
some 60% would be financed by the proposed IDA Credit of $9.0 million,
about one-third by the Tanzania Government and the balance by the Tanganyika
Tobacco Board. The IDA Credit would cover the foreign exchange component
of the project estimated at $7.4 million and about $1.6 million of local
currency expenditure. Despite substantial efforts to mobilize local
resources Tanzania is not able to generate sufficient savings to fine'nce
all the local currency requirements of its development plans, and
in the   special circumstances as indicated in Fart V below, some external
financing of local expenditure is required. Disbursements of the Credit
would be spread over the six years 1970/71 - 1975/76, by the end of which
the settlement of new growers under the project would be completed.
During the following three years the project would give rise to an addi-
tional investment expenditure of $1.6 million for completion of on-farm
infrastructure, incremental seasonal credit and technical assistance.
Tanzania would finance this further expenditure itself.
13.       The project would expand tobacco production in Tanzania by
about 20 million lbs. to 45 million lbs. by 1978 and increase the value
of exports by $11.5 million, assuming a long-term tobacco price of TSh 4.20
per lb. dry weight f.o.b. Dar es Salaam. This price takes into account
the possible end of the embargo on Rhodesia tobacco and the
present trends in cigarette consumption. The economic rate of
return on the project would vary from about 12% to 37% over a range of
export prices from TSh 3.50 to 4.50 per lb. with a most likely rate of
30% at the assumed long term price of TSh 4.20 per lb.   Average export
prices during the 1969/70 crop year are expected to be about TSh 4.46 per lb.
1h.       The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Cooperatives would have
overall responsibility for the proposed project, and a Tobacco Project
Group headed by a Tobacco Project Officer wou]d be established under the
Ministry to execute the field aspects. Planning and survey of village



- 6 -
settlements would be carried out by a section of the Project Group headed
by a Senior Planning Officer. The appointmiient of persons to the positions
of Tobacco Project Officer and Senior Planning Officer with qualifications
and experience acceptable to IDA would be required prior to effectiveness
of the Credit.
15.       The 150 newr villages to be established under the project would
be grouped for administrative purposes into about 15 complexes, for each
of which a cooperative would be established to handle the distribution
of farm credit and inputs and to supervise baling of cured tobacco.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government would
make available all trained staff needed to assist with the establishment
of the villages and cooperatives and to help the farmers.
16.       The Tangany-ka Tobacco Board (TTB) and the Tanzania Tobacco
Processing Company (TTPC), twzo existing entities, would handle marketing
and processing. The Tanzania Government proposes to introduce auction
arrangements in place of the present system of selling the crop through
a foreign sales agent.  h study would be carried out under the project
to deterrine the size and timing of the construction of the auction
floor and of the additional storage and processing facilities required.
The study would also investigate the organizational, managerial and
training arrangements necessary for the effective operation of the proposed
facilities. Assurances have been obtained that the present arrangements
for marketing the crop would be continued until new arrangements have
been agreed betwJeen the Govermnent and IDA, in the light of -the study's
findings, for a smooth transition to an auction system. To prepare the
w:ay for the change-over, the Tanganyika Tobacco Board would be required
to appoint a Chief Marketing Officer, with qualifications and experience
satisfactory to IDAI, before the Credit would be made effective.
17.       The cost of constructing the proposed auction floor and additional
storage and processing facilities is tentatively estimated at $2.5 million,
of which 60%, that is $1.5 million, would be provided from the proposed
Credit.  However, no disbursement of these funds would be permitted until
after the results of the proposed marketing study had become available
and agreement reached with the Government on the design, cost estimates
and organization aspects.
18.       It is proposed that funds provided under the Credit for incre-
mental seasonal loans, medium-term loans for on-farm development and
long-term loans for the auction floor, storage and processing facilities
and the marketing study would be channeled through NDGA, wshich is the
executing agency for the ongoing Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No.
80 TA). NDCA already has considerable experience in providing credit
for tobacco and its performance in this area has been satisfactory. Its
financial position has recently been strengthened by the Government taking
over responsibility for bad debts inherited from previous credit organiza-
tions and resulting from unsuccessful Government loan schemes. Its staff



- 7 -
is also to be strengthened by -the appoint]nent of a financial analyst,
with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA, prior to effective-
ness of the proposed Credit.
19.       A limitation in the past on NDC1!Is ability to lend effectively
has been that its borrowers - the cooperatives and cooperative unions -
have themselves often been weakly managed and have not applied the neces-
sary financial discipline on their members. In addition, the technical
supervision of the recipient farmers by the Ministry of Agriculture's
extension services has sometimes been inadequate.  The situation requires
that NDCA's future lending programs be backed up by adequate management
and technical advisory services at the cooperative and farn levels.  These
services have accordingly been built into the proposed project.
20.       The amount of the proposed Credit wyhich would be channeled
through NDCA for use by farmers, cooperatives, TTB and TTPC is estimated
at $6.3 million. The remaining $2.7 million would be used directly for
expenditures on the project by the iPinistry of Algriculture, Food and
Cooperatives. The part of the proceeds of tlhe ID.! Credit to be administered
by ITDCA would be passed on to NDCA by the Government under a Subsidiary
Loan Algreement satisfactory to IDa, the completion of arrangements for
which would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA Credit.
This Subsidiary Loan Agreement woulcl provide that, because onf the need
to make seasonal credit available to the tobacco fermers year in and
yea-r out at the annual rate of about TSh 13 million ($1.8 million), the
first TSh 13 million of the IDA Credit uTould be passed on to NbDCA as
permanent capital in the form of a &rrant; the remaining funds would be
made available as a loan at 4 percent interest over 14 years, including
6 years' grace.  NDCA would charge interest on all its loans of
ft- per annum.
21.       The Tanzania Government has advised the Association that it
proposes to establish a new Rural Levelopment Bank in Tanzania which would
incorporate NDCA. The proposed structure of this new bank is under
consideration by the Government and the timin£ of its establishment has
yet to be determined. The Government's intention to set up a new bank
was fully discussed during negotiations for the proposed Credit.  The
standard provision has been included in the draft Development Credit
Agreement that the Credit may be suspended if the Government takes any
action to dissolve or disestablish rNDCA, or suspend its operations,
without the prior agreement of the Association on the arrangements to be
made in order to replace NDOA by an organization which will assume and
perform all of NDCA's obligations under thle Tobacco Project.  A similar
covenant is also contained in the Crecit Agreement for Credit No. 80 TA.
The Tanzania Government is fully awa?re of these provisions and has confirmed
that action to implement its proposal to establish a Rural Development
Banc will be taken only after mutually satisfactory arrangements have
been agreed.



22.       The Tanzania Government has rectl1ested that expenditure incurred
prior to signing of the Credit on three items should be reimbursed retro-
actively. These items are (a) aerial photography of certain parts of the
project area; (b) initial land plannin:; and (c) the study of the proposed
introduction of auctions for tobacco. An early start to these pre-investment
activities has been essential to ensure the timely implementation of the
project. I therefore reconrmmend that expe-nditure incurred on them after
hIarch 15, 1970 and prior to signing of the Credit should be eligible for
reimbursement. Assuming that the proposed Credit is signed about October 30,
1970 the amount involved in this retroactive fin2ncing would not exceed
$50,000.
23.       International com-npetitive bidding procedures wvould be followed
for the procurement of items to be financed under the proposed Credit,
with two exceptions.  First, buildings and water supply, valued in total
at about $1.3 million, would be procured through local competitive bidding,
since the individual amounts involved would be too small to attract
foreign firms. Secondly, followring extensive investigation of the
various alternative plant layouts available, TTFC is proposing to extend
its processing facilities by increasing the capacity of units in its
present processing line. International competitive bidding procedures
are not appropriate for such an extension and TTPC intends to procure
machinery costing about $510,000 for the extension by means of negotiated
contracts.  In the circumstances, I reconmmend that the Association accept
this procedure.  A local fertilizer plant is due to start producticn in
1971/72. Provision has been made in the draft credit documents for local
preference of 15% or the appropriate custoi,is duty, whlichever is lower,
for procurement of fertilizer.
PART IT - LEGAL INSTRU]vENTS AN AUTHORITY
24.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the United Republic of Tanzania, the draft Project agreement betreen
the Association, the National Development Credit Agency, the Tanganyi-ka
Tobacco Board and the Tanzania Tobacco Processing Company Iimited, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive
Mrectors separately.
25.       The provisions of the draft Development Credit and Project
Agreements generally conform to the pattern of Association agricultural
development credits of this type.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
26.       An economic report entitled "The Economic Development and
Prospects of Tanzania" (Report No. AE-7 in two volumes) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on March 24, 1970 (R 70-43). The principal
findings of this report were briefly summarized in the Report and Recom-
mendation of the President to the Executive Directors (Report No. P-805
dated May 1, 1970) in connection with a loan to the East African Posts
and Telecommunications Corporation. Updated Basic Data are attached.
27.       Tanzania's Second Five-Year Plan, launched on July 1, 1969,
provides for investment of Sh 8,055 million. The Bank's economic mission
which reviewed the Plan considered that it generally reflected the appro-
priate priorities in Tanzania although the total size was somewhat ambi-
tious since it represented about twice the investment which was actually
achieved during the previous Plan. However, the mission concluded, in
the light of Tanzania's growing capacity to prepare and implement develop-
ment projects,that a target of Sh 7,430 million would be within Tanzania's
reach and would deserve the support of aid donors. Tanzania would be
able to provide a substantial proportion of the necessary resources itself,
but some 30 percent would be required from abroad. M4any projects for
which external aid is likely to become available have a low foreign ex-
change component. Hence, if Tanzania is to succeed in mobilizing external
resources on the scale required, the aid received would have to cover not
only the foreign exchange cost of these projects, but a proportion of
their local costs as well. In the absence of such local cost financing,
investment on the scale which the economic mission considers both desirable
and feasible could not be attained.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEIENT
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
