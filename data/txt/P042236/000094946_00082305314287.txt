3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3. 1 Original Objective:
The main objectives of the Project as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) dated January 2, 1996 are
to: (a) help meet the rapid growth in electricity demand in the south of Vietnam through the addition of new
gas-fired generating capacity; (b) strengthen the high voltage (HV) transformation capacity in Vietnam; (c)
assist the Govemment in introducing private power in the country; (d) strengthen the institutional capability
of EVN through technical assistance (TA) and training; and (e) assist in the formulation of a national
strategy and master plan for rural electrification
The objectives were realistic in scope, relevant, important, and consistent with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (Report 18375) which sees IDA's role for the power sector as filling an important
niche not covered by other players in the sector. This includes financing of transmission and distribution,
and thermal power to the extent that the Bank Group could be instrumental in introducing private power
while simultaneously working with the Govemment in improving the legal and regulatory framework. The
project design is directly relevant toward achieving the above objectives.
A major achievement of the Project was in spearheading the introduction of private power in Vietnam by
the development of Phu My 2-2 through a joint venture/Build Own Transfer (BOT)-type of arrangement
(the bidding process is completed but negotiations with the successful bidder are still underway). In
addition, the Project supported two crucial investments in the power sector in Vietnam - Phu My 2-1
(2x15OMW gas turbines (GTs)) and HV transformer additions. The GTs assisted in relieving the power
shortages in Vietnam and the HV transformer additions reduced recurrent transformer overloading, thus,
improving quality of service.
The Govemment and IDA developed a staged program for sector reform under the Project and the Ministry
of Industry issued a policy statement for power sector reform dated August 12, 1997, which was an update
of the first policy statement issued on December 1, 1995. The staged reform program was intended to
gradually strengthen the financial health of the power sector to meet the huge investrnent and rural access
challenges being faced. It was recognized that the major economic, institutional and political challenges
occurring in Vietnam required the reforms in the power sector to be evolutionary rather than rapid and
immediate. In essence, it was recognized that while these reforms were not to be easy, they were
considered fundamental to embarking on a stable reforn process. Although much work has been done to
support reform implementation, in many areas, key decisions and government approvals have been
inordinately delayed. Institutional barriers to reform remain, but IDA and the Government are working
towards reforming the external environment and internal constraints facing the country.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives remained unchanged.
3.3 Original Components:
The Project financed: (a) the installation of 2xl 50 MW gas turbines for the first 450 MW Phu My 2,
Phase-1 PIHMY2-1 Combined Cycle (CC) power block; (b) addition of about 900 MVA of high voltage
transformation capacity at existing substations in the South of Vietnam and about 1,350 MVA of such
capacity in other parts of the country; (c) resettlement and compensation of persons affected by the Phu My
plant; and (d) consulting services for: (i) project design and supervision for Phu My; (ii) development of
BOT type of arrangement for the second CC power block of Phu My on the basis of competitive bidding;
(iii) technical assistance (TA) and training for EVN managerial staff; (iv) master plan for rural
electrification; and (v) technical studies for the Dai Ninh hydropower project. In addition, ESMAP group
-2 -



of the World Bank provided continuing technical assistance for development of a legal and regulatory
framework for the power sector. The original Project components were:
Component                            Total Project Cost
(US$ million)
2x1501 MW PHMY 2-1 gas turbine generators                           109.0
Transformer additions including switching/Control equipment and testing Equipment  72.0
Resettlement and compensation                                        1.0
Consulting services                                                  6.5
Technical assistance                                                 2.5
Miscellaneous (overheads, taxes and duties and local civil and erection works)  39.0
Total                                                                230
The above components were well designed and took into account the administrative and financial
management capability of EVN, the implementing agency. EVN had prior experience with Bank
procurement guidelines and procedures through the first Credit (Power Sector Rehabilitation and
Expansion Project, CR 2724-VN) and with power projects in the country at the time of project initiation.
3.4 Revised Components:
The original description of the components was not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Overall, quality at entry is rated as satisfactory. There is no QAG rating at entry available for the Project.
At appraisal, preparation of the technical and economic components of the Project had been advanced to a
satisfactory degree, and the level of readiness of all the project components was satisfactorily uniform in
terms of level of preparation. At the outset, several initiatives approved under the first Credit, have been
provided to assist the Government and EVN in restructuring the power sector and institutional
strengthening: (a) the Power Sector Reform and Restructuring Study supported by ESMAP, was intended
to assist the Government in developing a framework and sequence for reforming the sector; (b) TA to
improve the financial and accounting systems of EVN and the Power Companies (PCs) funded by ADB;
and (c) TA with JGF funding to support the commercialization and corporatization of EVN and the PCs.
These initiatives were the starting point for further TA planned under the Project and were aimed at
ensuring that the recommendations from these studies would be fully considered for implementation.
*   Consistency of Obiectives. The Project was consistent with the major objectives of the Government
Power Sector Policy, namely, to encourage and introduce private sector capital and direct participation
in the sector, to introduce an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the sector, to prepare
and implement a plan to bring electricity to rural areas, and to improve the technical and operational
efficiency of the sector through strengthening the sector institutions and moving them toward
commercialization and corporatization.
*   Risk Assessment. The Project clearly identified the risks associated with the Phu My component.
Risk mitigation measures for minimizing potential implementation delays for Phu My were exemplary:
The Phu My GT power plant was finalized in record time under controlled project management
arrangements. However, the Project underestimated the political requirements for securing a
long-term arrangement for gas supply for Phu My which was expected by end-of 1996 and was only
realized in December 1999. Several risks associated with the transformer additions component were
not identified at appraisal and, therefore, not mitigated: (a) the risk of forecasting errors in the
evaluation of the expected loading levels of transfonners which resulted in early overloading of some
- 3 -



additional transformers; and (b) the risk of a devaluation in the exchange parity of the SDR to the US
Dollar which resulted in inadequate fund allocation to cover committed and anticipated disbursements
under the component.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The outcome of the Project is satisfactory; the Project achieved to a satisfactory degree all relevant
institutional and physical objectives. It is noteworthy that the development objective (DO) rating of the
Project was downgraded from "satisfactory" to "unsatisfactory" in June 1998. This was due to the
uncertainty in reaching agreement with the Government on sufficient tariff adjustments that would enable
EVN to meet its main development objectives. However, this issue was resolved, when the Government
sent an official letter to IDA in August 1998, reaffirtning its commitment to the financial sustainability of
EVN and the PCs. The letter indicated Government's agreement to: (a) increase average retail tariff and
(b) maintain the self financing ratio of at least 30% during the period. Consequently, the DO rating was
upgraded to "satisfactory" in late 1998 and remained "satisfactory" until Credit closing on December 31,
1999.
Underlying the implementation of the Project, there were 20 legal covenants which were designed to: (a)
promote sector reforn and restructuring; (b) ensure the sustainability of EVN and the sector by requiring
compliance with financial ratios; (c) promote rural electrification, (d) promote private sector participation
by developing a joint venture/BOT type of arrangements; and (e) foster environmental sustainability. The
Government and EVN have complied with all but one of the covenants (i.e. self financing ratio less than
30%) under the Credit and Project Agreements.
Sectoral/Institutional Objectives
Assist the Government in the Introduction of Private Power. The introduction of private power in
Vietnam is a major accomplishment of this Project. The achievement of this objective is highly
satisfactory. IDA's successful strategy to predicate financing on a clear up-front policy decision by the
Government to introduce private power for the second block of Phu My bore fruit. The Government
acceded to IDA's request and competitive bidding for Phu My 2-2 CC, the first plant targeted for private
power participation, was satisfactorily concluded and resulted in competitive and favorable low price of
power obtained from Phu My bidders. The ICB process has been successful in introducing the concept and
procedures for ICB in BOT projects. While the ICB process provided one of the lowest prices for
electricity, the Government, MOI, and EVN have yet to conclude the negotiations and sign the contracts.
In addition to Phu My 2-2 CC, there are two other independent power producers now in commercial
operation (i.e. the 3x125 MW Hiep Phuoc, and the 7 MW Amata), one in which commercial operation is
expected in 2000 (i.e. 50 MW Nomura), and seven others for which PPAs have either been agreed or are
under negotiation.
Establishment of a Legal and Regulatory Framework. The achievement of the sectoral objective is
currently underway. Under the Project, a follow-up TA was provided to assist the Government in
identifying issues and options in creating a legal and regulatory framework for the power sector that would
be conducive to private sector participation. At negotiations, EVN agreed that it would review the
recommendations of the consultant study engaged by this TA and take necessary measures to implement the
regulatory framework and Electricity Law. As required, a Draft Overview of the Electricity Law was
prepared and forwarded to Ministry of Industry (MOI) in September 1996 and a first draft of the Law was
discussed with the Government in early 1997. The final Draft of the Law was completed by the Electricity
-4-



Law Working Group and is currently under review with the National Assembly; approval expected by early
2001. The passage of the Electricity Law was delayed by the backlog of other laws in queue at the National
Assembly and ongoing political debate in the structure and role of the regulatory agency. Nevertheless, the
process of drafting the legislative package and consultations on the content of the draft legislation are
progressing well. The landmark Law has resulted in the preparation of a primary Law and secondary
regulations on electricity pricing, licensing, formation of the regulatory authority, supervision and penalties,
and inspection of facilities. The framework is essential to successful private power development, however,
the massive legal, political, and organizational underpinnings, required to enact the Law was particularly
challenging.
It is to be noted that in drafting the electricity law and its attendant decrees, there was coordination with the
ADB who financed part of the TA necessary for the detailed drafting of the decrees while the Bank worked
on the draft of the Electricity Law.
Financial Obiectives and Compliance with Covenants. The financial objectives of the Project, as
reflected in the covenanted financial ratios, were substantially achieved. EVN's financial performance
since its creation in February 1995 has been satisfactory. Its profitability and strong perfornance are
reflected in the financial ratios: from FY96-98, operating margin (earnings before interest and taxes)
averaged 17%; return on average invested capital, 4%; and self-financing ratio, 36%.
EVN's financial projections during project appraisal were largely met. At appraisal, EVN projected
financial results to be satisfactory on the strength of robust sales, reduced system losses, efficient
implementation of the power development program and upward adjustment in tariffs. With this scenario,
it was assumed that EVN would be able to finance about 34% of its future investments from internal
sources. ]n spite of the regional financial crisis in mid-1997 and export stagnation which affected energy
consumption in all economic sectors, EVN continued to record satisfactory financial performance and
achieve strong earnings in FY98. Because of the continued growing demand for power, albeit at a slower
rate than pre-1997 pace, and increased revenues from electricity sales, sufficient revenues were generated
by EVN to cover all operating and maintenance expenses (including depreciation) and interest expenses.
Except for FY98, EVN was in compliance with all the financial covenants during the project period.
Despite positive operating results, however, audited figures showed that EVN fell a little short of its
obligation to contribute at least 30% of internally generated funds to investment, posting a self financing
ratio of 27% in FY98, The shortfall was caused primarily by an increase in working capital requirements
due to significant trade prepayments at the end of the year, which tied up necessary funds.
The financial strength of EVN and the power sector as a whole is a key development objective of IDA in its
involvement in Vietnam's power sector. Hence, the sector reform program required an increase in the
average rate of tariffs to reflect the true cost of electricity supply to consumers. The long-run marginal
cost of electricity was estimated in 1993 to be in the range of 7 US¢/kWh and the Government, at the time
of project appraisal, expressed its commitment to increasing tariffs to this level by 1999. Electricity tariffs
were raised periodically during the project period: in June 1995, April 1996, and May 1997. In January
1998, IDA approved the third Vietnam Credit for the Transmission, Distribution and Disaster
Reconstruction Project, which was conditioned on the Government's actual approval to raise electricity
tariffs to 7 US¢/kWh by 1999. However, while the Government agreed to the tariff conditionality during
negotiations, they were not prepared at Credit signing to be bound by a tariff increase within a year's time.
Furthermore, the impact of the regional financial crisis and continuing devaluation of the Dong against the
dollar, raised major concerns in the govemment. This led to an 18-month impasse, a delay in Credit
signing and a downgrading of the Project rating to unsatisfactory. After detailed discussions with the
Government, the issue was finally resolved and agreement was reached to raise average retail electricity
- 5 -



tariffs according to a progressive schedule: (a) 5.2 USO/kWh by July 1999; (b) 6.2 USO/kWh by July
2000; and (c) 7 US /kWh by March 1, 2001. In March 1999, EVN proposed a restructuring of tariffs
within categories and an increase in the average retail tariff to 5.2 USO/kWh and the Government approved
the proposal effective October 1, 1999.
Physical Objectives
The physical objectives were fully achieved. Phu My 2-1, completed in record time, assisted in meeting the
rapid growth in demand in the southern areas of Vietnam. The Project also added 2,447 MVA (SAR:
2,250 MVA) of transformer capacity which is now in operation, assisting in reducing the recurring
brown outs and improving the voltage profile in the system.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Physical Components
Construction of Phu My 2-1, 2x150 MW Gas Turbines and Status. This component was satisfactorily
carried out. Phu My 2-1 was executed by a turnkey contract through International Competitive Bidding,
the first such contract undertaken by EVN. Project management was satisfactorily carried out by the Phu
My Ba Ria Management Board (PMBRMB). Completion time for the Project was a record 419 days, in
keeping with its "fast-track" schedule. Unit 1 was synchronized on February 2,1997 and Unit 2 on
March 3, 1997. The GTs are currently operating on gas from the White Tiger field. The long-term supply
contract, according to the credit covenant, which was supposed to have been signed by December 1996,
was finally signed in December 1999, for a period of 17 years starting from the year 2000. Phu My 2-1
was developed initially as an open cycle gas turbine plant, with later conversion to combined cycle, giving a
final capacity of approximately 900 MW.
Annual unplanned interruption for maintenance was 2% in 1998 and 3.1% in 1999. A major overhaul of
both units was undertaken in 1999, and hence unit availabilities were down to 79% and 38% for units 1
and 2, respectively. For 1997 and 1998, plant availability exceeded the target of 85%. The units are well
maintained and operating staff is adequate and well trained to cope with any contingency in the plant.
Maintenance budget for the period 1997-1999 was about 28% of the operating budget.
Addition of transformer capacity and status. By Credit closing, 44 of the 46 substations were energized
and the assembly and installation works of the remaining two substations have been completed.
Procurement of goods was undertaken satisfactorily through ICB while local construction companies
performed the installation-works. Despite delays in finalizing the contract awards for the substations and
the regional financial crisis which affected delivery of some equipment this component has been, in the
main, satisfactorily carried out by the Northern, Central and Southern Power Projects Management Boards
of EVN  As all transformers and associated switchgear were installed in existing substations operating for
many years, land acquisition was not necessary. In addition, all transformer substations built followed
Vietnamese environmental and safety regulations and were approved by the local fire-Protection Authority.
The installation of transformers posed no significant environmental risk and no PCBs were used.
*   Northern Vietnam, five 220 kV and twelve 110 kV existing substations were extended, adding a total
transformer capacity of 1,410 MVA. A total of 15 substations were energized by December 1999 and
the Dong Anh 110 kV substation, which was transferred to Hanoi Power Company in May 1999, was
energized in June 1999. Only the Viet Tri 110 kV substation remained to be energized by Credit
closing date, with completion expected in March/April 2000. Financing for the balance of this work
will be undertaken by EVN.

*  Central Vietnam, one 220 kV and five 110 kV existing substations were extended, adding 207 MVA of
transformer capacity to the system. There was a 1 /2-year delay, for the I  0 kV substations, because of
the impact of the regional financial crisis on the suppliers who could not deliver the control and
protection panels.
* South Vietnam, three 220 kV and twenty 110 kV existing substations were extended, adding 830 MVA
to the system and improving the recurrent overloading and undervoltage situation in the network. All
substations except one were energized by Credit closing date. The My Tho substation was energized in
March/April 2000 with financing provided by EVN.
Environment and Land Acquisition
Phu My 2-1 is in compliance with social and environmental requirements. Social impacts have been kept
to a minimum, and the Project has improved the local infrastructure, as well as welfare of the project
affected people (PAPs): annual per capita income of the affected people rose five fold in the 4-year period
from 1995-1999: from D 890,000, at project appraisal to D 5,460,000 at project completion. About 80%
of the inhabitants in Phu My Township live on agricultural activities (i.e. fruit crops, cashew nuts, rice
cultivation, animal husbandry), fishing and salt production. Appraisal estimates for resettlement and land
acquisition factors (Tables 1 and 2 in Section 10) were close to the actual values, reflecting a thorough
analysis of the issues. According to the Township Development Plan, Phu My will become an urban area
which would include the Phu My Industrial Development area, comprising heavy industry, fertilizers, and
metallurgy, provide opportunities for employment, and further increase the standard of living of the PAPs .
In retrospect, the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) constituted a good basis for resettlement planning. No
major grievance was recorded.
As required in the Project Agreement, an environmental unit was set up by June 30, 1996. The following
environmental mitigation measures which were satisfactorily implemented:
* GTs are burning natural gas which is considered environmentally benign.
* GTs are equipped with low NOx burners and NOx levels have been kept below 25 ppm which
compares favorably with the appraisal figures of 50 ppm.
*  At night, noise levels range from 47-53 decibels (dBA) against the appraisal figures of 55 dBA.
*   Since oil spillage into the sensitive mangrove ecosystem is a potentially serious matter, oil deliveries
are inspected regularly by the local fire department.
*   Operating and maintenance procedures have been established for the delivery and inspection of oil and
an emergency response plan is also in place.
*  As required in the EIA, an environmental coordination and training program, and environmental
monitoring during construction and operation, were fully implemented. More information on
environmental data is available in Table 3, Section 10.
Technical Assistance
TA for the Development of BOT type of Arrangement for Phu My 2-2. The outcome of this TA is
satisfactory. Closing negotiations on the final arrangements for Phu My 2-2 are expected in July 2000 and
commercial operations by 2003.
TA for Rural Electrification Master Plan. The outcome of this TA is satisfactory. The TA was financed
by the Danish Government Consultant Trust Fund, the Danish Government Environmental Fund, and the
Bank's Asia Alternative Energy Program (ASTAE). It was aimed at providing assistance to the
Government in developing a national rural electrification strategy and implementation plan to extend
- 7 -



electric service to more than 65% of the population by the year 2010. The TA was completed in June 1999
and its findings and recommendations were used by EVN and IDA for the preparation of the Rural Energy
Project which was approved by the IDA's Board on May 30, 2000.
TA for Technical Studies for Dai Ninh. This TA was successfully carried out. With financing from the
Japanese Grant Fund, the objective of the TA was to assist the Government in making a decision on the
most feasible hydropower scheme under its Master Plan for hydropower development; and the development
of models for the optimization of the Dai Ninh Hydropower Project. The outcome of this TA would have
supported IDA's preparation work on a Dai Ninh Hydropower Project, but financing for the project was
taken over by OECF. The feasibility study, including detailed design and bidding document were finalized
and approved in December 1997.
IP Rating: Throughout the implementation of the Project, the Implementation Progress rating of the
project was "satisfactory". The implementation of the Project was accomplished in record time, there were
no procurement delays and disbursement perfornance was exemplary; reflecting the high coordination and
successful management of the Project.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Phu My Power Plant At appraisal, the Project was a priority project in the least cost power
development of the power system of Vietnam for the period 1995-2000. The economic rate of return
(EIRR) was based on the incremental economic cost and benefits associated with the entire
investment, including development of the transmission and distribution system in order to consume the
power generated by the Project. The EIRR at appraisal was estimated as 16.9%. Using the same
methodology as in the SAR, but with some adjustments in the assumption as deemed appropriate, the
EIRR was recalculated as 19%. In the SAR's base case, the gas price was assumed at
US$2.5 1/1,000 cu.ft., and the LRMC at the consumer end was 6.1 US¢/kWh. For this ICR, the
recalculation was based on the latest gas price of US$3.0/1,000 cu.ft. and LMRC of 7.0 USO/kWh.
The EIRR of the project is slightly higher than SAR estimates due to the following factors: (a) the
SAR assumed that the power plant would run on distillate oil for about 6 months after commissioning,
but in fact gas became available on the first day of the operation of the plant, (b) the LRMC of power
at the consumer end was higher than estimated, and (c) the actual output of the plant is slightly higher
than estimated.
Transformer Additions. At appraisal, the economic analysis for the transformer additions was based
on two scenarios: (a) " with the project", and (b) "without project". The EIRR was estimated at
appraisal as 42.6% for the southern region and 40.1% for the rest of Vietnam. Using the same
methodology and the same assumptions as the SAR, with appropriate adjustments, and with the actual
costs of the project, EIRR for these two components have been re-estimated as 34% and 22% for the
southern region and for the rest of Vietnam, respectively. The actual EIRR is lower than estimated
because: (a) the actual benefits streams occurred two year later than estimated in the SAR, and (b)
actual costs were higher than estimated.
4.4 Financial rate of return.
There was no financial rate of return calculation for this Project.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Project was instrumental in:
* maintaining Government's commitment to improving the commercial operation of the sector and for the
need to increase tariffs to reflect cost-based principles. The Government demonstrated its commitment
-8 -



by raising tariffs in October 1999; further tariff increases have also been agreed to;
* maintaining Government's commitment to power sector reform and restructuring which was started
under an ESMAP-funded TA under the Project. Government commitment to sector reform and
structuring remains strong; the primary electricity law and secondary regulations are being finalized
and are expected to be approved in early 2001;
* fostering private sector participation through the development of a joint venture/ BOT type of
arrangement for the next block at Phu My following a competitive process,
* improving customer service, including: prompt response and fair handling of customer complaints and
questions, in installing and managing the metering system; and
*   promoting good environmental practices by inter alia minimizing the environmental impact during
construction and operation of the gas turbine, properly disposing of PCBs in old transformers, and not
using PCB in new transformers.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
GDP growth in 1999 was the lowest growth rate in a decade. The slowdown in economic growth limited
the expansion in electricity demand to about 8% in 1998 and 1999, half the growth rate in the mid-1990s,
and led l,VN to lower its load forecast in the next 5 years.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
* Strengthening EVN managenent systems. The Government needs to undertake actions to improve
EVN's organizational and management system and increase independence. The Government recognizes
the problem and is slowly beginning to decentralize some decision-making. It is also focusing on staff
training to upgrade EVN's skill base;
_ Financial Sustainability of EVN. EVN financial sustainability is largely dependent on government
support through periodic tariff revisions. Without such support, EVN would not be able to generate
consistent cash flow to maintain its operations, service its debt, and fund future capital investments;
*   Large Investments of EVN. To sustain power sector growth, EVN must be able to meet the huge
capital investment of the sector. External financing and government support would not be sufficient to
support the investment needs of EVN. Hence, the Government should accelerate the pace of opening
the power sector to even greater private sector participation.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
* Weak coordination by EVN: Although Project Management was satisfactory, particularly the
coordination provided by the Project Management Units (PMUs), suppliers, contractors and
subcontractors, there were some problems with internal procedures which could have been solved
sooner if there had been stronger coordination by EVN;
* Equipment interface problens: This caused some delays in project implementation in the Northern
Region where Soviet-built equipment was replaced by western-built equipment (e.g. protection
relaying);
*   EVN operating andfinancing efficiency. Because of the capital intensiveness of EVN's business and
lengthy periods necessary to construct power facilities and networks, EVN requires extensive and
flexible capital planning systems. The ability to limit the use of debt is also dependent of EVN's skill
in managing construction projects and completing new facilities on schedule and within cost estimates.
5.4 Costs andfinancing.
Total project costs were estimated at appraisal at US$230 million. Actual project cost was US$216.2
million, a reduction of 6%. The main reduction in project costs was for the Phu My component which
was 15% lower than estimated and this was mainly due to: (a) procurement through ICB; (b) controlled
-9-



construction schedule; and (c) excellent project management resulting in the commissioning of Phu My 1,
Phase 1, in record time.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating.
Sustainability is rated as highly likely, considering that:
*   The GTs are operational and the long-term gas supply contract has been signed. Satisfactory
arrangements have also been made for maintenance and environmental control of emissions and
effluents from the GTs .
*   It is expected that the transformer additions will be productive for many years. The transformers and
other substation components financed under the Project are equipped with modem technologies, do not
need much maintenance, and in certain cases are even maintenance free. However, as some of the new
transformers are already overloaded, additional transformer capacity is needed urgently so as to
minimize the decreasing technical life of the transformers caused by conitinuous overloading.
*   EVN financial performance is satisfactory. EVN is projected to generate consistent cash flow to
service its debt, finance its operations, and fund its investments. A staged tariff increase would allow
tariffs to reach 7 US¢/kWh by March 2001.
* On the policy siLe the 14th Draft of the Electricity Law is expected to be approved by early 2001.
This Electricity Law would provide a clear structure for the sector and an adequate regulatory
framework, as well as enhanced private sector participation.
*   The institutional gains demonstrated by the realization of Phu My 2.2 under a joint venture/BOT type
of arrangement in promoting a competitive environment and in the low prices obtained from Phu My
bidders, would ensure the likelihood of lower prices through competitive bids for subsequent offers.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
All project components are now fully operational and appropriate technical provisions are in place to
ensure sustainable operation. The long-term gas supply agreement for Phu My 2-1 was negotiated and
finalized. Financial, economic, and environmental policies required for continued operation and
maintenance are also in place. Agreements have been reached on adequate electricity prices which will
ensure the financial health of EVN. The enactment of the Electricity Law providing a regulatory
framework is likely to promote a more commercial and stable environment and more efficient operation.
The performance indicators in Annex I are suitable for monitoring project operation. It is expected that no
future monitoring or other follow-up by IDA would be needed.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
IDA's performance in all phases of the Project is highly satisfactory. The project was identified in April
1995 during negotiations of the earlier project when the Government informed IDA of their need to
commission on a very urgent basis and in a staged manner, Phu My 2. The Government formally requested
the Bank to provide the funds for the Project on a fast track basis and to pre-appraise the project in July
1995. Various units of the Bank Group (i.e. FIAS, IFC, ESMAP, Region) participated in project
processing. IFC and ESMAP, particularly, worked closely with the Task Team on the project since the
- 10-



concept stage. The processing of the Project was particularly strenuous largely due to IFC's view that the
Project be redesigned (i.e. create a separate entity to own and operate Phu My which would include IFC's
participation in the capital structure at the outset). The issue was resolved with the Government deciding
that it was not prepared to risk possible delays with the IFC's proposal and that it was not ready to
establish a separate entity with a majority private ownership. However, the Government agreed to have
Phu My 2-2 constructed under a BOT approach, the condition laid down by IDA to ensure private sector
participation.
The project objectives fitted well with the prevailing sectoral objectives. Preparation and appraisal were
generally thorough; project appraisal was concluded in October 1995, the Credit was approved by the
Board on February 20, 1996 and the Credit signing took place on February 26, 1996. The entire project
preparation was accomplished on schedule and took 10 months.
The design of the procurement arrangements was straightforward, and the decision was right to allow
procurement of consulting services for the two GTs on a sole-source basis due to the tight schedule for the
commissioning of the two units. Although the appraisal recognized the risk in securing gas supplies, the
expectation that it could be concluded by the end of 1998 proved to be overly optimistic.
7.2 Supervision:
Overall, project supervision by IDA was highly satisfactory, with about two missions a year on average.
IDA's project team worked closely with both EVN and the Power Projects Management Boards. Project
supervision also benefited from decentralization of Bank work, i.e. the presence of a fully-functioning
energy team in the Bank's office in Hanoi.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Highly Satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's preparation of the Project is rated as satisfactory. The appropriateness and timing of the
Government's overall sector strategy was satisfactory. EVN, the Power Projects Management Boards, and
other entities involved in the Project were active in assisting IDA missions in the overall design and in
providing relevant inputs on technical, financial, economic, environmental, and institutional aspects. The
feasibility study for Phu My 2-1, prepared by consultants, was comprehensive and well prepared.
However, the preparatory work to determine the need of new transformer capacity to decrease the
overloads in the system was somewhat inadequate, particularly in the forecasts. Thus, some of the new
transformer extensions have already loading levels reaching 80% after only one year of operation.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government implementation performance is rated as satisfactory. The Government was fully
supportive through all phases of the project cycle. The Government's reaffirnation to the Project's
development objectives, particularly on the tariff issue, was instrumental in moving the Project forward and
in the satisfactory rating of the Project at completion. Although the establishment of a legal and
regulatory framework was delayed, partly due to IDA's and the Government's unrealistic expectations of
the political process, approval of the Electricity Law is expected in 2001, about three years behind the
schedule.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The Power Projects Management Boards of the PCs have satisfactorily provided coordination between
purchasers, suppliers, contractors and sub-contractors. The technical management of EVN was highly
- 1 1 -



satisfactory and consultants inputs were used effectively. There were no procurement delays and
disbursement was exemplary.
7. 7 Overall Borrower performance:
The Borrowers overall performance is rated, on balance, as satisfactory. The Borrower and the
implementing agency were fully committed to the successful implementation of the Project.
8. Lessons Learned
The key lessons than can be drawn from this Project are:
*   Flexibility in all aspects of project design and implementation exhibited by the Borrower and the Bank
was critical to the successful implementation of the Project.
*   The need for utmost coordination with IFC in the preparation of a fast track project involving the
private sector within time and budget constraints would ensure smooth project preparation.
*   The risks associated with a protracted process of govemment approvals (i.e. long-term gas contract,
tariff adjustment) was much higher than originally envisioned.
O   There are no short cuts to a successful complex operation; above-average inputs of Bank resources and
broad staff skill mix for project design, appraisal and supervision, are required.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
* Phu My 2. Phase 1: During project implementation, Bank's staff have followed the project closely to
timely solve difficulties. The Bank has organized a training course on project implementation matters
and has given guidance to PMBRMB to carry out the requirements of the loan agreement according to
the Bank's instructions.
*   HV substation expansion project: Bank's performance was recognized in all project-stages. Bank's
instructions were very important in project implementation especially in preparation of ICB bidding
documents, in bid evaluation, etc. Project implementation was strictly followed by the Bank through
inspections and working visit, by which the problems raised during the project implementation were
also carefully checked by the Bank's staff and remedies were timely recommended. In parallel to the
physical progress implementation, disbursement schedule was also monitored and timely updated.
*   Intensive specific training such as training on procurement, procurement monitoring, project tracking
and management, etc. should be conducted more frequently for the EVN head office's experts and staff
from PMBRMB as this would enormously increase their effectiveness in project implementation.

VIETNAM
POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Cr. 2820-VN)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR) MISSION
AIDE-MEMOIRE
March 2, 2000
Introduction
1.    An IDA mission composed of Kurt Schenk (Senior Power Engineer), Van Tien Hung
(Officer, Resident Mission), Anil Malhotra (Task Team Leader/Regional Energy Adviser), Pham
Nguyet Anh (Consultant, Power) visited the power sector agencies in Vietnam from February 22 to
March 4, 2000, for preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power
Development Project (Cr. 2820-VN). Mr. To Hai Au (Project Coordinator, ICD, EVN)
accompanied the mission as coordinator for the data collection and Borrower's Report preparation,
and review of completion reports from the Management Boards.
2.    This Aide-Memoire records the mission's findings and understandings reached. It would be
ratified by IDA management and sent to EVN soon. The mission would like to thank EVN, the
Northern Vietnam Power Projects Management Board (NPPMB) in Hanoi, Central Vietnam Power
Projects Management Board (CPPMB), Southern Vietnam Power Projects Management Board
(SPPMB), and the Phu My Baria Management Board (PMBRMB), the respective Power
Engineering Consulting Companies, the National Load Dispatch Center, and other entities involved,
for the excellent preparation work and cooperation.
Project Components
3.    The Project financed: (a) the installation of 2x150 MW gas turbines for the first 450 MW
Combined Cycle (CC) power block of the Phu My power station; (b) addition of about 900 MVA of
high voltage transformer capacity at existing substations in the South of Vietnam and about 1,350
MVA of such capacity in other parts of the country; (c) resettlement and compensation of persons
affected by the Phu My plant; and (d) consulting services for: (i) project design and supervision for
Phu My; (ii) development of BOT type of arrangement for the second CC power block of Phu My
on the basis of competitive bidding; (iii) technical assistance and training for EVN managerial staff;
(iv) master plan for rural electrification; and (v) technical studies for the Dai Ninh hydropower
project. In addition, ESMAP group of the World Bank provided technical assistance for
development of the legal and regulatory framework for the power sector.
Review of Physical Components
4.    Phu My 2-1, Gas Turbines (PMBRMB). This component was satisfactorily carried out.
Phu My 2-1 was executed by a turnkey contract, the first such contract undertaken by EVN.
Completion time for the project was a record 419 days. The project was implemented on a "fast-
track" schedule in order for the plant to be in commercial operation to meet load in the late dry
- 28 -



season from March-May 1997, when the output of the hydro-plant on the Vietnamese network is
lowest. Project Management was satisfactorily carried out by PMBRMB. Unit I was synchronized
in 2 February 1997 and Unit 2 was synchronized in 3 March 1997. The gas turbines are currently
operating on gas from the White Tiger field. The long-term supply contract, according to the credit
covenant, which was supposed to have been signed by December 1996, was finally signed on
December 1999, for a period of 17 years starting from the year 2000.
5.    The RAP has been implemented. Phu My 2-1 is in compliance with social and
environmental requirements. Social impacts have been kept to a minimum, and the project has
improved the local infrastructure as well as welfare of the affected people. EVN is satisfactorily
implementing the recommendations of the environmental expert's report of March 1997. The gas
turbines are burning natural gas, which is considered environmentally benign. The GTs are equipped
with low NOx burners and NOx levels have been kept below 25 ppm (SAR 50 ppm). Noise levels
range from 47-53 dBA (SAR 55 dBA at night).
6.     Transformer Additions in: Northern Region (NPPMB), Central Region (CPPMB), and
Southern Region (SPPMB). In the north, seventeen (five 220 kV and twelve 110 kV) existing
substations were extended, adding a total transformer capacity of 1,410 MVA. Dong Anh 110 kV
substation was transferred to the Hanoi Power Company in May 1999 and energized before loan
closing. Of the remaining sixteen, fifteen were energized by December 1999. Only Viet Tri 110 kV
substation remains to be energized with completion expected in end of March 2000. EVN is
financing the balance of work. Transformer loadings were reduced; however, about 40% of the new
transformers have loading levels already exceeding 80% at peak demand times.
In Central Vietnam, six (one 220 kV and five 110 kV) existing substations were extended, adding
207 MVA of transformer capacity to the system. There was a 1 Y2 year delay, for the 1 10 kV
substations, caused by the financial crisis in the region as the supplier could not deliver the control
and protection panels. In addition, the 220 kV transformer was ruptured after four months into
service. Since it was still under warrantee, the supplier arranged for its repair, and placing back into
operation. In spite of these problems, all substations were energized by loan closing. The
transformers are presently loaded to levels over 40 % thus relieving the overloaded situation before
substation extension.
In South Vietnam, twenty-three (three 220 kV and twenty 110 kV) existing substations were
e xtended, adding 830 MVA to the system and improving the recurrent overloading and undervoltage
situation in the netwoTk. All substations except My Tho substation (some equipment got damaged
(luring the long period of storage - equipment was delivered in 1996) were energized by loan
closing. The My Tho substation is expected to be energized by end of March 2000 with financing
from EVN. As a portion of the demand was met by diesel plant, as soon as the capacities of the
substations were increased, the loading levels in some transformers increased rapidly as the load was
transferred to the grid. More than half of the additional transformer capacity is now loaded over
80%, and the forecast for the year 2000 is that 65 % of the new transformers will be fully loaded.
Review of Technical Assistance
7. Phu My 2-2 BOTProject. Although negotiations have been delayed by many factors (i.e.
guarantee for foreign exchange; mechanism for compensation of exchange rate fluctuations;
guarantee of project loan; project development expenses; legal status of MOI to sign BOT agreement
on government behalf; and specific issues for the project such as tax, GSA and extension of bid
- 29 -



validity), closing negotiations are expected to be finalized by I st quarter of 2000 with commercial
operation expected in 2003. The mission reminded MOI that there were only about 25 days
remained in funds provided by a PHRD grant for consultant services to assist in contract
negotiations. Hence the urgent need to finalize the negotiations.
8. Rural Electrification Master Plan Study. The consultants, COWI, have submitted the
Final Report on master plan for rural electrification and the T/A was closed on 30 June 1999.
Findings and recommendations of this study were used for preparation of the Rural Energy Project.
9.    Legal and Regulatory Framework. A draft overview of the Electricity Law was prepared
and forwarded to MOI on September 23, 1996. A first draft of the Electricity Law was discussed
with Government in early 1997 and a 10th version of the Electricity Law has been completed by the
Electricity Lay Working Group and is at present under review. Although passage of an Electricity
Law is critical for enhanced private participation through definition of clear government policy and
the creation of a regulatory framework, approval of the Electricity Law is now only expected in 2001
at the earliest. More clarification by Government on the institutional setting appears to be needed.
The Bank has recommended issuing of a Policy Statement delineating, (a) an integrated strategy for
gas and electricity since there is a lack of coordination between policy, prices and projects, (ii)
clarifying issues on ownership and equitization of distribution, and (iii) a policy on import and
exports of electricity. This will assist in clarifying the institutional setting and in moving towards the
required legislation for the legal and regulatory framework.
10.   Trainingfor EVN. To include up-to-date information on TA and training provided to EVN,
the mission requested EVN to provide a summary of the training activities undertaken under this
project to improve and strengthen managerial and operational functions of the power sector.
Performance Indicators
11.   The mission reviewed the performance indicators for the project and requested EVN to (i)
thoroughly review them, and (ii) provide the missing information. Details of needed information are
given in the Annex.
Financial Performance and Compliance with Financial Covenants
12.   The average tariff increase to US 5.2¢/kWh (see next para) allowed EVN to maintain the
30% SFR (31.2%) and debt service coverage ratio (3.2x), under the Credit Agreement for FY 99.
The SFR in year 2000 is expected to be 30%, and debt service coverage ratio of 2.4x.
Electricity Tariffs
13.   On the basis of agreements reached between the Government and the Bank, EVN had made
the fist step and raised the average tariffs to US 5.2¢/kWh, with effect from October 1, 1999. The
next agreed step of the tariff adjustment is to increase the average tariff to 6.2 US¢/kWh from 1 July
2000, and to 7.0 US¢/kWh from March 2001.
Recalculation of Economic Rate of Return
14.   An Economic Rate of Return (EIRR) of 16.9% for Phu My Combined Cycle Power Project
was projected at the time of project appraisal on the basis of converting the GTs to combine cycle
operation for gas prices above US$ 1.75/MMBTU. For the transformer additions, the EIRR was
- 30 -



calculated at appraisal as 42.6% including unserved energy and downstream investments. For the
Rest of Vietnam the appraisal EIRR was evaluated as 40.1%. Such EIRRs are being recalculated
utilizing the same methodology and based on current projections and actual project costs.
Next Steps and Agreements Reached
15.   PMBRMB. Attachment 1 gives details of the additional data and information required. As
agreed, this information is to be sent to the Bank by mid March 2000 at the latest.
16.   NPPMB, CPPMB, and SPPMB. Attachment 2 provides a summary of the additional
infiormation required. For the improvements in undervoltage condition before and after the
substation extensions, the information may have to be collected from the National and/or Regional
Load Centers. As agreed, this information is to be sent to the Bank by mid-March 2000 at the latest.
17.   Consolidated Borrowers Completion Report. As agreed, EVN will prepare a consolidated
Borrowers Completion Report, including updated tables for Performance Indicators, project costs,
project costs by procurement arrangement, and project financing by component, technical assistance,
and institutional developments, for the Project. The mission requested that this information be
submitted to the Bank by end of March 2000. The Bank will review the draft and give EVN its
comments in mid April 2000, and EVNwillfinalize the report and submit it to IDA in end of early
mid May 2000.
18.   Financial Statements and Projections. EVN to provide the latestfinancial statements (i.e.
income statement, balance sheet, and funds flow statement for the years 1995-1999), and financial
projections up to 2005, and sent to the Bank by mid-March 2000.
1!3.   Draft ICR. The Bank will submit a draft ICR to EVNfor comments by end of April 2000.
EVN will send its comments, if any, by end of 15 May 2000.

Power Development Project
(IDA. 2820-VN)
Borrower's Completion Report
A. Introduction
This report was prepared as a part of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the
Power Development Project under the World Bank Credit No. 2820 VN. The project was prepared
in 1995, appraised by the Bank in January 1996. The Credit, for a total of SDR 121 millions, was
signed in February 1996 and became effective in May 20, 1996. The project was successfully
implemented; all the project components designed under the project have been effectively put into
operation. The credit was closed in December 31, 1999 with 99.6% of the funds disbursed. An
undisbursed balance of US$ 410,568.96 will be cancelled. There were no loan cancellations.
B. Objectives of the Project
The main objectives initially set for the project are: (a) to help meet rapid growth in
the electricity demand in the south of Vietnam through the addition of new gas-fired generating
capacity, (b) to increase the high voltage transmission capacity in Vietnam; (c) to facilitate
independent power production on a competitive bid BOT basis, (e) to assist the Government in the
fonnulation of a national strategy and master plan for rural electrification and (d) to strengthen the
institutional capability of EVN through technical assistance and training;
C. Assessment of Outcome
1. Achievement of the Objectives
To achieve the above set of objectives for the project following components and activities
were designed for the project (a) Installation of 2x 150MW gas turbines for the gas-fired Phu My 2-
1 project  (b) Expansion of 46 high voltage substations, (c) consulting services for (i) project
design and supervision of Phu My 2-1; (ii) development of Phu My 2-2 gas fired turbines power
plant: BOT power project to be implemented through international competitive bidding; (iii)
Master Plan for Rural Electrification, and (iv) Strengthening the capacity of EVN.
(EVN's assessment on how and what way these components meet the set objective)
(a) This component meet the set objective by timely put into commercial operation of the 2
x 150MW gas turbines power plant. The project was successfully implemented through
ICB procedures. Good outcome of the project has been achieved thanks to the support of
the governmental authorities, good coordination between EVN's involved department
and local authorities. Long term (17 years) gas supply contract for the plant has been
signed.
(b) This component meets the set objective by: energizing 44 over total 46 substations
included in the project. Assemble and installation works for the remaining two
substations were completed. Procurement of goods was implemented through ICB and
local construction companies performed installation works.
- 37 -



(c) (i)This sub-component meets the set objective by the works of EVN and the selected
consultant ESBI. These works were strictly followed to the conditions written in the
consulting contract. (ii)This sub-component meets the set objective by the works of the
chosen consultant, EVN, MOI and other relevant authorities. Standard documents on the
BOT basis were formed to facilitate IPP. (iii) This subcomponent was done by the works
of EVN and Cowi consultant. The report to assist in the formulation of a national
strategy and master plan for rural electrification was issued. (iv) The institutional
development study of this subcomponent is not included in this 2820-VN credit.
2. Implementation Status of the physical components:
- Original implementation schedule
- Actual implementation schedule
Original and Actual implementation schedules were given in the completion reports of respective
Power Projects Management Boards as well as in the quarterly progress reports which were sent to
WB for number of times.
- Reason for delaying, if any
There was no delay in the PM2.1 project. There were some delays in the works on substation
expansion due to mainly following reasons: (i) incompatibility between the old and new
equipment; (ii) low quality of the F/S and technical designs as well as budget estimation in some
cases of the NPPMB and SPPMB; (iii) The bidding and approval procedures in general took more
time than initially scheduled; (iv) Financial crisis in the region and in some cases the supplier could
not deliver the equipment on time.; (v) Many troubles raised when power cut needed for the works
on energizing of the substations.
3. Economic viability of the project
1) Estimated cost and actual cost of the project
Please refer to Attachment 1
There is difference between the estimated cost and actual cost, the main reasons are:
(i) ICB (ii) savings in local expenditures.
2) Economic variability of the project
- Original project estimation of EIRR:
- Revised EIRR, based on the actual costs and actualproject benefits (the evaluation of the
EIRR follows the same methodology as that used in the ICR (refer to SAR Chapter VI and Annex
18).
The original and revised EIRRs of PM2. 1 project were given in details in the ICR and its
supplementary report of PMBRMB. Both reports have been sent to WB.
4. Environmental and Social Aspects of the project
- 38 -



1. Environmental:

and improve the living standards of the Project Affected People (PAP).
(Refer to Attachment 2)
See details in PMBRMB's ICR and supplementary report.
5. Technical Assistance for the project
- Give the actual status of the Technical Assistance included in the project: PM2.2, TA for Master
Plan for Rural Electrification, TA for Legal and Regulatory Framework
(Refer to Attachment 3)
- Provide a summary of EVN's assessment of the benefits of the TA: PM2.1 consulting services:
PMBRMB was transferred the knowledge and experience of procedures to develop project
following intemational practice: Preparation of bidding documents, Designs, evaluation,
negotiation, RAP....
(Refer to Attachment 3 for more details)
6. Project Sustainability
a/ For project sustainability of each component please refer to Attachment 1 and ICRs of the
respective management boards that were already sent to the Bank.
bl - Long term (17 years starting from the year 2000) Gas Supply Contract has been signed for gas
sales to Phu My 2.1 power plant.
- Expansion of HV substations posed neither negative effect nor any risks to environment.
Expansion of substations has effectively contributed to meeting the load growth in the country.
c/ Tentative EVN's generation, transmission and distribution plans were already sent to the Bank
d/ Sales and Sales Forecast, Power balance and highlights are included in Attachment 1.
- 39 -



e/ The most recent audited financial reports were already sent by EVN to the Bank.
D. Performance Assessment
1. Bank performance
-  PM2.1 Project: During the project implementation, the Bank's staff have followed the
project closely to timely solve difficulties. The Bank has organized a training course and
given guidance for PMBRMB to carry loan agreement accordingly the Bank's
instruction
-  HV substation expansion project: Bank's performnance was recognized in all project-
stages. Bank's instructions were very important in project implementation especially in
preparation of ICB bidding documents, in bid evaluation etc. Project implementation
was strictly followed by the Bank through inspections and working visit, by which the
problems raised during the project implementation were also carefully checked by the
Bank's staff and remedies were timely recommended. In parallel to the physical progress
implementation, disbursement schedule was also monitored and timely updated
-  Note: Intensive specific training such as training on procurement, procurement
monitoring, project track and project management etc should be conducted more
frequently for the EVN head office's experts and staff from PPMBs as it would
enormously increase the effectiveness in project implementation.
2. Borrower performance
Borrower perfornance on implementation of most of the project components is
considered impressive thanks to the effort from EVN headoffice and PPMBs. In
general, coordination between EVN, its subunits and relevant authorities was good. By
the closing date of 31 December 1999 almost all physical components were completed
and put into operation.
All PPMBs have carefully carried out instructions from EVN headoffice.
Recommendations from the Bank were carefully studied and proceeded. Relatively
good coordination between PPMBs with designing companies, suppliers, contractors
and subcontractors was done.
However, there were still some delays in some cases for the works on substation
expansion due to the reasons given in C, item 2. Some other reasons given by separate
PPMBs could be found in their respective reports that were sent to the Bank.
Counterpart funds in general considered sufficient satisfying project scope.
For PM2.1 project, environmental and resettlement works were performed strictly
following the required standards and commitments. For the expansion of substations
there were no problems on resettlement as the works were performed in the areas of
existing substations.

E. Key Lesson learned from the project
PM2.1: i/Technical specifications should be reviewed carefully before issuance of
Tender documents so that there would be wide competition between potential tenders and
suppliers; ii/ The time frame for project completion defined in general conditions of contracts
should include the time schedule for tests on completion
Expansion of HV substations: Some selected lessons drawn from PPMBs are listed
below
-  NPPMB: i/ Synchronism is required for the anti-overloaded program. It would include
investment both in substation and transmission line projects especially the 22 kV feeders
going out from the substations/ Bidding documents for good procurement should cover
main equipment and auxiliaries as well. Equipment for operational and managerial
purposes would be also upgraded. iii/ Quality of the FS and technical designs would be
improved.
-  CPPMB: i/ ICB could help the Borrower save a lot of money from the allocated budgets/
Project management and implementation much depend on approval procedures,
disbursement process and action coordination. Quality improvement and effectiveness
increase would require simplification of the working procedures between involved
parties. iii/Equipment selection would be done with most caution to ensure continuos
and safe operation of the network.iv/ For I lOkV and 220 kV projects foreign consulting
services are not required.
-  SPPMB: i/ Long time bidding procedure may cause expire of the equipment guarantee,
so long term guarantee would be required, ii/Specific training on project management
would be more frequently given.
