Chapter I
The Energy Sector
A. Overview
1.1       Viet Nam began the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy in 1986, at
the Sixth Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party. This process was accelerated in 1989 with the
devaluation of the Dong and the decontrolling of most prices. In 1993, Viet Nam obtained access to
concessional international finance, while the US embargo was lifted in early 1994. All these events
provided a stimulus to the economy, which responded with a rapid growth of about 8% per annum
(p.a.) over 1992-1994. The gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to continue growing at this rate
for the rest of the decade. In the economy's continued transition and growth, the energy sector, which
provides approximately one third of the nation's foreign exchange earnings, will play a vital role. Viet
Nam's economic development will be closely linked to growth in energy supplies in general, and
electricity in particular.
1.2       Per capita consumption of commercial energy in Viet Nam, at around 135 kilograms of oil
equivalent (kgoe), is amongst the lowest in the world. In comparison, per capita consumption is 215
kgoe in the Philippines and 325 kgoe in Thailand. Biomass and fuelwood still account for about 60%
of total primary energy consumption. Petroleum products made up 47% of primary commercial energy
consumed in 1992, with coal (21%) and hydropower (32%) making up the balance. Commercial
energy consumption has grown relatively quickly in the last two years, 10% in 1993 and 12.5% in
1994. However, over this period there has been a major shift in its composition, with a decline in the
consumption of coal and an increase in the consumption of electricity (10% p.a.) and petroleum
products (9.5% p.a.).
1.3       There are substantial regional differences in the country's energy endowments and the
pattern of energy consumption. The North has an excess of hydro and coal-fired power resources, and
surplus power is now being exported to the Center and the South over a 500 kV transmission line
commissioned in 1994. This has to some extent eased the electricity shortages that these two regions
had been suffering during recent dry seasons. The South, however, is geographically closer to the
hydrocarbon resources that have so far been discovered, and has had a more reliable supply of
petroleum products.
B. Domestic Energy Endowments
1.4       Viet Nam has considerable indigenous primary energy potential, in the form of oil, gas,
coal and hydro. These could not only meet projected national demand, but also allow additional exports
of oil and coal. Viet Nam's energy potential is, however, largely unexplored and under-exploited.



-2-
The Oil and Gas Sector
1.5       Viet Nain's hydrocarbon potential is estimated to be in the order of 4,000 - 6,000 million
barrels (mmb). Proven and probable reserves are currently estimnated at around 1,000 rnnb of oil and
3.6 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, of which 2.3 tcf is associated gas. However, recent discoveries and
further drilling in known fields indicate that these estimates would be upgraded.
1.6       By 1994, four offshore oil fields had been discovered: Bach Ho, Rong, Dai Hung and Du
Block 15-2 of Rang Dong fields (discovered by JVPC of Japan). Production at the Bach Ho field,
operated by VietSovPetro, is currently 7 million tons per annum (tpa). The Dai Hung field, operated
by a consortium lead by BMP Petroleum of Australia, began production in October 1994 and its
production in 1995 is estirated at 1.1 million tons. The Rong field contains an estimated 30-40 mmb,
and its production in 1995 is estimated at about 1 million tons. The oil reservoir discovered by JVPC
in the Rang Dong field contains two layers of product; tests show that in the upper layer the production
could be about 4,000 barrels/day (bpd) and in the lower layer about 10,000 bpd.
1.7        Until recently, offshore gas development was linked to oil production. In 1994, a large
unassociated natural gas field was discovered at Lan Tay-Lan Do on Block 6 by the Oil and Natural
Gas Commission of India (ONGC), British Petroleum (BP) and Statoil of Norway, with an estimated
reserve of about 2 tcf. Based on production forecasts, Bach Ho alone is not expected to be able to
sustain a stable gas supply for 15-20 years of the quantum required by downstream users and will have
to be supplemented with the production from Dai Hung and Rong. The production of the Lan Tay-Lan
Do fields could be rather large and about 70 billion cubic feet (bcf) per annum could be available from
1998. A gas pipeline from Bach Ho to Ba Ria has already been completed; the pipeline would be
extended to Phu My in 1997 and Thu Duc power station in 1998.
1.8       Viet Nam does not yet have an oil refinery, and the entire crude oil production is
exported, the bulk of it to Japan. Refined petroleum products are currently imported to meet demand
and are distributed by truck, rail and barge; there is currently only one pipeline for the transportation of
petroleum products, from Quang Ninh port to the Hanoi area. There are plans to construct a refinery
near Nhatrang by 1999, with a capacity of 6.5 million tons (mmt) (below national demand for oil
products at this date). The refinery is expected to be financed by a consortium composed of Total
(France), the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (Taiwan) and the China Investment and Development
Company (China).
The Coal Sector
1.9       Viet Nam's coal reserves are estimated at 2,345 mrnt of anthracite, 78 mrnt of semi-
anthracite, 38 mmnt of coking coal, 96 mnmt of thermal coal and 306 mint of lignite. The commissioning
of the 1,920 MW Hoa Binh hydro plant in the north has led to a drop in coal demand from the power
sector, and coal mines are currently operating at around 50% capacity. This has pushed up costs of
production by 20%.
1.10      While the production costs of Viet Nam coal are low, the ocean freight rates charged from
Viet Nain ports are two to three times the freight costs of Australian coal to similar Asian and European
destinations. These high costs are due to slow loading rates and smaller ship handling capacity at
Vietnamese ports. Viet Namn exported just under a third of its total coal production of 3.9 mit in 1994.



-3-
1.11      The export market is likely to be the key for future growth in the coal sector. The export
of anthracite and the possible export of electricity to China from coal-fired stations in the north
represent the major export markets for coal. However, the successful export of anthracite will require
improved port facilities. If this is done, Viet Nam could be exporting as much as 2.3 mint by 2000 and
3.6 mmnt by 2010.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.12      Substantial hydropower resources exist in Viet Nam, estimated to be in the region of
10,000 MW (3,000 MW in the south and 7,000 MW in the north). The Son La site in North Viet Nam
is the largest of the schemes that could be developed, with a potential of 2,400 MW - 3,600 MW. In
the Southern and Central regions there are 10 as yet undeveloped sites with an aggregate capacity of
2,400 MW, which could be developed before 2010. The largest of these is the Yali project in Central
Viet Nam (700 MW), which is under construction and scheduled to begin operation in 1999. There is
also the possibility of importing hydro power from Laos and Cambodia.
Biomass and Fuelwood
1.13      Biomass and fuelwood currently make up over 60%  of Viet Nam's primary energy
consumption. There are substantial regional variations in the type of biomass used. In the northern
rural areas, rice straws and husks represent the bulk of the fuel used, with wood representing the
remainder. In the Mekong delta in the south, wood, along with coconut shells and woody residues
make up the bulk of traditional fuels, while rice husks and straw play a minor role. The upland areas
of the north, center and south are in general still heavily wooded, although deforestation is proceeding
under pressure from clearing for agriculture, cutting for poles, logging and for fuelwood. As part of a
policy to conserve the forests, the Government has developed an Improved Cooking Stoves Program,
which would need to focus on areas currently having the greatest pressure on fuelwood resources. The
Bank, under Energy Sector Management and Assistance Program (ESMAP), is providing technical
assistance to the Energy Institute of Viet Nam (El) to help improve the efficiency of the productioD and
consumption of traditional fuels. Specifically, the technical assistance will assist El in: (a) the design of
a phased, costed conmnercialization plan for the program to distribute improved cookstoves; and (b)
determining options for modernizing and improving the efficiency of the coal briquettes industry.
C. Energy Consumption
1.14      Table 1.1 presents the primary commercial energy balance for Viet Nam for 1994,
excluding traditional fuels (biomass and wood). Diesel fuel accounted for just under half of the
petroleum products consumption in 1994, with gasoline and fuel oil accounting for 23 % and 24% of the
total respectively.

1.15       In 1994 electricity accounted for 14%, petroleum products 66% and coal 20% of the end-
use energy consumption. Commercial energy end-use consumption has grown at only 3 % per year over
the last decade. However, this masks two distinct phases, from 1980-1985 when petroleum products
consumption was held constant and electricity consumption increased by 8% per annum, and from 1985
onwards when there were rapid increases in the consumption of both petroleum products and electricity,
at 9% and 10% p.a. respectively. Coal consumption has declined since 1987, due to a shift in fuel
consumption patterns by households and industry.
1.16       Sector-wise, industry accounts for 42%, transport 37%, household/service 16%  and
agriculture 5% of end-use commnercial energy consumption. The bulk of energy used by the industrial
sector is coal, although the usage of electricity is expected to rise rapidly with the modernization of the
economy and the introduction of light industries. Around 50 % of household consumption is made up of
petroleum products; this sector still consumed, in 1994, twice as much coal, in energy terms, as
electricity.
1.17       Commercial energy consumption is expected to increase rapidly if the forecast GDP
growth target in the order of 8% is realized. Over the last decade, due to the substitution of electricity
and petroleum products for coal, there has been a slow growth in commercial energy consumption,
relative to GDP growth. This situation is likely to change as the demand for electricity and petroleum
products is expected to increase sharply over the next decade. This could yield an overall commercial
energy consumption growth at as much as 10% - 12% p. a.. The composition of consumption, in terms
of the relative importance of coal, gas, oil and electricity, will depend upon the availability and pricing
of gas. The power sector is expected to be the main consumers of gas; it is unlikely that the household
sector will account for a significant share of consumption, at least in the near future.
D. Institutional Framework
1.18       The energy sector in Viet Nam is largely under government ownership and control. All
authority within the sector is derived from the nation's senior Governmental and political body, the
Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister. Responsibility for planning, pricing and foreign
investment across the whole economy, including the energy sector, falls under the jurisdiction of three
State Committees which report to the Council of Ministers. The Government has in recent years
undertaken a major restructuring of the institutional arrangements to provide greater autonomy to the
managements of operating companies. There has also been an effort by the Government to rationalize
functions of the Ministries in the energy sector, with a focus on sector policy and oversight rather than



an active role in enterprise management.   A State Enterprise Law was promulgated in April 1995,
which effectively allows the Management Boards of state corporations to perform the ownership
function on behalf of the State. This arrangement reduces the direct influence of the Ministries in
sector operations.
1.19       The Oil and Gas Sector. The oil and gas sector is consolidated under Petrovietnam (PVN).
a holding company for all enterprises in the sector. PVN was established in 1989 under the Ministry of
Heavy Industry (MHI). In 1992, PVN was transferred directly under the Prime Minister. PVN has 14
companies which include many joint ventures with foreign companies. As a holding company, PVN
negotiates and manages all production sharing contracts for the exploration of hydrocarbon resources.
The companies under PVN include: Vietgas responsible for developing natural gas resources; and
VietSovPetro, the Vietnamese-Russian joint venture responsible for the exploitation of the Bach Ho
field.
1.20       The Power Sector. Until January 1995, the power sector was divided into three distinct
regional systems each managed by an integrated power company. These companies were Power
Company No.1 (PC 1) in the North, Power Company No.2 (PC2) in the South and Power Company
No.3 (PC3) in the Center. In addition to these three utilities, there were companies for engineering,
design, construction, manufacturing and associated service entities. A premier Institute of Energy
provided much of the planning and analytical support to the sector. The entire sector was under the
Ministry of Energy (MOE) which also controlled the coal sector.
1.21       In January 1995, the Government established a holding company, the Electricity of Viet
Nam (EVN), for the entire power sector. The MOBE' was rationalized to provide only policy support
to the sector. EVN is comprised of 34 separate business units. Five separate distribution companies
have been created through this restructuring and have the status of "independent accounting" state
enterprises under EVN. The remaining business units are 'dependent accounting" entities (para. 2.22).
E. Energy Pricing
1.22       The Government's main objectives in setting energy prices are to ensure the financial
viability of the energy entities, to generate surplus funds for the sector to finance a significant part of
the investment program, to set prices at levels that discourage wasteful consumption and, via taxes, to
raise revenues for the general budget. However, in the electricity sector in particular, fixed assets are
undervalued and depreciation understated due to the lack of modem financial techniques. Therefore,
the estimated financial costs, which tariffs are due to recover, do not reflect the current or future costs
of production. ADB-funanced studies on tariffs and on accounting systems in the power sector would
provide the bases for imnproving the sector's financial performance (paras. 2.17 and 3.19).
1.23       Wholesale prices for petroleum products are set by the Council of Ministers based upon
the CIF cost, the exchange rate and anticipated inflation, and a 15%  import tax for gasoline.
Petrolimex, the national distribution agency, may then set retail prices within plus or minus 10% of the
official wholesale price. However, the tax on gasoline may not be collected if Petrolimex's actual
I/ The MOE was subsunied under the Ministry of Industry in October 1995.



-6-
purchase costs of gasoline are sufficiently above the levels anticipated. The level of taxes on petroleum
products are low compared to neighboring countries like Thailand. Both, in the interest of revenue for
the Govermnent and for energy conservation, there is a strong case for higher taxes on petroleum
products.
1.24       Viet Nam has still to lay down prices for natural gas. The economic cost of gas from the
earlier discovered fields is estimated to be in the region of US$1.3 per million BTU (MMBTU);
however, further studies are required to establish the gas base, the costs for development and transport
and the correct prices for this resource in various sectors of the economy. The price of gas to the
power sector is currently being considered in the range of US$2.0 to 3.5 per MMBTU.
1.25       Export prices for coal are determined by market forces; the principal constraint facing
Vietnamese exports is the relatively high cost of freight from Vietnamese ports. Domestic prices are
largely set by market forces, subject to minimum sales prices which are set by the Coal Consumers
Association. The minimum prices are set so that the companies producing coal break even, which
means that coal is sold below full cost. Prices for coal to the power sector are determined through
negotiation between the coal producers and the power companies; in doing this, they follow guidelines
laid down by the State Committee on Planning (SCP).
1.26       Electricity tariffs were increased almost two-fold in 1992, with the average tariff reaching
about 4.5 USc/kWh (para. 2.16). In August 1994, a tariff reform was implemented, with higher rates
for consumption above minimum levels for residential consumers. In March 1995, tariffs were again
raised by about 0.45 USc/kWh. Currently tariffs average just over 5 USc/kWh. Although the tariff
schedule contains peak and off-peak tariffs for energy, the absence of time-of-day metering, even for
the largest consumers, means that these tariffs cannot be implemented. The Government has indicated
that it wishes to raise tariffs in a series of steps to 7 USekWh by 1999. This represents the Long Run
Marginal Cost (LRMC) (actually, average incremental cost) of electricity estimnated in the Bank's
Energy Sector Review. Allowing for modest inflation of the dollar of around 2.5% p.a. over this
period, this means that by 1999 tariffs will be around 90% of LRMC, as compared to about 75% at
present.
F. Energy Conservation
1.27       The operation of the centrally planned economy, with energy prices substantially below
cost, monopoly state enterprises with little incentive to increase efficiency and the absence of
competitive markets did not encourage energy efficiency. The transition of the economy to a market
system, with competition in product markets, and pricing energy products closer to their cost will go
some way towards encouraging energy efficiency.  There is therefore considerable scope for
improvements in the efficiency of energy use in Viet Nam. The capital base of the manufacturing
industry is expected to more than double in the next decade; this will provide opportunities for
introducing energy efficiency technologies, provided the correct incentives are in place.  Energy
efficient household appliances will help to ease the burden that the rapid increase in household
electricity demand is expected to place upon the system, especially in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
Viet Nam's commercial energy-GDP relationship, given its current GDP of US$16 billion and energy
consumption shown in Table 1.1, is US$2 of GDP per kgoe. In comparison, in 1992 Thailand had a



-7-
GDP of US$3.1 per kgoe and the Philippines US$2.7 per kgoe. The industrialization of the country
and the switch to commercial fuels would increase energy consumption per unit of GDP, and it is
important that conservation measures, such as Demand Side management (DSM) are introduced now to
moderate the growth in the demand for energy.
1.28      The conservation of energy and end-use efficiency improvements will need to be an
important component of Viet Nam's energy strategy. Efficiency gains can be expected to be derived
from both the supply and demand sides. In the power sector, the older thermal plants consume at least
20% more fuel per kWh of electricity produced than plants in other East Asian countries. Transmission
and distribution losses are in the range of 20% or more, around two to three times the level in the
OECD. The distribution system rehabilitation components of the Power Sector Rehabilitation and
Expansion Project (PSREP) (Credit No. 2724-VN), the strengthening of transformer substations under
this project, and other rehabilitation and reinforcement projects being undertaken by EVN will
contribute substantially towards reduction of the level of losses.
1.29      Although there is a growing awareness within Viet Nam of the utility of energy efficiency
measures, there has not so far been any systematic evaluation of DSM opportunities. A Demand Side
Management study for Viet Nam has been commissioned under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).
G. The Environmental Sector
1.30      In 1991, Viet Nam  adopted the National Plan for Environment and Sustainable
Development: A Framework for Action (NPESD). This provides a comprehensive framnework for
establishing, over the next 10 years, the necessary policies, institutions, laws, regulations and programs
for addressing environmental issues. In the energy sector, it acknowledges that programs will be
required for environmental impact assessments (EIAs), watershed management, oil spill contingency
planning, air, water and soil pollution, and energy demand management through conservation programs
or legislation such as fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. The Government is now preparing a
National Enviromnental Action Plan (NEAP), building on the Bank's report entitled Environmental
Program and Policy Priorities (Report No. 13200-VN), addressing issues related to land use and
management, reforestation and forest/watershed protection, wetlands, coastal and forest protection,
urban and industrial pollution and policy, institutional and regulatory issues.
1.31      Viet Nam has also begun to establish the legal and institutional framework required to
implement environmental management programs. The Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) is the Government's main environmental arm. This department is part of the
Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MSTE) which was established in October 1992.
The Law on the Enviromnent identifies key environmental management functions, but does not define
the role and responsibilities of DENR at an operational level. DENR's capacity to perform these
functions remains limited. Within the line agencies, DepaJtments of Science and Technology have been
instructed to add environmental protection to their mandates.  Therefore, the MOE has an
environmental management role; however, in common with the other line agencies, it lacks the staff
with specialized training and experience, and does not yet have the capacity to develop and implement
sector-specific environmental guidelines.



-8-
1.32       A Law on Protection of Environment was enacted in December 1993. Amongst other
provisions it: (a) identifies in general terms the responsibilities of the state, organizations and
individuals to prevent and remedy enviromnental deterioration and pollution; (b) provides for the
development of environmental standards and submission of environmental impact reports on new and
existing facilities and provides for responsible parties to pay compensation for environmental damage;
and (c) calls for civil and criminal penalties for violations. Several other legal initiatives relevant to the
energy sector have been completed or are being developed. These include the Act of Forestry
Protection and Development (enacted by the National Assembly on August 18, 1991), a key provision
of which requires compensation if environmental disruption occurs, ar.d designates certain areas as
protected forests for hydroelectric watersheds; and the Regulation on Environmental Protection in
Marine Petroleum Operation (enacted September 5, 1990). Waste water guidelines and regulations, and
a Mining Law are currently being enacted. However, the Law does not make clear, for example, who
shall be responsible for preparing the ElAs, or which institutions will have the mandate of reviewing
them.
1.33       It is likely that the next two years (1996-1997) would concentrate on the promulgation of
environmental umbrella legislation, institutional capacity building and drafting of specific regulations on
pollution and environmental management. The implementation and enforcement of selected regulations
in high priority areas will follow on from this.
1.34       In the conunercial energy sector, high priority areas are watershed management (affecting
hydroelectric resources) and particulate emissions from thermal plant, and surface disruption by coal
mines. Water pollution from site-specific energy industry investments, and air pollutior. from sulphur
emissions and NO/VOC emissions may have a relatively low priority, yet it is expected that they will
be addressed in the 1997-2001 time horizon primnarily because these problems can be handled using
relatively straightforward control technologies.
H. Energy Sector Strategy and lssues
1.35       In its wider program to reform the economy, the Government is moving from price
liberalization measures, which have so far been very successful, to more difficult institutional reforms,
such as restructuring and privatizing state-owned businesses. The Government has restructured the
power sector by creating a holding company, EVN, and organizationally separating the core power
sector operations of generation, transmission, and distribution. This operational separation in itself
represents a fairly significant step in the right direction. While the structure will still have a single
authority over the entire sector, the Government would gradually need to sequence further reforms
especially in the development of a legal and regulatory framework that would allow for strong
regulatory oversight and greater autonomy and financial responsibility at the enterprise level. This
careful pacing and sequencing of reforms is particularly important for the power sector which has
strong monopolistic characteristics. The studies initiated under PSREP and follow-up studies under the
proposed project (para. 2.26) will not only assist the Government in making these decisions and in
implementing them but will also allow the achievement of broader objectives of introducing mnarket-
oriented mechanisms in all sectors of the economy.



-9-
1.36       The demands placed upon the power sector by the pace of economic growth, in particular
in the cities of Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, are likely to be severe. This makes the reform of the sector to
introduce efficient and flexible management essential. It will also require the mobilization of financial
resources, internally through changes in tariffs and taxes and in the longer-term externally through
foreign direct equity investment and bilateral/multilateral aid and the implementation of an integrated,
least-cost development program for the energy sector. This will require that the MOE maintain iis
policy making capacity to provide guidance to the sector as a whole.
1.37       As far as pricing of energy products is concerned, there are two issues which are of
imnportance. The level of duties and taxes on petroleum products is low compared with successful
neighboring economies such as Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. There is considerable scope for the
Government to raise additional revenue for the budget by raising duties, in particular on gasoline and
diesel fuel. This would also have the benefit of dampening the increase in demand for these products.
Secondly, the price of electricity is substantially below LRMC. The Government's indication that
tariffs will be raised to 7 USc/kWh by 1999 is, therefore, welcome. It is important that electricity is
correctly priced to send the right price signals to consumers. The introduction of metering to support
time of day tariffs, at least for the largest consumers, and the possible application of seasonal tariffs,
will help to achieve this objective.
1.38       In the coal sector, the Govemment agencies should move away from operations and focus
more on policy implementation, research and regulation for safety and pollution control. The success
of exports will depend upon the development of modem handling facilities at ports.
1.39       There is already extensive private sector involvement in the petroleum sector, with the
operation by foreign consortia of oil fields within Viet Nam's territorial waters, and the likelihood of
private sector financing for the refinery. The Government's role within this sector should continue to
be at a regulatory and policy-making level. As far as the development of gas resources is concerned,
the policy should be to ensure correct pricing of gas, and ensuring availability of gas to sectors where
it has the highest value; predominantly in the power sector.






Chapter II
The Power Sector
A. Introduction
2.1        Viet Nam's power sector is divided into three distinct regional systems. Till recently,
these systems were managed by PC1 in the North, PC2 in the South and PC3 in the Center. With the
creation of EVN in January 1995, the operations in the power sector are managed by the following
entities:
North
Power Company No. 1 (PC1)  Power generation below 30 MW, regional load dispatch and power
transmission and distribution at or below 35 kV in the North, except
Hanoi.
Power Company of Hanoi      Power distribution in Hanoi.
Transmission Company 1      Power transmission above 35 kV in the North.
Transmission Company 4      National load dispatch center and 500 kV transmission.
Five Generation Units       Pha Lai, Uong Bi, Ninh Binh, Hoa Binh, Thac Ba.
South
Power Company No. 2 (PC2)  Power generation below 30 MW, regional load dispatch and power
transmission and distribution at or below 35 kV in the South, except
HCMC.
Power Company of HCMC       Power distribution in HCMC.
Transmission Company 2      Power transmission above 35 kV in the South.
Six Generation Units        Thu Duc, Tra Noc, Ba Ria, Tri An, Thac Mo, Da Nhim
Center
Power Company No. 3 (PC3)  Power generation below 30 MW, regional load dispatch and power
transmission and distribution at or below 35 kV in the South.
Transmission Company 2      Power transmission above 35 kV in the Center.
One Generation Company      Vinh Son
2.2        The North has an installed capacity of about 2,673 MW and a peak demand of about 1,100
MW. The South has an installed capacity of about 1,495 MW and a peak demand of about 1,055 MW.
The Center has an installed capacity of about 250 MW and a peak demand of about 190 MW. The
available generating capacities are well below installed capacities due to poor condition of the thermal
plants.
2.3        The North has abundant coal and hydropower resources; in contrast, the South and Center
regions face acute generation deficiencies and require substantial additions of capacity over the near



-11-
future. Fuel options for power generation in the South include: (a) off-shore natural gas; (b) coal,
imported either from the North or fr,n regional countries; and (c) hydropower, both from the South
and from the two other regions. In C; .tral Viet Nam, the demands are low and the region has a large
hydropower potential which can be tapped for the benefit of both the Center and the South. A 500 kV
line linking the three regions was completed by the Government in 1994; this facilitates interregional
power transfers and an integrated development of the national grid.
B. The Power Market
The Growth of Electricity Demand in Viet Nam
2.4        Viet Nam has seen a very rapid growth in the demand for electricity over the last decade,
averaging 9.9% p.a. over the period 1981-1993. This is conimensurate with GDP growth of around
79% over the same period. Sales of electricity in 1994, at just over 9,200 Gwh, were treble the levels
of 1981. Growth was slowest in PC1, although it still averaged 8.2% p.a., with sales in PC2 and PC3
growing at 10.0% p.a. and 12.6% p.a., respectively. There was a slowdown in the growth of sales in
PC2 and PC3 in 1990-1992, due to chronic shortages in electricity supply; since these have eased,
growth has accelerated again.
2.5        Table 2.1 compares sales, losses, and peak demand for the three systems for 1994. For
the country as a whole, average total losses were about 21 % of generation of which non-technical losses
were about 3%.

2.6         Sectorally, industry represents the largest consumer (sales of 3,893 Gwh in 1994), with
sales to residential consuners (3,236 Gwh) comparable in size. Both agriculture (1,420 Gwh) and non-
industrial sales (696 Gwh), the latter representing transport and service industries, are still relatively
small. Sales to residential consumers grew at 12.6% p.a. over the period 1985-1994, nearly double the
growth rate of sales to industry (which grew at 6.8%).
Forecasts of Electricity Demand
2.7        Since the time of the Bank's Energy Sector Policy and Investrnent Review (Report No.
10842-VN, 1993), the actual demand for electricity in Viet Nam has been growing at a much more
rapid rate than forecast. The Energy Institute has been periodically updating its load forecasts based on
economic data. Its sales forecast of August 1994 was based on Base Case average demand growth rate
over 1995-2000 of: (a) 12.9% for the whole country; (b) 11.5% for the North; (c) 14.2% for the



-12-
South; and (d) 12.8% for the Center. This has become outdated and the Energy Institute's sales
forecast of January 1995 is based on Base Case average demand growth rates over 1995-2000 of: (a)
13.7%  for the whole country; (b) 12.3%  for the North; (c) 14.9% for the South; and (d) 13.9%  for the
Center. The Energy Institute's sales forecasts for each of the regions are presented in Table 2.2.
These represent a Base Case and a High Case scenario; the Base Case assumes an average increase of
13.7% p.a. for the country as a whole until the year 2000, the High Case assumes an average increasc
of around 14.6% p.a. over the same period. After this period, lower growths of around 11.3 to 11.7%
are assumed. With the substantial increase in economic activity in the country and increasing per capita
consumption in the urban areas due to increases in the income levels, Energy Institute's High Case
demand forecast is considered to be a reasonable assumption for power planning in the near to medium
term.

C. Generation and Transmission Facilities
Generation
2.8          The total installed generating capacity in the country is approximately 4,480 MW  (2,673
MW in the North and 1,495 MW in the South). In the northern region, the completion of the Hoa Binh
hydroelectric plant (1,920 MW and 8,400 Gwh p.a.) has created substantial excess capacity; the three
large coal-fired steam generation plants in the region (Pha Lai, Nin Binh and Uong Bi) are operating at
well below 50% of their rated capacities. These plants are of Soviet and Chinese origin, and are
located near anthracite mines. All these plants are in relatively poor condition, due to the quality of the
design, dearth of spare parts, inadequate control systems and poor mnaintenance. Peak demand in the
North, at 1,000 MW, is well below installed capacity, although allowance has to be made for exports to
the South and the Center of around 400 MW, and the low availability on some of the older thermal units.



-13-
2.9        The commissioning of the 500 kV  North-South-Center link has created a single
Vietnamese power grid and has for the time being ended the chronic energy shortages that the South
and Center had been suffering. The South anticipates importing 33 % of its power requirements through
the link in 1995. Unlike the North, the South and Center have suffered from a deficit in generation,
shortages in power being especially critical during the dry season when hydropower energy is low. The
major hydro sites in this region are Tri An (400 MW), Vinh Son (66 MW) and Thac Mo (150 MW).
There are two principal fuel-oil fired thermal generating stations in the South (Thu Duc, 165 MW, and
Can Tho, 33 MW). New combustion turbines have been added to both Thu Duc (2 x 37.5 MW) and
Ba Ria (5 x 37.5 MW). A gas pipeline, from the Bach Ho field has been commissioned to the Ba Ria
site in niid-1995 (and will be extended to Phu My by 1997 and Thu Duc by 1998), allowing these
turbines to be operated on gas. Despite these additions, there would be insufficient generating capacity
to provide a firm backup to the 500 kV link (which is single circuit) and therefore the South and Center
can expect to suffer from at least temporary power shortages when the link is inoperative.
Transmission and Distribution
2.10       Viet Nam's transmission and distribution systems are based on multifarious standards and
are old and unreliable, with overall losses of about 20% (see Table 2.1). There is an urgent need to
rehabilitate and strengthen the networks to reduce technical losses, improve reliability and thereby
reduce outages, and serve the forecast increases in demand. While PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN)
provides for extensive reinforcement of the medium voltage distribution networks, the proposed project
would cover strengthening of the high voltage sub-station capacity.
2.11       As far as EHV and HV transmission are concemed, the commissioning of the 500 kV link
(1,440 lkm long) represents the first step in the construction of a national grid. Prior to this, there were
two separate interconnected grids in the country, operating at 220/230 kV, 110 kV and 66 kV, with a
total circuit length of about 5,500 km. The development of a national link underscores the need for
modem national and regional dispatch centers and communications systems which are being covered
under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).
D. Viet Nam's Power Development Plan
2.12       The Govermnent's objectives for the development of the power sector are: (a) exploitation
of the vast hydropower potential of the country; (b) improvement of supply side efficiency through
reduction of losses in energy conversion, transmission and distribution; (c) promotion of foreign
investments; and (d) increasing the availability of electricity in rural areas.  In line with these
objectives, the Energy Institute has developed a generation expansion schedule, using the ENPEP
model.
2.13       Under this plan there will be a substantial addition of hydro capacity (Vinh Song, Song
Hinh, Yali, Dai Ninh, Pley Krong and Son La) and of gas-fired combined cycle capacity (Ba Ria, Phu
My and others). There is also expected to be development of coal-fired capacity in the north, at Pha
Lai and, later, at Quang Ninh. A total of 2,987 MW is expected to be added by 2,000 and 5,995 MW
by 2005.  The plan was developed using the High Case demand forecast (see Table 2.2), and a
planning criteria of Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) of about 3 days per year.



-14-
2.14          Associated with this, it is expected that about 2,832 km of 220 kV lines, 3,259 km of 110
kV lines, 7,686 MVA of 220 kV transformer capacity and 6,815 MVA of 110 kV transformer capacity
will be added to the system in the period 1995-2000. Additional capacity on the 500 kV interconnector
is expected to coincide with the commissioning of the Yali project. The development of the large Son
La scheme (2,400 MW), which is planned for the period after 2005, would require a further upgrading
of the link.

2.15         Table 2.4 shows forecasts of the regional power balance, for selected years (the most
important dimension as far as medium term planning for the power sector is concemed). It shows that,
countrywise, the reserve margin would dimninish from 57% in 1995 to about 29% in 2005, a level that
would be considered reasonable. The table also shows the extremely precarious condition of the power
supply system for the South over the 1995-1997 period, underscoring the need for urgent capacity
additions. After 1997, the situation would progressively improve with the rapid commissioning of gas
fired capacity in the early years and the coming on line of hydro capacity in the outer years.
Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Govemment would, on an annual basis, continue to
fumish to IDA for its review and comments: (a) a review of the implementation of its power
development program during the preceding 12 months; and (b) its proposed implementation program for
the next five years, and thereafter carry out the power development program taking into account IDA's
comments.

E. Electricity Tariffs
2.16         Existing tariff levels are provided in Annex 1. Tariffs were rationalized and raised almost
two-fold in March 1992; higher charges during the dry season were introduced for consumption above
set levels, and special tariffs were introduced for foreigners and partially or wholly owned foreign



-16-
companies. Further upward revisions in the tariffs were implemented in August 1994 and May 1995;
currently the average tariff is about D580/kWh, or about 5.3 USc/kWh. The LRMC of electricity was
estimated in 1993 to be in the range of 7 USc/kWh and the Government has expressed its commitment
to increasing tariffs to this level by 1999. Assuming relatively low levels of inflation (around 2.5%) in
US$ terms, by 1999 tariffs will be approximately 90% of LRMC, as compared to about 75% at
present.
2.17        Tariffs are currently uniform across Viet Nam. Industrial consumers face a tariff schedule
that has average, peak and off-peak tariffs, with peak rates being well over double the off-peak rates.
Unfortunately, few, if any, of these customers have time of day metering, and therefore this tariff
schedule cannot be applied. The introduction of these meters, for appropriate consumers, will be an
important step in establishing a cost reflective tariff that will provide incentives for conservation of
energy at peak times. The ADB is funding a tariff study to assist in the development of an appropriate
tariff policy, based on appropriate financial and social objectives. This study would address the
metering issues.
2.18        The present tariff structure broadly reflects the differences in costs associated with voltage
level and type of consumer. Therefore, charges to industrial consumers are highest for those supplied
at 6 kV or below, and lowest for those supplied at voltages above 20 kV. There is a subsidy element
in the Residential category; consumers face a rising block tariff. The tariffs to commercial customers
are substantially above anything paid by other consumers. It is likely that residential consumers will be
contributing proportionately more to the peak than conmmercial consumers do, suggesting that this
difference is not cost reflective. In addition, there is a tariff schedule for foreign customers (both
business and residential), with tariffs above the estimated LRMC of 7 USc/kWh. The existence of
"wholesale electricity vendors", particularly in rural areas, who buy electricity from the power
companies and resell it, metered through submeters, to small customers, is quite prevalent. The prices
the vendors charge are considerably higher than the official tariffs, ranging as high as Dl,000/kWh.
The high prices charged suggest that the willingness-to-pay for electricity in certain areas is well above
current tariff levels.
2.19        The main reform required at present is an increase in the average rate of the tariff, to
reflect to consumers the true cost of electricity supply. To improve the accuracy of the price signals
sent through the tariffs, the Government should consider: (a) introduction of metering to allow peak and
off-peak tariffs to be charged to large consumers; (b) introduction of demand charges for larger
consumers; and (c) increasing the level of tariffs charged to residential consumers, at least for
consumption over the minimum block, so that the higher rates are at least equivalent to that charged to
commercial consumers. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government would furnish, on
an annual basis, to IDA a review of the policy and levels of its electricity tariffs, including proposed
adjustments to meet the objectives of the power development program, and thereafter implement
proposed adjustments taking into account IDA's comments.

F. Sector Strategy
The Govenment's Power Sector Policy
2.20       The power sector in Viet Nam faces a number of challenges in the coming years, the most
significant being the ability to finance and implement an investment programn of almost US$6.5 billion
from 1995-2001, to meet the unprecedented growth in electricity demand. Presently, the power system
is technically stretched to its limit and owing to years of under-investment in assets and in maintenance,
the system is inefficient and unreliable.. Further, with only 78% of the population having access to
electricity and a per capita consumption of less than 300 kWh, there is a large amount of suppressed
demand in the country.
2.21       Recognizing the need for drastic rationalization of sector policies to meet these challenges,
the Government has prepared, in consultation with IDA, a Power Sector Policy Paper that lays out its
sectoral objectives, its reform strategy and a reform implementation plan (see Annex 2 for details). The
principal elements of the Government's power sector policy are to: (a) rationalize power sector
institutions and functions; (b) commercialize the operations of sector entities through financial and
management restructuring; (c) introduce an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the sector;
(d) adopt appropriate bulk and retail electricity tariffs, both in terms of tariff level and tariff structure;
(e) encourage and introduce private sector capital and direct participation in the sector; (f) introduce
electricity conservation and load management practices; and (g) prepare and implement a plan to bring
electricity to rural areas.
Sector Reform and Restructuring
2.22       In January 1995, the Government issued Decree No. 14/CP to establish EVN, a holding
company for the different power sector entities engaged in generation, transmission, distribution and
associated service functions. EVN comprises 34 separate business units, each with its own charter and
each reporting to EVNs Director General. These business units are grouped under two accounting
systems: (a) independent accounting, which focuses on costs and revenues; and, (b) dependent
accounting, which focuses on costs. The business units fall into three categories:
(a)   Those engaged in generation and transmission are subject to dependent accounting, and
consolidation of accounts takes place only at the level of EVN as a whole (General EVN).
There are 17 business units involved in these activities - 12 for generation and 5 for
transmission. They all report to EVNs Director General, through the Deputy-Director
General for production.
(b)   Those responsible for distribution and supply are independent accounting enterprises
(profit- or cash-generating centers), which are accountable directly to EVNs Director
General. There are five distribution units: Hanoi-PC, HCMCPC, PCI, PC2 and PC3.
(c)   Those involved in the provision of services (including finance, design and construction,
and planning) have either independent or dependent accounting status.



-18-
2.23       EVN has the legal status of a state corporation under the State Enterprise Law.
Independent accounting entities have the status of state enterprises that are members of the state
corporation (i.e. EVN). EVN's newly created Board of Management (BOM) has been vested with
responsibility to exercise the States ownership function based on the principles established under the
new State Enterprise Law. It also oversees the operation and management of EVN.
2.24       From a sector structure perspective, the core functions of generation and transmission are
separated under several regionally-oriented business units, all of which are grouped under EVN as
dependent accounting units. This restructuring has set the stage for consolidation of a transmission
business unit as a separate profit center and progressive commercialization of the distribution units.
The generation-transmission business units sell electricity in bulk to the five independent distribution
companies. Retail prices to final consumers are established by the Government and are currently
uniform across the country. The mechanism for setting the bulk transfer price (BTP) allows the
distribution companies to make a target profit; the profit level is determined by EVN. Given uniform
retail pricing and differing distribution system costs for each distribution company, the BTP is different
for each distribution company.
2.25       The Ministry of Energy (MOE), now MOI, has been significantly rationalized in parallel
with the establishment of EVN. Consistent with the Governments policy for all line ministries, MOE
is increasingly responsible for policy and oversight functions, while all operational responsibility is
being vested with operating companies.
EDA's Strategy and Assistance to The Power Sector
2.26       IDA's strategy for the power sector and the associated technical assistance are focused on:
(a) assisting the Government in introducing reformns and restructuring the power sector; (b) improving
the technical and operational efficiency of the sector through strengthening the sector institutions and
moving them towards commercialization and corporatization; (c) initiating legal and regulatory reforms;
(d) creating an enabling environment for introduction of private power; (e) promoting conservation and
encouraging environmentally and socially sustainable development; and (f) encouraging the spread of
electricity to rural areas. In furthering this strategy, IDA (under the PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) and
under the proposed project) would focus on:
(a) Power Sector Reform and Restructuringe In association with PSREP, ESMAP began an
investigation of the needs and priorities of sector reformn. The work was a collaborative effort
between an MOEIEVN working group and the ESMAP team, and was coordinated by a high-
level government steering committee. The findings of this work, as well as options to reform
the sector was discussed at a workshop in May 1995 in Hanoi. ESMAP also conducted a
training workshop on power sector financing options in July 1995. The work done by ESMAP
is reprinted in Report No. 174/95. This report provides the framework for further reforms in
the power sector.
(b) Power Sector Institutional Strenutheninu Much work remains to be done by the Government to
achieve an increasing commercial orientation of the sector, including: (i) separating more
sharply the function of government oversight and regulation from that of sector ownership and
management; (ii) establishing a commercial arms-length ownership policy vis-a-vis EVN, in
terms of financial responsibilities and operational performance; (iii) strengthening the
administrative and management practices of EVN and its enterprises; and (iv) allowing adequate



-19-
financial and management autonomy to the distribution companies. Technical assistance in
institutional strengthening is being provided under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN). It includes:
improving organizational structures; streamlining administrative and management practices;
improving reporting and information flows between entities; and defining of budget and
financial control systems. The proposed project would provide for additional strengthening of
EVN through management training.
(c) Legal and Regulatorv Framework  An important element of the power sector policy is the
establishment of an effective and credible body of sector-specific legislation and regulations,
which is a prerequisite for the orderly introduction of private power. This would comprise: (i)
defining the scope of regulation and the agency to carry out this function; (ii) drafting of an
electricity law and its subsequent approval by the National Assembly; (iii) preparation and
operationalization of a Grid Code; and (iv) promulgation of the Electricity Law and
Regulations. In support of the proposed project, the ESMAP group of the Bank would provide
extensive technical assistance to the Government in developing an appropriate legal and
regulatory framework for the power sector.
(d) Development of Private Power As a key objective to encourage private sector participation, the
Government issued Decree No.87/CP on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts to facilitate
private investment in infrastructure, including power. Despite this policy initiative, significant
impediments to promoting and implementing private power remain including: (i) the lack of a
proper legal and regulatory framework; (ii) the unfavorable credit-risk of EVN stemming from
low tariffs and the lack of financial disclosure; and (iii) uncertainty regarding a domestic dispute
resolution mechanism. Under the proposed project, assistance will be provided by the Bank
Group to help structure the second phase of the Phu My power station as a BOT type project.
This work would include: (i) improving the overall framnework to solicit private investment; (ii)
training for structuring and negotiating project agreements with foreign investors and lenders;
and (iii) providing project specific legal and financial consulting services.
(e) Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management A study to evaluate energy conservation
potential and methods to implement demand side management and energy conservation
programs is being conducted under the PSREP.
(f) Master Plan for Rural Electrification The proposed project provides for technical assistance in
developing a strategy and a master plan for rural electrification in the country.
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement
2.27       IDA's first operation in the Viet Nam power sector (PSREP) has just conmmenced and the
lessons leamed from this project have been drawn upon in the preparation of the proposed project. An
important lesson has been the need for a detailed preparation of the resettlement action plan (RAP) with
a clear definition of project affected persons and the legal framework for resettlement, and assuring the
active participation of the affected people in the project and the RAP. Another significant lesson from
power projects, in general, is the need for thorough investigations in the preparation of technologically
and managerially complex projects. The proposed project includes development of a large gas-fired
thermal power complex; adequate field investigations have been made, alternatives studied, and foreign
consulting assistance has been availed of from the feasibility stage and will be continued during
implementation. Being a fast track project, adequate safeguards have been provided to achieve its
timely completion, including construction on a turnkey basis.



-20-
Rationale for IDA Involvement
2.28       The project would be fully consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (Report
No. 15053-VN of October 25, 1995), discussed by the Board on November 21, 1995, which sees
IDA's role for the power sector as filling an important niche not covered by other players in the sector.
This includes financing of environmentally sustainable hydropower, transmission and distribution, and
thermal power to the extent that the Bank Group could be instrumental in introducing private power
while simultaneously working with the Government in improving the legal and regulatory framework.
The policies and programs that the Government proposes to follow in the sector are consistent with the
Bank's policy guidelines for the power sector.
2.29       Viet Nams needs for financing its infrastructure are large (the power sector alone
requiring almost US$6.5 billion over 1995-2001) and the Government clearly recognizes the necessity
for private direct financing. However, to permit the private sector to participate in power development
on the required scale and in a sustainable manner, Viet Nam needs a conducive policy, legal and
regulatory framework. The present situation does not permnit such participation because of an almost
total lack of such a frarnework. Accordingly, IDA's dialogue with the Government over the past two
years has been to agree on a shift in its policy on private sector participation, help create a proper legal
and regulatory framework and to move the power sector increasingly towards conmmercialization and
corporatization. Various units of the Bank Group - FIAS, IFC, ESMAP and the Region - have
participated in this dialogue. Notable among the Bank Groups efforts so far have been: (a) the
collaborative work of ESMAP and the Government through the Power Sector Reform and Restructuring
Study (ESMAP Report No. 174/95); (b) the seminar held by ESMAP in July 1995 to sensitize the
Govemrnent to issues relating to private financing of power; and (c) the holding of a high level semninar
by FIAS and IFC in Hanoi in September 1995 on Impediments to Direct Investment in Infrastructure.
2.30       Preparing and implementing a sound policy, legal and regulatory framework will,
however, take time, in part because there is not yet a completely uniform view on private sector power
development within the Government. In the meantime, the demand for power is increasing rapidly.
Therefore, in parallel with the efforts to develop the framnework, the Government is willing to consider
private power development under BOT arrangements on a case-by-case basis, provided it is done in a
competitive and economic manner. This preparatory work will take time. The Government believes
that it needs to make some immediate investments in power generation through EVN to head off a
looming power crisis in the southern part of the country, an assessment with which IDA concurs. The
Bank Group is satisfied with the appropriateness of the overall strategy which will be implemented first
in the development of the Phu My complex.
2.31       Phu My, with an ultimate capacity of 2,400 MW, will be the largest thermal power
generation complex in the country. EVN has invited bids for the first two 150 MW gas turbines while
it has also, in parallel, received some private power proposals. EVN did not find the latter acceptable
for technical and economic reasons. There were also concerns that negotiations and finalization of
project arrangements, in the absence of a proper framework, would require considerably more time than
was available (the initial capacity increase needs to be completed by December 1996).  The
Government, therefore, requested IDA to finance these two gas turbines. The approach taken by IDA
was to predicate IDA financing on a clear up-front policy decision by the Government to introduce
private power for the second CC block of Phu My. After considerable debate at the highest political
level, the Govermment adopted the policy decision recommended by IDA. IDA's strategy has, thus,
succeeded in creating a breakthrough in the introduction of private power in Viet Nam. While
reiterating its desire to work with IDA in establishing the proper legal and regulatory framework (which
should significantly facilitate large scale and sustainable private sector involvernent in power



-21-
development), the Government has sought Bank Group's assistance in realizing a BOT type of
installation for the second CC block of Phu My. IDA and IFC consider the Governmnents approach to
be reasonable, and are satisfied that their involvement will help introduce private power in an orderly
manner.



Chapter III
The Beneficiary
A. The Beneficiary
3.1        The beneficiary of the proposed credit is the Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN).
B. Organization and Management
3.2        EVN was created on January 1, 1995 by govermnent decree number 562/TTG dated
October 10, 1994 (Annex 3).  EVN, a "State Corporation" under the newly promulgated State
Enterprise Law, is an independent juridical entity acting as a holding company overseeing 14
"independent accounting" and 22 "dependent accounting" business units. EVN's legal basis, scope of
responsibilities, organizational boundaries and other institutional features are laid out in its charter.
3.3        The Ministry of Energy (MOE) which earlier exercised oversight of the power sector
enterprises, has been rationalized and most of its staff reassigned to EVN. A limited scope of
regulatory functions has been assigned to MOE. The interface between EVN and MOE remains to be
clarified and the ESMAP-funded technical assistance project on "Developing a Legal and Regulatory
Framework for the Power Sector" (para. 2.26) would assist in clarifying the details of the separation of
these responsibilities and functions.
Management Board
3.4        Under its charter, EVN's organization (Chart 1) consists of: (a) the Management Board;
(b) the Board of Directors headed by the General Director assisted by deputies and department heads;
and (c) business units. The Management Board which is the highest decision-making authority in EVN,
consists of five members headed by the Chairman (Minister of Energy). The other mernbers of the
Management Board include a Vice Chairman, a General Director, and two experts on legal, technical
and economic aspects. The members of the Management Board have a tenure of five years. The
Management Board (similar to a corporate Board of Directors) is authorized by the State to carry out
ownership and control functions on its behalf. Specifically, the Management Board is responsible for
setting up policy and giving advice to EVN's top executives.
Board of Directors
3.5        The second level of management is the Board of Directors which consists of the General
Director and four deputies in charge of production, investment, development, construction management
and finance. The main function of the Board of Directors is to implement the Management Board's
decisions and for day-to-day management. EVN has 15 functional and administrative departments for
administration, planning, organization and personnel, finance and accounting, business, power
generation, power network, international cooperation, financial estimation, project evaluation, material
and import-export, rural and mountains region power development, inspection security and technical



-23-
safety inspection. Each department is headed by a director who reports directly to the General
Director.
Business Units
3.6        Under the new EVN charter, the three formerly fully integrated power companies (PCI in
the North, PC2 in the South, and PC3 in the Center), which were responsible for generation,
transmission and distribution in their respective regions; the two Power Investigation and Design
Companies (PIDC1 and PIDC2), which undertook detailed design and construction management af large
power sector projects; the three Power Construction Companies, which undertook construction of major
power projects; and the National Load Dispatch Center, were fragmented and restructured into financial
"independent" and "dependent" business units.
3.7        The "independent' business units comprise five distribution companies, four power
construction companies, two investigation and design companies, a company for fabrication of electrical
equipment, and a communication company. The "dependent" business units comprise 12 generating and
four transmission companies, the National Load Dispatch Center, and three peripheral units for
planning, information and research. Currently, some Project Management Boards, which formally
belonged to the PCs have been separated from the PCs and now belong directly to EVN as dependent
business units. The list of EVN's business units is given in Annex 4.
3.8        Each business unit is headed by a director. While the business units are given autonomy
by EVN to appoint their own deputy directors and heads of departments, the director and chief
accountant of each unit are appointed by EVN. As presently structured, there is a tendency to
concentrate much of the decision making at the level of EVN senior management. This lack of
autonomy, particularly for the independent business units' directors, is inconsistent with the intent of the
sector reorganization to provide the independent business units with legal and financial independence.
The issue of developing a plan to implement the internal organizational changes within EVN which
would allow greater autonomy along with adequate accountability is being addressed in the study
"Power Sector Institutional Strengthening" under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).
C. Staff Development and Training
3.9        EVN's management and staff, drawn largely from the staff of MOE, PCI and PIDC1, are
technically competent and qualified, but are not equipped with modern tools and are inadept at modern
management practices. During the reorganization and restructuring of the sector, no employee in the
power sector was retrenched. As of January 1, 1995, EVN has a total staff of 63,788 representing the
total work force of the sector prior to reorganization. More than half (57%) of EVN staff now belong
to the five distribution companies, 16% to the power construction companies, 13% to the power
generation companies, and the rest to the transmission and other companies. As of April 1, 1995, EVN
reported 52,300 staff with fixed positions, but transfers are still taking place and the final numbers are
not yet officially known. Of this number, 3,500 belong to the managerial ranks. EVN has a staffing
ratio of 12 employees per installed MW, and 65 customers per staff. The latter figure is low, when
compared to a figure of about 120 for Thailand.



-24-
3.10       Recruitment is the responsibility of EVN's Administration Department but the business
units have been delegated the task of recruitment of their own staff within limits specified by EVN.
Staff training has also been delegated to each business unit. The National Training Center of PCI and
the training centers of PC2 and PC3 still operate under the control of the respective PCs as
technical/vocational schools. The National Training Center, in line with EVN's policy of re-educating
staff, provides technical and non-technical training on management, accounting, and computers. A
major program of upgrading training facilities and staff skills in managing new and sophisticated plants
and systems is being provided under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).
D. Operations and Management
Project Development and Procedures
3.11       The procedures for development of investment projects in the power sector are
cumbersome and bureaucratic. As currently envisaged, the strategy for development of long-term plans
for the power sector would be drafted by the Energy Institute and submitted to EVN and MOE for their
review and appraisal.  On the basis of these plans, projects are prepared and approved by the
Government in accordance with established procedures and stages. Once approved, feasibility studies
are appraised by the State Appraising Committee or by a committee chaired by the Vice Minister or
Vice Chairman of the People's Committee. Project proposals within EVN are subject to the following
levels of approval: (a) Level A, projects in excess of D 100 billion by the Prime Minister; (b) Level B,
projects ranging from D 6-100 billion by the Government and MOE; and (c) Level C, projects less than
D 6 billion by EVN's Board of Management. Procurement, which has caused bottlenecks and delays in
project implementation, needs to be streamlined. Currently, procurement is done by bidding in
accordance with government regulation. The National Procurement Evaluation Comnmittee evaluates
and selects bids costing above D 100 billion for the Primne Minister's approval while MOE approves
bids below D 100 billion.
Operational Performance
3.12       At present, EVN operates 15 units of various generating stations with a total capacity of
4,480 MW; of which 68% is hydro and 32% is conventional oil/gas and thermal power plants. With a
transmission line length of 6,900 circuit-kIn, it has 85 substations and 2,530 MVA transformer capacity.
In April 1994, the 1,500 km 500 kV North-South power line was completed providing 500 MW of
electricity to the central and southern provinces. The PCs, who managed the facilities prior to the
establishment of EVN, have operated these facilities and the transmission network at levels that have
been severely constrained by shortages of funds and spare parts supplies.
3.13       Power losses, including both transmission and generation losses, arnount to about 20% of
electricity produced, with estimated transmission and distribution losses being about 18 % and auxiliary
consumption being 3% of generation.  These levels are relatively high when compared to those
recorded for the more developed power grids of countries such as Thailand and South Korea. EVN
would need to exercise stricter control on its operations to reduce non-technical losses. A program to
progressively reduce the non-technical losses of PC3 in the Central Region from about 18% to 3% as
planned by the Government has been agreed with IDA under the PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).



-25-
E. Financial Management
Accounting System and Promdures
3.14       The establishment of the charter of EVN coincided with the introduction by the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) of modifications to the Vietnamese accounting system. In accordance with Circular
No. 162 TB dated November 30, 1994, the Prime Minister approved the application on a trial basis of
the reformed accounting system to several state-owned enterprises including EVN. MOF and MOE
have required EVN and its business units to adopt the new system with modifications to the chart of
accounts to suit the power sector. EVN's system is designated as a "mixed" accounting system
whereby: (a) centralized accounts are maintained in the generation and transmission of electricity; (b)
all power plants and transmission companies are dependent accounting units; and (c) consolidation of
accounts take place only at the EVN level as a whole.
3.15       The revision in the accounting policies has resulted in the following improvements in the
accounting principles adopted by EVN:
(a)   EVN and its subsidiaries now use the accrual basis of accounting;
(b)   Remittance to the Government of regular depreciation and depreciation of fully written-off
assets has been discontinued. The EVN group now employs uniform capitalization and
depreciation policies and adopts appropriate depreciation rates on each asset consistently;
(c)   Foreign currency denominated balances are now restated at the end of each reporting
period with the resulting gains or losses recognized for that period;
(d)  Cash flow statements will now be prepared at the end of each entity's financial year.
Consequently, a consolidated cash flow statement of EVN will also be presented;
(e)   The business units are now required to mnaintain their own books of accounts and submit
regular financial and non-financial reports to the Management Board for review and
consolidation of accounts; and
(f)   Consolidated accounts will be prepared for EVN and the dependent business units on a
monthly basis and EVN  and the independent business units quarterly.  During
consolidation of accounts, all intercompany transactions are eliminated.
3.16       While the aforemnentioned changes are encouraging, certain practices, however, are still at
variance with internationally accepted accounting principles and practices. Thus:
(a)   There is no external or internal audit of EVN accounts. The consolidated accounts of
EVN and its independent business units are only submitted to MOF for approval;
(b)  EVN is not allowed to make provisions for doubtful accounts. The current practice is that
the distribution companies submit a list of long overdue accounts to the Management



-26-
Board for review. Write-offs will only be made upon approval of the Board and MOF.
In the meantime, no allowance is provided for these doubtful accounts;
(c)   Differences between the result of the physical count and the book balances of inventories
at the end of the year are recognized as balance sheet items instead of being taken directly
to income. This practice results in a misstatement of the balance sheet and profit and loss
accounts; and
(d)   The consolidated balance sheet of EVN does not properly account for construction work in
progress.  Fixed assets are not classified into assets in operation and assets under
construction in progress.
3.17       The deviations mentioned above are not of a serious nature and EVN's accounting
practices are now, for the most part, consistent with international accounting standards. The ADB
consulting study (para. 3.19), which is expected to be completed in early 1996, should assist EVN in
improving the systemic and qualitative presentation of the financial statements.
3.18       EVN is required to conform to the accounting manual of MOE and MOF and has adopted,
for all its business units, uniform accounting policies and procedures, documentation of transactions,
and charts of accounts. Its business units now prepare and submit standard accounting and other
financial reports. EVN's Business-Finance Department reviews the reports prior to submission to the
Management Board for consolidation. EVN's computerized accounting system was developed by
computer specialists from the three power companies, PCs 1, 2 and 3. While currently in use, the
program is still under evaluation and improvements are introduced as necessary. The business units all
have their own accounting departments and the accounting staff are generally competent.
3.19       PCI, PC2, PC3, HCMC and Hanoi Distribution Companies maintain a comprehensive
accounting system. These business units also have their own Electronic Data Processing Departments
acting as computer service centers for all their other departments. Other business units, which have not
yet computerized their accounts, are currently evaluating the systems in place. EVN is aware of the
need to adopt modern management practices and improve financial reporting within the group.
Eventually, a plan to computerize all significant accounting systems within EVN will be implemented.
The ADB study on "Improvement of Financial and Accounting System of the Power Companies in Viet
Nam" aimed at introducing a modem accounting and management information system, and the study on
"Power Sector Institutional Strengthening" under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) aimed at improving and
modernizing the commercial systems and institutional strengthening of the power sector, should assist
EVN in carrying out some of the important reforms and restructuring necessary.
Reporting and Management Information System
3.20       The guidelines for EVN's project development and procedures, accounting systems and
practices, infornation reporting, approval process and decision-making are extensive and reflect
prinarily a "top down" centralized approach to management control and decision-making. The reason
for the top-heavy decisior2 making seems to be lingering doubts as to the extent to which delegation to
the business units can be justified. The management reporting system has evolved primarily in response
to existing external reporting requirements and is used by the Government and EVN for strict
monitoring of the business units. Information is exchanged within EVN through written reports and the
computer network. Access to financial data is highly restricted and centralized. The ADB and IDA-



-27-
supported studies referred in para. 3.19 will address this issue and should help EVN decentralize and
improve the management of and operational relationship between the business units.
Audit
3.21       Auditing capability in Viet Nam has developed significantly over the past two years. Six
international accounting firms now have self-sufficient in-country practices. Three have been licensed
to operate independently in Viet Nam, while three operate as joint ventures with local firms. In
addition, there are five strictly local firms, which are state-owned enterprises. Operating under the
supervision of MOF, they are expected to compete and be financially self-sufficient. While two of
these local firms are joint venture entities with foreign accounting firms, they also operate separate
entities under their own namnes. Recently, MOF has also established a certification program for local
accountants, with technical assistance from the European Economic Union.
3.22       Currently, there is no independent external audit of Government entities in Viet Nam.
EVN has no Internal Auditing Department nor are there plans to create one. The Government does not
require the annual financial statements of the consolidated EVN and the independent business units to be
published or audited by independent auditors. The consolidated financial accounts of EVN will be
submnitted to MOE, MOF and the Tax Department for review and approval. MOF audits are used to
determine tax liabilities, scheduled payments of "state-rented" capital, and other financial matters. IDA
is advising MOF in initiating work under an Institutional Development Fund grant for improving Viet
Namn's audit capacity that will represent the first important steps toward designing and implementing
modem govemmental accounting and financial importation systems. At negotiations, agreement was
reached with EVN that it would appoint independent auditors acceptable to IDA and that an audit report
in a form acceptable to IDA would be made available to IDA within nine months after the close of each
financial year.
Taxes and Insurance
3.23       EVN is subject to the following major taxes: (a) tax on revenues (turnover tax) levied at
8% of power sales; (b) royalty tax at 2% on the use of water for hydro generation and calculated on the
basis of share of revenues from power sales generated from hydro against total generation; (c) capital
tax at 2.4% of government capital; and (d) income tax on net profit at 25%.
3.24       Unless otherwise provided by law or by MOE, EVN does not carry any insurance
protection for its assets and their contents. EVN does not also have either property or liability
insurance arrangements. Only company vehicles, as mandated by law, are insured. EVN is aware of
the IDA requirement for provision of insurance for assets financed by IDA and that insurance could be
obtained from external insurers or be effected through specific internal insurance funds of individual
business units or a common EVN fund. Agreement was reached during negotiations that EVN would
make provisions, satisfactory to IDA, for insurance against such risks and in such amounts consistent
with appropriate practice.
Budgd Arrangements
3.25       The existing budget process is designed to support applications by state-owned enterprises
for funds from the governnent budget and to provide the Government with a tool to exercise tight
financial control. Each business unit of EVN is required to submit an annual revenue and expenditure



-28-
budget and a five-year budget by September. These budgets are submnitted to the General Director, who
presents the annual budget to the Management Board for approval. The five-year plan for the period
1996-2000 is currently being prepared and will be proposed to the Prime Minister for approval. EVN
will review the financial performance of the business units and will compare it with the annual budget
for the purpose of granting bonuses to the units. The bonuses will be in the form of cash although no
definite criteria has been set by EVN with regard to the level and funding for them. The budget
process of EVN would be reviewed by the Power Sector Institutional Strengthening Study under PSREP
(Credit No. 2724-VN).






Chapter IV
The Project
A. Objectives and Description
4.1        The main objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) help meet the rapid growth in
electricity demand in the south of Viet Nam through the addition of new gas-fired generating capacity;
(b) strengthen the high voltage (HV) transformation capacity in Viet Nam; (c) assist the Government in
introducing private power in the country; (d) strengthen the institutional capability of EVN through
technical assistance and training; and (e) assist in the formulation of a national strategy and master plan
for rural electrification. The achievement of project objectives would be monitored during and after
project implementation through specific project performance indicators (para. 4.20).
Project Description
4.2        The proposed project would cover: (a) the installation of 2x150 MW gas turbines for the
450 MW Phu My 2, Phase-1 (PHMY2-1), Combined Cycle (CC) power block; (b) addition of about
900 MVA of HV transformation capacity at existing sub-stations in the South of Viet Nam and about
1,350 MVA of such capacity in other parts of the country; (c) resettlement and compensation of persons
affected by PHMY2-l; and (d) consulting services for: (i) project design and supervision for PHMY2-1
CC power block; (ii) development of a BOT-JYV type of arrangement for the Phu My 2, Phase-2
(PHMY2-2) CC power block on the basis of competitive bidding; (iii) technical assistance and training
for EVN managerial staff; (iv) master plan for rural electrification; and (v) technical studies for the Dai
Ninh hydropower project. In addition, technical assistance for development of the legal and regulatory
framework for the power sector would be provided by the ESMAP group of the World Bank.
Description of The Project Components
Phu Mv Power Station
4.3        The Phu My Power Station would be located in Phu My village, Ba Ria-Vung Tau
province in South Viet Nam. The site is about 600 mneters from the Thai Vai River which would be the
source of cooling water for the power station. The first phase of the Phu My development (PHMY1)
would comprise 3x200 MW conventional gas/oil fired power units financed by the OECF of Japan.
This phase is expected to be conmmissioned in 1998. The second phase of the Phu My development
(PHMY2) would comprise 2x450 MW gas-fired CC power blocks. The two 150 MW internal
combustion turbines (GTs) of the first block (PHMY2-1), which constitute the proposed project and
which are being constructed on a fast-track basis, would be commnissioned by end-1996; the full CC
block would be functional by 1998. The second 450 MW CC block (PHMY2-2) is expected to be
commissioned in 1998199. A detailed feasibility study for PHMY2 was prepared by the Power
Investigation and Design Company No 2 (PI)C2) and was reviewed and updated by consultants, ESBI
of Ireland. The study has been approved by EVN and the State Appraisal Committee and is acceptable
to IDA.



-30-
Gas Supplv for the Phu MY Power Station
4.4       In the near term (1997-1998), gas supply for Phu My would be available from the off-
shore Bach Ho associated gas field. Petro Viet Nam (PVN) would arrange to install gas compressors
which would increase the capacity of the existing pipe line from Bach Ho to the Ba Ria power station to
109-128 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) by the middle of 1997. This would be sufficient to meet
the gas requirement of about 56 MMCFD for the 2x150 MW GTs of PHMY2-1, about 38 MMCFD for
the gas turbines at the Ba Ria power station and about 30 MMCFD for the liquified petroleum gas
(LPG) plant. For a period of about six months after commissioning (end-1996 to mid-1997), the 2x150
MW GTs of PHMY2-1 would use distillate. The natural gas reserves of Bach Ho would suffice only
for a period of about five years. The price of natural gas from the Bach Ho field, following
commissioning of the compressors, has been fixed by the Government at US$2 per MMBTU.
4.5       In the long-term, PHMY2-2 will have to use gas from the off-shore Nam Con Son Basin
(Block 6), which is expected to be available on-shore at Vung Tau by the end of 1998. The participants
in Block 6 gas are, British Petroleum (BP) (30% stake), Statoil of Norway (15% stake), and Oil and
Natural Gas Commission of India (ONGC) (55% stake). At the present time, PVN (which has an
option to take a 5% stake in field development) is the owner of the gas since the existing Production
Sharing Agreement (PSC), which is for oil, has yet to be renegotiated with the participants in regard to
the gas discovery. The feasibility study for the 375 km mid-stream gas pipeline is currently under
progress by British Petroleum (BP), Statoil, Mobil and PVN. The pipeline would be constructed
through international competitive bidding. Evaluation of the Nam Con Son gas reserves (estimated at
around 2 trillion cubic feet (TCF)) has been completed by BP and Statoil and by PVN. The gas
reserves have subsequently been certified by an independent body, the National Natural Resources
Committee of Viet Nam. The Nam Con Son gas reserves would be enough to fire as much as 2,400
MW of CC capacity for 20 years. The price of Nam Con Son gas has yet to be determined, but is
expected to be in the range of US$2.5 to 3.5 per MMBTU.
4.6        The gas from Block 6 is earmarked for: (a) PHMYI - 3x200MW, to be financed by
OECF of Japan; (b) PHMY2-1 - 450 MW, being constructed by EVN; (c) PHMY2-2 - 450/600MW,
which would be constructed through a BOT type arrangement; and (d) PHMY3 - 600/900 MW, which
would be constructed by BP through a BOT type arrangement. EVN needs to conclude a Gas Supply
Agreement (GSA) for PHMY1, PHMY2-1 and Ba Ria (total 180-190 MMCFD for 20 years) with the
owner and developer of the gas. The GSAs for PHMY2-2 and PHMY3 would be concluded by the
BOT developers.
4.7        The estimated cost of development of the Nam Con Son gas systen is about US$760
mnillion, comprising: (a) US$150 million for Lan Tay field development; (b) US$180 million for
compression platform for Lan Tay, 7-9 years down the line; (c) US$100 million for Lan Do field
development; and (d) US$330 million for the trunkline to shore and terminal. Several ownership
structures are currently being explored for the construction and operation of the pipeline. The minimum
gas supply required to make the pipeline and field development economically viable, is estimated by BP
to be about 150 MMCFD.
4.8        Agreement was reached at negotiations that EVN will enter into contractual arrangements
by no later than December 31, 1996, for gas supply to PHMY2-1 for a period of at least 20 years.
Further, (a) receipt by IDA of certification of gas reserves for Namn Con Son, satisfactory to IDA; and



-31-
(b) EVN entering into contractual arrangements for gas supply to PHMY2-1 for a period of at least five
years, are conditions for effectiveness of the IDA Credit.
Addition of HV Transformation CapacitY
4.9        EVN has done a detailed analysis of the transformer capacity and the forecast demand
(1995-2000) at each of its existing HV (66, 110 and 220 kV) sub-stations. Most of these sub-stations
not only do not have firm transformer capacity, but are operating near (and in some cases above) their
name plate ratings. This situation is a cause for alarm and augmentation of transformer capacity at
these sub-stations is imminent. Twenty-three sub-stations in the South of Viet Nam and 28 sub-stations
in the rest of Viet Nam, where the need for additional transforming capacity (based on current loading
and forecast demand) is most urgent, are listed in Annex 5. A total of about 2,250 MVA of
transforming capacity (900 MVA in the south and 1,350 MVA in the rest of Viet Nam) together with
the associated switching and control facilities are proposed to be installed under the project.
Consulting Services: (a) CC Block of PHMY2-1: Desien and Project Management: and (b) Dai Ninh
Hydropower: Technical Studies
4.10       Provision has been made in the project for about 350 staff-months (SM) of consulting
services to assist in engineering, design, procurement and construction supervision for the CC Block of
PHMY2-1. As this project component has to be implemented on a fast track basis, EVN has appointed
ESBI of Ireland as consultants, on a sole source basis, for the two GTs of PHMY2-1 for about 160 SM.
This is acceptable to IDA as ESBI (selected on a competitive basis for the Ba Ria CC power plant under
PSREP) are already in Viet Nam and are fully familiar with the requirements of PHMY2-1. It would
also be impossible to meet the extremely tight project schedule if EVN were to embark on a new
selection process. Consulting services for the steam cycle of PHMY2-1, amounting to about 190 SM,
would be procured following the Bank's procedures for the selection of consultants. EVN has adequate
in-house capability to undertake engineering, design, procurement and construction supervision for the
transformer reinforcement proposed to be undertaken under the project and hence, no provisiorn has
been made for external consulting services for this project component.
4.11       A provision of US$2.0 million has been made in the project for consulting assistance of
about 130 SM for technical studies associated with the Dai Ninh Hydropower project which is currently
under preparation as a prospective IDA-assisted project for FY97. These consulting services would be
engaged following the Bank's procedures for the selection of consultants.
Technical Assistance for Development of PHMY2-2 on Build. Operate. Transfer-Joint Venture (BOT-
JV) Basis
4.12       The main objectives of this technical assistance (TA) would be to: (a) review the
Govermnent's overall private sector policy and legal framework vis-a-vis development, ownership, and
operation of private power projects; (b) recommend the necessary legal and incentive framework for the
implementation of power generation projects by the private sector in Viet Nam; (c) develop the
solicitation package for PHMY2-2 (including selection criteria and security package) and evaluate the
proposals; and (d) assist the Govermment in contract negotiations and executing the contract with the
selected project sponsor. The terms of reference for this TA are at Annex 6. Agreement was reached
at negotiations that EVN would develop PHMY2-2 through a BOT-JV type of arrangement following a



-32-
competitive bidding process and would engage TA for this exercise according to terms of reference
agreed with IDA.
Technical Assistance and Training for EVN
4.13       PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) provides for TA directed at institutional strengthening,
focusing on the development of appropriate organizational structures, adoption of commercial
management practices, budget and control systems, reporting procedures and information flows, under
the reformed sector structure.  This TA is currently under implementation.  It is envisaged that
considerable resources (in terms of advisory services, computer hardware and software) would be
required in the strengthening of EVN management, including training of staff, following the
reconrmendations of the aforementioned TA. The proposed project provides for about 18 SM of in-
country consulting assistance, about 6 SMs of staff training and about US$100,000 worth of computer
hardware and software. The terms of reference for the proposed TA would be drafted after completion
of the first TA. Agreement was reached at negotiations that following completion of the TA under the
PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN), and taking into account its recommnendations, EVN would discuss and
agree with IDA the requirements for further TA and training and implement such TA and training
according to a plan and schedule to be agreed with IDA.
Technical Assistance for Master Plan for Rural Electrification
4.14       Extension of electrification to rural areas in the past has been dictated primarily by the
need for agricultural pumping. To achieve a more widespread improvement in the living standards of
the rural population, the Government has set specific targets for per capita electricity consumption to
the year 2020 in various rural areas of the country. As costs of extensive rural electrification (RE)
become increasingly higher, the Government would need to optimize its limited resources and undertake
RE in the most cost effective manner. This would require development of a master plan that lays down
policies, strategies and criteria for meeting provincial rural area development priorities. There are a
number of technical, financial and institutional issues that would need to be addressed including: (a)
inadequate transmission and distribution networks, poor power supply reliability and poor loading
characteristics in rural areas; (b) scarcity of investment capital, subsidized pricing practices, inadequate
private investment mechanisms and underdeveloped domestic equipment enterprises; and (c) lack of
locally based institutions to manage and operate grid-connected and/or isolated rural electric networks.
The main objectives of the rural electrification master plan study would be to define: (a) appropriate
regulatory, institutional and financing frameworks; (b) methodologies for forecasting and economic
evaluation of alternative supply locations and options; and (c) technical standards of design, construction
and operation. The terms of reference for the study are at Annex 7. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that EVN would undertake a master plan study of rural electrification according to terms of
reference agreed with IDA, review with IDA the reconunendations of the study and fornulate a rural
electrification mnaster plan and implementation program consistent with the reconmmendations of the
study.
Technical Assistance for Le2al and Regulatory Framework
4.15       This TA would be a follow up on the TA on "Power Sector Reform and Restructuring"
that was provided by ESMAP in association with PSREP (Credit No. 2427-VN). The main objective of
the proposed TA (which would also be funded by ESMAP) is to assist the Government in identifying
the issues and options in creating a legal and regulatory framework for the power sector that would be



-33-
conducive to private sector participation. The terms of reference for this TA, which would include
drafting of an Electricity Law and a Grid Code, are given in Annex 8. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that EVN would review with IDA the recommnendations )f this TA and thereafter take
measures, mutually acceptable to IDA and the Borrower, for implementing the regulatory framework
and the Grid Code and take further actions in passing the Electricity Law.
B. Implementation
4.16       EVN, through its appropriate business units, would have full responsibility for
implementing the physical components of the project, including the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for
Phu My. MOE (now MOI) and EVN would be responsible for managing the TA associated with the
project's policy aspects. Steering committees would be formed and representatives from relevant line
ministries would be involved in the development of the legal and regulatory framework and in the
solicitation of private power proposals. For managing the implementation of large thermal power
projects in the south of Viet Nam EVN has established the Phu My Ba Ria Management Board
(PMBRMB). PMBRMB will be responsible for implementing the PHMY2-1 component of the project.
For managing the implementation of high voltage transmission lines and sub-stations in the south, north
and center of Viet Nam, respectively, EVN has established Management Boards of the Power Projects
for the Southern, Northern and Central Regions (MBPPSR, MBPPNR and MBPPCR). These Boards
will be responsible for irnplementing the transformer augmentation component of the project falling in
their respective regions. The organization charts of the PMBRMB and the MBPPSR, MBPPNR and
MBPPCR and the project management units created by them for implementation of the project
comnponents are shown in Charts 4 and 5. Most of the personnel of these Boards have been drawn from
the erstwhile power companies and have adequate experience in technical and managerial aspects of
project implernentation. PMBRMB will employ consultants for assistance in engineering, design, bid
evaluation and construction supervision of the PHMY2-1 project component (para. 4.10). The 2x150
MW GTs of PHMY2-1 will be installed under a single responsibility supply and erection contract.
MBPPSR, MBPPNR and MBPPCR have substantial in-house expertise in engineering, design,
procuremnent and construction supervision for installation of transformers and no external consulting
assistance is required (para. 4.9). This project component will be installed by local contractors under
the supervision of staff of the respective Boards and with supervision services from foreign contractors
for the installation of major equipment like transformers and circuit breakers. Bid documents following
the Bank guidelines were prepared by consultants for PHMY2-1; the bids were received in September
1995 and contract award has been made. Bid documents for some of the transformer installations have
also been issued. Bidding Evaluation Committees (having representation from the MOI) have been set
up for evaluating bids and approving contract awards.
4.17       EVN has prepared a Project Implementation Plan in line with Bank guidelines (Annex 19,
Ref. 1). The bar charts for implementing the various project components are given in Charts 2 and 3.
Most of the project would be implemented over the 1996-1997 period. Vietnamese institutions are
technically well experienced in implementing the project components and with the consulting assistance
provided under the project for PMHY2-1, no substantive problems are foreseen in efficient and timely
implementation of the project. The implementing arrangements are satisfactory to IDA.



-34-
Monitoring and Reporting
4.18       Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in terms of physical
execution and financial reports were agreed with EVN, at negotiations. It was also agreed that EVN
will furnish quarterly progress reports. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be drafted by
IDA not later than six months after completion of the Credit and agreement was reached with EVN to
assist in its preparation. EVN will adopt the plan for the operational phase of the project. EVN will
also prepare and make available to IDA its own evaluation report, including a summary report which
will be attached unedited to the ICR. The evaluation would assess the project execution and initial
operation, its costs and benefits, IDA's performance, its own performance of the obligations under the
Credit Agreement, and the extent to which the purposes of the Credit were achieved.
Supervision Plan and Key Performance Indicators for Project Monitoring
4.19       Supervision of this project will extend over a period of three years, 1996-1998. The key
issues that would be focused upon are: (a) review of Viet Nan's power development plan in keeping
with changes in the economic scenario; (b) a continuing dialogue with the Government on tariffs for the
power sector; (c) monitoring of compliance with financial covenants to assure the financial health of the
sector while undertaking large investment programs; (d) monitoring of the implementation of the
environmental impact mitigation measures and resettlement plans for PHMY2-1; and (e) technical
supervision of physical implementation of the project components. The IDA missions, accompanied
with ESMAP as necessary, would also assist the Government in: (a) legal and regulatory framework
issues for the power sector; (b) realizing a BOT-JV type of arrangement for PHMY2-2; (c) institutional
strengthening of EVN; and (d) development of strategies and master plan for rural electrification.
Supervision of the project would require expertise in power engineering, economics, financial analysis,
power sector regulation and private power development, and resettlement. Three missions annually for
a period of three years (normally coinciding with preparatory missions for ongoing and future IDA-
assisted projects) are foreseen for adequate supervision of this project. The total estimated staff inputs
are: (a) power engineer, economist and financial analyst - 24 staff-weeks; (b) environmental impact
assessment and rehabilitation - 4 staff weeks; and (c) regulatory framework and private power
development - 15 staff-weeks (see Annex 9 for details).
4.20       Key project performance indicators that would be used for monitoring and supervision are
given in Annex 9. These performance indicators are closely linked to the project objectives spelled out
in para. 4.1. The targets for some of the performance indicators have been defined, while targets for
others would be developed, early during implementation. In addition to the perfomiance indicators,
target dates have been defined to monitor: (a) commissioning of PHMY2-1 on schedule to ensure that
there is no load shedding in the south; (b) availability of gas by mid-1997 so that PHMY2-2 turbines do
not bum costly distillate fuel for more than six months; (c) taking of timely steps by EVN towards
development of PHMY2-2 on a BOT-JV basis; and (d) timely completion of the TA on legal and
regulatory framework for the power sector and the process of subsequent decisions on its incorporation.

C. Environment and Resettlement
Phu My Power Project
Environmental Impacts
4.21       A detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA) (Annex 19, Ref. 2), which takes into
account the 3x200 MW conventional power plants of PHMY1 and the 2x450 MW CC power blocks of
PHMY2, has concluded that with proper design and mitigation measures, atmospheric impacts (NO.,
SO, and noise levels) and aquatic impacts (cooling water temperature, chlorine concentration and impact
on shrimp farming and mangroves) would be within acceptable limits.  A summary of main
environmental impacts and mitigation measures is presented in Annex 10. The EIA has been approved
by the Governrnent. It was agreed during negotiations that EVN would: (a) design the PHMY2-1 plant
to meet specified environmental requirements and adopt appropriate mitigation measures; and (b) set up
an environmental unit and an environmental coordinator as part of the management structure of the
power station.
Resettlement
4.22       About 18 ha of land are being acquired by PMBRMB for the overall PHMY2
development, which would accommodate the 450 MW block of PHMY2-1, whose GTs are being
financed under the project, and the future 450 MW block of PHMY2-2. About 63% of the area is
covered with cashew trees, about 30% comprises other tree crops and the remaining 7% is fallow land.
The total number of families that would be affected by the PHMY2 development is 55 of which 9
(currently residing on the right-of-way of the transmission line) will need to be resettled and the
remaining 46 compensated and rehabilitated. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared for
the 55 families that would be affected by the project (see Annex 11 for details). The principles of that
RAP would also apply for resettlement/compensation of people affected by future phases of
development at the Phu My site. The project affected persons (PAPs) will be relocated, as far as
possible, close to their present location in order to ensure that their socio-economic lifestyles will not be
affected. The form of compensation for land will be "land for land", unless PAPs specifically insist on
cash compensation. PAP's opting for cash compensation would be given a choice between land-based
and non-land based rehabilitation. Compensation will be paid at replacement cost for houses and
structures and at market rates for trees and crops. The RAP will be implemented by PMBRMB with
the involvement of PAPs and the peoples' committees at the district and commune levels. Adequate
mechanisms have been provided for the redressal of grievances and for external and internal supervision
and monitoring. The RAP is in compliance with the Bank's operational directives and is acceptable to
IDA. The RAP was agreed with the Government at negotiations. It was also agreed at negotiations
that EVN would carry out the RAP as approved by the Government and accepted by IDA.
Installation of Transformers
4.23       All transformers and their associated switchgear will be installed in existing substations
which have been in operation for several years. Hence, no acquisition of new land would be necessary
and thus there would be no persons affected by this project component. An environmental analysis
pertaining to the installation of transformers at sub-stations is given in Annex 12. No PCB is used in



-36-
the transformers in Viet Narn and none would be used for the transformers that would be installed
under the project
D. Cost Estimates
4.24       The total cost of the project (including capitalized interest during construction) is estimated
at US$242 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$180 million. The cost estimates for the
gas turbines for PHMY2-1 are based on bids already received. The cost estimates for the transformers
and associated switchgear are based on contracts recently placed for such equipment in Viet Nam.
Physical contingencies are assumed at 10% of the base cost for all project components. Price
contingencies are estimated on the basis of escalation factors of 6% per annum for local cost
components and 2.2% per annum for foreign cost components, following the Bank's latest forecasts.
Table 4.1 summarizes the cost estimates for the project (details are at Annex 13).
E. Financing Plan
4.25       The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 4.2. The proposed IDA credit of
US$180 million equivalent would meet 100% of the foreign cost of the project and about 74% of
project financing requirements. The proposed IDA credit would be made to the Govermnent at IDA's
standard rate for a 40 year term including 5 years of grace on repayment of principal. The Credit
would be onlent to EVN in US dollars at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% per annum, with repayment over
20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and foreign exchange risk being borne by EVN. The
finalization of subsidiary loan agreement between the Govemrnment and EVN, acceptable to IDA, would
be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.

F. Procurement
4.26         About 94.5%  (US$170 million equivalent) of the IDA credit would be used for financing
goods procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using the Bank guidelines.  In the
evaluation of bids obtained following ICB procedures, a margin of preference equal to 15% of the CIF



-38-
bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be
allowed for domestic manufactures. About 3.5% (US$6.5 million equivalent) of the credit amount
would be used for financing consulting services and TA procured following the Bank procedures for the
employment of consultants. Consulting services for the two GTs of PHMY2-1 amounting to about
US$2.0 million equivalent have been procured on sole source basis (para. 4.10). About 0.5% (US$1.0
million equivalent) of the credit would be used for financing specialized equipment (including testing
and measuring equipment, computer hardware and software) using the following procedures complying
with the Bank guidelines: (a) Limited International Bidding (LIB), aggregating US$0.5 million
equivalent; and (b) International Shopping (IS) aggregating USS0.5 million equivalent. Contracts under
these procedures would not exceed the equivalent of US$200,000 each for LIB and US$50,000 each for
IS.
4.27       The bid documents would follow the text of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. All
bid documents, contract award recommendations and contracts for goods and services would be subject
to prior review and approval by IDA. The total number of procurement packages is foreseen to be: (a)
ICB - 8 packages (Annex 14); and (b) LIB and IS - about 5 packages. A total of about 660 staff-
months of consulting services will be engaged under 6 contracts.
4.28       Civil and installation work for transformer additions would be contracted to local finns
through a competitive bidding process satisfactory to IDA. Such local contracts would not be financed
from the IDA credit.
4.29       Table 4.3 summarizes the procurement arrangements for the components expected to be
financed out of the proposed IDA credit.
G. Disbursements
4.30       The IDA credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures, or 100% of
local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for items procured through ICB; (b) 50% of local expenditures for
other items procured locally; and (c) 100% of expenditures for consulting services, excluding taxes.
Statement of Expenditures (SOE) procedures would be followed for consultancy contracts below
US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account
would be established in US currency for EVN on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA with a
deposit of US$3.0 million. Replenishment applications would be submitted monthly or when the
account is drawn by 30% of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs first. For withdrawal outside
of the Special Account (applications for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitments) a
minimum application value of 30% of the authorized allocation of the Special Account would be
observed.
4.31       Retroactive financing would be permitted to the extent of US$15.0 million equivalent for
payments made, prior to the date of the Credit Agreement but after October 1, 1995 (the appraisal
starting date), for contracting urgently required goods and consulting services. This is necessary to
meet the project implementation schedule.



-39-
4.32          Annex 15 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit and the standard
profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia. This is a fast track project and the Credit is
assumed to be disbursed about two years faster than the profile, based on actual performance of Viet
Nam on other power projects and the preparatory work already undertaken. The project is expected to
be completed by June 30, 1999 and the closing date for the credit would be December 31, 1999.

Financial Aspects
A. Past and Present Financial Performance
PAst P'rformce of the Pwer Sector
5.1          Since 1990 the power companies (PCs) were allowed by the Govermment to manage and

for the Government and themselves."  Key performance figures of PCI, PC2 and PC3 for 1994 are

5.2          The past financial results showed that the three PCs' overall financial performance,
representing the operations of the entire power sector, were satisfactory as PCI and PC2 generated
revenues sufficient to cover all their operating and maintenance expenses, including depreciation.
While PCI and PC2 indicate reasonably acceptable results, PC3's finances were seriously negative and
as an independent company, it could be considered bankrupt.
5.3          Notwithstanding the acceptable financial results related to the overall operation of the PCs,
they continue to have serious cash flow constraints. This problem, which constrains the PCs' ability to
finance their investment program, is clearly discerned from the serious weakness in the capital structure



-41-
of the power sector. The PCs simply have not been provided with any paid-in capital nor allowed to
accumulate adequate earnings to sufficiently finance capital expenditures. The structure of the sector's
equity base consists of Government capital at D 14,533 billion (representing the non-cash residual
interest in the assets of the PCs after deducting liabilities), and accumulated profits of only D 158
billion, representing a mere 1 % of total equity. Furthermore, until 1995, the PCs were required to
remit anywhere from 30-100% of their depreciation charge to the Govermnent and to continue
depreciating and remitting fully depreciated assets. In other words, the PCs' financial constraints derive
from their balance sheets, not their income statements. With these constraints, the PCs' financial
performance and liquidity have suffered, ruining their ability not only to maintain existing assets but
also to finance capital investments and future expansion. Without adequate retained earnings, the
financial resiliency of the power sector to withstand unexpected business crises has been greatly eroded.
5.4        To address the vulnerable condition of the PCs, particularly, PC2 and PC3, and to achieve
financial recovery, the PSREP sought a recapitalization of the PCs' equity with the aim of rebuilding,
fully funding, and strengthening the capital base. In 1994, the Government decided to discontinue the
requirement of remitting depreciation charges starting 1995. Assurances were also obtained (under IDA
Credit No. 2724-VN) that actions, including but not limited to adjustment of tariffs, would be made to
enable PC2 to generate enough internal funds to finance its investment program and to ensure viable
operations of PC3.
Financial Performance of EVN
5.5        The reorganization of the power sector in January 1995 into a corporate structure resulted
in the establishment of EVN, as holding company, and numerous subsidiaries or business units involved
in specific types of activities under it. For accounting purposes, EVN as a consolidated entity now
comprises the following dependent and independent entities:  14 power plants, four transmission
companies, five distribution companies, four construction companies, and nine peripheral units
consisting of two design companies, two conununications companies, the National Load Dispatch
Center, the Energy Institute, the Research Center, an equipment production company, and a finance
company.
5.6        Given the very recent establishment of EVN, a financial analysis of its past performance is
not meaningful. The first year of operation is 1995, when the accounts of the three formerly fully
integrated power companies, PCI, PC2 and PC3 (which were responsible for generation, transmission
and distribution in the North, South and Center, respectively), were consolidated into the accounts of
EVN.

5.8          As can be seen in the above table, EVN reported net revenues of about D 137 billion in
the first quarter of its first full year of operation. However, these figures are prelirninary and should be
treated with caution. The figures reflect accounts submitted by the various business units to EVN for
consolidation. It has been the practice of the previous power companies to submit figures that
underestimnate financial performance that would result in more fund transfers and less taxable obligations
from and to the Govermment, respectively. EVN is convinced that this is the case for the first quarter
of 1995 and it is currently discussing this issue with the independent business units on the final
numbers.

5.10          l accordance with its charter, the State assigns capital and resources to EVN, which is
also allowed to mobilize all sources of domestic and foreign funds in line with the provisions of the
State. EVN's financial objective, as defined by its charter, is to preserve and develop the assigned
capital and fulfill its financial obligations towards the State in conformity with laws. Furthermore, it is
responsible for regularly upgrading its equipment, technology and management so as to lower its cost of
production and reduce electricity losses. While the financial objectives presented are very broad, the
Institutional Strengthening Study financed under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) would greatly assist
EVN to define "market-oriented' financial objectives, develop financial planning systems and redefine
the process of setting performance targets for its business units.
5.11         Table 5.3 shows that EVN's assets to date have largely been financed by equity as the
power companies have not incurred any significant long term debt in the past. The long term debt
consists primarily of some term loans contracted by PC2 in 1993 from local commercial banks. Gross
Fixed Assets in Operation decreased from D 22,373 billion in 1994 to D 21,375 billion in 1995 on
account of EVN's writing off of some assets during the consolidation of its accounts in 1995. EVN's
liquidity position is satisfactory with a current ratio of 1.24 during the first quarter of 1995.
Fixed Assets Valuation and Distribution
5.12         Major portions of the fixed assets of the PCs were initially recorded at cost. Upon the
unification of Viet Nam, the PCs' assets were valued using standard unit prices, which was typical of
the system used by many centrally-planned economies. These asset values remained on the PCs' books
at cost without regard for the general development of the economy and inflation. After minor
adjustments were made in 1981, 1985 and 1989, a nationwide asset revaluation exercise was decreed by
the Government in 1990 for all industries, using the following parameters: (a) one Russian Ruble



-44-
equivalent to D 2,400 for assets procured from the former Soviet Union; and (b) one US Dollar
equivalent to D 2,400 for assets procured abroad elsewhere. A second nationwide revaluation was
undertaken in January 1992 using: (a) one Russian Ruble equivalent to D 10,000 for all assets procured
from the former Soviet union; and (b) one US Dollar equivalent to D 10,000 for assets procured abroad
elsewhere. However, due to the high rates of inflation experienced in Viet Nam over the past four
years, the varying methodologies used for revaluing fixed assets, and distortions in the value of fixed
assets, it is not possible to state definitively whether the assets are properly valued. As a result,
computations of annual rates of return, can be misleading.
5.13       Upon the organization of EVN and its subsidiaries, the necessary assets that will be used
by the appropriate business units were transferred at net book value. These historical book values were
based on the 1992 revaluation exercise. The carrying costs of assets which were acquired prior to the
revaluation done in 1992 could not be determined as objective. It is therefore difficult-to determine if
the carrying costs of the assets transferred within the EVN group reflect the fair value of the assets at
the time of transfer. A revaluation of EVN's fixed assets in operation will be undertaken as part of the
ADB Study on "Improvement of Financial and Accounting Systemns of the PCs in Viet Nam". Until
this valuation exercise is concluded, the value of fixed assets presented in EVN's balance sheet as of
March 31, 1995 is used as basis for future projections. To enable continuous assessment of real
earnings to be made which in turn will help in determining the appropriate level of cash generation,
agreement was reached during negotiations that EVN will revalue its fixed assets periodically in
accordance with sound and consistently maitained methods of valuation satisfactory to IDA.
5.14       As of March 31, 1995, EVN's gross fixed assets representing generation, transmission,
distribution and other assets (except land) of the power sector, amounted to D 21,373 billion of which
D 7,218 billion was accumulated depreciation. The Hoa Binh hydroelectric plant, formerly operated by
PCI and now operated by the Hoa Binh Power Plant Company, represented the biggest asset holding
valued at more than a quarter of total EVN assets. Other substantial assets were transferred to
Transmission Company No. 1 at D 2,072 billion and to the Tri An Power Plant Company at D 1,848
billion. The new PCI and PC2 recorded asset shares at 9% and 7% of total EVN assets, respectively.
The 500 kV transmission system was transferred to Transmission Company No. 4 and the assets were
valued at D 1,094 billion.
B. Fiunicial Outlook
5.15       Projections of EVN's financial performance for the period 1995-2001 and the assumptions
underlying these projections are presented in Annexes 16 and 17. The key financial indicators are
presented in Table 5.4 below. In interpreting the ratios shown, it should be borne in mind that EVN
will become fully operational only at the end of 1995 and that there are certain outtanding financial
issues including appropriate bulk pricing arrngement, d  ion  of cost and profit centers,
unrealistic asset valuation, and the accounting variances and misstatements described in para. 3.16, that
could make conventional ratio analysis of limited value.

5.16         The future financial situation of EVN will depend heavily on the economic development of
the country and the resulting demand and sales increases, and the speed and efficiency with which EVN
will be able to develop and finance its potentially large investment program. Maintenance of a sound
revenue position for financing operations will be equally important. The assumptions used for EVN's
future finances were designed to ensure its financial viability and satisfactory financial performance. In
this context, EVN's ability to generate income adequate to meet all financial obligations on a timely
basis and to sustain an adequate level of working capital needed for continuous operations will be of
great importance. The projections also aim at developing EVN's capability to contribute to the renewal
and expansion of assets and maximizing EVN's finances by abandoning its total reliance on the
Govermnent budget and instead, using, to the extent possible, internal as well as external sources of
funds. Having these principles in mind, the financial projections are based on the parameters dealt with
below.
5.17         The Government has developed three demand scenarios: low, base and high. Over the
next few years the scenarios are not too different because financing for the generation facilities is more
or less secured and the completion of the 500 kV interconnection system provides much of the energy
required to satisfy the demand expected to materialize in the short-run. The financial projections are
based on the high case scenario with an average growth rate over 1995-2000 of around 12.8% in the
North, 16%  for the South, and 15%  for the Center or an average increase of 14.6%  for the country as
a whole. Average technical and non-technical losses currently at about 21 % of generation (of which
non-technical losses are about 3%) are projected to be maintained at 21%  until 1997 and to be gradually
reduced until the losses reach 17% in 2001.

5.18       On the basis of these assumptions, EVN's projected financial results are satisfactory
showing that it would be able to generate revenues sufficient to cover all operating expenses (including
depreciation), as well as interest expenses and income taxes. EVN's load forecast assumes that sales
would increase from 10,676 Gwh in 1995 to 24,297 Gwh in 2001-an increase of about 15% p.a. With
projected reduction in system losses, review of the power development program, and upward adjustment
in tariffs agreed with under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN), electricity revenues will increase by an
average of about 33% from D 6,059 billion in 1995 to D 32,714 billion in the year 2001. The
projected income statements also assumes that EVN would be able to increase tariffs by half a cent (5
USc/kWh) beginning FY96; from its current level of 5 USc/kWh, the average tariff is expected to
increase to 5.5 USc/kWh in FY96, and reach 7 USc/kWh by 1999.
5.19       EVN's operating costs are projected to increase on average by 14% annually between
FY95-2001. EVN's fuel expenses (as it puts several hydropower projects to operation and switches to
more fuel-efficient thermal plants) are expected to reduce significantly over this period. Because tariff
increases would rise faster than increases in operating costs, EVN's operating ratio is expected to
improve substantially from 92% to 38%. Consequently, operating income is expected to grow steadily
from 8% of total revenues in FY95 to 62% in FY2001. While interest expenses are projected to
escalate from D 22 billion to D 2,025 billion during the period, as EVN finances a larger portion of
future investments through loans, nevertheless, net income is calculated to rise from 6% of total
revenues in FY95 to 42% in FY2001.
5.20       The financial projections show that with reasonable tariff adjustments averaging to about
10% p.a. and allowing EVN to accumulate profits and build its cash reserves, EVN would be able to
finance about 34% of its future investment from internal sources. At negotiations, agreement was
reached with EVN and the Government that EVN would take all actions including but not limited to
revision of tariffs, so that funds generated from internal sources would be equivalent to not less than
30% of the annual average of EVN's capital expenditures incurred for the financial year, the previous
financial year, and the next following financial year.
5.21       In the past, the power sector has not borrowed long term funds since all funds have been
provided through the Government budget. EVN's existing long term debt is only 2% of its debt plus
equity, however, long term debt and further borrowing would be needed to finance EVN's investment
program, which would involve large debt service payments in the coming years. The projections
assume that about two-thirds of future investments would be financed through loans and the balance
from internal cash generation. The assumptions on future financing show that no additional capital
infusion nor any contribution to the investment program would be made by the Government during the
period as it is the Government's intention that EVN becomne self-sufficient from the date of its
organization. The decision by the Government to wean the power sector into financial independence
through several steps would lay the foundation for a power sector that hopefully would be able to raise
its own funds for capital expansion.  In order to achieve satisfactory financial performance and
contribute to the renewal and expansion of assets, PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) included contractual
obligations in the legal agreements binding PC2 and PC3 to maintain financial viability. Through these
covenants, (suitably modified following the restructuring of the power sector) IDA would monitor the
relevant PCs' financial performance and, eventually, assist them to become sufficiently creditworthy to
raise funds in the capital markets.

Note: All figures are in Dong billion.
5.23        EVN's development program for the period 1995-1999 is huge when compared to its
modest capital expenditures of the past. It is projected at D 58,730 billion or an average annual
investment of D 11,746 billion. This is mainly due to the large capital costs of thermal and hydro
projects which account for about 43% and 40%, respectively, of the total investment program. The
hydro generation program includes investments in the future projects in Ban Mai (D 2,105 billion), Son
La (D 4,745 billion), Yali (D 4,907 billion), Plei Kron (D 1,581 billion), and Ham Thuan Da Mi (D
4,779 billion). Thermal generation includes investments in three major plants: Pha Lai (D 8,484
billion), Quang Ninh (D 1,674 billion) and Phu My (D 8,880 billion). The value of EVN's net fixed
assets in operations and its revalued rate base at the end of the period are projected to increase to about
1.9 timnes their 1995 levels.
5.24        To finance this substantial investment program, EVN would secure long term financing,
net of debt service, of about D 17,766 billion of projected 1995-1999 investments. These borrowings
represent an adequate capital structure with long term debt not exceeding 40% of total capitalization for
the projected period. EVN is expected to finance the balance from internally generated funds and
achieve a significant level of self financing averaging about 35 % throughout the period.
5.25        The financial projections show that with the implementation of adequate tariff increases,
the debt service coverage ratio of EVN would be between 3.3 to 82.1 during the period. The initial
years of operation would show very high debt servicing capabilities as debts repayments would not
occur until the later part of the period. With a view to maintaining debt service at acceptable levels,
agreement was reached at negotiations with EVN and the Government that EVN would not incur
additional debt unless its estimated internally generated cash, after expenditure for each year, during the



-48-
term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 2.0 times its total estimated debt service requirements in
such years.
5.26       In the past, the financial constraints of the power sector (para. 5.3) stemmed from the
insufficiency of its equity capital. While the Government's policy is to no longer make any capital
contributions to EVN in order to set it up as an independent company, it must recognize that the
financial viability of EVN is well beyond EVN's control. There are problems which can negatively
influence the financial situation of EVN; if projected demand fails to materialize, if the Government is
unable or- is delayed in making the necessary tariff adjustments, if the external financing for the
investment program is not fully secured, or if other unforseen problems arises, the Government will
need to provide relief, either through new equity investments or advances or reimbursements in respect
of some portions of the investment program. At negotiations, agreements were reached that by
December of each year, EVN will review with IDA its proposed annual budgets and financial plan for
each succeeding five year period.

CHAPTER VI
Project Justification
A. Economic Analysis
6.1        Development of the power sector is crucial for the economic upliftment of Viet Nam.
Implementation of the proposed project would help ensure the country's continued economic growth in
general and of the rapidly expanding southem region, in particular. The project would make a
significant contribution towards: (a) strengthening the managerial capabilities of the power sector
entities; (b) establishing a legal and regulatory framework for the power sector, a necessary prerequisite
for the introduction of private power; and (c) achieving a BOT type arrangement in the power sector.
6.2        The project supports two crucial investments in the power sector of Viet Nam - PHMY2-1
and HV transformer additions. The acute power shortage predicted for the South from the end of 1996
makes it imperative to add generation within a short period of about 15 months. This is feasible only
with internal combustion turbines (GTs). Forunately, natural gas would be available to fuel these GTs
from mid-1997 and the use of costly diistillate oil is expected to be limited to about 6 months only.
Also, the discovery of large offshore gas reserves in the South and the expected availability of this gas
onshore by end-1998 makes gas-fired combined cycle (CC) generation an economically attractive (and
environmentally least-objectionable) option for power generation in the South. Gas-fired generation
(along with environmentally acceptable hydropower), thus, figures largely in the least-ost power
development plan for Viet Nam.
6.3        The second investment supported by the project (HIV transformer additions) is an
investment that is long overdue. Due to paucity of funds, many HV transformer substations have aeen
operating at or above their rated capacities. The consequences of overloading transformers are a loss of
life, high energy losses and unserved energy. PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) supports the reinforcement
of medium voltage (MV) distribution in some of the heavily loaded MV systems supplying the fast
growing areas in and around HCMC. Complementary investments in the HV system are vital to meet
the demand growth. The project supports transformer capacity augmentation at some of the critically
loaded HV substations in fast growth areas in the South as well as the most urgent capacity additions in
the HV transformier substations elsewhere in Viet Nam, especially in the North.
PHMY2
6.4        The 2x15OMW GTs of PHMY2-1 are scheduled to be commissioned by end-1996. A
detailed feasibility study by PIDC2 has established that it would be economical to convert the GTs to
CC operation for gas prices above USSI.75IMMBTU. Accordingly, the GTs would be converted to
CC operation by the installation of the associated steam cycle equipment in end-1998. The following
Base Case assurmptions are made in the economic analysis:
(a)   Costs and monetary benefits are converted to 1995 prices. Due to the liberalized nature of
the market for foreign exchange in Viet Nam, the exchange rate reflects market prices and
no adjustments are made for foreign costs. As the labor component of the project cost is



-50-
s -.                         only about 1 % of the total cost, no adjustment is made for the shadow wage rate
(estimated at about.0.75).
(b)   Capital cost for the GTs is US$117.4 million; this includes physical contingency of 10%;
price contingencies and duties and taxes are excluded. The capital cost for the steam cycle
to be installed at a later date is assumed to be US$7501kW.
(c)   In the Vietnamese power grid, generation accounts for about 65 % of the total investment,
transmission and distribution accounting for the balance 35%. Accordingly, the cost of
transmission and distribution associated with the project is assumed to be about US$125
million (US$35 million for transmission and US$90 million for distribution). The cost of
distribution system expansion is assumed to be spread uniformly over 7 years.
(d)   Annual O&M costs as percentage of capital costs are assumed at 5% for GT, 3.5%  for
CC, 1.5% for transmission and 2.5% for distribution.
(e)   Based on the data provided by the Energy Institute, the plant is assumed to operate at an
annual plant capacity factor of 68%. The plant life is assumed to be 20 years.
(f)   The plant is assumed to use distillate for the first 6 months and natural gas thereafter.
(g)   The economnic cost of distillate is 20 USc/liter (24 USclliter with 20% tax). The econonic
price of natural gas is assumed to be the same as the expected buying price. The latter is
assumed to be in the range of US$2.5-3.5/1,000 cu. ft (Base price - US$2.5/1,000 cu.
ft.). The true economic price would be lower, but is not possible to estimate, as the basis
of gas pricing has not yet been finalized in Viet Nam.
Cn)   The net heat rates for the GTs are assumed to be 11 cu. ft./kWh for gas and 0.33
liter/kWh for distillate.
(i)   The output from the plant (derated for site conditiorLs from 150 to 130 MW) is decreased
by the level of technical losses forecast for the system (reducing from 17% in 1996 to 13
% in 2006 and remaining constant thereafter) in each year of operation; this represents the
incremental sales from the project.
(j)   The electricity tariffs are used as proxy for the evaluation of project benefits. The tariff is
assumned to increase progressively to 7 USc/kWh by 1999, in nominal terms, based on
Government's proposals.
6.5         The EIRR is estimated at about 17% (details are at Annex 18). The EIRR calculated
understates the benefits to the economy, as consumer surplus (benefit derived by consumers over and
above the price for electricity) is not included. Inclusion of consumer surplus would result in a higher
EIRR, largely independent of the tariff; a lower tariff would simply transfer the benefit from the power
comspany to the consumners.
6.6         The project faces the following significant risks: (a) delay in the availability of natural gas,
forcing the use of distillate for an extended period; and (b) higher than assumed price for natural gas.
Other lesser risks faced by the project are: (a) the plant operates at lower than assumed plant capacity



-51-
factor due to the nature of system demand; and (b) higher than estimated capital cost. Sensitivities are
computed for the aforementioned risks (as also for a lower gas price of US$2.0/1,000 cu. ft. and the
results are as under:
Case                                                %EIRR
Base                                                      16.9
Delay in availability of gas:    6 months                 15.3
18 months                    13.1
Higher gas price:            US$3.0/1,000 cu.ft.          13.9
US$3.35/1,000 cu.ft.         12.0
Lower price of gas:          US$2.0/1,000 cu. ft.         19.7
Capital cost of the GT/CC plant increased by 20%          14.6
Annual plant capacity factor reduced to 55%               12.4
6.7        Under all scenarios, the EIRR remains at or above the threshold level of 12%  (the
opportunity cost of capital in Viet Nam) except when the gas price exceeds $3.35/1,000 cu. ft. A
combination of adverse events is unlikely, but could render the project marginally un-viable. However,
it is to be noted that the analysis-is conservative in that it does not take into account consumer surplus
(para. 6.5) which would increase all EIRRs substantially.
Transfonner Additions
6.8        The HV transformer additions are essentially components of overall network expansion
and rehabilitation programs and it is not feasible to evaluate their EIRRs in isolation. The existing
distribution networks in Viet Nam are old, unreliable and overloaded, and incur high losses. With the
forecast rapid increase in demands, large investments are needed in rehabilitating the old network
components, in expanding the networks to new areas and in connecting new consumers. Part of the
reason that sales are expected to increase so rapidly is that there is substantial pent-up demand because
of shortages in generating capacity. Detailed feasibility studies for upgrading distribution networks in
important areas in the South and North have been conducted by consultants. These studies provide
useful data on: (a) demand growths; (b) investment requirements over the next several years for meeting
the demands while upgrading the networks to acceptable levels of safety and reliability; and (c)
estimates of progressive reductions in losses and improvements in reliability (expressed in terms of
unserved energy due to outages).
6.9          The following methodology is used for evaluating the EIRR for the transformer additions
as part of distribution expansion and rehabilitation.
6.10       The analysis assumes two scenarios: (a) "with project"; and (b) "without project"'. The
"with project" scenario is based on incurring the full investments (in the HV transformer substation
reinforcements under the project and the downstream subtransmission and distribution systems) for
meeting the forecast demands and a progressive reduction in losses and unserved energy. The "without



-52-
project" scenario assumes that the system would be able to meet the full forecast demand growth with
zero investments but with progressive increase in losses and unserved energy. The "without project"
scenario makes the conservative assumption that the existing system would be able to meet the demand
growth. Incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are conservatively assumed to be the
same for both the scenarios, although in the "without project" scenario these would be higher. The
following are the main assumptions:
(a)   All costs are expressed in constant 1995 prices, mnaking no adjustments for shadow
exchange rate or shadow labor costs.
(b)   The downstream investments in subtransmission and distribution are assumed to be six
times the cost of HV transformer additions according to norms currently applicable for
power networks in Viet Nam and corresponding well with figures assumed in recent
feasibility studies by consultants.
(c)   The capital investmnent is considered over the 1996-2000 time slice (part of which would
be funded by the proposed project).
(d)   The analysis is made over a project economic life of 25 years, with no increases in sales
or losses or improvements in reliability after 2000.
(e)   The average retail sales tariff is assumed to increase from the current level of about 5
USc/kWh to 7 USc/kWh in 1999 as proposed by the Government.
(f)   The LRMC of supply at the HV level is assumed at 4.6 USc/kWh based on the Bank's
Energy Sector Investment and Policy Review (Report No. 10842-VN).
(g)   Unserved energy is very conservatively valued at 10 times the tariff level.
(h)   With the project, the technical losses are assumed to reduce over the years (based on
recent feasibility studies). Without the project, the percentage losses are assumed to
increase in proportion to the demand. The technical losses are valued at the LRMC of
supply at the HV  level (non-technical losses are not considered in the economic
evaluation).
6.11       The details of the economic analysis are presented in Annex 18. To test the robustness of
the EIRR for the base case, a sensitivity is undertaken, with unserved energy not evaluated. The
resulting EIRRs are tabulated below:
EIRR %
Case                                    South Viet Nam          Rest of Viet Nam
Base                                          42.6%                  40.1%
Unserved energy not evaluated                 24.8%                  20.4%



-53-
6.12        The results indicate robust EIRRs for these project components and there is little need to
undertake sensitivities for adverse conditions, such as lower demands and higher capital costs. The
EIRRs are likely to be underestimates because of the conservative assumptions made about the unserved
energy (both in terms of its magnitude and its evaluation) and about the other factors mentioned above.
B. Risks
6.13        The Phu My component of the project faces two significant potential risks: First, delays in
commissioning of the power plant, which could result in curtailing demand in the south; Second, delays
in securing the gas supplies and the uncertainty about the gas price. The Government is conscious
about the need to take all measures possible to avoid implementation delays. The contract for the gas
turbines is in place and construction is progressing satisfactorily. Gas supply arrangements for the
earlier years are being finalized; the plant is not expected to burn distillate oil for more than six months
from start, and the EIRR is robust enough to tolerate burning of distillate for a year longer. With
regard to the long term gas supply arrangements, the Prime Minister has directed that gas should be
available at Phu My by the end of 1998 and negotiations between gas suppliers and EVN are well under
way. The project requires short-term gas arrangements to be finalized before credit effectiveness and
long-term arrangements by end-1996. It is expected that the price of gas could be satisfactorily
negotiated in the range of $2.5-3.5/1,000 cu. ft., within which the project is economically viable.
6.14        The only tangible risk associated with the transforner additions component is that of delay
in procurement which could result in overloading of transformers and/or shedding of load. The
Vietnamese are well aware of this situation, bids have already been invited, and appropriate
arrangements have been made for timely procurement decisions. The risk of demand not materializing
is small; in this case, the downstream investments in distribution could be delayed, besides the EIRR is
robust enough to tolerate lower demand growth rates.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF POWER SECTIORPOLICY
Hknoi, December)', 1995
This paper sets out the main elements of Govemment of Vietnam's
(GOV) power sector policy, It outlines the objectives and strategy of the
Govemment. and the Ministry of Industry for the development of the Power
Sector of Vietnam
A. Policy Objectives
1.1  The Govemment's power sector policy aims to achieve the following
objectives:
(a)   Provide electricity access to the national economy and the entfre
population of Vietnam
(b)  Increase the operatingltechnical efficiency of the electicity sector
to optimize the use of scarce investment resources.
(c)   Ensure the best quality of elctricity delivered
(d)   Resolve the mismatch between market - based production costs
and State administered prices
(e)   Clearly delineate state managernent functions and business
management functions
(f)   Enable Vietnam to raise financing in the order of USS 1 billion
(10.000 bil. VND) annually for power sector expansion to meet
economic growth targets.
B. The power Sector In Vietnam - An Overview
1.2  In January 1995, GOV issued Decree No 141CP to establish Electricity of
Vietnam (EVN) - a group corporation for the different power sector entitis
engaged In generation, transmission, distribution and associated service
functions. The business units are grouped under two accounting systems:
(i)independent accounting; and, (ii). dependent accounting. The business units
fall into three categories:
* Those engaged in generation and transmission are subject to dependent
accounting, and consolidation of accounts takes place only at the level of
EVN as a whole (general EVN). There are 17 business units involved in
these activities - 12 for generation, 4 for transmission and I for National
Load dispatch center.

Page 2 of 7
* Those responsible for distribution and supply are independent accounting
enterprise. There are five distribution units: Hanoi, HCMC, PC1, PC2 and
PC3.
*  Those involved in the provision of services (including finance, design and
construction, and  planning) have  either independent   or dependent
accounting status.

1.3    EVN  has the legal status of a state corporation  under the  State
Enterprise Law. Independent accounting entities will have the status of state
enterprises that are members of the state corporation (i.e EVN). Within the
EVN, the Board of Management (BoM) has the highest authority and exercises
the functions established under the new State Enterprise Law.
1.4    From  a sector structure  perspective, the core functions of generation
and transmission are integrated and under direct management of EVN
headquarters. The generation- transmission core sells electricity in bulk to the



Annex 2
-60-                                Page 3 of 7
five independent distribution companies (Figure 1). Retails prices to final
consumers are established by the Govemment and are currently uniform
across the country. The mechanism for setting the BTP allows the distribution
companies to make a target profit - the profit level is determined by EVN. Given
uniform retail pricing and differing distribution system costs for each distribution
company, the bulk transfer price is different for each distribution company.
1.5   According to State - Owned Enterprise Law the Ministry of Industry
(MOI), as and  line ministries,. is responsible  for policy and oversight
functions(as the owners of state enterprises),   while all operational
responsibility is vested with operating companies.
1.6  The current installed capacity  is insufficient to meet the increasing
energy demand in Vietnam. Vietnam's power development plan calls for the
addition of 3000 MW by the tum of the century and about 6,000 MW by the
year 2005. To meet this ambitious expansion program, apart from govemment
budget, ODA funds and funds from Multinational Financial Institutions, GOV will
increasingly utilize private finance. Decree No. 87/CP on BOT (i.e Build -
Operate - Transfer) contracts facilitates private investment in infrastructure
including power projects.
C. Reform Strategy
1.7  The Govemment reform strategy addresses the following key aspects of
power sector reform. A proposed Reform Implementation Plan is attached.
(a)   Rationalizing Power Sector Institutions and Functions.
1.8   The Govemment plans to rationalize the functions and responsibilities of
the various bodies relevant to the power sector and clarify their exact roles. The
Govemment proposes:
, Ministry of Industry    perform  the "ownership function" and state
management functions over EVN.
* Management Board of EVN fulfill the ownership functions related  to EVN
activities, and be responsible for development of the Power sector to meet
the targets set by GOV
* Vest all operating and management responsibilities (except regulatory
functions) with EVN's General Director and the management team of Deputy
General Directors.
(b)   Structural Reform and Commercializafion of Sector Enterprise
1.9   GOV  proposes to  rationalize the power sector structure and
commercialize  the  operations  of  its  power  sector  enterprises.
Commercialization would include: (i) strengthening the finances and long-term
creditworthiness of sector enterprises; and, (ii) introducing improved operational
and management practices. The Govemment proposes to:



-61-                                 Annex 2
Page 4 of 7
*  Reevaluate the operational efficiency of the four transmission companies.
Consider the possibility of consolidation of the operations of the four
transmission companies under a single transmission business unit.
*  Strengthen  the  internal  organizational  structure,  improve  the
accountinglfinancial systems and streamline administrative procedures in
the distribution companies and the EVN generation-transmission core.
*  Establish  the  independent distribution  companies  as entities with
management and financial autonomy; define appropriate incentives to
undertake efficient investment and operating decisions; and, establish
performance contracts between the EVN Board of Management and
distribution companies.
*  Consider the feasibility of establishing non - core members enteprises of
EVN (eg Power Investigation and Design Companies) as seperate business
units.
(c)   Electricity Law and Regulatory Framework
1.10 It is expected to develop a consistent body of laws and regulations that
would facilitate efficient and commercial operation of the sector, provide
security to domestic and foreign investors in the sector and allow the
Govemment to supervise sector operations on an objective basis. It is proposed
as follows:
- Define the scope and institutional arrangements for regulation
- Prepare a draft Electricity Law
Prepare a Grid code that would formalize operating   arrangements
between: EVN generation entities and the integrated transmission operation;
independent BOT/JV generators and the EVN purchasing entity; and, EVN
generation-transmission core and distribution entities. The Grid Code will be
progressively operationalized.
(d)   Electricity Pricing - Bulk Transfer Price and Retail Price
1.11  It is recognized that cost-based retail prices and intemal transfer prices
are essential to a commercial power sector that is expected to raise the
required capital for its needs. Retail prices based on these principles will
ensure that resources are allocated efficiently in the economy and that
consumers face the appropriate price signals to utilize electricity efficiently.
Efficient intemal prices will provide incentives -to the distribution companies to
operate efficiently and establish an objective basis to evaluate the cost of
purchasing power from BOT/JV power generation schemes. It is proposed to:



Annex 2
-62-                                  Page 5 of 7
* Progressively raise average retail tariff to levels prevailing in the region by
1999 - 2000. The tariff is proposed to be varied to about 7 USC/kWh by
1999.
* Determine and adopt an appropriate bulk transfer prices (BTP) between the
distribution companies and the EVN generation-transmission core.
(e)   Private Sector Participation In Vietnam's Power Sector.
1.12  The objectives for promoting private sector participation are to: (i).
mobilize additional financial recourses in the form of debt and equity financing
with minimum Government guarantees; (ii). supplement public sector
investments; (iii). access the private sector's proven skills in project design,
finance, implementation and operation; and (iv) create an enabling environment
that fosters competition. It is expected to achieve: (i) balanced portfolio mix:
private power projects will be consistent with Vietnam's least-cost power plan in
terms of size and technology, and with the system's operational needs; (ii)
competitiveness: project sponsors will be selected through a competitive
bidding process measured in terms of the lowest price of electricity delivered;
and, (iii) limited recourse project financing: foreign investors will secure
financing under limited recourse basis where project sponsors and lenders will
assume commercial and project risks.
(f)   Rural Electrification
1.13 Only 65% of the Vietnamese population has access to electricity. Access
to electricity is much lower in rural than in urban areas. In order to increase
rural access to electricity the Govemment will develop a Rural Electrification
Master Plan. This master plan will define: (i). criteria for expanding the
electricity network to rural areas; (ii) appropriate regulatory, institutional and
financing frameworks; (iii) methodologies for forecasting and economic
evaluation of alternative supply locations and options; (iv). technical standards
for design, construction and operation.
(g)   Electricity Conservation
1.14 To facilitate the efficient utilization of electricity and encourage electricity
conservation practices and technobgies, the Govemment will examine the
potential and scope for electricity demand-side management (DSM), and load
management in Vietnam.

VIET NAM
Power Development Project (SRPDP)
Development of Phu My 2 Phase 2 with Private Sector Participation
Terms of Reference for Consulting Services
Background
1.         The Government of Vietnam  (GOVN) has embarked on reforming its state-owned
enterprises and has selected its power sector as a pilot-cxperiment enterprise reform under the
Enterprise Group initiative11. GOVN is conmmitted to the implementation of comprehensive reforms in
its power sector and as a first step, under Decree 14/CP dated January 22, 1995, it has reorganized and
regrouped the different power sector enterprises by establishing Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) as a
holding company. The charter of EVN calls for the creation of three hierarchical organizations: Board
of Management, Control Section, and Finance Company. Currently, the roles and responsibilities of
EVN as owner, regulator, and financier are in apparent conflict with each other. Under a separate
technical assistance provided by the joint World Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance
Progranmme, GOVN is launching a study that will, inter alia, review options and make
recommendations for an appropriate legal and regulatory framework.
2.         GOVN's power sector reform measures will include setting up of a legal and regulatory
framework, commercialization and corporatization of EVN and the four independent distribution
companies, and fostering private investment in the power sector through Build-Own-Operate-Transfer
(BOOT) or Joint Venture (JV) type of arrangements. GOVN issued Decree No. 87-CP dated
November 23, 1993 on "Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Contracts" to encourage foreign investments in
the construction and development of Vietnam's infrastructure.
3.         Although the BOT decree has generated private sector interest in power generation
projects, there has been no progress beyond signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) to on-the-
ground projects.
4.         Under the Southern Region Power Developmernt Project (SRPDP), GOVN, in coordination
with the World Bank, proposes to take concrete steps towards the developmrent of Phu My 2 Phase 2
(PHMY2-2) under a BOT/JV type of arrangement. It expects that this would be the precursor to future
such developments in the power sector of Viet Nam.
Objectives of The Consulting Services
5.         The objectives of the consulting services are to: (a) review GOVN's overall private sector
policy and legal framework vis-a-vis development, ownership, and operation of private power projects;
(b) identify constraints and recommend the necessary legal and incentive framework that would help
achieve specific power generation projects in an optimum manner through BOOT/JV type of
arrangements; (c) develop the solicitation, selection criteria, security package, and evaluation of request
for proposals (RFP) for the selection of project sponsors for PHMY2-2; and (d) assist GOVN in
1/ In March 1994, GOVN issued a decree No. 91/Ttg, Pilot-Work to Establish Enterprise Groups. This decree outlines the
GOVN's initiative of refofning large sectorAl and regional state-owned enterprises.

evaluating proposals, in contract negotiations and in executing contracts with the selected project
sponsor.
Scope of Work
6.          The consulting services will involve three main tasks. The first two tasks will comprise
Phase I and the third task, Phase II of this consultancy. Because private power project development in
developing countries is driven by financial issues and concerns of the developers and investors, the first
task will entail: (a) a thorough diagnostic analysis of (i) the requirements of the project sponsors,
lenders, and equity investors; and (ii) the requirements for mobilizing financial resources for successful
private sector power project development; and (b) crystallization of project objectives and
implementation framework vis-a-vis legal, regulatory, financial, technical, and institutional roles and
responsibilities, and preparation of a Request for Qualifications for the PHMY2-2 BOT power project.
After the successful completion of the first task, the second task will involve preparation of detailed
documents (request for proposals, security package (power purchase agreements, fuel supply
agreements, etc.) incorporating findings of the first task, and proposal evaluation criteria and
methodology - for the PHMY2-2 development; design and preparation of a Brochure on Vietnam's
Private Power Program; and a framework for setting up a "one-stop-shop" within the Ministry of
Energy (MOE) as a clearinghouse for information on Vietnam's private power policy and a road map
for implementing private power projects. In the third task the consultants will assist the GOVN team in
evaluating proposals and contract negotiations.
7.          The three tasks would consist of the following main activities:
Task I      Enabling Environment Diagnostics
Schedule:         October 1995 - December 1995

to Vietnam's power sector;
(c)   review and discuss the scope of EVN to participate as a minority equity partner in a BOT-
JV arrangement for PHMY2-2 and at the same time a purchaser of electricity from the
PHMY2-2 BOT-JV project company; if the existing legal and contractual framework pose
hurdles to EVN's participation as a minority equity partner, discuss contractual and
legislative options that will facilitate EVN's participation;
(d);  review the expectations and conditions from the international investors' and banking
community's perspective; discuss the spectrum of risks in project development (pre- and
post commissioning) and recommend alternative schemes and security arrangements for
risk allocation and resolution;

for contract performance by the power purchaser;
(k)   evaluate and recommend different project ownership and financing structures for the Phu
My 2 - Phase 2 project and also identify the role of the World Bank Group in catalyzing
private sector power development; the range of options for project ownership and
financing structures considered should delineate the documentation requirements for each
option and conformity or lack thereof with the legal and contractual framework; also see
Task 11 (e).
(I)   evaluate (i) the applicability and implications of non-recourse and/or limited recourse
financing techniques to the Phu My 2-phase 2 project, (ii) the nature of risks associated
with projects of this type highlighting those areas of risk which will be of particular
concern to investors, lenders, and GOVN, (iii) requirements of lenders to such projects,
the formulation of alternative credit structures attainable which would limit recourse to
shareholders, (iv) sources of debt finance (international capital narkets, export credit
agencies, etc.) for such projects, (v) the sharing of risks between the various parties
involved in the project, and the costs and implications of non-recourse and/or limited

Annex 6
Page 6 of 7
(b)  the scope and extent of services needed during evaluation and negotiations will depend on
GOVN's private power framework that will evolve from Tasks I and II, the number of
proposals received, and complexity of proposals.
8.         Consultants with direct involvement in competitive bidding, project proposal preparation,
evaluation, contract negotiation (power purchase agreement, impelementation agreement, gas supply
contract), and financial closing of successful BOT/BOO type private power projects would be identified.
In mobilizing the team, the selection criteria for consultants would include the requirement that the
consultants' experience represent perspectives of the government, utility, lenders, local and international
investors regarding private power projects in developing countries.
9.         Two local consultants, a legal expert and a financial expert, well versed in Vietnam's
power sector, commercial and contract law, and local and Asia's capital investment market respectively,
will be hired to provide needed inputs in the development of the private sector power development
framework, and to assess the situation from the perspective of the domestic and non-resident
Vietnamese investors.

of PHMY2-2 simple cycle (gas turbine operation) by June 1998.
General Conditions
14.        Due to the complexity and evolving nature of the assignment, the Consultant shall be
prepared to act as a conduit for additional expertise that may be identified and required during the
implementation of this assignment. This additional expertise may be sourced from individual experts not
associated with the Consultant and would be made available through the Consultants contract.
Contracting of a consortium of technical, legal, and financial advisory firms will be considered.
15.        Experts assigned by the Consultant should have extensive international experience of direct
relevance and some knowledge of the Vietnam's power sector. Close coordination with a parallel
technical assistance for Vietnam's grid code, and power sector legal and regulatory framework by the
joint World Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance Progranmne is deemed critical to
overall success.

Master Plan Study for Rural Electrification
Bacdground
Current Status of Rural Electrification in Vietnam
Present status of rural Rower network development
1.         Electricity supply to rural areas in the North of Vietnam started from the late 1950's.
Network development was, however, totally halted in the war period (1964-1972), was resumed in 1980
and considerably accelerated from 1985 onwards. In the Southern Region, the electricity supply for
rural areas started and developed at a substantial rate only after 1975.
2.          As of 1993, electricity consumption in rural areas was 1,243 GWh (23.7% of commercial
electricity) of which agricultural use accounted for 485.3 GWh (39% of total rural electricity). Region-
wise consumption was:
(a)   Northern Region (to Ha Tinh province): 883 GWh (23.7%  of Northern Region
conmnercial electricity) in which agricultural production: 321 GWh (36.4%).
(b)   Central Region (from Quang Binh to Phy Khanh), Tay Nguyen (except Lam Dong): 112
GWh (17.5%  commercial electricity for Central Region) in which for agricultural
production: 99.3 GWh (40%).
(c)   Southern Region: 248 GWh (7.3%  of Southern Region commercial electricity) in which
agricultural production: 99.3 GWh (40%).
3.          The rural power networks have been developed fairly. According to the statistics of 1992
the whole country had 19,872 kan of medium-voltage 6-35 kV lines (76% of total), transformers with
capacity of 2,616 MUA (43% of total).
4.          The districts and conmmunes being supplied with electricity by power companies are as

Ma  Issues
7.          As of now, Viet Nam does not have a master plan for rural electrification that lays down
policies, strategies and criteria for meeting provincial rural area development priorities. There are a
number of technical, financial and institutional constraints, including: (a) inadequate transmission and
distribution networks, poor power supply reliability and poor loading characteristics in rural areas; (b)
scarcity of investment capital, subsidized pricing practices, inadequate private investment mechanisms
and underdeveloped domestic equipment enterprises; and (c) lack of locally based institutions to manage
and operate grid-connected and/or isolated rural electric networks.
Objectives of the Study
8.          The main objectives of the rural electrification master plan study  are to define: a)
appropriate regulatory, institutional and financing frameworks; b) methodologies for forecasting and
economic evaluation of alternative supply locations and options; and c) technical standards of design,
construction and operation. The study should provide a basis for detailed project preparation.

Power Development Project
Electricity Law and Regulatory Framework
(Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance)
Background
The Goverrnent of Viet Nam (GOVN) has in conjunction with macro-economic reform efforts,
initiated a broad program of power sector reforms. In January 1995, GOVN issued Decree No.14/CP
to establish Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) - a holding corporation for the different power sector
entities engaged in generation, transmission, distribution and associated service functions.  From a
sector structure perspective, the core functions of generation and transmission are integrated, and
distribution is separate.   There are five distribution companies and they are able to maintain
independent accounts, and have the status of state enterprises in accordance with the State Enterprise
Law. EVN is classified as a state corporation according to the State Enterprise Law and comprises of
member state enterprises. EVNs Board of Management (BoM) has been vested with responsibility to
exercise the States ownership function based on the principles established under the new State
Enterprise Law. It also oversees the operation and management of EVN.
Retail prices to final consumers are established by the Government and are currently uniform across the
country. Electricity is sold in bulk by the integrated generation-transmission core to the independent
distribution companies. The mechanism for setting the bulk transfer price allows the distribLtion
companies to make a target profit - the profit level is determined by EVN. Given uniform retail pricing
and differing distribution system costs for each distribution company, the bulk transfer price is different
for each distribution company.
The Ministry of Energy (MOE) has been significantly rationalized in parallel with the establishment of
EVN. Consistent with the Governmend policy for all line ministries, MOE is increasingly responsible
for policy and oversight functions, while all operational responsibility is being vested with operating
companies.
The current installed capacity of [4,200 MW] is insufficient to meet the annual energy demand in
Vietnam. VietnamA power development plan calls for the addition of 2,400 MW by the turn of the
century and about 6,000 MW by the year 2005. To meet this ambitious expansion program, GOVN
will increasingly utilize private finance which is essential to meet the power sector expansion targets.
Decree No.87/CP on BOT (i.e. Build-Operate-Transfer) contracts facilitates private investment in
infrastructure including power projects.
In a recently completed exercise the Ministry of Energy and EVN examined the implications of the
sector structure and defined a series of actions to continue the refonn process and ensure that reform
objectives can be achieved. This exercise which was conducted with the assistance of IDA/ESMAP
concluded that some form of transparent economic regulation was necessary for the power sector.
From a reform perspective the development of consistent body of laws and regulations was required to



-85-
Annex 8
Page 2 of 6
facilitate efficient and commercial operation of the sector, provide security to domestic and foreign
investors in the sector and allow the Government to supervise sector operations on an objective basis.
Further, as the entry of independent generators is envisaged an operational grid code would clarify the
technical and operational standards and responsibilities of independent entities in the sector. This
technical assistance project is designed to address this priority area of power sector reform.
Objectives
The technical assistance project will assist GOVN in developing a legal and regulatory framework for
the power sector, to accelerate and support on-going power sector reform efforts. The creation of a
suitable regulatory system and institutions is a pre-requisite for a commercially-oriented power system.
The mnain elements of this work are:
1.   definition of the appropriate regulatory functions to be undertaken by government supervisory
agencies;
2.   delineating the regulatory responsibilties of different government agencies and ministeries;
3.   devising a suitable institutional form for the conduct of these functions, as well as establishing
regulatory procedures and mechanisms;
4.   preparing the required draft electricity legislation and regulations; and
5.   Preparing a grid code that would formalize operating arrangements between: EVN generation
entities and the integrated transmission operation; independent BOT/JV generators and the EVN
purchasing entity; and, EVN generation-transmission core and distribution entities. The grid
code will be progressively operationalized.
Scope and Organization of Work
Given the complexity of regulatory reform and the need for a process that is open to review and inputs
by all stakeholders, the technical assistance activity will be divided into 5 phases.
Ph.e  1: Counterpat Arrangements and Background Report
GOVN will designate a suitable high-level steering conmnittee to oversee and direct the activity. This
Steering Conmnittee will include officials from the relevant government agencies and ministries that
have a stake in the process of power sector reform. These agencies will include, but not be limited to,
Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Justice, State Planning Conmmission, Ministry of Finance, etc..
The Steering Conmmittee will be responsible for setting up a working group and constituent task forces
to interact on a day-today basis with the international advisory team, and carry out the required analytic



-86-
Annex 8
Page 3 of 6
and conceptual work. It is envisaged that the working group will include representatives from power
companies, and the principal government agencies and entities involved in power sector decisions and
operations. It is advisable to involve key individuals who assisted with the earlier IDA/ESMAP
financed work on 'Options for Power Sector Restructuring' in the working group to provide the
required continuity with this activity.
The working group will complete a review of the implementation of sector reforms and prevailing
institutional arrangements. This review will form the basis of preliminary discussion of issues and
regulatory objectives within Viet Nam.
The formation of the Steering Committee, Working Group, and preparation of the background report
will be completed by Sept./Oct. 1995.
Phase 2: Definition of Fundamental Prnciples and Scope of Power Sector Regulation
This task will be completed during a two week period of intensive discussions between the working
group and international advisory team. The main elements of this second phase of work are the
following:
(a).  Review and discussion of the background report by intemational consultants
(b).  Presentation and discussion of international experiences in power sector regulation. The focus
will be on clarifying the concepts of economic regulation and discussing the advantages and
disadvantages of different regulatory techniques.
(c).  Definition of guiding principles and objectives of power sector regulation in Viet Nam.
(d).  Outline of the required or desired scope of power sector regulation in Viet Nam.
(e).  Preliminary scope and requirements for an Electricity Law
(f).  The requirements of a Grid Code for Viet Nam
In effect, the output of this phase will lay the foundations for more discussions on the details and
structure of power sector regulation. This task will be undertaken in Dec. 95/Jan. 96.
Phase 3: Preliminary Design of the Electricity Law & Regulatory Framework
The Working Group and the international consulting team will in this phase focus on four aspects of
regulatory framework design. Broadly defined, these are:
1.   Price Regulation
2.   Separation of Regulatory Function from EVN
3.   Regulation of Franchise Operations and Licensing
4.   Requirements of a Grid Code



-87-
Annex 8
Page 4 of 6
The four topics, which are outlined in greater detail below, are inter-related. The Vietnamese working
group could be divided into four task forces corresponding to the four topics. The issues that are
common to all four topics listed above, relate to: (i). the allocation of regulatory roles and
responsibilities; and (ii). the regulatory mechanism and organizational structure to perform these
regulatory functions. These issues will be discussed in by the individual task forces, as well as in
plenary session when required.
A detailed, although not comprehensive, scope of issues to be tackled by the four task forces is as
follows:
Task Force 1: Price Regulation
(a).  Retail and bulk prices that need to be regulated:
-    Retail consumer price
-    Bulk transfer price regulation
(b).  Evaluation of mechanisms to regulate prices; principles to establish pricing policies; information
needs for price setting/review; administrative processes for price revisions in the regulated
monopoly segment of the power sector.
(c).  Identification of institutional mechanism to regulate prices
Task Force 2: Separation of Regulatorv Function from EVN
(a).  Review and assessment of the role and responsibilities of EVNs Board of Management. The
impediments to effective and efficient enterprise management should be clearly identified.
(b).  Institutional arrangements to undertake all regulatory/government functions currently performed
by EVNs Board of Management and completing its separation from enterprise management and
ownership.
Task Force 3: Regulation of Franchise Operations and Licensine
(a).  Evaluation of current procedures and institutional responsibility for system planning, and the
obligation to serve
(b).  Identification and evaluation of options to draw a balance between the need for appropriate
oversight of planning and investment decision and the obligation to serve by a local supplier.
(c).  Reconciling the obligation to serve under a workable licensing and franchising framework
(d).  Identification of methods and mechanisms to separate central and local responsibilities



-88-
Annex 8
Page 5 of 6
Task Force 4: Requirements and Preparation of a Grid Code
(a).  Regulatory requirements to facilitate fair entry for new players in the generation sector
(b).  Creating an objective and arms-length mechanism for:
-     regulating bulk sales of power
-    access to transmission networks
(c).  Implementing and operationalizing a Grid Code
Phase 4:    Workshop -   Power Sector Regulation in Viet Nam
A key phase in this technical assistance will be a workshop on power sector regulation. The workshop
will targeted at a audience of senior policy makers, power enterprise officials and power sector experts.
At this workshop the working groups will present the task force interim reports (i.e. output of phase 3)
on power sector regulation in Viet Nam. The workshop will be important in developing broad
consensus amongst policy makers in Viet Nam on the pace and scope of regulatory reform in the power
sector.
The workshop will be held in Hanoi around July 1996. At present a three-day event is envisaged - 1-
day for opening session, an overview of the work, and a presentation of international experience in
power sector regulation; 2-days for presentation and discussion of task force interim reports by the
Vietnamese working group.
Phase 5: Recommended Regulatory Framework and Institutional Structure, Draft Electridty Law
Based on the inputs and discussions at the workshop, the working group and the international consultant
team will begin to develop the elements of a workable regulatory framework. This task will include:
(a).  Draft power sector regulation that clearly addresses all the major aspects of regulation discussed
by the four task forces. It is of crucial importance that the draft regulation clearly delineate the
roles and responsibilities of the different government agencies.
(b).  Design of an institutional structure that will be able to enforce the draft regulations. The
structure must clearly identify new/revised roles of existing institutions, clarify their functions
and propose an organizational structure and staffing for any new institution.
(c).  Preparation of a draft Electricity Law
Time Schedule
This activity should be completed within 12-16 months of initiation. If work is initiated around
August/September 1995, a preliminary draft/design of the legal and regulatory framework (Phase 3)
__       W_

may be prepared by June 1996. The Workshop will follow soon after, perhaps around July 1996. It
should then be possible to prepare and submit the draft Electricity Law and regulations to the legal
committee of the National Assembly for prelininary review by end-1996.

Power Development Project
Environmental Assessment Summary
Phu My 1 and 2 Power Plants
Project Description
1.1        The project is for the development of 800MW of combined cycle plant at Phu My in the
South of Vietnam. The plant will burn natural gas which will be available in mid 1997. At this stage
the only stack emissions of significance would be NOx (oxides of nitrogen) which will be maintained
below a level of 50 ppm by use of low NOx burners. The first two gas turbines will, however, be
commissioned in December 1996 and will burn distillate fuel oil for about 6 months until natural gas is
available. During this phase emission of NOx will be rather high at about 300 ppm as it is not
justifiable to install NOx reduction measures for such a short period.
1.2        A conventional thermal plant called Phu My 1 as also planned for the site and will consist
of 3 x 200MW units. Phu My I will also burn natural gas. Residual fuel oil will be used for
emergency standby. For completeness of information this EIA considers total emissions from the site,
i.e. Phu My 1 and 2.
1.3        Cooling water for the plants will be taken from the Sao stream at the rate of 60n3/s and
will be discharged to the Thivai estuary. Chlorination of the system in order to reduce fouling will be
carried out so that the residual chlorine level at the discharge is <0.02 ppm.
1.4       Waste water streams will include water treatment plant waste, sewage, surface drains,
boiler washings and other minor sources typical of a power station. They will be treated as appropriate
so that the effluents will satisfy IBRD and Vietnamese regulations.
1.5        The plant will require fresh water for boiler make-up and domestic use at a maximum rate
of about 2000 m3/day. This will be supplied by wells on site. Gas will be delivered by pipeline and
distillate and heavy fuel oil by tanker. A 4km power line will be constructed to join the existing
transmission system.
Baseline Data
1.6        The Phu My site is located in a rural area about 70kn south east of Ho Chi Minh City.
The population of the small townlet is about 8000 and the main economic activities are farming and
fishing. The average income is low even compared to nearby districts and infrastructure and services
such as electrical supply, roads, health services and education are also poor.
1.7        Given the rural nature of the site air quality is expected to be good.  Limited
measurements on the site show that this is so with levels of NO2 of 0 - 0.06 mg/mn3 and levels of SO2 of
0.010 - 0.02 mg/m3.

1.8        Noise measurements carried out at 3 locations show levels of about 40 dBA at night and
higher levels at day time, probably due to nearby construction activities for a harbour development.
For power station design night time levels are the most significant as the permitted noise levels are
lowest during night.
1.9        The most significant ecological system is that of the mangrove forest and associated fish,
shell fish and other animal species. This appears under threat in this region as it does in many parts of
South East Asia due to:-
*     Excessive siltation and organic pollution
*     Harvesting for firewood and charcoal manufacture
*     Operation of shrimp and fish aquaculture enterprises which may involve clearing
mangrove areas as well as, depending on the stocking level, water pollution from biocides
and other wastes.
1.10       There is evidence of all the above activities near Phu My; however successful replanting
of mangroves has also taken place in areas where they were cut down. Development of shrimp
aquaculture probably represents the single greatest threat.
1.11        A survey of mangrove trees in the site and nearby study area indicated the presence of 32
species.  The distribution depends on submersion and salinity levels as well as impacts of artificial
replanting. The survey also found the following numbers of animal species which are largely associated
with the mangrove areas;
*     30 species of birds
*     17 species of mammals
*     8  species of amphibians
*     16 species of reptiles
1.12       The site itself, which is 150ha in extent contain, about 20 ha of mangrove area. The rest
is mostly cultivated for rice, cashew nut trees, eucalyptus and other crops. Apart from the mangroves
there are no significant habitats or wild life areas on the site or in the surrounding area.  A study
carried out showed the presence of 201 species of plant in the study area of which 101 occurred in the
actual site area.
1.13       The Thivai river estuary, which runs by the site, will be utilised to disperse the heat in the
cooling water discharged from the plant. It is wide (400m) and deep (15 - 30m) with a tidal variation
of about 3m and a large tidal flow (1O,00Om3/s). Analyses of the water quality of the Thivai estuary
indicated the following main features:-
*    High salinity levels, particularly in the dry season.
*     Some evidence of oil pollution.
*     Organic pollution from domestic sources.
*     Moderate levels of dissolved oxygen.

1.14       Surveys of the aquatic ecosystem of the Thivai river indicate that it is typical of the nearby
large area of delta. It is rich in numbers of species but with some evidence of an impact from organic
pollution. The baseline surveys identified the following numbers of species:-
*    72 species of phytoplankton and 31 species of zooplancton.
*    60 species of fish and 22 species of shellfish.
*    42 species of zoobenthos (near site).
1.15       Fish eggs and larvae are considered particularly sensitive to enviromnental disturbance. A
survey of eggs and larvae in the Thivai estuary showed numbers and species composition typical of the
delta area. The larvae were found to migrate from surface layer to the bottom depending on the time of
day.
Environmental Impacts
1.16       The proposed project, consisting of combined cycle plant burning natural gas, is the most
environmentally benign forn of thermal power plant. It has a very high efficiency, close to 50%, and
lower air emissions and cooling water requirements per unit of electricity generated than for
conventional plant. In particular, when burning natural gas with a low NOx burner as is planned for
this project, there are no significant emissions of NOx or SO2 and emissions of carbon dioxide are 50%
lower than for conventional plant burning fuel oil or coal.
1.17       A major and positive impact will be the provision of 800MW generating capacity. This
will impact on a regional basis by strengthening the electricity supply network and allowing the
connection of extra consumers and the development of industry and services in the region. The
employment of large number of people during the construction and operation phase will also benefit the
local economy.
1.18       While some disturbance will be caused to the townlet of Phu My the overall impact should
be positive by the provision of jobs and improvement of infrastructure.
1.19       During the construction phase there will be a permanent loss of 2 ha of mangrove forest
due to the construction of a jetty and a loss of about 0.5 ha of mangrove at the cooling water intake.
There will be a temporary loss of 1 ha due to construction of the cooling water outlet pipes. As these
will be buried the areas can be replanted.
1.20       Dredging of the Thivai river in order to allow berthing of tankers of 10,000 dw tonnage as
well as all the cooling water system construction will cause a local and temporary loss of benthnic
animals as well as disturbance of fish and other organisms.
1.21       Impacts of other construction activities such as noise, dust, sewage, after taking into
account mitigation measures, will be minor.
1.22       The Phu My 1 and 2 Power Stations will bum natural gas and the only stack emission of
interest will be NOx. A dispersion analysis was carried out for the case of plants on full load and
showed that the maximum hourly ground level concentration of NO2 when burning natural gas would be
0.11 mg/m3 while the maximum annual average will be 0.002 mg/m3. These relatively low values will



-96-
Annex 10
Page 4 of 11
be well below IBRD and Vietnamese air quality regulations and will be of minor significance to air
quality in the area.
1.23       For about six months the first two gas turbines to be commissioned will burn distillate
until natural gas reaches the site. The rate of emission of NOx will be quite high at 300 ppm as
methods of reducing NOx levels such as water injection are not considered feasible for this short
period. However as they will be on open cycle for this period the high exit temperature will provide
good dispersion characteristics. A dispersion analysis for this case showed that maximum hourly
ground level concentrations of NO2 would be 0.100 mg/m3. This level will not break ambient air
quality standards nor will it have a significant impact over the short period involved.
1.24       Specification for the proposed plant will be such that noise levels at the site perimeter will
not exceed permnitted levels for residential areas. This will ensure that no noise nuisance is caused at
nearest residences.
1.25       Cooling water discharge will be at a maximum rate of 60m3/s and a temperature rise of
70C. The discharge will be deep into the Thivai estuary which has a large tidal flow of 10,000 m3/sec.
A thermal diffusion study indicates that the physical impact will be minor with, for the worst case, a
thermal plume of 1C extending across the estuary. Beyond the immediate outfall the maximum
temperature rise will be 1.5C.
1.26       Ecological impacts of the thermal plume are not predicted to be significant. However,
because it is a deep discharge some scouring will take place at the outfall. No significant impacts will
be caused to aquaculture or commercial fishery on the Thivai River.
1.27       Chlorination of the cooling water will take place at a rate that will leave a residual level of
<0.02 ppm at the outfall. At this concentration the chlorine should not have any significant impacts
beyond the discharge point.
1.28       A large number of organisms including fish eggs and larvae will be entrained by the
cooling water system and significant mortality will occur due to pressure, temperature rise and
chlorination. This is not predicted to have an overall impact on fish numbers in the area due to the
large amount of similar habitat in the region and due to the small ratio of CW flow to overall tidal
flow.
1.29       Other waste water streams from the plant include water treatment plant effluent, sewage,
surface drains, boiler washes and acid cleans. These will all be treated as appropriate so that the
effluents will satisfy Vietnamese regulations and will have no environmental impacts on the receiving
water.
1.30       Oil spillage into the sensitive mangrove ecosystem represents a serious menace. In order
to minimise this risk strict procedures will be implemented for the delivery, unloading, storage and
handling of oil as well as an emergency response plan and clean up procedures.
1.31       Dredging will be required occasionally in order to maintain navigable depth at the jetty.
This will create a local and temporary disturbance to biota in the area. The dredged material will be
transported for land reclamation to an area not yet designated.

Summary of Altematives
1.32       Alternatives to the proposed project should be seen in the context of a high predicted
growth in electricity demand in the South Vietnam area over the next twenty years. This growth is
required for economic development and improvement in standard of living. A mixture of thermal and
hydroelectric power, which are complimentary to each other, is required to satisfy this demand.
Alternative designs and sites were considered.
1.33       A natural gas fired combined cycle plant, such as the present design, has the following
major advantage over other types of thermal plant which might be considered
*    Lower capital cost
*    Shorter lead times to power production
*    Small land area requirements
*    Higher efficiencies
*    Lower air emissions per unit of electricity generated
*    Lower cooling water requirements per unit of electricity generated.
1.34       A number of alternative sites were considered and evaluated on the following criteria:-
-    Proximity to Bach-Ho - Thu Duc gas pipeline
-    Distance to transmission lines
*    Cooling water availability
-    Environmental and socioeconomic issues
-    Site area available
-    Construction and engineering issues.
The site at Phu My was judged as the optimum available.

Summary of Mitigation Measures
1.35            In order to reduce enviromnental impacts from  the proposed development mitigation
measures, sunmmarised below, have already been put in hand or are planned. Apart from these, and
taking into account the minor residual impacts of the proposed development, no further mitigation
measures are considered necessary.
1.36            Mitigation measures to apply during the construction phase include the following:-
*       Provision  of housing, clean  water, sanitation  facilities, health  services  to  the
construction workers.
*       Sewage treatment.
*       Dust suppression control
*       Noise control
1.37            During the operation phase air emissions will be controlled by burning natural gas and
installing low NOx burners.



-102-
Annex 10
Page 10 of I1
1.38         Noise control will be by housing and acoustic cladding of noisy plant to ensure noise
levels at the site perimeter are within regulations.  Other noise reduction measures such as tree
plantations may be used as appropriate.
1.39         Impacts of the cooling water system will be mitigated by:-
*     Design of outfall to reduce extent of thermal plumes.
*     Maintaining residual chlorine levels at less than 0.02 ppm.
*     Measures to reduce impingement of fish at the intake.
1.40         All other waste water streams will be treated so that effluents will satisfy Vietnamese
regulations and will not cause any significant impacts.
1.41         In order to avoid risks of ground water pollution or soil contanination all waste
materials that will arise at the site will be monitored as to type and quantity and removed offsite for
disposal or recycling.
Environmental Management and Training
1.42         It is recommended that an environmental unit be set up as part of the management
structure in the new development at Phu My. The main function of this unit would be the monitoring
and control of waste water streams and other emissions from the plant. This function could be
combined with the already planned water quality analysis programme at little additional expense.
1.43         It is also recommended that as EVN  expands its generation programme, an
environmental co-ordinator be established with the function of developing environmental policy, issuing
in-house guidelines and establishing compliance with standards and regulations and setting up an
environmental management system.
1.44         It is further recommended that this co-ordinator would also liaise with other groups such
as a coastal zone management group in order to promote strategies for the protection and sustainable
development of the delicate coastal zone.
Environmental Monitoring
1.45  In order to fully control the implementation of the proposed project, it is recommended that the
following monitoring programme be put in place:-
*     Monitoring programme of the waste water streams from the new project.
*      Extension of the existing air monitoring programme.
*      Noise monitoring at the site perimeter.
*      Monitoring of waste materials arising on site.
*     A review of the baseline ecological study of the Thivai river estuary particularly in the
area near the power plant site.
1.46         During the construction phase monitoring for dust levels, noise levels, sewage effluent
should be carried out to ensure no nuisance is created.



-103-
Annex 10
Page 11 of 11
1.47         Recommendations are made for training programs for management and staff at the
proposed plant. Particular attention should be given to staff involved in environmental work, to those
handling oil and chemicals and those involved in emergency and safety procedures.

SECTION 1
INTRODUCTION
A - The Project
1.        Under the Power Development Project, the Electricity of Viet Nain (EVN) will be
constructing the Phu My 2 (PM2) Power Station (the Project), comprising two 300-450 MW combined
cycle power blocks. This power station will require acquisition of 180,000 ml of land in 1995. This
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) covers this power station and has been prepared by the Management
Board of Phu My - Ba Ria power plants of EVN (PMBRMB) with the consulting support of the Power
Investigation & Design Company N2 and was approved by EVN and the relevant local government
bodies at the end of August 1995. The power station is located on land where further power generation
development is planned. Resettlement, compensation, and rehabilitation of persons affected by further
power station development will follow the principles laid down in this RAP. This RAP applies for
PM2.
2.         At the Phu My Site it is proposed to construct power plants PM1, PM3 and PM4 in the
future. The Land for PM1, PM2 and PM4 and cooling water intake and discharge canals for these
plants were acquired together and the compensation payment will be finished by the end of October,
1995. The principles for the total land acquisition process followed the same guidelines, and are
described in this RAP. However, the numbers of affected persons and households, the approximate area
acquired, etc. are only those for PM2.
(See attached Map 3)
B - Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
Project Impact Area
3.         Phu My 2 power plant will be constructed in Phu My Townlet, Tan Thanh District, Ba
Ria-Vung Tau province. Phu My Townlet was set up since August 15, 1994 from the former Phu My
village. Phu My Townlet is located in an area running from km 44 to km 47 along the National Road
No 51 and on the left bank of the Thi Vai river. The distance from the Townlet to Ho Chi Minh City is
about 80 km., 20km to the provincial center of Ba Ria and 40hn to the coastal city of Vung Tau.
4.         Phu My Towniet covers 3,000 ha. Its population is 8,126 people living in 1,481 famnilies.
There are 3,707 people of working age. The percentage of women is 50%, children under 15 years old
is 30%. The percentage of economic dependants is 54.25%. Agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery,
salt production and forestry are main professions of local people. The other subsidiary professions are
service and handicrafts.
5.         More than 65% of the inhabitants live on agricultural activities concentrated mainly on
tree crops (fruit and cashew nuts) and partially on rice cultivation. Since soil in the Phu My site is
sandy and salty, the agricultural production is very low. Average annual income per capita of local
farmers is low, at about VND 891,320 (1994 statistics).

Project Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impact
6.         The Phu My 2 Power Plant covers a total area of 180,000 m2. The total area for this RAP
analysis is taken all plots affected particularly/or fully by PM2 plant. On this area will be constructed
the power generating plant itself and ancillary buildings like administration, water treatment plant,
workshop, warehouse and fuel supply system. The cooling water system and oil unloading jetty will be
commnon with Phu My 1 power plant. The plant will be permanently connected to the network through
220kV busbar of Phu My 1 220kV switchyard.
7.         Since PM1 will be built after PM2, the PM2 project will temporarily connect to the Ba
Ria - Long Binh transmission line by overhead 220kV line. Right - of - way for this temporary
transmission line is 4.4km long and 21.6m wide, and it is included in the PM2 project.
8.         The transmission line, and its routing, has not been decided and approved by the
Government, therefore the land requirement for this has not yet been determined. This RAP is based on
the assumption that the transmission line is chosen as indicated on the attached Map 2.
9.         Similarly, the underground gas fuel pipeline from the Ba Ria gas supply station to the
power plant has not yet been finally located and designed, and land requirements for this has not yet
been determined, this will be contracted out for gas fuel delivery at the fence. For both the transmission
line and the fuel intake, the principles of this RAP will be followed.
10.        The project produces two major impacts. The first is land acquisition and the resettlement
of the area of the power station site and the second is the clearance and relocation of houses under the
transmission line and the fuel intake line.
Il.        Based on the survey, the power station area consists of 130 pieces of land belonging to 49
households of the Quang Phu hamlet of Phu My Townlet and 3 households of Vung Tau city. All the
49 households live in the same hamlet. There are no houses on the project area. In land - use structure,
cashew plantation covers an area of 13.78 ha (66.7%). Paddy - crop covers an area of 2.5 ha (12%),
other trees cover an area of 4.39 ha (21.3%). The number of PAPs affected by the power station area
is 305 of which 84% gain their main income from agriculture, 10% from service and small trade, and
6% from handicraft and other occupation. Most of the land under cultivation in the power station site
was newly - reclaimed from vacant land after 1975. Land - use certificates has not been issued to any
land - users. However, all plots have been surveyed and registered in the cadastral and tax payment
book of Town People's Committee. Therefore, there are no disputes over the land - use rights.
12.        The second major affected area of the temporary transmission line is the place where the
transmission line crosses the National Highway N51. There are 9 households whose houses and their
properties are identified under the 21.6m right - of - way of transmission line. All these 9 households
(100 %) gain their living from agriculture. There are 4 households with brick - made houses, the rest
are households with thatched and timber structures.
13.        The power generating plant area has already been acquired and the first step of
compensation payment has been done, the second (last) will be done by the end of October, 1995. The
transmission line and fuel intake line ROW has not been acquired yet.

14.        The Socio-Economic study, undertaken as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment
shows that while the affected people welcome the project and the economic development and
employment opportunities that this will create, the affected people expressed their concerns regarding
the level of compensation. For the success of the project such concerns should be covered by adequate
rates of compensation and suitable rehabilitation measures. This RAP was prepared after extensive
consultations with the project affected people, and the rates of compensation were only determined after
careful examination of the cost of replacement of similar land.
15.        This RAP defines the PAP, the resettlement principles and objectives, legal and
institutional framework, modes of compensation and rehabilitation, people's participation features and
grievances procedures that will guide the resettlement and rehabilitation of the PAPs. The RAP is based
on the results of the census and socio-economic survey of the PAPs and properties to be affected and
includes compensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements of various categories of PAPs;
a timetable for implementation of the RAP; allocation of the institutional responsibilities for
implementation; a budget for funding the various compensation and rehabilitation measures, internal and
extemal monitoring arrangements. These components are detailed in the following parts and in the
Annex.
16.        The principle objective of this RAP is to ensure that all PAPs will be compensated and
rehabilitated to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their living conditions and income earning
capacity at the pre-Project levels. The PAPs will be resettled as close as possible to the vicinity of their
original residential areas.
C -Project Affected People (PAP)
17.  The PAPs include the following persons:
(a)   persons whose residence is in part or in total affected by the Project;
(b)   persons whose premises and/or agricultural land is in part or in total affected (permanently
or temporarily) by the Project; and
(c)   persons whose businesses are affected in part or in total (temporarily or permanently) by
the Project.
D - Resettlement Principles and Objectives
18.        The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been
adopted in preparing the RAP. In this regard the following principles and objectives have been applied:
(a)   Minimize adverse impact on the local population of acquisition by the project location and
project design.
(b)   All PAPs residing or cultivating land in the Project area as of the date of the socio-
economic survey are entitled to compensation and rehabilitation, and resettlement if
required.



-109-
Annex 1 l
Page 6 of 16
(c)   PAPs will be compensated, resettled and rehabilitated so as to improve their standard of
living or at least maintain their current standard at pre-project levels.
(d)   The means of resettlement and rehabilitation are: Compensation at replacement cost for
houses and other structures, agricultural land for land of equal productive capacity
acceptable to the PAP. PAPs losing productive land will be given a choice among the
following alternatives: (i) land for land of equal productive capacity; or (ii) cash for land
and a choice to opt for land - based or non - land - based rehabilitation. For PAPs losing
house and premise land only, replacement of premise land of equal size acceptable to the
PAP, transfer allowance, and compensation for structures, trees, tombs, wells and other
fixed assets at replacement value.
(e)   Replacement premises and agricultural land must be acceptable to the PAP and will be as
close as possible to the land that was lost.
(f)   The resettlement transition period will be minimised and land for land and/or cash
compensation will be provided to the PAPs no later than one month prior to the eviction
of the PAPs.
(g)  Comnpensation, resettlement and rehabilitation will be carried out in close consultation with
the PAPs.
(h)   Financial and physical resources for resettlement and rehabilitation will be made available
as and when required.
(i)  Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design, planning and
implementation of the RAP.
(k)   Supervision and internal, as well as external monitoring will be an integral part of the
project design to ensure effective and timely implementation of the RAP.
SECTION 2
INSIMJTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK
A -Institutional Framework
19.        The responsibilities for implementing the RAP are as follows:
(a)   EVN (or PMBRMB on its behalf) assumes the overall responsibility for planning and
imnplementing the RAP. For this purpose, PIDC2 provides technical consultancy support
for RAP planning. PMBRMB is responsible for co-ordinating with the Provincial People's
Committee (PPC) of Ba Ria Vung Tau, District People's Committee of Tan Thanh (DPC)
and Town People's Committee of Phu My (TPC). The Phu My TPC have held meetings



-110-
Annex 11
Page 7 of 16
to discuss the various aspects of the RAP with the PAPs in the presence of PMBRMB
representatives.
(b)   Funds for the resettlement program will be provided by EVN based on decisions reached
through negotiations between local governments (provincial, district, and town people's
committees) and the PAPs.
(c)   EVN will implement the RAP in co-ordination with the Provincial, District, Town
People's Comnnittees and the participation of PAPs.
B - Legal Framework
20.        The overall objective of the RAP is guided by Article 27 of the Land Law of 1993 as
further amplified by Government Decree No 90-CP of 17th August 1994. Article 27 provides that: "In
case of utmost necessity, then the State recovers land being used by a land user, for national defence,
security, national benefit, or public benefit purposes, the land user shall be given compensation for the
damnages".
21.        Compensation for land and fixed assets (e.g. houses) is defined by the Government
Decrees No. 87-CP and 89-CP of the 17th of August 1994, which provide for land compensation and
cash for land, when land is not available, at rates established by Government. These rates have been
established for purposes of leasing government land, acquisition of land by government for national
purposes, and for tax computing on issuing land use rights certificates. Also, compensation for land
and fixed assets is defined by Decision 423/QD-UBT of March 30th 1993, Decision 31/QD-TJBT and
Decision 970/QD-UBT of the Ba Ria - Vung Tau People's Committee.
SECTION 3
ENTITLEMENT POLICY
22.        In respect to resettlement principles and objectives and based on PAP's census survey
(Table 1) PAP will be entitled to the following types of compensation and Resettlement and
Rehabilitation (R & R) program, according to their entitlement categories.
(a)   PAPs losing agricultural land will have the choice between the following forms of
compensation:
(i)   either to be provided with land of equal productive capacity by the Peoples'
Committee of the District, satisfactory to the PAP. (the land-for-land option)
(ii)  or to be compensated in cash for the lost land at a rate that can provide for similar
type of land in the commune as mutually agreed between PAP and PC of Ba Ria
Vung Tau. (the cash-for-land option)



-lll-
Annex I 1
Page 8 of 16
23.          The PAP census showed that all PAPs expressed a clear preference in favour of cash-for-
land compensation. This supports their preference to select alternative land themselves rather than be
allocated alternative land by the Peoples' Committee. The location of the alternative land will be in the
vicinity of the commune. When the PAP have identified land, and agreed with the present land user that
the land should be registered in his/her name, the Townlet will arrange for this land to change land
user, without fees. The Townlet will monitor that the PAPs wanting land have been able to get land.
The cash rate of compensation has been calculated to meet the replacement value by taking the state -
authorized land - use value of 70 VND/m2 and adding the a production assistance of 5,930VND/m2 for
new land development in the transitional period. This comes to a total of 6,OOOVND (  0.55 $US) per
m2 of land. According to a survey of current rates for land - use transfer, and the PAPs, this is
adequate to secure new land in the vicinity.
(iii)  Compensation in cash at market price is to be provided for the loss of standing
crops and other trees, plus the assistance in cash equivalent to the lost production in
the transitional period to restore the original income depending on the maturity and
quality of the existing plants and trees. The average compensation cost per tree, as
well as the production assistance for the trees to restore the present production are
shown in Table A. The production assistance is calculated as a product of the
number of years to bear fruit and the average annual income from the trees.

The above rates have been negotiated with the PAPs and are acceptable to them.
(b)   PAP losing agricultural land will be provided economic rehabilitation of their own
choosing through various activities in support of their requests.
(i)    For those PAP opting for land based rehabilitation, whenever required, the local
committee will assist them in securing the alternative land with necessary
procedures like official witnessing and registration. The local committee will
monitor progress to ensure that PAPs have acquired land of their choice. If PAPs
opt for land in the conunune or nearby area then adequate land will be available.
The land in these areas are of better quality than the land currently used by the
PAP. Hence, it is expected that the compensation areas will permit more intensive



-112-
Annex 1I
Page 9 of 16
use of the alternative land and therefore yield higher incomes to the PAPs
concerned The requisite nursary trees are available in the market at very low
prices.
(ii)  Those PAPs opting for non - land based rehabilitation will be provided
opportunities of employment, training and starting new occupations, as well as the
assistance needed in order to maintain their living standard. PMBRMB will present
PAPs seeking employment to the contractors engaged in construction of PM2, and
co-operate with local authorities in fmding employment opportunities for PAPs.
EVN has recently started a two year residential course for operation of power plant
staff, where suitable PAPs have been accepted. PAPs opting to start their own
business (food etc.) will be assisted by EVN and local PCs with registration, tax
exemptions in the beginning years. EVN will also be responsible for providing fees
for training to the PAP in relevant occupations at local vocational training centers,
planned to start early 1996. The training would cover technical training (like
tailoring, electrical repair, carpentry) and business training (like running of small
enterprises, marketing and finance).
(c)   PAPs whose house is affected by the project transmission or fuel lines and forced to
relocate will be entitled as follows:
(i)   A equivalent residential site, acceptable to the PAP and cash compensation at full
replacement cost for the affected structures and fixed assets without depreciation.
The PAP will be allowed to take material from the site before it has to be vacated.
(ii)   A transfer allowance of about 1 million VND or more for the relocation of the
affected house to new resettlement site.
(iii)  Land not directly acquired for construction (of transmission poles, etc) but is in the
right of way can be used by the current user for cultivation, grazing and other
activities, and will normally not be compensated. However, as height restrictions of
4 meters will have to be observed by the user in all future, trees above that height
will be removed and compensated as above. Because of the restrictions in land use,
the PAP will receive a one-time lumpsum 'restriction-fee' of at least 70 VND/m'.
(iii) Any damage caused to PAP's properties and crops during project construction
period will be compensated at market price by Contractor.
SECTION 4
PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT
24.        There are various stages in the RAP planning and implementation activities that require the
PAP participation. This was encouraged by favourable conditions created by PMBRMB and the
respective conmnittees.



-113-
Annex 11
Page 10 of 16
25.        The PAPs were adequately informed by the relevant local peoples committees of the
details of the RAP and meetings were held as follows:
Dec. 14, 1994    PAPs informed by local Peoples Committee (PC) on project impacts
June 25, 1995   PAPs representatives (7 households) met with Tan Thanh PC.
August, 1995    On site verification of losses. The procedure of verifying the number of
trees, their age, etc, and determining the value was done with the
participation of the concerned PAP, representatives of the local Peoples'
Committees (District and Towniet), and an independent consultant.
Sep. 9, 1995    PAPs met with PC of Phu My Townlet, Rehabilitation Committee of Baria-
Vung Tau Province, Tan Thanh District and PMBRMB representatives.
26.        PAPs were specifically informed about the choice available to them and their subsequent
choice was recorded.
27.        The PAP's participation included their attendance in the meetings jointly held by
PMBRMB and the respective people's committee in order to learn of the project impacts, obtain their
co-operation in providing adequate information on affected matters, and to give their suggestions for
RAP planning.
28.        The crucial PAP's participation is their agreement upon the finalisation of RAP. This
includes their consensus in joining the consultancy process to mutually arrange compensation choices
and rates, and the commitment to the implemnentation arrangenent with the respective people's
committee and PMBRMB in the spirit of current law and the R & R policies.
29.        The final participation that is also important, is the PAP's co-operation with respective
people's committee and PMBRMB in implementing RAP and resolving any issue that may arise in the
process.
SECTION 5

Remark: The above percentage of land loss is only taken in comparison to the total agricultural
land area in Phu My commune fields belonging to h. holds.
31.       Incomes of PAPs are expected to improve due to new ability to intensify agricultural
production ( in the case of those opting for land-based rehabilitation) or due to the potential offered by
small scale enterprise. Typical incomes from small scale trading is 7.2 million VNDJyear and for food
services, 12 million VND/year. Construction firm labour income is about 9.8 million VND/year.

SECTION 6
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENT
A - Resettlement and Construction Schedule
32.        The PAPs have been informed by project authorities and/or LPCs about the detailed
description of project impacts and the properties to be acquired . Payment of compensation for crops,
trees and other properties, allotment of land for construction of relocated houses, and replacement land
of equal productive capacity, will be completed before the affected people will be evicted from the land
and construction can start on the affected area.
B - Implementation Arrangements
33.        Implementation of the Resettlement and Compensation (RIC) program will be a joint effort
of EVN and it's subsidiary (PMBRMB), the Provincial Peoples Committees (PPC), District peoples'
Committees (DPC) and the commune authorities. The overall responsibility for implementing the RAP
will be that of EVN. EVN will exercise its functions through MB of PMBRMB. Though most of the
activities will be carried out in close co-ordination with the Peoples' Committees at various levels, the
officials of EVN and of PMBRMB will ensure that implementation complies with the RAP (Par 45).
EVN will be responsible for co-ordinating the disbursement of funds. The funds would be disbursed to
the people directly by PPCs, with the Local Peoples Committee Representatives acting as a witness.
34.        The PPCs will inform the concerned district about the resettlement program and direct it
to take the steps necessary for compensation and resettlement of the PAP. The DPCs will inform the
PAP and the respective communes about the project and the R/C program and co-ordinate its activities.
35.        PMBRMB and PIDC2 have carried out a socio-economic survey on PAP covering the
following information:
(a)   The losses of PAP's land, properties, crops.
(b)   PAP's claims on compensation choices and compensation rates.
(c)   PAP's aspiration for R/C.
36.        The PPCs are responsible for checking and fixing compensation amounts for various types
of affected properties in agreement with PAP and in accordance with the principles of this RAP.
Payment of compensation will be supervised by PPC & PMBRMB and its agencies. Allotment of
alternative lands for PAP's house relocation will be the responsibility of the DPCs.
37.        The town authorities will be in charge of informing the PAPs about the RAP
implementation schedule, and to redress their grievances and to act as a communication link between
the PAPs and the DPCs, PPCs, EVN & PMBRMB. Most routine activities will be co-ordinated
directly by the town and district authorities. EVN will finance the total cost of the RAP and ensure the
timnely availability of funds. Table 8 in the Annex shows the activities which need to be carried out as
a part of the R/C program and the organisation(s) responsible for it.

38.         With regard to economic rehabilitation of PAPs, it is important to note that the area is an
rapid growth area, with several new employment opportunities emerging. Not only from the power
plant development, but from several industries already established in the area (e.g. Vinakyoei Steel
Mill). As noted earlier, the Townlet of Phu My was established in August last year, in order to
facilitate the economic growth of the area, and the local PC have made several plans for improving the
general as well as the technical educational facilities. Many PAPs, and especially their teen-age
children, have expressed their desire for changing their sources of income from agriculture to off-farm
employment, either in the opportunities established by incoming industries or by self-employment to
render services to these enterprises and their workers. Therefore the challenge of the economic
rehabilitation program of this RAP is to ensure that PAPs avail of the opportunities that are being
created in the area. This require general education, vocational training, access to credit, and initial
extension support. The major responsibility for implementing these measures lies with the PC of the
Townlet and the district, and funding will be provided by EVN.
39.         The first step in this process will be to carry out a detailed survey of the capacity, wishes
and plans of PAP households. Every person, belonging to an affected household, between 16 and 50
years of age will be offered assistance for economic rehabilitation to be availed of within a two year
period from the time of the survey. Based on this survey, a rehabilitation plan will be worked out for
the PAPs. This survey will be carried out by the agency that EVN will contract for external monitoring
and evaluation during November-December 1995.

38.          With regard to economic rehabilitation of PAPs, it is important to note that the area is an
rapid growth area, with several new employment opportunities emerging. Not only from the power
plant development, but from several industries already established in the area (e.g. Vinakyoei Steel
Mill). As noted earlier, the Townlet of Phu My was established in August last year, in order to
facilitate the economic growth of the area, and the local PC have made several plans for improving the
general as well as the technical educational facilities. Many PAPs, and especially their teen-age
children, have expressed their desire for changing their sources of income from agriculture to off-farm
employment, either in the opportunities established by incoming industries or by self-employment to
render services to these enterprises and their workers. Therefore the challenge of the economic
rehabilitation program of this RAP is to ensure that PAPs avail of the opportunities that are being
created in the area. This require general education, vocational training, access to credit, and initial
extension support. The major responsibility for implementing these measures lies with the PC of the
Townlet and the district, and funding will be provided by EVN.
39.          The first step in this process will be to carry out a detailed survey of the capacity, wishes
and plans of PAP households. Every person, belonging to an affected household, between 16 and 50
years of age will be offered assistance for economic rehabilitation to be availed of within a two year
period from the time of the survey. Based on this survey, a rehabilitation plan will be worked out for
the PAPs. This survey will be carried out by the agency that EVN will contract for external monitoring
and evaluation during November-December 1995.

D - Complaints and Grievancs
41.          Complaints and grievances related to any aspect of the RAP will be handled through
negotiations aimed at achieving consensus.
42.          Settlement between the PAP and local government will be first attempted at the level of
the Commune. If this first conciliation attempt fails, the case will be discussed a second time at the
District level. If at the District level the case is not resolved, an ad-hoc committee established by the
PPC will decide the matter
43.          In case where, despite the above efforts, no agreement is reached between the parties, the
case will be submitted to the District court.
44.          PAPs who present their cases to the Commnune, District and Provincial authorities, will be
exempted from any legal fees. PAPs, who bring their case to the District Court, will have to follow the
prevailing laws.

E - Supervision and Monitoring
45.        Implementation of the RAP will be regularly supervised and monitored by EVN in co-
ordination with the respective local peoples committees.  An agency nominated by EVN, namely
PMBRMB will periodically carry out internal monitoring and evaluation. External monitoring will be
done by an organisation such as an academic or a research institution, an NGO or an independent
consulting firm. They will be identified and hired in November 1995, prior to commencement of
project implementation.
46.        Internal monitoring and supervision will:
(a)   verify that the census and socio-economic survey of all PAPs has been carried out and that
property assessment and compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation has been carried out
in accordance with the provisions of the RAP;
(b)   oversee that RAP is implemented as approved;
(c)   verify that funds for implementing the RAP are provided in a timely manner, are
sufficient for their purposes, and are spent in accordance with the provisions of the RAP.
(d)  ensure that all PAPs opting for land-based rehabilitation have been able to secure land and
all those opting for non-land-based rehabilitation have been set up in their new
occupations; and
(e)   monitor the implementation of training to the PAPs.
47.        In addition to verifying the reports generated by the internal monitoring, the extemal
nonitoring agency will carry out the following tasks:
(a)  evaluate the initial social and economic impact of land acquisition and assess the training
needs of PAPs, based on which a training programme, availing of existing institutions will
be proposed;
(b)   verify if the objective of enhancement or at least restoration of income levels and
standards of living of the PAPs has been met; and
(c)  suggest modification in RAP implementation to achieve the principles and objectives set
forth in of this RAP.
48.        Monitoring activities will start from the time the PAPs have been compensated and will
continue for a period of about five years. The extemal monitoring agency will undertake surveys on an
annual basis and produce reports.

VIET NAM
Power Development Project
Assumptions in the Financial Statements
The following assumptions were used for the projected consolidated financial statements of EVN
and its affiliates as discussed in paras. 3.2 - 3.8 of the Beneficiary Chapter.
Revenues
1.         Power will be generated in accordance with the load forecasts based on economic
data, prepared by the Energy Institute. The revenue forecast assumes that the average growth rate
over 1995-2000 would be around 12.8% for the North; 16% for the South; and 15% for the
Center or an average increase of 14.6% p.a. for the country as a whole.
Losses
2.         Average technical and non-technical losses currently at about 21 % of generation (of
which non-technical losses are about 3%) are projected to be maintained at 21% until 1997 and to
be reduced to 20% in 1998; to 18% in 1999-2000; and to 17% in 2001.
Tariff
3.         The average price of electricity is about D 580/kWh, or about 5.3 USc/kWh. The
financial projections assume that tariffs would be progressively raised to an average level of 7
USc/kWh by 1999 as proposed by the Government. Assuming a 5% annual depreciation of the
Dong vis-a-vis the dollar, this tariff in 1999 would be about D 944/kWh.
Cost of Fuel
4.         Cost of fuel includes the cost of coal, heavy fuel, diesel and gas consumed by EVN's
thernal generating facilities. The fuel mix is based on EVN's generation plan. The base fuel
costs as of July 1995 are as follows: (a) Coal - US$42 per MT; (b) Heavy fuel oil - US$140 per
MT; (c) Diesel oil - US$280 per MT; and (d) Gas - US$2.5 per MMBTU.
Salaries, Wages and Benefits
5.         EVN records base salaries, wages and benefits in the Income Statement; staff,
however, also draws bonuses which are not recorded in the costs of the Income Statement.
Consistent with the practice of other state-owned enterprises in Viet Nam, EVN will distribute
20% of its profits to employees as bonuses. In the financial projections, this allocation of profit is
not carried forward to retained earnings but instead is recorded as current payables to employees
and treated as a reduction from funds generated from operations in the Funds Flow Statement.

Annex 17

Other Operating Expenses
6.         Other Operating Expenses are based on current EVN experience, with projections for
future plants based on historical costs for similar plants and escalated with inflation rates of 10%
per annum.
Taxes
7.         Taxes are based on current levels as follows: (a) Tax on Revenues (Turnover Tax) at
8% of total revenues; (b) Tax on Natural Resources (Royalty Tax) at 2% of that part of revenue
from sales of power which corresponds to the percentage of hydro generation versus total
generation; (c) Tax on Capital at 2.4% of total Government capital; and (d) Income Tax at 25%.
Depredation
8.         Depreciation rates are prescribed by the Government and calculated on the following
basis: turbines (8%), rockfill dams (2%), concrete dams (3%), and distributionsystems (8.5%).
Capital Investment
9.         Projected capital expenditures are those estimated to provide the additional plant and
equipment required to meet the demand forecast, escalated in accordance with the latest projection
of inflation rates. These expenditures are projected by EVN in accordance with the power
development plan.
Capital Structure
10.        The following capital structure is assumed:  (a) existing Government capital and
Enterprise capital remain as equity; (b) capital balance remains unchanged for the duration of the
projected period; (c) starting FY95 new investments are assumed to be financed at two-thirds debt;
(d) interests on outstanding loans are assumed to be totally capitalized; (e) long termn debts are
assumed to have an annual interest rate of 8% per annum and repaynent tems of up to 15 years
including two years of grace; and (f) no dividend payments on equity are assumed.
Fixed Assets
11.        Due to doubtful past valuation procedures, fixed assets as recorded may not represent
the fair value of the assets at the time of transfer from the PCs to EVN. Consequently, the
financial projections are based on fixed assets values provided by EVN as available at the end of
March 31, 1995.
Current Assets
12.        Accounts receivable are projected to be approximately one month of total revenues
while stocks are assumed to be one-eighth of total revenues.
