MEMNORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DVELOPMENT ASSOCIATIO
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO BOLIVIA
FOR A PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OPERATION
1.        The following report on a proposed developmenc credit to Bolivia for
SDR 9.0 million (US$11.5 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The
proposed credit, on standard IDA terms, would help finance a Public Financial
Management Operation.
2.        Background.  When  the  Paz  Estenssoro Government  took office  in
August 1985, it adopted a bold economic reform program to control inflation,
cut fiscal deficits, restore external balances, improve the efficiency of a
reduced public sector, and create the conditions for private sector growth.
The record of the Government's first 20 months in office is extraordinary.
With incisive stabilization policies in place, Government now is addressing
institutional constraints which chreaten to undermine full implementation of
the economic reforms and impede efficient resource mobilization and use.
Actions have been taken and planned to improve public sector performance at
the center and in major public enterprises, with IDA support. A Government
priority is to install basic cash management, budgetting and control systems
and capabilities in the main ministries and public entities; these moves are
prerequisites for effective financial management in Bolivia. Another priority
is implementation of the 1986 tax reform, crucial if stabilization measures
are to be maintained and growth resumed.   The tax reform embodies:   major
simplification, with a focus on value added and wealth; use of the banking
system network for collections, which has been tested in Bolivia, proven
successful elsewhere In Latin America and encouraged by IMF; and more
effective auditing and non-compliance actions. With this new regime, a lean
kvernment tax administration is being mounted under the new Ministry of
Taxation. A third institutional reform area encompasses major improvements in
the banking system, to establish a sound framework for monetary management and
financial intermediation.   The Government has initiated this reform with a
reorganization of the Central Bank, to limit its role to central banking
functions, reduce staff to efficient levels, install sound accounting and
i.ternal central  systems,  and establish  solid banking inspection.   After
..atensive preparation, the Central Bank re-zganization was initiated in
February 1987.
.
3.        Project  Objectives.   The   proposed   Bolivia  Public  Financial
.'anagement  Operation  (PFtFO)  aims  to  improve  efficiency  of  resource
mobilization and use, by implementing programs to improve organization, staff
and systems in three key areas: public financial administration and controls,
tax administration, and the banking system. Substantial technical support in
the development and initial implementation of these three programs is being
provided under a US$1.5 million IDA-financed Project Preparation Facility
(PPF)  advance  for  the  proposed  operation.    The  PFMO  is  designed  to
achieve tangible performance improvements, while laying the foundations for



institutional reforms over the medium term.   In the two principal years of
project implementation, reliable and timely financial administration and
control systems and a core of qualified staff would be functioning in the most
important ministries and public entities.  In tax administration, the program
aims to have the new tax regime functioning successfully, with organizational
reforms made, and efficient systems installed for all taxes.  In the banking
system, the PFMO would support improvements in Central Bank organization,
procedures and capabilities in accounting, banking inspection, monetary
policy,  and  debt  management,  and  implementation  of  agreed  restructuring
programs in the two large public development banks.
4.              Project Descriptiou.  The  PFMO consists  of  three mutually
reinforcing but separate components.   (1) The Financial Administration and
Control (SAFCO) component incorporates substantial technical assistance in
developing norms, installing basic systems and training core local staff to
provide timely and reliable financial information, efficient administration,
and effective controls in key ministries and 12 major public entities. Formal
and on-the-job training should result in at least 300 qualified, well-paid
staff assigned to the institutions covered under the first PFMO.   Entities
covered are expected to have reliable, compatible and timely accounting, cash
management, and programming and budgetting systems in place; budget and
project execution capabilities would have been strengthened substantially.
This program will be overseen by the SAFCO Council, comprising the Ministers
of Planning, Finance and Taxation, the Controller General of the Republic, and
other members satisfactory to the Association.   A full time SAFCO Executive
Secretariat  will  coordinate  day-to-day  operations.    IDA  would  finance
consultants, analysts, fixed-term appointments to the Executive Secretariat,
and  foreign  equipment  and  materials.    USAID,  under  parallel  financing
arrangements, has committed to finance US$3.0 million in incremental local
currency costs.  Government would fund base salaries and facilities.  (2) The
Tax Administration component would be managed by the Ministry of Taxation.
The 18 month action program deals with organizational improvements, and
installation of well functioning systems for tax collection, compliance,
auditing and statistics for the new tax regime.   IDA would fund the fixed
contract local team, and consultants for organizational improvements, auditing
and statistics. IDB and UNDP, under parallel financing, will continue to fund
consultants for tax collection and compliance systems, with US$1.6 million in
additional financing. (3) The Banking System componePt supports organization,
staffing and systems improvements in the Central Bank, needed for successful
completion of its recent reorganization, and technical assistance through the
Central 3ank in implementing agreed action programs to restructure Banco
Agricola and Banco del Estado.   A detailed action program for restructuring
the two development banks acceptable to IDA, will be finalized by January 1,
1988. For all other project elements, detailed implementation plans, Year I
action programs and terms of reference have been agreed in substance with
Government implementing agencies and parallel financing sources.
5.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Government of Bolivia and IDA
attach  top  priority  to:    (a)  strengthening  key  institutions  to  enable
execution of reforms, economic management, and efficient operations of a
smaller public sector; and (b) establishing the bases for reactivating the
economy, through financial sector reforms, internal and external resource



-3-
mobilization,  and restructuring  of  productive  capacity.    The  PFMO would
sujpport key first steps in building the organization, staffing and systems
needed to achieve these objectives.   Substantial IDA support in improving
public financial management  is warranted at this time.   The measures are
needed urgently,  the Government's economic team is committed to the agreed
programs for institutional reform, and leadership for each component is
strong.   IDA is playing an active role in coordinating donor support in the
public financial management area to ensure coherent approaches in the three
areas.   The IMF has provided important  technical  inputs in preparing  the
t          Central Bank reorganization.  The IMF Accounting Advisor to the Central Bank
is the head of the  IDA-financed  accounting  team.   The  new  IMF Resident
Representative to Bolivia is a leading Latin American central banker, which
will facilitate IMF technical support for the Banking System component of the
PFMO.   Arrangements have been made to ensure that this technical advice and
close coordination with the IMF will continue during project implementation.
The PFMO supports institutional reforms in the banking system, which form a
substantial basis for an IDA financial sector loan, under preparation. These
reforms are designed to improve Central Bank operations, banking inspection
systems and capabilities, and initiate restructuring of the development banks.
As such, the PFMO provides technical assistance to institutional reforms in
the financial system, complementing financial sector policy reforms to be
supported under the proposed financial sector adjustment loan.
6.            Agreed Actions.  As conditions of effectiveness,  (a) the SAFCO
Council and Executive Secretariat would be established, with composition and
functions acceptable to IDA; (b) the Borrower will have established satisfac-
tory contractual arrangements with tho Central Bank of Bolivia to carry out
the banking system component; and (c) a satisfactory administrative services
contract  will  have  been  signed  with  UNDP-OPE.    Implementation  programs,
detailed Year I action plans, TORs, and financing plans have been agreed in
substance for all components. For each of the three components, respectively,
tne following disbursement conditions have been agreed: (a) for SAFCO,
establishment of SAFCO satisfactory to IDA, compliance with disbursement
conditions for USAID local currency financing; (b) for each component,
submission of an acceptable Component Implementation Program and Year I Action
Plan.   An agreed program for restructuring the two large development banks
will  be  finalized  by January  1,  1988.    All  procurement  and  consultant
selection will follow Bank guidelines.  ID  and USAID both have confirmed the
imounts and timing of needed parallel furns. Completion of necessary arrange-
mevL.s for IDB funding of the tax administration component are required not
later than one year after credit effectiveness of the IDA Credit; IDB funds
are expected to be available by July 1987. A tentative list of the ministries
and entities for coverage under the SAFCO program was discussed during
negotiations; final selection will be made by the SAFCO Council, and will need
to be acceptable to IDA.  Arrangements for annual action programs, reporting
and monitoring have been agreed.
7.         Justification.  The institutional reforms and systems improvements
incorporated in the proposed Public Financial Management Operation are
essential to sustaining the early successes of the Government of Bolivia's new
economic policy.   During the project period, central ministries and the 12
public entities which account for about 60% of public financial flows would



-4-
have basic, reliable and timely accounting, cash management and budget systems
in place, and a core of qualified staff managing and operating these systems.
The reforms in tax administration are expected to result in dramatic increases
over  historically  poor  tax  collections.    The  major  reorganization  being
implemented in the Central Bank and planned for the main development banks-
combined with financial policy measures taken and planned--are expected to
rationalize and strengthen the banking system substantially.   Each of these
programs is expected to have concrete impact in improving the efficiency of
resource mobilization and use.
8.        Risks. The project is designed to improve the depth and profession-
alism of public financial management, and to reduce the vulnerability of the
civil service to political swings. However, the success of implanting SAFCO,
restructuring the banking system, and installing improvements in tax adminis-
tration depend on the strong leadership presently responsible for each
component. Thus, the operation is vulnerable to major shifts in politics or
leadership.   These risks have been reduced by:   focussing on basic changes
over a relatively short period; agreeing on detailed blueprints for each
component  with  implementation  already  initiated;  and  creating  stable
organizational  mechanisms,   such  as  CONSAFCO  and  the  SAFCO  Executive
Secretariat, to protect the technical integrity of the program from political
swings. The operation has been tailored to reflect implementation constraints
and to focus on basic building blocks during the initial two-year period.
9.        Recommendatlons.    I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
