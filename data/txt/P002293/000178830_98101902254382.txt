REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed dev-
elopment credit to the Republic of Senegal for the equivvalent of US$4.2 mil-
lion to help finance a lIvestock project. The credit would be on standard
IDA terms.  The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KF) would provide
a loan of Kuwaiti Dinars 1.2 million (US$4.1 million) to the Government of
Senegal for a term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at
2.5 percent per annum and an administrative charge of 0.5 percent per annum.
The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) would also provide a
loan of US$1.6 million to the Government for a term of 25 years, including
5 years of grace, with interest at 2.0 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.         A report entitled "The Economy of Senegal" (212-SE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 10, 1973. A special mission on public
finance visited Senegal in October 1974; its findings are included in this
report. Country data appear in Annex I.
Past Development
3.         During the 1960's, the Senegalese economy experienced virtual
stagnation, as real output increased less rapidly than population, and per
capita GNP declined. Two factors were responsible for this situation. First,
with independence, Senegal lost its privileged position as the center of
French West Africa and therefore had to adjust to reduced economic, administra-
tive, and political dimensions. Secondly, the difficulties of adaptation to
the new situation were compounded in the latter part of the decade when
groundnut production fell by 50 percent due to unfavorable weather and falling
export prices. In 1971, weather conditions improved temporarily, but 1972 and
1973 brought the Sahel'Es most severe drought in this century. Food emergency
operations alleviated th,e drought's harmful effects, but both the fiscal and
balance of payments situations sharply deteriorated.
4.         Public savings net of amortization, which had substantially improved
during the preceding years, were all but wiped out in 1972/73 and 1973/74.
Revenues were affected by the decline in economic activity; and recurrent
expenditures were further increased by a rise in salaries to compensate for
the rapidly increasing cost of living, substantially higher debt service

payments, and perhaps most importantly, heavy consumer subsidies which result-
ed from maintaining low domestic prices in the face of skyrocketing food
import prices. Thus, at mid-1974, in spite of a US$46 million higher transfer
to the Stabilization Fund from groundnut sales than in the previous year, the
public finance situation was more serious than it had been since 1960.
5.         Faced with a difficult situation in public finance, the Government
took a number of steps in November 1974 which were expected to put public
finances on a sounder footing. Consumer prices for rice, sugar, and groundnut
oil were raised by 40 to 90 percent to bring them more closely in line with
world market prices and eliminate or drastically reduce subsidies. However,
high world market prices for wheat required an increase in domestic flour
prices which the Government was reluctant to pass on to the consumer and which
led to a subsidy on flour. To compensate for the rapid increase in basic food
prices, Government salaries were raised on average by 16 percent, with actual
increases ranging from 60 percent for the lower to 3 percent for the higher
salaries. Farmer prices for groundnuts were brought closer to world prices
which were particularly high at that moment. The Government thought it could
safely reduce its take from the groundnut crop since world phosphate prices
had increased five-fold. In addition, compensating revenues from the latter
source were assured through expanded government participation in the phosphate
mining company and a 100 percent tax levy on excess profits accruing from the
price rise. However, a good part of the additional public savings was absorbed
by payments for the increased participation in the phosphate mine and the
servicing of debt incurred to finance new investments and state acquisitions
of two foreign-owned public utility companies.
6.          The balance of payments also came under pressure in 1973 and 1974,
in the former year because of a widening of the trade gap and in the latter
year because capital outflows from the private sector partly offset a substan-
tial improvement in the current account. Net foreign reserves at the end
of 1974 stood at minus US$44 million. Tn January 1975 Senegal drew its
full US$19.2 million allocation under the IMF oil facility.
7.          Balance of payments problems persisted through 1975 largely because
of cyclical factors. The good 1974 crop was harvested at a time when world
groundnut prices were still high; this created an atmosphere of optimism both
in the private and public sectors. At the end of 1974, the state marketing
organization purchased the crop from the farmers at generous prices thereby
injecting massive purchasing power into the economy. In summer 1975 private
and public expenditures were booming, but the bulk of the groundnut crop
remained unsold, world market prices were 30 percent lower than a few months
earlier, and foreign exchange reserves fell rapidly under the pressure of
excess demand. The Government responded by introducing selective credit
restrictions which so far have been effective in reducing total credit out-
standing and stabilizing domestic inflation. Foreign exchange reserves stood
at minus US$66 million by the end of November 1975; this was financed by a



- 3 -
drawing in September of US$11.7 million under the second IMF oil facility, by
the monetary union to which Senegal belongs, and by the mostly foreign-owned
commercial banks.
8.        The first half of 1976 will see a continuation of the problems
experienced in 1975; the Government's reluctance to cut incomes of groundnut
farmers has encouraged it to maintain producer prices in the face of slack-
ening world demand-for groundnut products. Unfortunately, phosphate rock
prices are weakening as wqell; this will effectively eliminate the cushion
which has enabled Senega:L to absorb the recent rises in oil and other import
costs while implementing a policy of income distribution in favor of the
rural areas. Hopefully, this income redistribution policy will not fall
victim to the current difficulties Senegal is experiencing. There are strong
indications that several OPEC countries are willing to provide increased
capital aid; moreover, there remain substantial sources of additional balance
of payments assistance the Government can tap such as the IMF, Stabex and the
monetary union to which Senegal belongs. Finally, the Government has already
demonstrated its willingness to use credit restrictions and to eliminate
costly consumer subsidie3 to maintain control over the short-term situation.
Prospects
9.        As demonstrated during the last five years, weather conditions
and groundnut world market prices remain critical Eor Senegal's growth pros-
pects. The Government is striving, with our support, to reduce its vulner-
ability to variances in these factors. Its long range program calls for
development of areas less affected by rainfall fluctuations (Casamance and
Eastern Senegal) where cash crops other than groundnuts can be grown. Irriga-
tion is being developed in the arid northern part of the country; this will
reduce dependence on cereal imports. With substantial gains also in industry,
tourism and fisheries, weather conditions and groundnuts by 1980 will be
less decisive factors than today. However, groundnut cultivation is the
mainstay of the economy and provides the livelihood for the majority of the
rural poor. The Government is, therefore, supporting the introduction of
animal traction, fertilizers and crop rotation techniques to raise the prm-
ductivity of the groundnut farmer.
1,0.      The Fourth Development Plan (1973/74 - 1976/77) continues to
give highest priority to rural development (36 percent of the total projected
investment during the Plan period), housing/public utilities (18 percent) and
transport infrastructure (16 percent). Industry and tourism, quite justifi-
ably, will have their share increased from 5 to 10 percent during the Plan
period. Assuming average rainfall conditions, Senegal's growth in real terms
in the remainder of the 1970s will be of the order of 4.5 percent or about 2
percent per capita, which is still a considerable improvement over the past
decade. A new plan is under preparation and will be reviewed in the course of
a basic economic mission scheduled for the Fall of 1976.



- 4 -
11.       The structure of Senegal's balance of payments will gradually
improve, but in the next few years the benefits of these favorable trends will
be reduced by falling terms of trade. Tourism, some new export industries and
an important expansion of phosphate rock mining will provide additional
foreign resources, and the implementation of existing irrigation plans will
progressively diminish the large food imports for urban centers. These
prospects combined with a favorable long-term outlook for groundnut production
should result in a healthier trade balance in the early eighties. The favor-
able long-term prospects remain contingent on the execution of the investment
program which will have to be largely financed from abroad at a rate of
about US$125 million annually on concessionary terms. Traditional sources of
aid will probably not suffice, and it will take time before new aid flows
are developed. Therefore, for the coming two or three years supplemental
foreign funds, over and above foreseeable project aid, will be needed.
12.       The financial pressures of the past three years have already led
the Government to borrow on the Eurodollar market for a total amount of US$85
million, partly to roll over previous debts. Part of the expected balance of
payments deficits over the next two or three years could be financed through
access to the expanded IMF facilities or the Stabex fund; but additional
foreign exchange resources at a rate of about $25 million a year will pro-
bably be needed. Assuming that additional borrowing to cover the gap is done
on Eurodollar terms, debt service would increase from six percent of exports
of goods and non-factor services in 1975 to roughly ten percent by the end
of the 1970s.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SENEGAL
13.       The Bank Group has had 25 operations in Senegal to date.     Total
outstanding lending amounts to US$137.8 million, including fourteen IDA
credits, six Bank loans, two blends of Bank and IDA funds, two IFC operations,
and one blend of Bank and IFC funds. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1976 and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       Execution of these projects, apart from the Railway Project,
is moving forward without exceptional delays. The procurement for the railway
has been slow due to time consuming contract approval procedures, but most
components have now been received or ordered. Two agricultural credits
(140-SE and 404-SE) provided for technical assistance designed to facilitate
the reorganization of the Office National de Cooperation et d'Assistance au
Developpement (ONCAD); these programs did not achieve meaningful results.
Although Government took in early 1975 steps to strengthen ONCAD's management
and financial operations, ONCAD's overall performance has not improved. (see
Annex II).
15.       In view of Senegal's need for substantially higher capital inflows,
the scale of Bank Group lending is expected to increase significantly in the



future. The Bank Group share of foreign aid disbursements (including grants)
is expected to increase from about 6 percent in 1970/71 to 24 percent over
the 1974-80 period. By then the Bank Group is likely to be the largest aid
donor. This will increase the Bank Group's share of the outstanding and dis-
bursed debt from 12 percent at the end of 1973 to about 25 percent by 1980.
IBRD/IDA share in public debt service will probably go up from 2.2 percent
in 1973 to about 13 percent by 1980.
16.       The objectives of Bank Group project lending in Senegal fall under
four main headings. Priority will continue to be rural development, including
development of irrigation in the Senegal River Valley Region (e.g., the Debi-
Lampsar Engineering Credit), intensification of groundnut production and di-
versification into new crops and new regions (e.g., the Sine Saloum and Terres
Neuves projects, the proposed Sedhiou II project in Casamance and the project
described in this report). As in the past, our agricultural lending is ex-
pected to exceed one-thlird of the total. Secondly, we shall assist diversi-
fication of the economy by lending for the growing sectors of tourism and
industry (e.g., the proposed tourism infrastructure project on the Petite Cote
and a proposed second loan to SOFISEDIT, a development finance company esta-
blished with assistance from the Bank Group in 1974). Thirdly, we shall
continue investment for modernizing and expanding the country's infrastructure
(e.g., a Third Highway Project and a Feeder Roads Project approved by the
Board in March 1976, and a proposed fishing wharf at Dakar Port). Finally we
shall continue lending to reorient and expand the country's education system,
as in the Second Education Project.
PART ]III: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
17.       Despite relatively poor soils and erratic rainfall, the agricul-
tural sector is centraL to Senegal's economy. It has traditionally accounted
for about 35% of GDP, up to 70% of Senegal's exports and 70% of all employ-
ment. There are several important sectoral characteristics: small farms
(less than 10 ha) account for 95% of all production; groundnuts account for
almost 70% of agricultural exports; 60% of the rural population is con-
centrated within about 100 miles of Dakar in the Groundnut Basin; and large
areas in the northern and eastern parts of the country are suitable only
for livestock production under extensive grazing.
18.       Government's efforts to develop agriculture have been directed
to increasing groundnut and millet production, especially in the heavily
populated Groundnut Basin; diversifying production by promoting rice and
cotton in the south and east, and developing the irrigation potential of the
Senegal river; and encouraging the migration of farmers from the heavily
populated areas of the Groundnut Basin to Eastern Senegal.     To date the major
component of Government's rural development efforts has been "Programme
Agricole".   Starting in the early 1960s, the program has aimed at increasing
the production of millet and groundnuts by making animal drawn implements,
fertilizers and improved seeds available to farmers on credit, providing



- 6 -
extension services to promote the correct use of these inputs, and developing
cooperatives to facilitate the distribution of inputs and crop marketing.
19.       To coordinate the support it provides through Programme Agricole
and other special programs, the Government is increasingly relying on semi-
autonomous development agencies. The long range objective is to have at
least one of these agencies established in each administrative region of the
country with each reporting directly to the Ministry of Rural Development
and Hydraulics and working in close cooperation with Banque Nationale de
Developpement du Senegal (BNDS) and ONCAD, the national cooperative support,
input supply, and groundnut marketing organization. Some of these agencies
are already the beneficiaries of Bank Group financing; one of them, Societe
pour le Developpment des Fibres Textiles (SODEFITEX), has expanded its range
of activities well beyond its original focus on cotton production, and is
ready to take responsibility for the livestock project proposed in this
report.
20.       The Livestock Subsector.   Livestock numbers were increasing
rapidly prior to the 1972/73 drought, when losses amounting to about 15% of
the country's herd occurred. At the end of 1973 the cattle population was
about 2.2 million and livestock's share of GDP was a relatively modest 7.5%
(US$140 million). The total value of animal products in the year was about
US$53 million; meat and offal accounted for about two-thirds of that and
milk, eggs, hides and skins for the rest.
21.       Until the drought, domestic meat production met about 80% of
domestic demand with the balance coming from Mauritania on the hoof. How-
ever, Mauritania meat imports are now more expensive; and as a result of
generally rising retail meat prices, per capita meat consumption has dropped
to about 10 kg per year from close to 15 kg before the drought. Per capita
fish consumption is still the highest in West Africa, at about 50 kg/year,
and milk imports amount to about US$9 million per year.
22.       About 2-3% of Senegal's population derive their livelihood entire-
ly from livestock, and another 8% depend on livestock as their main income
source. The Peul, a nomadic or semi-nomadic ethnic group, raise an esti-
mated 70% of the cattle; the remaining 30% are raised by other ethnic groups
as a complement to farming activities. Lately some changes have become
noticeable in the value system of the traditional pastoralists. Though status
and prestige are still predominant reasons for accumulating large stock
numbers, there is a rising awareness of the irrationality of maintaining old,
unproductive animals and even a willingness to sell younger animals; a
transition from subsistence to production-oriented attitudes is therefore
underway and could be substantially accelerated, provided the pastoralists
are made aware of incentives and marketing opportunities through programs of
education and extension services.
23.       Senegalese cattle are well adapted to the environment, but because
of poor nutrition (particularly during the dry season when weight losses of
10-20% are common), total herd offtake is not more than 10% annually and



- 7 -
average carcass weights are very low (in the range of 125-140 kg). The aver-
age semi-nomadic herd in the north of Eastern Senegal is 67 cattle; annual
milk and meat production amounts to roughly US$1,400, of which about 1/4 is
consumed by the family group and the balance either sold or retained as
savings. Including the value of agricultural and other activities (estimated
at US$30 per capita), a herdsman family group of about 25 people in Eastern
Senegal would therefore have an effective per capita income roughly equal to
the average of all Senegalese small-scale farmers (US$85).
24.       About 90% of annual cattle marketing is handled by a complex tradi-
tional system which involves a large number of established private traders,
intermediaries and butchers. There are about 20 principal and 50 secondary
cattle markets in which animals are sold on appearance only, with sales
usually for cash. This traditional system performs quite efficiently.
25.       Government intervenes in the livestock subsector principally through
its tax system and by providing animal health and extension services to herds-
men and supervision of slaughtering and meat processing. So far, the Govern-
ment has not seriously attempted to take over marketing and control prices in
the livestock subsector as it has in other parts of the agriculture sector.
In 1963, the Government did enter the livestock production and export market-
ing business by setting up a state corporation, Societe d'Exploitation des
Ressources Animales du Senegal (SERAS), to operate a 5,000 head fattening
ranch and the Dakar slaughterhouse and to handle the export of hides and
skins; this venture has not been very successful and handles only a small
proportion of the market.
26.       About 1% of total public revenues are raised through direct head
tax on animals in the domestic herds; this tax is unpopular and only 30% of
the revenues due are collected each year. Some revenues are also collected
through taxes on the marketing and slaughtering of cattle and on the annual
turnover of tradesmen and butchers.
27.       All of Government's animal health, extension and inspection pro-
grams are managed centrally by the Department of Animal Health and Pro-
duction of the Ministry of Rural Development. The operating staff of this
Department, both veterinarians and livestock technicians, are well trained
under existing Senegalese programs. The Department gives top priority to
animal health programs and has managed through mass vaccination campaigns
in the late 1960s to bring rinderpest and pleuropneumonia under control;
chronic budgetary constraints have, however, limited the extent of veteri-
nary services coverage tD about 45% of the country's cattle population,
and the risk of a destructive epidemic remains therefore high. For the
same reason, livestock extension services are practically ineffective.
28.       Pastoral Resources and Livestock Development Strategy.     Senegal's
11 million ha of pasture, coupled with about 3 million ha of arable fallow
and the agricultural by-products from an area of 2.5 - 3 million ha of
cultivated land, constitute a major national resource which, under the
present system of livestock production, is grossly underutilized. The



- 8 -
major factors leading to this underutilization are the lack of range manage-
ment, with resulting destruction of pasture through bushfires and overgraz-
ing, and the unfamiliarity of traditional herdsmen with the use of crop re-
sidues for animal feed. Any strategy to increase livestock production must
address these two factors.
29.       Range management entails bringing the livestock production of a
given area into line with the area's water and pasture resources (its "carry-
ing capacity") while simultaneously working to prevent degradation of those
resources through fire or other natural calamity. Carrying capacity varies
with climatic conditions. Thus, the some 7 million ha of Senegalese pasture-
land located in the Sahel zone, an ecologically delicate area characterized
by low annual rainfall and a very long dry season, could support, even under
good range management conditions, far smaller herds than the 4 million ha of
pasture further south in the Sudano/Guinean zones where rainfall is higher
and some mixed farming/livestock raising is possible. As a result of the
severe droughts of the early 1970s, Senegal's livestock herds are now
smaller than the optimum carrying capacities of the respective zones; the
best strategy for increased livestock production would be to encourage rapid
herd reconstitution in the Sudano/Guinean zones while going much slower in
the Sahel zone.
30.       Range management cannot take place, however, under the present
practice of communal pasture utilization in Eastern Senegal. Each herd
owner tends to maximize his personal benefits by grazing as many animals as
he can on the common pasture; he has no incentive either to control the size
of his herd or to invest in land improvement. What is needed is education
for the pastoral community to realize the futility of the present system;
at the same time incentives must be provided to induce the individual herds-
man to voluntarily control the size of his herd. The existing social struc-
ture and system of land tenure plus sheer administrative burden augur against
a new program centered on individual herdsmen and their families. What does
appear desirable is a scheme whereby groups of related families would be
alloted exclusive grazing and water rights in a specific area in return for
acceptance of prescribed husbandry practices, including limitations on the
size of their herds; control over the use of their alloted pastureland would
be the principal incentive for these groups to participate, but they would
in addition benefit from the provision of watering facilities, livestock
extension services, training and credit. The success of such schemes in
Eastern Africa, under similar socio-economic conditions, offers encourage-
ment to try in Eastern Senegal. The proposed project is just such an
attempt; 90 percent of the project area falls in the Sudano/Guinean zones
where the potential is greatest for livestock development, and its various
components are consistent with the Government's overall program for dev-
elopment of the livestock subsector.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       The Government of Senegal has requested IDA assistance in financing
a livestock project in the Eastern Senegal Region. The project was identified
by the Bank's Resident Mission in Western Africa (RMWA) and prepared by the
French consulting firm SATEC assisted by the Government and RMWA under a UNDP
financed project.. The project was appraised in May 1975 and joint negotia-
tions were held in March 1976, with a Senegalese delegation led by Mr.
Tidiane NDiaye, Director of Financing of the Plan a.i., and representatives
of the Kuwait Fund and BADEA. The appraisal report (No. 988a-SE) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a
credit and project summary and the attached map (IBRD 11823) shows the
project area.
Project Description
32.        Eastern Senegal's potential for crop production is not high, basic-
ally because of poor soils, and livestock development constitutes a rational
approach to making the best use of the region's human and natural resources.
This would be IDA's fiirst livestock operation in Senegal and the country's
first comprehensive efEort to increase livestock production by traditional
pastoralists through the combination of animal health and husbandry improve-
ments. The project would assist some 30,000 livestock owners in Eastern
Senegal to increase their income and living standards through the develop-
ment and operation of a controlled grazing scheme and the provision of
effective animal healtlh, extension and credit services. The project would
be carried out over the five-year period, mid-1976 mid-1981, and would in-
clude:
(a)  Developing and operating a grazing scheme on about 1.4 mil-
lion ha of understocked grazing land in the northern part of
Eastern Senegal, involving principally:
(i) organizing some 6,500 predominantly pastoralist
families into about 65 grazing units to whom
exclusive rights to land and watering facilities
would be granted;
(ii) constructing about one hundred wells 45 to 75 m
deep, and about 2,400 km of firebreaks;
(iii) granting up to 300 credits to herders for the pur-
chase of breeding animals, 500 credits for supple-
mentary feed (cottonseed) and 30 credits for ox-drawn
carts and small farm equipment;
(iv) designing, developing and evaluating a functional
literacy program for livestock producers.
(b) Improving animal health services throughout Eastern Senegal;



- 10 -
(c) Providing fellowships and opportunities for visits to
livestock development projects abroad for Senegalese
graduates, project staff and pastoral leaders and pro-
viding agricultural extension workers with training in
livestock husbandry; and
(d) Monitoring and evaluating the project, and formulating future
livestock investment proposals.
Project Execution
33.       The grazing units would be established in Years 2 through 5 of the
project after consultation with pastoralists and local leaders. Under the
grazing scheme, each group of pastoralists would be given exclusive grazing
rights to a specific grazing unit; such rights would be granted and safe-
guarded by Government and enjoyed by the pastoralists for as long as they
followed range, water and livestock management practices prescribed by Gov-
ernment. The project would provide for the construction of firebreaks to
demarcate and protect each grazing unit and for two shallow wells per unit.
A typical grazing unit of 22,000 ha would accomodate a group of 100 families
of eight members on average, and at full development about 2,000 cattle and
1,000 sheep and goats. Government would issue a decree establishing the
administrative conditions for implementation of the grazing scheme and
entrusting the administration of the project area to SODEFITEX, the regional
rural development agency for Eastern Senegal, which would have the power to
grant and withdraw grazing rights (Section 3.02(a) of the draft Credit Agree-
ment). SODEFITEX is a corporation (Societe Anonyme d'Economie Mixte) which
is majority - controlled by the Government. The Government agreed not to
take any action by which it would lose effective control over SODEFITEX
(Section 4.09 of the draft Credit Agreement). As a condition of effective-
ness, the Government would conclude an agreement with SODEFITEX entrusting
the latter with the execution of the project (Section 3.01(b) of the draft
Credit Agreement).
34.      During the project period, a credit program would be developed from
PY 2 through PY 5, to assist: (i) 200 to 300 families - about 60 per year-,
or 5% of the families in the grazing scheme area, in the acquisition of
breeding animals by providing long-term credits to cover 80% of the purchase
price of about four heifers/young cows per family (totaling about 950 heifers/
cows and 50 bulls), for a 12-year term, including a four-year grace period,
at 7.5% interest per year; (ii) about 30 pastoralist families in the acquisi-
tion of ox-drawn carts and small farm tools by providing medium-term credits
to cover 80% of the purchase price of such equipment, for a five-year term
at 7.5% interest per year; and (iii) about 500 pastoralist families in the
acquisition of supplementary feed (cottonseed) by providing short-term
credits to cover the entire costs of such inputs to feed about 5,000 cattle
annually, for a 12-month term at 7.5% interest rate.

35.       The existing staff of the Regional Animal Health Service (RAHS)
is sufficient and competent, but lacks facilities and funds. Consequently,
the project would provide RAHS with 9 veterinary field offices, 40 vac-
cination yards, transport, veterinary and laboratory equipment and the
incremental operating funds needed to carry out a five-year regionwide
vaccination campaign. The first two years of this campaign would be free
of charge to the beneficiaries; afterwards Government would entrust RAHS with
the collection of charges with respect to vaccinations and drugs provided to
participating pastoralists. During negotiations, Government gave assurances
that it would discuss with IDA no later than 18 months after the date of the
Credit Agreement the arrangements for the collection of these charges (Section
4.03(a) of the draft Credit Agreement).
36.       SODEFITEX is in the process of establishing a Project Unit at
Tambacounda, in Eastern Senegal, to coordinate and supervise the entire
project implementation. Key project staff would include a Project Director,
his Deputy and an Accountant. The unit would have two specialist sections:
(a) a Pastoral Service, headed by a Range Management Specialist, to handle the
grazing scheme, and (b) a Hydraulic Service. The animal health component of
the project would be carried out by the Department of Animal Health of the
Ministry of Rural Development and Hydraulics through RAHS; the project's
water development, rural. engineering and functional literacy components
would be undertaken in close collaboration with, respectively, the Urban and
Rural Hydraulics and Rural Equipment Departments of the Ministry of Rural
Development and the State Secretariat for Human Resources of the Ministry of
Education.
37.       Given the shortage of qualified and experienced Senegalese, ex-
patriates would be recruited for the following posts: Deputy Director, Range
Management Specialist, and Hydrogeologist. The first two would be replaced
after about five years and the third after about three years by Senegalese
whose training would be funded under the project. The project would also
provide for 25 man-months of consultant services for studies related to pro-
ject implementation and preparation of a second-phase project for a total
cost of $152,000.
Project Cost and FinancLng
38.       The total cost of the project, net of-taxes (US$2.5 million) but
including contingencies, is US$10.5 million. The proposed IDA credit of
US$4.2 million would be complemented by parallel financing from the Kuwait
Fund equivalent to US$4.1 million and from BADEA of US$1.6 million. Livestock
owners who would be beneficiaries of the project would contribute about
US$100,000 to project with the balance of project costs, including all taxes
and duties, to be financed by Government. The financing plan is, thus, as
follows:



- 12 -
(US$ million)        Percentage
IDA                                 4.2                 40
Kuwait Fund                         4.1                 39
BADEA                                1.6                15
Government                           0.5                 5
Farmers                             0.1                   1
Total                    10.5                100
39.       Government and colenders' contributions would be passed on as a
grant to SODEFITEX because SODEFITEX would receive negligible revenues from
the project and, except for the grazing scheme, the project would involve
services normally supplied to pastoralists by Government. However, the
Government has agreed to explore means of recovering costs from beneficiaries
and to exchange views with IDA on this subject (Section 4.05 of the draft
Credit Agreement).
40.      At Government's request it has been agreed that an advance of
$300,000 under the Project Preparation Facility would be made to permit
implementation of the project to begin prior to Credit effectiveness.
Indeed, Government, colenders and IDA agreed that it was essential to
strengthen SODIFITEX by providing it with the expatriate staff (para. 37)
as soon as possible. In addition, it is necessary that the first vaccina-
tion campaign, because of its seasonal nature, be completed before vacci-
nation campaign, because of its seasonal nature, be completed before trans-
humance of cattle starts in September 1976. A delay in the implementation
of this component would result in a loss of one year in the animal health
program of the project. Funds under the Preparation Facility will be used
to establish the project unit (including the recruitment of staff and the
provision of facilities) and to launch the first vaccination campaign.
Accordingly, retroactive financing of up to $300,000 is provided.
Procurement and Disbursement
41.       Well development (US$4.1 million) would be financed by the Kuwait
Fund with procurement in line with Kuwait Fund procedures. Firebreaks dev-
elopment (US$1.6 million)would be financed by BADEA with procurement in
line with BADEA procedures. All other procurement would be according to IDA
guidelines. Contracts in excess of US$50,000 for buildings (US$0.7 million),
and vehicles and equipment (US$0.6 million) would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding; contracts for less than US$50,000 would
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally. Goods
manufactured locally would be allowed a preference of 15 percent or the level
of applicable import duty, whichever is lower, when comparing domestic and



- 13 -
foreign bids. Contracts of over US$10,000 (US$0.5 million) for the construc-
tion of vaccination yards and extension outposts and the purchase of motor-
cycles for extension officers would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally. The balance of equipment purchases of furniture
for the staff houses and office furnishings and small equipment would be in
small lots of less tharn US$10,000 each (aggregating US$0.2 million), and
would be made locally following quotations obtained from suppliers. The
services of internationally recruited staff and consultants, costing about
US$1.0 million, would be obtained in accordance with procedures acceptable to
IDA. The remainder of the project cost would be for local salaries and
allowances (US$1.3 million) and for general operating expenditures (US$1.6
million).
42.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed to cover the
following:
(a)  70% of total expenditures for civil works (excluding construction
of wells and firebreaks) - US$0.50 million;
(b)  100% of the foreign exchange costs of vehicles and equip-
ment or, if procured locally, 65% of total expenditures -
US$0.35 mill"on;
(c)  100% of foreign exchange costs for expatriate personnel,
consultant services and training of project staff abroad -
US$0.57 mill:ion;
(d)  75% of total costs of credits for breeding stock - US$0.22
million;
(e)  75% of total project incremental operating costs - US$1.44
million.
US$1.12 million would be unallocated.
Marketing
43.       All output o:: the project would be consumed domestically, and as
the incremental product-ion of the project at full development would be less
than 5 percent of domestic output, the market outlook for the products
involved is very good. Meat is increasingly scarce due to the recent droughts,
and the strength of domestic demand is shown by an increase in cattle prices
of about 180 percent during the past five years. Incremental milk production
generated by the project would improve the nutrition of about 30,000 rural
families, and any surpLus would find a ready market in Eastern Senegal.
Hides and skins can be sold to either the state agency SERAS for eventual
export or local private tanneries.

Benefits and Justification
44.       The principal direct benefits from the project would be incremental
annual livestock production worth US$3.0 million in 1975 terms. Each of the
6,500 pastoral families benefiting from the grazing scheme is expected to
nearly double its average annual cash income from livestock production to
US$670, while some 24,000 other rural families benefiting only from the
improved animal health services, would increase theirs from US$250 to US$310.
In addition, about 1,000 seasonal and 80 permanent jobs would be created.
45.       The overall economic rate of return of the project is estimated
at 23 percent and analysis shows it to be relatively unsensitive to all but
major variations in costs and benefits.
Risks
46.       Although interviews of potential participants in the grazing scheme
have revealed considerable interest, it is extremely difficult to assess
at this time the rate of response of pastoralists to the changes required as
a condition of participation and whether the participating groups and the
Government will be able to prevent encroachment by non-participants. Conse-
quently, the grazing scheme is risky and, in a sense, experimental. However,
the degree of risk involved appears acceptable given the generally success-
ful results of similar grazing schemes in East Africa. Such schemes also
appear to offer the only practical means to achieve significantly better
use of the livestock, pasture and human resources of the area and, at the
same time, to prevent environmental degradation through overgrazing. More-
over, an appropriate legal framework is provided to protect the grazing units
from encroachment; and, most importantly, the potential benefits to pastoral-
ists from participation are very attractive.
47.        In order to minimize the risk, the implementation of the grazing
scheme would be phased, with each successive phase undertaken only follow-
ing the completion and satisfactory management of previous phases (Section
3.01(d) of the draft Credit Agreement). This would enable this project com-
ponent to be modified or even terminated in the light of experience. If it
should become necessary to limit the scope of the grazing scheme, continua-
tion of other project components would still be justifiedd. In particular,
the animal health component, covering the entire Eastern Senegal Region, will
have high returns; furthermore, the stocking rates in this region are very
low, and the danger of overstocking and overgrazing is serious but not
immediate.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Senegal and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
in Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association



- 15 -
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.       Features of the draft Credit Agreement of special interest in-
clude: (i) those referred to in paragraphs 33, 35, 39 and 47 of this report,
(ii) cross remedies in case of suspension or default under the Kuwait Fund
and BADEA loan agreements (Sections 5.01 and 5.02 of the draft Credit Agree-
ment), (iii) additional conditions of effectiveness, namely that conditions of
effectiveness under the Kuwait Fund and BADEA loan agreements have been met,
that a decree granting authority to SODEFITEX to organize the grazing scheme
has been enacted, that an agreement has been concluded between the Government
and SODEFITEX entrusting the latter with the carrying out of the project and
that the Project Director and Deputy Director have been employed (Section 6.01
of the draft Credit Agreement) and (iv) a condition of disbursement against
the credit program, namely that the Association has approved the plan of
implementation for said program (paragraph 4(b) of Schedule 1 to the draft
Credit Agreement).
50.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed dev-
elopment credit.

Credit of February 10, 1969 and Loan of same date (cancelled);
Effective June 25, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The credit is almost fully disbursed and a completion report has been
prepared.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any

Cr. 252         Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 Million
Credit of June 18, 197i; Effective January 6, 1972
Closing Date:   June 30, 1977
Project progress is satisfactory and production targets established
at appraisal have so far been reached.    Adequate rainfall ensured a satisfac-
tory 1975/76 campaign, although maize production suffered from heavy rains.
Because of cost overruns, mainly due to the increased number of extension
staff, salary increases and changes in the US dollar exchange rate, funds
available under the Credit will be insufficient to cover all expenditures
required. However, Government has made available US$960,000 to finance
project implementation between July 1975 and June 1976. Together with un-
disbursed IDA funds (US$500,000) this would ensure enough money to maintain
project activities until funds available under the second project can be
disbursed. This second project will be presented to the Board in the near
future.
Cr. 253         Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective November 30, 1971;
Closing [ate: October 1, 1976
All components except the University Institute of Technology (IUT)
have been implemented. This item is expected to be completed shortly.
Delay has been due largely to technical problems. A cost overrun of about
US$500,000 on the project as a whole is anticipated, which the Government will
finance.
Cr. 254         Terres Neuves Settlement Project; US$1.35 Million
Credit oi- June 18, 1971; Effective January 31, 1972;
Closing I)ate: December 31, 1977
The project's settlement program was completed in 1974 as antici-
pated at appraisal. The project has been successful in providing higher in-
comes than expected for settlers and has attracted families with more adult
workers than anticipated in 1974. 300 families have been settled as envi-
saged and there are about 2,300 people in the six settler villages. There
are adequate water supp:Ly facilities and the necessary social infrastructure
is being completed. Adequate and evenly distributed rainfall ensured good
crops during the last seasons. Societe des Terres Neuves (STN) (the State
Corporation in charge o:E the project) is taking measures to solve the major
problems relating to financial management, audit and project monitoring.
The credit is expected to be fully disbursed in the near future.

Cr. 314/Ln. 835      Second Railway Project:   US$3.2 Million and
US$6.4 Million Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972;
Effective December 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1976
The original project was substantially modified to reduce track
renewal works in favor of funds for spare parts for track laying and mainte-
nance equipment and for locomotives. By the end of 1975, US$6.0 million had
been disbursed out of the total Loan/Credit of US$9.6 million; track renewal
had been completed, as well as procurement for workshop rehabilitation and
orders had been placed for all track equipment and spare parts for locomo-
tives under the project; bids for the civil works to rehabilitate the work-
shops had been submitted and were being analyzed. In recent months, as a
result of sustained efforts by supervision missions, the railway has been
granted financial autonomy, locomotive availability has been increased result-
ing in a higher carrying capacity, and steps have been taken to strengthen
technical assistance. Much improvement is still needed, however, in manage-
ment efficiency, and a proposed Third Railway Project, scheduled for FY 1977,
will focus on this. A drop in international traffic (end of the Mali drought
relief program) and in phosphate traffic (slump in world phosphate market) has
weakened railway finances.
Cr. 336              Site and Services Project; US$8.0 Million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Effective August 31, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Progress in project execution continues to improve, although at a
slow pace. The absence of a program of community development activities
is critical at this juncture and considered fundamental in the promotion of
a viable community. Thus, a second and follow-up project, has been outlined
aimed essentially at filling this vacuum. Sales contracts for about 1,200
plots have been signed. Plot occupation cannot occur before June 1976, be-
cause of delays in physical works. A further complication is the absence of
a credit line for housing and materials to the project population. Civil
works are proceeding on the second tranche and expected to begin in July 1976
on the third and fourth tranches. Work on the Thies site is expected to begin
in January 1977. With the reduction of the IDA disbursement percentage from
67% to 45%, sufficient funds are available to execute two of the three tranches
in the Thies component. The OHLM staffing situation has significantly improved,
and the transfer of responsibilities to a counterpart team almost completed.
The project will continue to receive close supervision to ensure a reasonable
pace of implementation.

Ln. 866              Telecommunications Project; US$6.25 Million Loan of
December 19, 1972; Effective June 5, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
Large cost overruns have raised the cost of this project from
US$8.9 million at appraisal to US$19.9 million according to recent estimates.
A co-financing formula was successfully worked out which included a loan from
the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of US$4 million,
new French suppliers' credits of US$4 million, and an increased contribution
from our borrower, Office des Postes et Telecommunications du Senegal (OPTS).
The new financial package! and conditions of the CCCE loan were accepted by the
Senegalese Government ancl the agreement would enable the project to be com-
pleted as originally appraised. However, recently OPTS has been informed
that the Government intends to levy an income tax on OPTS's profits from
operations in FY 1975 anc[ also for previous years. OPTS has never before
been subject to tax. This change of policy towards the OPTS is causing doubts
about the financing plan drawn up at the time the CCCE loan was negotiated.
These matters are being discussed with the CCCE and the Government.
Ln. 867              Airport Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of December 19, 1972;
Effective May 22, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
All project work was completed, the runway in full operational serv-
ice and the loan fully di'sbursed by the end of January 1976. The total cost
of the project did not exceed the CFA franc costs made at appraisal although
the devaluation of the US dollar resulted in the proceeds of the Bank loan fi-
nancing a smaller percentage of the works than originally contemplated.
Cr. 350              River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million Credit of January 9,
1973:: Effective June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977
Procurement has; been completed for the main components of the project
and contracts have been awarded. Construction of works is progressing satis-
factorily. The Senegalese authorities requested that the Debi/Lampsar compo-
nents of the project be deleted from Credit-350-SE and be reformulated within
the broader framework of integrated development of the Senegal River Basin.
The proposed reformulation was agreed upon by IDA and an engineering project
for Debi/Lampsar was appraised in December 1974 and approved by the Board
in April 1975. Because of price increases, US dollar devaluation and addi-
tional works, the proceeds of Credit 350-SE will not be sufficient to complete
the projects, despite the deletion of the Debi/Lampsar component. The proj-
ect authority SAED (Societe d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres du
Delta), is presently seelcing supplementary financing from Government of about
US$3.6 million to complel:e the project.

1973; Effective November 28, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
Implementation of the maintenance program and engineering studies
started about six months behind schedule and execution at the beginning was
slow but has improved since 1975. Engineering studies for the next phase of
pavement strengthening were completed during the first half of 1975. Work
on pavement strengthening began in February 1975, about 18 months later than
appraisal estimates. The pavement strengthening component originally com-
prising 109 km of road rehabilitation had to be reduced to 35 km due to higher
construction costs than expected at appraisal, changes in the exchange rate of
the US dollar and the shifting of funds from pavement strengthening to higher
priority road maintenance.
Cr. 404              Second Agriculture Credit Project; US$8.2 Million Credit
of June 25, 1973; Effective November 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The 1974/75 campaign was good: groundnut and cereal production
(1.0 million and 0.7 million tons, respectively) reached their highest levels
since 1969. Demand for short and medium-term credit under the 1975/76 campaign
remained stronger than anticipated, but available credit funds were sufficient
to cover requirements for this campaign, the output of which is expected to be
even higher than that of 1974/75. Government has eliminated the subsidy on some
farm implements and reduced the subsidy on fertilizers from about 70% to 60% of
actual cost. However, the on-going study on fertilizer applications financed
under the Credit should provide a basis for policy review. Major organizational
and financial problems still exist at ONCAD despite technical assistance pro-
vided since 1969. Steps taken by Government in early 1975 to remedy this
serious situation--maintaining staff level, giving ONCAD management more fi-
nancial autonomy and strengthening it with qualified accountants--resulted in
some improvement, especially in accounting. However, ONCAD's overall per-
formance has not improved and the organization remains overstaffed. ONCAD
credit requirements attained record levels, partly because of accumulating
operating losses but mainly because of the large groundnut and millet stocks
and prolonged prefinancing for Government's account.

The project consists of carrying out the following studies to deter-
mine the feasibility of a dry dock project:
a.   Technical studies including those of physical and
geophysical factors affecting site selection.



ANNEX II

and a survey formulating a training program.
The studies have now been completed; they indicate low economic and financial
returns, and a relatively high market risk. The Government is exploring pos-
sible financing and ways of reducing the market risk.
Cr. 446              Drought Relief Project; US$3.0 Million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effective February 5, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the Senegalese plan to rehabilitate people in
drought affected areas by assisting them to redevelop and improve their farms
and lands. Operations, including strengthening of health and water supply
services, have been proceeding satisfactorily and the project is expected to
be completed on schedule.
Ln. 987              SOFISEDIT Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of May 24, 1974;
Effective November 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978
SOFISEDIT was created by the Government in March 1974 for the pur-
pose of providing long-term financing for industry and tourism development.
To recruit the initial staff and to find office space took several months and
the company did not start operations until November 1974. During its first
fiscal year of operations which ended September 30, 1975, SOFISEDIT approved
nine loans totaling US$2.4 million and three equity investments for a total
of US$320,000.   The loan to SOFISEDIT is expected to be fully committed by
the end of 1976 and a second project was appraised in December 1975.
Cr. 530              Seccind Education Project;  US$15.0 Million Credit of
February 19, 1975; Effective April 22, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project management unit has been strengthened and is function-
ing well. Design work on the four lower secondary schools is well advanced
and is proceeding satisfactorily in the case of the lower secondary science/
technology centers. Construction at the Dakar Industrial Worker Upgrading
Center has begun and a tender has been issued for the National Marine Training
School. Equipment lists and bills of quantities of construction materials for
the nonformal rural youth training program have been approved by IDA. The
Hotel/Tourism Training Center is delayed due to prolonged contract negotiations
between the Government and the selected architectural consulting firm. Also the
Government has yet to complete the terms of reference for a preinvestment study
of primary education.

Description:             The project would assist some 30,000 livestock owners
in Eastern Senegal to increase their incomes and
living standards through the development and operation
of a controlled grazing scheme and the provision of
effective animal health, extension and credit services.
The project would be carried out over the five-year
period, mid-1976 mid-1981, and would include:
(a) Developing and operating a grazing scheme
on about 1.4 million ha of understocked
grazing land in the northern part of Eastern
Senegal, involving principally:
(i) organizing some 6,500 predominantly
pastoralist families into about 65
grazing units to whom exclusive rights
to land and watering facilities would
be granted;
(ii) constructing about one hundred wells
45 to 75 m deep, and about 2,400 km
of firebreaks;
(iii) granting up to 300 credits to herders
for the purchase of breeding animals,
500 credits for supplementary feed
(cottonseed) and 30 credits for ox-
drawn carts and small farm equipment;
(b) Improving animal health services throughout
Eastern Senegal;
(c) Providing fellowships and opportunities for
visits to livestock development projects abroad
for Senegalese graduates, project staff and

Procurement
Arrangements:                  Well development (US$4.1 million) would be
financed by the Kuwait Fund with procurement in
line with Kuwait Fund procedures. Firebreaks
development (US$1.6 million) would be financed
by BADEA with procurement in line with BADEA
procedures. All other procurement would be
according to IDA guidelines. Contracts in
excess of US$50,000 for buildings (US$0.7
million), and vehicles and equipment (US$0.6
million) would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding; and contracts for
less than US$50,000 would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally.
Goods manufactured locally would be allowed a
preference of 15% or the level of applicable
import duty, whichever is lower, when comparing
domestic and foreign bids. Contracts of over
US$10,000 (US$0.5 million) for the construction
of vaccination yards and extension outposts and
the purchase of motor-cycles for extension
officers would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally. The
balance of equipment purchases of furniture for
the staff houses and office furnishings and
small equipment would be in small lots of less
than US$10,000 each (aggregating US$0.2 million)
and would be made locally following quotations
obtained from suppliers. The services of
internationally recruited staff and consultants,
costing about US$1.0 million, would be obtained
in accordance with procedures acceptable to
IDA. The remainder of the project costs would
be for local salaries and allowances (US$1.3
million) and for general operating expenditures
(US$1.6 million).
Consultants:                   Total consultants' services would amount to 25
