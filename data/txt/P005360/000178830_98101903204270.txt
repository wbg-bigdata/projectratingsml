SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Second Agricultural Credit Project for
which an IBRD loan of US$24 million and an IDA credit of US$10 million
equivalent are proposed. The First Credit Project (Loan 433-MOR, US$10 million)
was a 3-year agricultural development project, completed in 1969, with a
total cost of about US$26 million, covering medium- and long-term loans to
farmers and institutions, for machinery and equipment, and processing and
storage facilities, to help improve agricultural productivity. This second
Project, a 3-year development program, would finance medium- and long-term
investments for mechanization of grain farms (where productivity is currently
very low); development of citrus and winter vegetables, dairy and cattle/
sheep operations; and provision of marketing facilities. Agriculture is the
most important sector of the Moroccan economy, providing employment for
about 60% of the active population, accounting for 28% of GDP and contributing
54% of export receipts. Accordingly, Government continues to give high
priority to its development including the diversification of agricultural
production and production of export oriented crops. The Project aims at
assisting this development process. The Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole
(CNCA) would be the borrower of the Bank loan and be responsible for Project
administration. Government would be the borrower of the IDA credit.
ii.       Estimated cost of the Project is US$69 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$34 million (49%), which would be met by the
proposed loan/credit. The Bank loan would be extended to CNCA at 7.25%
interest per annum and would be repaid in 15 years including 4 years of
grace, while the IDA credit would be passed on to CNCA as capital. Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk. Farmers and other borrowers would
contribute 30% of the cost. CNCA would contribute the balance of 21%. Terms
of loans to farmers and other borrowers would vary from 4 years for winter
vegetables to 12 years for citrus development. CNCA would ensure that bor-
rowers received adequate seasonal credit to enable them to obtain full
benefit from their investments. All borrowers having a fiscal income of
DH 6,000 and above, and those obtaining loans for mechanization under the
Project, would be charged 8% per annum, while those having a fiscal income
of less than DH 6,000 would be charged 6.5%. About 53% of Project costs
would be for grain farm equipment; 22% for citrus plantations; 13% for
winter vegetable production; 10% for dairy, beef cattle and sheep operations;
and the rest (2%) for marketing facilities. Project loans for marketing
facilities above US$110,000 equivalent would be submitted to the Bank/IDA for
approval. CNCA has competent management. Its financial situation was not
entirely satisfactory but some corrective measures have been taken and arrange-
ments are satisfactory for effective Project implementation.
iii.      The range of items to be financed under the Project is varied,
the quantities to be procured by individual farmers are small and not
suitable for bulk procurement, and the farmers' own choice is essential.



- ii -
A sufficient number of Moroccan and foreign firms are represented, assuring
satisfactory competition.  Procurement would therefore be through normal
commercial channels, as in most agricultural credit projects. Tariffs
and other taxes account for about 12% of tractor costs and 22% of combine
costs.
iv.       The Project would expand financial support for farmers in the
modern sector and would assist farmers of agrarian reform cooperatives to
make the transition from the traditional to the modern sector. By encouraging
investment and modernization it would help accelerate growth in agricul-
ture, which for the past decade has grown more slowly than other sectors.
The incremental production generated by the Project would increase (a) cereal
and milk production for import substitution; (b) beef and mutton supplies
for the expanding local demand; and (c) fruit and winter vegetable supplies
for export. At full production it would improve Morocco's annual balance of
payments position by an estimated US$24 million.
v.        The investments under the Project are technically feasible,
with financial rates of return ranging from 20% to 43%. The economic rate
of return of the Project as a whole would be 18%. The Project is suitable for
a Bank loan of US$24 million repayable over 15 years, including 4-years grace,
and an IDA credit of US$10 million on IDA's usual terms.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1965, IBRD agreed to lend US$10 million to the Caisse Nationale
de Credit Agricole (CNCA), which is a statutory body responsible for agri-
cultural credit, to help finance a 3-year development project, costing
about US$26 million. The project (Loan 433-MOR) included medium-and long-term
loans to farmers and institutions for on-farm machinery and equipment, pro-
cessing and storage facilities. The Loan became effective in February 1966,
and despite difficulties and temporary suspension in 1968 (para 2.19), was
fully disbursed by September 1969 (for further details, see paras 2.16 to
2.20).
1.02      Apart from the above loan, IBRD has made two irrigation loans to
the agricultural sector: Loan 389-MOR (1965), Sidi Slimane for US$17.5
million; and Loan 643-MOR (1970), Sebou for US$46.0 million.  The Sidi
Slimane project was satisfactory for civil works and agricultural production
but difficulties arose with regard to management and coordination. For the
Sebou project, US$5.4 million had been disbursed by the end of April 1972.
Construction of the dam is progressing satisfactorily, but the implementation
of some other parts of the project, particularly land consolidation, reorgani-
zation and redistribution, is somewhat slower than orginally expected.
1.03      The FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program helped CNCA prepare this Second
Agricultural Credit Project and in October 1970, CNCA asked for a loan of
US$34 million towards financing it. This report is based on the findings of
an appraisal mission to Morocco in November/December 1970, consisting of
Messrs. von Oppenfeld and Stoneham (IBRD) and Messrs. Rava and Doreau
(Consultants), and an updating mission in April 1972, consisting of Messrs.
von Oppenfeld (IBRD) and Dockx (Consultant).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Kingdom of Morocco has a population of about 15.5 million,
growing at a rate of 2.6% a year over the last 10 years. Most of its total
land area (440,000 km2) is mountain, forest and desert, and only 17% is
cultivahle. Seventy percent of the people.live in rural areas, while
Moroccan urban population is heavily concentrated in the six cities with
populations in excess of 100,000: Casablanca, Marrakech, Fez, Rabat, Meknes
and Tangier.  In 1971 the per capita GDP was US$242.



2.02      Following the period 1960-1966 during which GDP in real terms
rose by 2.7% a year, it rose by 5.8% in 1966-1971 and a growth of at least
5% is estimated for 1972. Agriculture, which employs 60% of the labor
force and still accounts for the largest component (28%) of GDP and contributes
the major share of export earnings, remains the keystone of the Moroccan
economy. Annual fluctuations in the volume of crops, largely influenced by
rainfall, have pronounced repercussions on the entire economy and its rate of
growth. Government policies aim to reduce the dependence of agriculture on
climatic conditions by promoting irrigation, use of fertilizers and soil
conservation. Aside from agriculture, public investment has, in recent years,
concentrated on transport, mining and power, while private investment has
mainly gone into construction, tourism and industry.
2.03      Fundamental economic problems include the fast rate of growth of
population and labor force in relation to the growth of employment oppor-
tunities and the slow rise in agricultural production, particularly in the
predominantly traditional areas. The average annual growth of agricultural
output from 1963 to 1971 was 3.2%, thus lagging behind that of the overall
economy.
B. Agriculture
2.04      A detailed background to agriculture is in Annex 1.  While about
17% (7.7 million ha) of the total land area is cultivable, only three-fourths
of the cultivable area is in use in any one year, due to the extensive
alternate year cropping system, which keeps over 2 million ha in temporary
fallow. Major farm areas are between the Atlantic coast and the Atlas and
Rif mountains within the zone that receives from 400 to 600 mm of annual
rainfall. Climate is Mediterranean in the north, becoming increasingly arid
towards the south. In the extreme south and east of the Atlas, the desert
climate limits land use to oasis-type cultivation and extensive stock breed-
ing. As in the other countries of North and Northwest Africa, Morocco's
annual agricultural production is heavily dependent on the weather. There
was a record harvest in 1968, and above average harvests from 1969 through
1971.
2.05      The principal reason for the slow rate of growth in agriculture is
low productivity of cereal and livestock farms in the subsistence-oriented
traditional sector. In addition, Government's concentration on major
irrigation works (60% of agricultural investment over the last decade) has
not yet resulted in substantial production increase, partly because of the
time lag between construction of major works and on-farm development, and
partly because of the difficult task of inducing traditionally oriented
farmers to change to modern crop regimes. More recently Government has
succeeded in stepping up the pace at which irrigated land is levelled and
equipped. It has also concentrated technical services under a coordinated
program in newly irrigated areas (Annex 1, paras 9 to 12). Major crops are
cereals (particularly wheat and barley), citrus, sugar beet, olives, legumes,



-3-
grapes, tomatoes and potatoes. Livestock products account for about one-third
of total agricultural production. The most important export crops are citrus,
tomatoes, other vegetables, cotton and diminishing quantities of wine.
Processed exports include canned fish, fruit and vegetable juices, dried
vegetables and cork. Over the past 5 years the value of agricultural
imports has averaged about half the value of agricultural exports. Imports
include sugar, food oil, tea, soft wheat, butter, cheese, milk and coffee.
2.06      The modern sector, which occupies about one-fifth (1.4 million
ha) of the cultivated area, produces about one half of the exports, and has
been growing at an annual rate of 9%. About half of the land in this sector
is occupied by medium- and large-scale Moroccan farmers, and one quarter by
European settlers. Of the remainder, about 250,000 ha (formerly farmed by
foreign settlers) are owned by the provincial authorities, and are scheduled
for redistribution to small Moroccan farmers in units of about 5 ha irrigated,
15 to 20 ha rainfed, in accordance with the Land Reform Act of 1966. Farmers
benefitting from the land distribution are organized in service cooperatives.
2.07      Under the current Five-Year Plan, 1968-1972, there were 4 pri-
orities within the agricultural sector: (a) intensification of production
through irrigation; (b) progressive improvement of traditional rainfed
agriculture; (c) extension of soil conservation; and (d) livestock develop-
ment. Large irrigation schemes, which account for about 60% of the planned
agricultural investment, have received the highest priority. According to
the Plan about 550,000 ha would be irrigated by the end of 1972, including
areas to be watered from major works still under construction and those re-
ceiving only intermittent irrigation from traditional schemes.
C. Agricultural Credit and Subsidies
Banking and Credit
2.08      Details of banking and agricultural credit are in Annex 2.  Commer-
cial banking is regulated by a 1967 decree, administered by the Minister of
Finance through the Bank of Morocco (Central Bank). There are 18 commercial
banks and some 8 specialized institutions for financing industry,
agriculture, tourism and commerce. Of these, the Banque Nationale pour le
Developpement Economique (BNDE), which finances industrial development, has
received 5 loans from IBRD, totalling US$117 million.
2.09      At the end of 1971 total outstanding bank credit was DH 3.3 billion
(US$716 million) of which about 70% came from commercial banks and the rest
from the specialized institutions. Of the total, about three-fourths was
short-term (less than a year). Credit to industry was 44% of the total,
to commerce 21%, and to agriculture about 17%, with smaller proportions for
hotels and transport.



-4-
Agricultural Credit Background
2.10      By the early 1960's the complex agricultural credit system had
deteriorated to such an extent that in 1962 Government established a new
system under which CNCA was set up and became the principal credit source
for commercial farmers (Annex 3), while small farmers (those with an annual
taxable income 1/ of less than DH 1,400) continued to obtain their credit
through Societes de Credit Agricole et de Prevoyance (SOCAP). SOCAP advances
have been designed to assist subsistence farmers. The more important credit
sources at present are CNCA (on its own and government account), commercial
banks, suppliers and equipment dealers. At village level moneylenders and
merchants remain a substantial source of seasonal credit, but its magnitude
is unknown.
2.11      In mid-1967 Government set up Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole
(CLCA) to provide both seasonal and longer term credit to farmers with an
annual fiscal revenue of between DH 1,400 and DH 4,000 under simplified
procedures, which did away with individual appraisal of loan applications.
CNCA was appointed to operate CLCA. In addition, CNCA is financing farms
taken over from foreign settlers and (since 1966) managed by the provincial
governments.
Impact of Credit
2.12      At the end of 1971 agricultural credit outstanding for production
and marketing through CNCA and the commercial banks was about DH 597 million,
of which about 73% was seasonal. CNCA's share was about DH 340 million
(57%), of which just over half was seasonal.
2.13      The principal credit institutions together made about 230,000 farm
loans in 1971. The institutions involved were: SOCAP and CLCA reaching
about 208,000 small farmers; the Centres de Mise en Valeur in irrigated areas,
reaching about 60,000 farmers; and CNCA lending to about 12,000 or 32% of
38,000 farmers whose farms generally range from 5 to 50 ha of irrigated land
or 15 to 200 ha of dry land, with a fiscal revenue above DH 4,000. To make
additional farmers eligible for its loans, CNCA has recently instructed its
branches to approve loans to farmers whose fiscal revenue exceeds DH 3,000,
if their individual farm plans meet the essential criteria of loan appraisal.
Interest Rates
2.14      Annual interest rates for agricultural credit loans vary from
3% through SOCAP, 4% seasonal and medium-term through CLCA, to 6%
seasonal and 6.5% medium- and long-term through CNCA 2/. Commercial banks
1/   Taxable income is the assessed amount of a farmer's income for taxation
purposes. In very general terms, it currently averages around 40% of
his annual gross income, but there are marked variations in different
districts.
2/   Medium-term:  1 to 5 years; long-term:  over 5 years.



-5-
charge around 8% for seasonal loans, and do not usually finance longer
term. These rates compare with 7% charged by BNDE for industrial development
loans 1/, 6.25% (discountable) to 7.75% (non-discountable) by banks for
commercial credit, and from about 8% to 12% for advances against goods.
In 1969, the estimated weighted average interest rates charged by the
specialized banks was 5.7%, by the commercial banks 7.1%, and by all banks
(excluding the Bank of Morocco) 6.8%. The basic discount rate is 3.5% per
annum, but CNCA enjoys a special rate of 3%.
Subsidies
2.15      Under the Agricultural Investment Code of 1969, subsidies are
given for fertilizer, farm machinery, forage production, selected wheat seeds,
and for plantations, with minor amounts for on-farm improvement, draft
animals and equipment, aimed especially to improve the traditional rainfed
agriculture. They can be given to owner and tenant farmers and to groups
of farmers 2/, and vary from 10% for machinery to 60% for selected seeds.
Subsidy payments 1968 through 1971 are shown in Annex 1, page 6. Subsidies
for mechanization would, to a large extent, offset import duties and other
taxes levied on farm machinery.
D. Evaluation of First Credit Project
The First Project
2.16      The project was a 3-year development program by CNCA costing
DH 130 million (US$26 million), of which DH 30 million was to be financed
by participating farmers. The lending program (DH 100 million) consisted
of Part (A) on-farm development (DH 60 million) involving land improvement,
farm buildings, machinery and plantation development, and processing and
storage facilities; and Part (B) farm machinery and equipment (DH 40
million) for the Centrale de Gestion des Exploitations Agricoles (CGEA),
the agency then responsible for managing more than 200,000 ha of land taken
over from European settlers. The Loan became effective in February 1966.
2.17      Part (A) was intended to encourage on-farm development in the
private sector, where productivity had been stagnating, and to strengthen
CNCA's ability to meet agricultural credit needs. Part (B) was to enable
1/   These rates were 8% from July 1, 1971 and 9% from January 1, 1972.
2/   Mainly "groupements de mecanisation", consisting usually of 5 to 10
farmers forming a group to purchase a tractor or combine. The group
is registered with the Ministry of Agriculture, has legal status, and
is required to keep financial records and machinery log books. Groups
also include agrarian reform cooperatives formed under the land reform
and settlement programs resulting from the Land Reform Act of 1966
(para 2.06).



- 6 -
CGEA state farms to replace their worn-out farm machinery. European settlers,
expecting their departure, had not maintained and replaced their equipment.
Since CGEA farms included Morocco's most fertile land, maintaining its pro-
ductivity through equipment renewal was of high priority.
2.18      Initial progress of the project was disappointing.  On-farm invest-
ment loans (Part A) lagged behind schedule, mainly because CNCA's shortage
of qualified personnel and successive changes in its management had resulted
in inadequate contact at the farm level. Moreover, substantial changes had
occurred in credit policy and programs, seriously affecting CNCA's financial
soundness. Loans outside the project (at 4% interest) were disbursed through
newly established branches of CLCA without on-farm appraisal, although
approved by local loan committees. These changes, on which IBRD had
not been consulted, had adverse effects on CNCA's staff and financial
resources.
2.19      Investments under Part (B) were made on schedule and 90% of
this loan portion was disbursed as of December 31, 1967. However, CGEA
had been dissolved as of November 1967, without prior notification to IBRD
and its assets were transferred to provincial authorities. Because of
these developments, the unused balance of Part (B) was cancelled and further
withdrawals under Part (A) were suspended (February 1968). IBRD
recommended that CLCA's operations be separated from those of CNCA, both in
staffing and financing, and that CNCA be paid a fee to operate CLCA. After
the Minister of Finance agreed to the separation and CNCA agreed to revise
its lending program, update its accounts and strengthen its staff, Part (A)
of the loan was reinstated. The Loan was fully disbursed by September 1969.
Since the reinstatement, CNCA's management and operations have improved
considerably, and this has been the main benefit of the project.
Impact
2.20      Available data permit only limited quantifiable evaluation of the
project's impact on development. Data furnished by CNCA are based on case
studies rather than on representative sample surveys. For on-farm invest-
ments which had not yet reached full development (mainly plantations) CNCA
could merely assume standards of performance observed elsewhere. A summary
of developments financed under the Project is in Annex 3, Table 7. The
three principal development categories were:

Total             4,270         96.1
Based on its case studies and other observations, CNCA estimates that the
value added from the project during the 1969 crop season was of the order
of DH 20-25 million. Despite reservations about CNCA's sampling, this
estimate of the project's impact is considered reasonable. Under the
proposed second Project, arrangements are being made for more systematic
procedures to estimate the impact of investments under the Project.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
3.01      The Project, which would be part of CNCA's lending program and
would be administered by CNCA, is the development of farm enterprises
selected because of their development potential and priority. It would
help finance, over 3 years, farmers' investments in: grain farm
development in rainfed areas through provision of tractors and harvesting
machinery; citrus development through groundwater and plantation development;
winter vegetable production through land and groundwater development; livestock
development including dairy, beef cattle and sheep fattening; and packers'
marketing facilities mainly for export produce. The Project would involve
about 8,000 loans to individual farmers, contractors and farmer groups.
Farms receiving loans would generally range in size from 5 to 50 ha of irrigated
or from 15 to 200 ha of dry land, as indicated in paragraphs 3.04 to 3.08.

B. Detailed Features
Grain Farm Equipment
3.03      Grain farmers investing in tractors and harvesting machinery
would be concentrated in rainfed regions averaging at least 400 mm of
annual rainfall, located mainly between the Atlas mountains and the Atlantic
Ocean (see Map). Their main crops would be hard and soft wheat, barley and
pulses, alternating with fallow in marginal rainfall areas. There is a
substantial demand for farm machinery among these farmers which would come
from three main farmer categories: (a) those shifting from animal-drawn to
mechanized equipment; (b) those whose need for mechanized cultivation and
harvesting has outgrown the capacity of the Government's tractor stations
to satisfy the growing demand for custom services; and (c) those needing
replacement equipment. The selective use of power equipment is especially
advantageous when associated with the other improved practices that would
be employed under the Project: use of high-yielding wheat seed, increasing
use of fertilizer and chemical weed control.



- 9 -
3.04      About 3,500 tractors with suitable attachments and about 370 grain
harvesters and 90 balers would be financed. Tractor loans, averaging about
DH 27,000, are generally given to farms of from 50 to 150 ha; harvester loans
averaging about DH 49,000 to farms of about 200 ha with evidence that (with
custom services) about 400 ha would be harvested annually. Employment effects
of mechanization are further discussed in Chapter VI. Annex 4 gives further
details on mechanized grain farming.
Citrus Development
3.05      Development would be concentrated near Agadir, El Jadida,
Casablanca, the Gharb, Marrakech, Tada and Oujda. Some groundwater
development would be necessary in all areas not served by irrigation. About
7,000 ha of citrus would be planted; mainly "Clementines" (50 to 60%), late
maturing Navel and Valencia oranges (about 30%), and other promising export
varieties. About 360 farmers are expected to plant an average of 20 ha each
(range 5-50 ha), either for expansion of existing orchards or for establishment
of new plantations. Farmers would intercrop vegetables among young citrus
trees to help offset the high investment cost before the trees begin to bear.
Loans would average about DH 138,000 each, and would cover land and groundwater
development, planting materials, fertilizer, pesticides, machinery and labor.
Annex 5 gives details about the citrus industry.
Winter Vegetable Production
3.06      Development would be concentrated in the same areas as for citrus.
About 750 farmers would develop an average of about 12 ha each (range 4-20
ha) for intensive, export-oriented vegetable production. Loans would
average about DH 38,000 each, and would cover land and groundwater development
and mechanized equipment. Background about vegetable production and
marketing is at Annex 6.
Dairy Development
3.07      Development would be mainly near Casablanca, Kenitra, Marrakech
and Oujda. Loans would be made to about 150 farmers already established
on rainfed grain farms, and would cover: (a) pump irrigation (except
in areas already irrigated) on about 12 ha to ensure year-round supply of
forage (alfalfa, bersim, sudan grass), which would be planted to match
the herd build-up from about 12 to 20 dairy cows: (b) barn construction,
including watering and milk handling facilities; (c) forage harvesting
attachments for existing tractors; and (d) purchase of about 12 in-calf
heifers. About 900 of the 1,800 heifers required would be imported.
Loans would average about DH 48,000 each. Background about the dairy indus-
try is at Annex 7.
Beef Cattle and Sheep Fattening
3.08      Development would be over a wide area, including some mountainous
regions. Loans would be made to about 2,900 established grain farmers with



- 10 -
at least 15 ha of dry land and would cover construction or improvement of
fattening stables, including watering facilities. Loans would average about
DH 5,600 each. Purchase of feeder cattle and sheep would be outside the
Project, and would be financed by short-term loans from CNCA. Annex 8 gives
further details about production and marketing.
Marketing Facilities
3.09      Present facilities for pre-packaging, conditioning and packaging
are owned and operated by individuals, consortia of growers (cooperatives),
and commercial packers. There is a need in some areas for further capacity
for sorting, grading and packaging of citrus, tomatoes and other vegetables,
both for export and for sale in the larger urban areas. Although CNCA has
previously made loans for such facilities, it is difficult to estimate the
size and nature of future requirements and CNCA's experience in evaluating
them is limited. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that where
the total loan exceeded US$110,000 equivalent, the application, with CNCA's
technical and financial appraisal, would be referred to IBRD for its prior
concurrence.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Project Cost
3.10      Total Project cost is estimated at DH 320 million (US$69 million),
of which 49%, DH 157 million (US$34 million), would be foreign exchange, as
follows:

Estimates are based on present prices allowing for a 10% cost increase. All
figures are rounded.
Financing
3.11      Of the total Project cost, US$24 million would be financed by a
Bank loan and TJS$10 million by an IDA credit.  The loan/credit of DH 157 mil-
lion (US$34 mdllion), /49% ' f Project eo.  would cover the estimated foreign
exchange component.  Farmers end commercial packaging firms would contribute
an average of 30%, and the remainder, PH 67 million, about 21%, would be
financed by CNCA. The financing of individual components would be as follows:

CNCA would be the borrower of the Bank loan and Government of the IDA credit.
Government would carry the foreign exchange risk of the loan/credit.  Loans
to farmers would be repayable over periods ranging from 4 to 12 years, i.-
cluding 1 to 6 years of grace (para 4.19). With loans commencing in
3 successive years, the last repayments to CNCA would be 15 years after
the Project's start, which would enable CNCA to repay the Bank loan within
the same period, with 4 years of grace (Annex 3, Table 9). Government



- 12 -
would transfer the IDA credit to CNCA as capital. Assurances on the foregoing
were obtained during negotiations. If demand for credit under any of the
above categories should decrease, the amounts no longer required would, in
agreement with IBRD/IDA, be reallocated to other categories. The proposed
transfer of the IDA credit would pass on to CNCA the principal benefit of
the IDA credit and would enable CNCA to use farmer repayments for relending
for similar operations.
Seasonal Credit
3.12      For a successful Project, farmers and groups obtaining medium- and
long-term credit must be assured of adequate seasonal credit. This would be
obtained through CNCA's existing seasonal credit program which is
satisfactory.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.13      The range of items to be financed is varied, and the quantities to be
procured by individual farmers are small and would not be suitable for bulk
procurement. Farmers would purchase the tractors and attachments, combines,
and pump sets of their choice through existing commercial channels. Major
farm machinery manufacturers from at least six IBRD/IDA member countries are
represented in Morocco, their prices are competitive and they have adequate
after-sale services through well established dealer networks. Tractors are
assembled locally, using a few locally manufactured parts. Most accessories
are made locally. Pump engines are imported while most pumps are made local-
ly. Duties and taxes, as percent of prices paid by farmers, range from about
12% for tractors to about 22% for grain combines. Although no difficulties
have been experienced in the past, assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that Government would continue to issue licenses for importation
of tractors, harvesting machinery and pump engines in accordance with the
needs of the Project. Farm buildings are constructed by local artisans
or contractors. Dairy development would require about 1,800 in-calf heifers
(mainly Friesian), which would be partly supplied from Government and private
dairy farms. However, not all Project requirements would be readily available
locally. Provision has therefore been made for importing about 900 heifers.
Existing livestock procurement channels are satisfactory, but assurances were
obtained during negotiations that Government would import or authorize
private dealers to obtain licenses to import about 900 in-calf heifers for
farmers obtaining dairy loans from CNCA.
Disbursement
3.14      Disbursement categories are shown in Annex 9.  While CNCA's commit-
ments under the lending program would be made over 3 years, disbursements to
borrowers would require about 3-1/2 years. Assuming a time lag of 6 months
between CNCA disbursement to borrowers and IBRD/IDA disbursements to CNCA,
Bank/IDA disbursement is expected to take about 4 years (Annex 10). IBRD/IDA
would reimburse CNCA 70% of individual subloans, against documents evidencing



- 13 -
amounts paid in respect of subloans. In addition these documents would be
accompanied by appropriate statements evidencing the purchase of the goods
and services procured by the borrowers. The IDA credit would be disbursed
before the Bank loan and would be exhausted by the end of 1973. IBRD/IDA
would reimburse CNCA up to a total of US$34 million which represents the
estimated foreign exchange cost.
E. Organization and Management
Project Administration
3.15      CNCA, assisted as required by technical officers of the Ministry
of Agriculture, would administer the Project. Coordination between them and
the other ministries and institutions concerned is adequate, both through
CNCA's Administrative Council, and more particularly through its Management
Committee (para 4.02). The latter meets at least once a week; it includes
representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture and Interior,
and the Bank of Morocco.
Groundwater Development
3.16      Ultimate responsibility for control of groundwater resources
is vested with the Ministry of Public Works. In accordance with
legislation (Dahir No. 670 of 1925), that Ministry's approval is required
for use of groundwater in excess of 200 m3 per day. Under a subsequent
decree (Arrete du MTPC of 1967), the authority for groundwater control has
been delegated to the Regional Offices of the Ministry of Agriculture
(OrMVA) in regions where major irrigation works exist. Although ORMVA
itself may not have competent hydrogeologists, it can call on those of the
Ministry of Public Works. Moreover, groundwater resources in ORMVA regions
are relatively well known. Farmers' requests for groundwater development
are generally approved within 1 or 2 months. By contrast, approval
is frequently delayed in regions not administered by ORMVA, partly because
groundwater studies have not yet been completed, partly because of staff
shortage and partly because procedures are cumbersome and time-consuming.
CNCA has made proposals for simplified procedures so as to avoid unnecessary
delays in meeting the requirements for loan approval.
IV. CAISSE NATIONALE DE CREDIT AGRICOLE (CNCA)
General
4.01      CNCA was set up by decree and started operations in 1962 to
provide credit for the promotion and improvement of agriculture and related
activities. It was also made responsible for the liquidation of the
complex credit system that preceded it. By 1972 it was providing on its
own account seasonal and longer term production credit to farmers with



- 14 -
a fiscal revenue of over DH 3,000 (US$650), cooperatives, farmer groups
and provincial governments for operation of state-owned farms. It also
makes loans to Government marketing organizations to finance surplus stocks
of agricultural produce accumulated during good harvests. Finally, CNCA
provides accounting services for SOCAP and administers 3 other Government
funds (amounting to DH 1.7 million) for distribution of fertilizer and seeds
to subsistence farmers, and seed multiplication of Mexican wheat. Additionally,
it manages the operations of the Caisses Locales (CLCA) for a fee. CNCA is
more fully described in Annex 3.
Organization and Management
4.02      CNCA is administered by a Board of Directors consisting of 22
members, with the Minister of Agriculture as President. A Management
Committee of 6 to 8 members is responsible for day-to-day management
under the overall direction of the Council. CNCA's General Manager (or his
deputy, the Secretary General) is Chairman, and members include representatives
of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture and Interior. The General Manager
is the Chief Executive (Annex 3, Appendices 1 and 2).
4.03      Under the Secretary General there are 3 main sections, dealing
with credit, finance and accounts, and technical and economic studies.  Thec.
are 17 Regional Offices, which report directly to the Secretary General. At
the end of 1967, total staff was 227, of which just over half were in the
Regional Offices, but there was a serious shortage at senior management and
the higher administrative and technical levels. In December 1967, after
IBRD had pointed out the inefficiency arising from this shortage, CNCA
recruited further staff. By 1971 management had improved considerably.
Total staff was 487 and the members in the senior grades, mostly well
qualified, had increased fourfold.
Resources
4.04      Up to 1965, CNCA's effectiveness was hampered by inadequate re-
sources. It could use the proceeds of liquidation of previous credit
institutions, but had no funds of its own, and only temporary and uncertain
access to Treasury funds and discounts with the Bank of Morocco. In mid-
1965, after negotiations for Loan 433-MOR, its capital structure was strength-
ened to include equity capital and increased access to Treasury and Bank of
Morocco funds.
4.05      As of August 31, 1971, CNCA's total resources (including those of
CLCA and other Government accounts) were about DH 365 million, of which
about 36% came from capital grants and reserves, 13% from the liquidation
account (which is regarded as quasi equity), 13% long-term debt from Loan
433-MOR, and 38% short-term, mainly from rediscounts and deposits. A new
source of funds since 1970 was deposits by individuals in the rural areas,
mainly small farmers. CNCA started full banking services at 6 of its
Regional Offices and extended them to 2 additional offices in 1971. It



- 15 -
mounted publicity campaigns and, although it pays only 1.5% interest p. a.
(on sight deposits), about DII 26 million had been deposited at the end
of August 1971. CNCA expects to raise additional funds from this source
(Annex 3, Table 12).
Use of Resources
4.06      CNCA gives seasonal loans for farm inputs (mainly fertilizer and
improved seeds) and cattle fattening; and medium- and long-term loans for
purchase of farm machinery (mainly tractors and equipment, combines, pumps
and irrigation equipment), and on-farm improvements (mainly irrigation and
drainage, farm buildings and plantations).
4.07      Loans made each year increased from DH 106 million in 1967 to
DH 325 million in 1971 (Annex 3, Table 1). Over the same period, short-term
loans averaged 83% of new loans made. In 1971, loans made to farmers, farmer
groups, and cooperatives were about 57% of the total. On August 31, 1971,
total loans outstanding were DH 338 million, of which 46% were short term,
48% medium- and long-term, and the balance (6%) advances against stocks of
produce (mainly cotton, with some wheat).
Operating Results
4.08      Comparative ratios based on the financial results of the combined
CNCA and Government operations from 1967 through 1971 (Annex 3, Table 6)
show a satisfactory operating position. Administrative costs, as a percent-
age of average capital employed, have averaged 2.9% during the 3 years
ending 1971. Interest earned rose from 4.6% of average capital employed in
1967 to 5.7% in 1971, reflecting the effect of the increase in interest rates
from less than 5% to a minimum of 6% agreed by CNCA as a condition of Loan
433-MOR. The cost of CNCA's resources (mainly equity capital; rediscounting
facilities: 3%; and IBRD funds: 5.5%) was 1.9% of average capital employed
in 1971. The spread between interest earned and paid (3.8% of average
capital employed in 1971) remained high enough for CNCA to earn surpluses
on its operations, and these have been placed in reserves. The average
return on capital over the period 1967-71 has been 1.8%. CNCA's debt/equity
ratio was 1:3.9 at the end of 1971. Comparative ratios for CNCA's projected
operations, after separation from Government accounts, are shown in Annex 3,
Table 6.
Loan Recoveries
4.09      Overdue loans are charged a further 2% a year if not paid within
2 months of due date. Since 1968, CNCA has made considerable efforts to
improve loan recoveries, particularly among individual farmers. At each
Regional Office, a separate section is engaged full time in such work.
Overall recoveries on individual loans due and overdue show continuous
improvement from 68.2% in 1968 to 72.7% in 1971 (Annex 3, Table 3). The
following table shows loans to individuals overdue at the end of recent
fiscal years:

1969               12.0      2.0         2.8      5.5       22.3
1970               10.7      2.2         1.4      6.6       20.9
1971               9.6       3.3         1.2      4.9       19.0
On August 31, 1971, the accumulated sum overdue on individual loans, at DH 19
million, was approximately 10% of individual loans outstanding. As of the
same date, CNCA's provision for bad and doubtful debts was DH 10.1 million,
or about 53% of such debts. In view of CNCA's efforts to improve collections,
such provision is adequate.
4.10      CNCA's short-term loans to cooperatives have good repayment records,
well over 90% being repaid within 4 months of the harvest. Members rely on
their credit at planting time, and repayment of the previous year's loans
has high priority. The repayment position of loans to groups and for
agricultural stocks is also satisfactory, since in both cases CNCA has
adequate security and in the event of default is generally able to recover
in full.
4.11      Recoveries of CNCA's loans to provincial governments for the farms
formerly operated by European settlers (not included under para 4.09) are
unsatisfactory. These loans were made on behalf of Government but CNCA
carried the risk. As of August 31, 1971, outstanding advances were DH 71.2
million of which DH 53 million (74%) was overdue, mostly on short-term loans,
and the greater part overdue by more than 6 months. Lending to and
recoveries from provincial governments are beyond CNCA's control and CNCA
has not been able to make provisions for these loans. These and other opera-
tions on behalf of Government should therefore be administered as proposed
in paragraph 4.14.
Lending Policies and Procedures
4.12      Responsibility for loans below DH 40,000 (US$8,700) to individual
farmers is delegated to Regional Offices. When a request is received, a
technician visits the farm and verifies the information. The loan is then
referred to a regional Credit Committee and upon approval by the Regional
Office, loans are ready for disbursement. Loans above DH 40,000 require
approval by the Head Office. Details on terms, conditions and procedures
for loans to individual borrowers, farmer groups and agrarian reform
cooperatives are in Annex 3, paragraphs 18-24.  Average time from receipt of
application to approval of loan has been less than 21 days for the past 2
years, which is commendable.
Financial Reorganization and Expansion
4.13      Since its inception, CNCA has relied upon Government assistance
to finance its needs. Government forewent returns on its equity, thereby

enabling CNCA to maintain a low level of interest rates. This policy did
not do much to improve CNCA's financial position since the subsidization
implied in no-cost Government capital was passed on to the ultimate bor-
rowers. As the principal agricultural credit institution in Morocco,
CNCA should begin to introduce policies which will ensure that it becomes
a strong and viable credit institution with reasonable financial autonomy
serving agriculture on a sustained basis. This requires that its earnings
be adequate to provide for a return on equity, which should eventually enable
it to enter the capital market on a modest scale, and a reasonable level of
reserves. Since 1969 CNCA's management and operations have improved substan-
tially and it would now be in a position to make the necessary changes to
improve its financial structure and operations. The immediate requirements
are that (i) the operations CNCA is carrying out on Government behalf (SOCAP,
CLCA and provincial farms) be kept in separate accounts with all costs
accruing to CNCA chargeable to Government; (ii) CNCA's capital structure be
strengthened to cover expansion of the operations on its own account; and
(iii) its interest rates be raised.
4.14      Separation of Accounts.  To achieve the required separation of
accounts, appropriate assurances were obtained during negotiations that:
(a) CNCA would maintain accounts and prepare financial statements
reflecting separately, the resources, use of resources and
operating results of the operations administered on Government
behalf;
(b) Government would cover CNCA's expenses and losses on these
operations and compensate CNCA promptly and adequately for
administering such operations; and
(c) Government would make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank/IDA
to provide CNCA with adequate resources for CNCA's own operations
and for the credit operations carried out on its behalf.
4.15      Strengthening Capital Structure.  Once the above steps are taken,
CNCA's liquidity (and reserves) would be satisfactory. However, the increase
in CNCA's medium- and long-term lending from DH 117 million in 1972 to
DH 281 million in 1976 (Annex 3, Table 12) would require, in addition to
IBRD/IDA funds (DH 157 million), the strengthening of CNCA's capital resources.
Accordingly, assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government
would authorize CNCA to transfer DH 44 million from the liquidation account
(an account for the liquidation of operations of predecessor institutions)
to equity capital and would contribute the proceeds of the IDA credit (DH 46
million) to CNCA's capital.
4.16      Projections of income and expenditures for the overall operations
on CNCA's own account (Annex 3, Table 11) are based on a combination of
interest rates for short- and medium/long-term loans (para 4.17). Require-
ments for adequate reserves and provisions were taken into account and
assurances were obtained during negotiations that CNCA would build up
general reserves (from profits) to 15% of its equity capital by 1976.

Terms and Conditions of Project Loans
4.17      Interest rates.  Government has made credit available at preferential
rates for industry and agriculture (see para 2.14); such measures have made
it difficult to arrive at a true market rate of interest. Since 1966 interest
rates for agricultural loans have remained unchanged -- 6% for short-term
and 6-1/2% for medium- and long-term lending. Commercial banks charge
around 8% for seasonal loans and up to 12% for advances against goods.
The discount rate is 3.5%, reduced to 3% for agriculture. Despite low
interest rates, CNCA has continued to realize slight surpluses, mainly
because of the low cost of its resources and nonassumption of risks under
special programs (see para 4.08).
4.18      The interest rate to sub-borrowers should be increased to be more
in line with the cost of capital which on the basis of market rates would
appear to be at least 10%. A rate higher than the existing 6.5% on medium-
and long-term loans would be well within farmers' debt service capacity
(financial returns on Project investments range from 20% to 43%). Moreover,
the cost of CNCA's resources on its own operations is projected to increase
from 2.1% in 1971 to 2.7% by 1976 and its administrative costs, expressed as
a percent of average capital employed, would increase from 3% in 1971 to 3.4%
by 1976. Its present earnings at a rate of 6% on capital employed would
be insufficient to cover such increases (Annex 3, Table 6). On all these
considerations, a minimum rate of interest at 8% on all agricultural loans
would be justified. While accepting that an increase to 8% was justified
for the majority of its borrowers, Government felt that this would discourage
farmers in the lower income brackets from borrowing and proposed to maintain
the present interest rates for lending to farmers having a taxable revenue of
less than DH 6,000 (equivalent to a net income below US$2,500). No more
than 20% of CNCA's lending under the Project would come into this cate-
gory. With these differential rates CNCA's earnings would rise to 7.5% and
provide a 3.8% return on equity. This proposal was accepted during negotia-
tions and assurances were obtained that an interest rate of 8% for all
medium- and long-term lending would be charged to sub-borrowers having a
taxable revenue of DH 6,000 and above, and on all mechanization loans under
the Project, while subborrowers having a taxable revenue less than DH 6,000
would, as in the past, continue to pay 6-1/2%.
4.19      Borrowers' Repayment Periods.  A review of the gestation periods
of typical on-farm investments (see also farm model calculations, detailed
in Annexes 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) indicates that the following repayment periods
for loans to CNCA's borrowers would be appropriate:
Grace       Repayment        Total
Models                       Period        Period          Period

- 19 -
During negotiations assurances were obtained that for Project loans these
periods would not be exceeded.
Audit
4.20      CNCA's accounts are at present audited by 2 auditors of the
Ministry of Finance (Commissaires aux Comptes), appointed by CNCA's Board.
At the time of the first project, Government audit, associated with French
technical assistance from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(now terminated), was considered satisfactory. With the envisaged expansion
of CNCA's operations, this audit would not be adequate for financial and
managerial control. The first independent audit relating to CNCA's
accounts for fiscal year ending August 31, 1971 has been completed. For
subsequent years CNCA's accounts would be audited annually by an independent
firm of accountants.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND FARMERS' BENEFITS
A. Production
5.01      The Project would have an impact on about 370,000 ha presently cul-
tivated. Of this, about 350,000 ha would be affected by grain farm
mechanization, and pump irrigation would be provided on 15,000 to 20,000 ha
for production of citrus, winter vegetables, and dairy forage. The estimated
incremental value of annual production due to Project investments would reach
about DH 240 million (US$52 million). Individual investments are expected to
reach full production in: (a) year 3 for grain farm mechanization and beef
and sheep fattening; (b) year 5 for winter vegetables; (c) year 11 for dairy;
and (d) year 15 for citrus.
5.02      The areas affected by the Project represent about 8% of the total
area under cereals and 11% each of the areas presently under citrus and vegeta-
bles. Livestock operations under the Project would involve about 10% of the
estimated total number of dairy cows, and 2% each of the Moroccan beef
cattle and sheep population. The estimated impact on national production
levels is as follows:

- 20 -
National production of milk, beef and mutton covers only milk marketed through
urban pasteurizing plants and meat processed in Government-inspected urban
abattoirs.
B. Markets and Prices
Grain and Pulses
5.03      Annual wheat imports have averaged 400,000 tons during the last
3 years (despite the record 1968 harvest) and rose to 670,000 tons
in 1971. Wheat deficits are likely to continue for this decade. Incremental
Project output would help reduce import needs. There is a large local market
for barley, with a partial substitution for wheat imports; the occasional
surplus in some years is exported. Pulses have generally been exported,
though not in large quantities. Cereal marketing is effectively regulated
by the Office Cherifien Interprofessionnel des Cereales (OCIC), whose up-
country buying stations purchase at fixed prices (Annex 1, para 15 and Annex
4, para 7). Marketing of cereals is reasonably well organized.
Citrus and Winter Vegetables
5.04      Of the incremental Project output, annual exports of citrus
(140,000 tons) and vegetables (55,000 tons) appear substantial when related
to quantities currently exported (4-year average exports: citrus 530,000
tons, vegetables 200,000 tons). However, considering: (a) the gradual
phasing to peak output (vegetables by 1979 and citrus by 1989); (b) the rising
purchasing power and high income elasticity for citrus in European markets;
and (c) the likely improvements in transportation, coupled with Morocco's
favorable location for ocean transport, the European market should readily
absorb these quantities. While export marketing of perishable, high-priced
off-season produce is never without risk, it requires a dynamic and aggressive
production and marketing outlook. That Moroccan citrus growers have such an
outlook is demonstrated by the fact that they are already shifting decisively
to those types and varieties for which the demand is strong and growing.
Given continued quality control, Morocco should on the whole be able to
maintain its present share of 15Z in the world market for fresh citrus.
5.05      Export marketing is the responsibility of the Office de
Commercialisation et d'Exportations (OCE), which buys citrus at contract
prices fixed annually in advance of the harvest. OCE bears all costs of
export marketing. For export of vegetables, OCE acts as a commission agent,
deducting its costs from the producers' gross return. During 1969 OCE exported
citrus mainly to France (43%), Germany (19%) and the USSR and Eastern
Europe (21%); see Annex 5, Appendix 1, Table 2. The increasing local capacity
for processing (canning, freezing and drying) culls, rejects and other non-



- 21 -
exportable fruit and vegetables will provide additional outlet for this
export-oriented industry 1/.
Livestock Products
5.06      Milk output generated by the Project, increasing to 4,000 tons
annually by 1978, would reach its maximum of about 9,000 tons annually by 1983.
Estimated 1978 output represents an increase of 10% over that sold presently
in organized urban markets. Incremental milk output would help reduce
importation of milk products. Current milk marketing capacity is sufficient
to handle additional output at least until 1978. Incremental output in
carcass weight of beef (2,800 tons by 1978) and mutton (1,400 tons by 1976)
would readily be absorbed by Morocco's growing urban market, and would also
benefit tourist-oriented hotels and restaurants. Livestock markets operate
effectively, in small rural trade centers as well as large markets close to
urban abattoirs. No early increase in abattoir capacity would be required.
Prices
5.07      OCIC's current up-country buying prices for hard wheat, soft
wheat and barley (Annex 4, para 7), as well as free market prices for pulses,
provide adequate incentives to cereal producers. Although OCIC's hard wheat
and soft wheat buying prices are 6% and 11% respectively above projected 1975
world prices (CIF Moroccan port adjusted for local distribution costs), no
downward changes in farmgate prices are expected because of Morocco's
persistent wheat deficit. Barley prices are 35% above projected 1975
prices (FOB Moroccan port less local transport cost) and OCIC has incurred
losses in years when large surpluses of barley have been exported.
5.08      Export prices of citrus and vegetables have generally been high,
offering incentives for expanding output. However, Moroccan production would
still be profitable if citrus and vegetable prices were to decline by 20%
due to international competition (Annex 5, Table 1). The local demand for
milk, beef and mutton has been strong and is rising, and there is no reason
to expect more than seasonal supply/demand imbalances of milk (Annex 7).
C. Producers' Benefits
5.09      On the basis of the assumptions detailed in the 5 illustrative
farm models (Annex 4, Table 2 and Table 1 of Annexes 5, 6, 7 and 8), farm
income at full development after debt service is estimated as follows:
1/   In 1966, IFC invested US$1.4 million in a tomato paste factory (107-MORO,
Compagnie Industrielle de Lukus, SA.

5.10      Project investments would not result in substantial changes in taxes
paid by farmers on their farm property and incomes, at least not under pres-
ent tax legislation. Farmers' tax liability is based on assessed land pro-
ductivity, assuming typical land use, yield and cost averages for each region,
not on actual or declared farm income. The tax system appears to be reason-
ably well enforced and the majority of commercial farmers pay their taxes.
CNCA requires evidence of up-to-date tax payment before approving loan re-
quests. Farmers engaging in dairy, beef cattle and sheep farming will have
to pay taxes on the additional animals they keep. However, the present tax
system does not reflect changes in farmers' income. Without changes in rele-
vant tax legislation, the incremental farm income generated by Project in-
vestments will not have substantial impact on farmers' tax liabilities.
5.11      The farm models show that substantial net incremental farm incomes
would result from the proposed investments. Financial rates of return for
these best estimates range from 20% to 43%. Varied sensitivity tests were
applied to each model, assuming lower net benefit streams due to less
favorable performance in one or more factors, but financial rates remained
satisfactory in all cases.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The Project would expand financial support for commercial farmers
in the modern sector. Through loans to agrarian reform cooperatives it
would also assist farmers in making the transition from the traditional to
the modern sector. By encouraging investment and modernization it would
help accelerate growth in the agricultural sector which, for the last decade,
has grown more slowly than other sectors.



-1 23 -
6.02      Incremental production generated by the Project would:
(a)  reduce grain imports and result in annual import savings of
about DH 6.3 million (,7-;4 4lI-_I'
(b)  generate additiyna a xorz earxir   ,i o bout DH 74 million
(US$16 million) annua,ly by i80, a:d largr amounts there-
after, through increased fresh citrus and vegetable exports;
and
(c)  benefit MoroccoTs urban consumers and tourist industry through
increased availability of rept and nillk.
6.03      Overall impact on the balance of payments would be substantial.
Import substitution of cereals and exwort3 of citrus and vegetables, less
foreign exchange required for the replacement of equipment, operating cost
and debt 3ervice, would be equi7alent to net tIoreign exchange savings of
about DH 68 million in 1980, riing to 7  98 millio  (US$21 million) in
1985.
6.04      The effect of mechanical grain harve-ting on employment would
depend on the percentages of combines that would either replace existing
ones or mechanize grain harvesting in newly mechanized areas. No displace-
ment would result through replacement of existing combines, which is
estimated at 80 to 90% of combincs provided for under the Project. The
alternative of reverting to hand-harvesting on these farms must be ruled
out because the seasonal labor required for relatively short periods could
not be mobilized. The balance of combines financed under the Project (10
to 20%) which could replace traditional harvesting, would displace approxi-
mately 900 temporary 2-month jobs annually. The social cost, at market
value of the displaced labor, has been included on the cost side, together
with investment cost (less taxes) and operating coSt for the combine in
computing the economic rate of return, against net savings of 15% of grain
as the sole benefit. The economic rate (16%) indicates that harvesting
machinery would make a worthwhile contribution to the Project. Annex 4
gives further details on mechanized grain farming.
6.05      Accurate data on the net employment effect of substituting tractors
for animal power in Morocco are not available. However, a net positive ef-
fect seems more probable than net labor displacement. Some of the increased
labor requirements will take the form of increased working hours by labor
that is already employed, while some will generate opportunities for employing
additional people. Tractors reduce labor requirements for the operations of
land preparation and seeding when measured on a per unit basis (per hectare
planted or per quintal of output). However, becauce of the short period be-
tween the first rains and the latest optimal planting time, tractors permit
a substantially larger area to be planted and result in higher yields because
of much better seed-bed preparation and reduced weather risks. When these
changes in production methods are combined with the higher levels of other
inputs made possible by improved land preparation, the resulting increase in



- 24 -
activity and output tends to increase direct, on-farm labor requirements over
the cropping period. In addition, it seems probable that the net effect on
indirect employment opportunities will be positive in view of the need for
tractor maintenance and supply services, and the increased marketing activities
directly required by increased output, as well as the multiplier effects on
overall employment levels of the high level output.
6.06      Employment for about 18,000 persons would be generated through
citrus, vegetable and livestock development on about 4,000 farms, aside
from employment generated through marketing activities, especially for
exports. Additional but non-quantifiable benefits would result from the
demonstration effect on non-project farmers, and from institutional improve-
ments of CNCA. The Project would continue the process of strengthening
CNCA through complete separation of its own operations from those on
behalf of Government.
6.07      Government revenue from import duties and other taxes on mechanized
equipment would average about DH 8.8 million annually during the 3-year
investment phase, and would more than compensate for estimated annual subsidy
payments for mechanization, ranging from DH 1.9 to 2.2 million during the
same period.
6.08      The Project's overall rate of return to the economy, based on an
average life of 20 years (30 years for citrus) would be 18% if based on
present prices, or 16% if cereal prices were reduced by 10% in line with
projected 1975 world prices, adjusted for transportation and distribution
in Morocco. The sensitivity of the rate of return was tested against
changes (+10%) in investment cost, operating cost and incremental net benefit
(due to changes in yield or prices). In all cases the results were still
satisfactory (Annex 11).
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The following principal points were agreed during negotiations:
(a)  The Royal Government of Morocco would:
(i)  provide CNCA with adequate resources for
CNCA's own operations (para 4.14);
(ii) provide all necessary resources to operate the
Government Account and compensate CNCA adequately for
managing it (para 4.14); and
(iii) authorize CNCA to transfer DH 44 million from the
liquidation account and the proceeds of the IDA credit
to equity capital (para 4.15).



- 25 -
(b) CNCA would:
(i)  submit for IBRD/IDA approval loans for marketing
facilities exceeding US$110,000 equivalent (para 3.09);
(ii)  maintain accounts and prepare financial statements
reflecting separately the resources, use of resources and
operating results of the operations administered on
behalf of Government (para 4.14); and
(iii)  raise its interest rate to 8% per annum for loans to
borrowers having a taxable income (revenu fiscal) of
DH 6,000 and above and on all Project loans for mechaniza-
tion without regard to fiscal income (para 4.18).
7.02      The proposed Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$24 million,
for a term of 15 years with 4 years of grace to CNCA, and an IDA credit
to Government of US$10 million on IDA standard terms.

ANNEX 1
Page 1
MOROCCO
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL BACKGROUND
General
1.       M4orocco has a total land area of 440,000 km , of which 7.2 to 8.2
million ha (16 to 18%) are cultivable. Of this area, 60 to 66% is in cereals
and legumes, 5 to 7% in tree crops and 25 to 32% is temporarily fallow.
Fallowing is practiced to conserve moisture, but also because there is in-
sufficient draft power. In years of low rainfall, the amount of land cul-
tivated declines and the amount left fallow increases.
2.        Major farm areas are west of the Atlas and Rif mountains; in the
north, the climate is Mediterranean, increasingly arid towards the south.
East of the Atlas and in the extreme south, the climate is desert-like,
which limits land use to oasis-type agriculture and to extensive stock
breeding. Irrigation works completed or still under construction are expected
to irrigate about 550,000 ha by 1972 including areas receiving intermittent
irrigation from traditional schemes. Although lack of rainfall is the most
crucial constraint to farming in most regions, floods occur frequently; in
the Sebou region, floods caused severe crop damage over 150,000 ha in 1969/70.
Role of Aygrlture in the Economy
3.        Agriculture contributes about 26 to 31% of the GDP (about two-
thirds from crops and one-third from livestock) and 54 to 58% of annual ex-
port value. It also provides a livelihood to 70% of the population. From
1963 to 1970, agriculture grew at a slow rate of 2.8%, as compared with 3.6%
for the overall economy, mainly because of low yields in cereals in the
traditional sector (Annex 4, para 3).
Production and Trade
4.        Crop production shows some increase, especially since 1968 (Table
1). The upward trend of barley is due partly to a record crop in 1968 and
partly to Government support of prices above world prices (Annex 4, para 7).
Sugar beet production has likewise been encouraged through price incentives
and increasing availability of irrigated land, coupled with concentrated
teclhnical services. Citrus production has increased in response to favorable
export markets.
5.        Agricultural export value has shown an upward trend, mainly because
of increasing exports of citrus and vegetables, fresh, dried, canned and
frozen (Table 2). The value of agricultural imports, however, has not



ANNEX 1
Page 2
changed much. While sugar imports have declined, soft wheat imports have
increased, except in 1969, following the record 1968 grain harvest. Net
exports in 1969 nearly doubled the DH 500 million (US$110 million) average
because of the 1968 harvest and the reduced wheat imports.
Land Tenure
6.        Morocco's rural population is estimated at 10.2 million, or 2
million rural families. Assuming that 25% are landless laborers and
transient herdsmen, there would be 1.6 million farms. Pending more reliable
data from a farm census scheduled for 1972/73, farms of less than 10 ha
are estimated to account for about two-thirds of the cultivated area.
Additional land is under collective ownership, but is often cultivated by
individual farmers or tenants. The modern sector, which comprises some 1.4
million ha, produces most of the cash and export crops. About half of this
area is owned by Moroccans, one-quarter is ex-concession, Government-held
land and the remaining one-quarter is owned by foreigners.
7.        Former French concessions (lots de colonisation), originally
covering 250,000 ha, are now administered by Provincial authorities. These
lands are to be distributed (in accordance with the 1966 Land Reform Act)
in units of about 5 ha irrigated and 15 to 20 ha rainfed land, against
payment of assessed value over 20 years. From 1966 to 1968, about 24,000
ha were distributed and an additional 75,000 ha were to be assigned from
1969 to 1972. New settlers are reasonably well assisted and supervised and
are eligible for short-term credit from the Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole. After two to three years of successful farming, settler groups
(cooperatives) would also be eligible for loans under the proposed Project.
8.        Another effort towards improvement of land tenure aims at
consolidation of small holdings into economic units. Consolidation involving
about 34,000 ha is reported to have been completed in 1968 and 1969, mainly
in rainfed areas, with technical support from USAID and UNDP/FA0.
Irrigation
9.        The pace at which land irrigated from major works (Tadla, Doukkala,
Moulouya and Haouz) is prepared (leveled and equipped) for irrigation
(18,000 ha annually in 1968 and 1969) is expected to increase. The first
tranche (7,600 ha) of the Sebou project is expected to be ready for irrigation
by 1973. New irrigation schemes are being initiated or under preparation.
About 550,000 ha would be irrigated from major schemes, including 40,000 ha
to be watered from other sources.
Input Supply and Supporting Services
10.       Research.  The Institut National de Recherche Agronomique (INRA)
is responsible for agricultural research. Its achievements include success-
ful introduction of sugar beet, development of a long-staple cotton variety



ANNEX 1
Page 3
(Tadlla l6) anid disease-resistant citrus and tomato varieties. INRA hlas also
acnieved promising results in testing and adapting high-yielding Italian
and .1exican wheat varieties (Annex 4, para 4).
11.       Extension.  The Direction de la Mise en Valeur (DMV), under the
Kinistry of Agriculture, is responsible for agricultural extension, input
supply distribution and custom services for tractors and combines for
smnall farmers (Annex 4, para 16). DMV works through Centres de Mise en
Valeur (CMV) in Government irrigation schemes and through Centres de Travaux
(CT) in rainfed areas.
12.       The CMV's in irrigated areas work under favorable conditions:
soils are productive and there is sufficient water for intensive cropping;
a good infrastructure exists, including marketing facilities for industrial
crops (cotton and sugar beet) and perishables (fruit, vegetables and milk);
extension services are adequately staffed and equipped (one extension agent
to 170 farmers); and input supplies, mechanization and credit services are
readily available.
13.       The CT's, on the other hand, face a more difficult task for their
work in the rainfed areas;  farms involving about 6 million ha are widely
scattered; rainfall is low and unreliable; production possibilities are
limited; infrastructure is less well developed and many farmers are
subsistence-oriented; and the ratio of extension workers to farmers (1:1,250)
is far from adequate.
14.       Development possibilities exist, however, and Government is
beginning to formulate and implement specific improvement programs in regions
where annual rainfall exceeds 400 mm: land settlement on former French
concessions (para 7), consolidation of small holdings (para 8), and grain
farm improvement through CT centers. Like the CKV centers (para 12), the
CT centers provide input supply (including high-yielding wheat seeds) and
CT tractor services (Annex 4, para 4). Wherever feasible, Government
encourages group ownership of grain farm machinery, either through "groupe-
ments de mechanization," consisting of five to 10 farmers forming a group
to purchase a tractor or combine, or through agrarian reform cooperatives.
Throughi loans to these groups, the proposed Project would help spread the
benefits of grain farm mechanization, combined with other improvements, to
increasing numbers of small farmers.
Marketing
15.       Government regulates marketing and prices of the important commo-
dities through the following agencies:



ANNEX 1
Page 4
Office Cherifien Interprofessionnel des
Cereales                        (OCIC) : Wheat and barley
Office de Commercialisation et d'
Exportation                      (OCE) : Export marketing of
citrus, fruit, vegetables,
fish, wine and cotton
Office National du The et du Sucre  (ONTS) : Sugar beet and sugar
Cooperative Marocaine des Huileries
Alimentaires                    (CONHA) : Edible oils
16.       Although responsibilities and functions of the above named agencies
vary widely, they all direct their programs toward accomplishment of the
following guiding principles:
(a) to stabilize farm prices through up-country purchase at
fixed prices;
(b) to stabilize consumer prices through sale to trade channels
at fixed prices;
(c) to coordinate domestic production with import/export policy; and
(d) to assure repatriation of export earnings through exclusive
export rights.
While assured outlets at reasonable buying prices have generally been
advantageous to farmers, there are also conflicts between the above objectives.
Some farmers complain about lack of efficiency. Citrus and vegetable pro-
ducers especially feel that increasing involvement of the private sector
would lead to a more prudent and agressive development of export marketing.
Free and unregulated prices exist for maize, rice, pulses, livestock and
livestock products, except for government-approved contracts between farmers
and milk plants.
Taxes and Subsidies
17.       Three specific taxes, droits de douane, tax speciale and tax sur
les produits, are levied on partly or fully imported agricultural machinery.
However, tractors and attachments imported on CKD (completely knocked down)
basis and assembled with some local parts are exempted from "droits de douane."
Thus the effective tax rates on the most popular makes and models of tractors,
combines and attachments are:



ANNEX 1
Page 5
Range of Tax Rates Applicable to Farm Machinery Expressed
Either as   % of CIF Cost  or as   % of Price Paid by Farmer
Range                        Range
Tractor        16-19                         10-15
Combines       23-48                         15-28
Attachments    13-28                          8-10
Government tax revenue on a tractor-attachment unit (DH 39,000) would average
about Dli 4,500 and on a combine (DiI 70,000) about DH 14,000. Projected
average annual investment would thus generate about DH 8.8 million (US$1.9
million) government tax revenue. This does not include import duty on
pumpsets of which the engine is generally imported.
18.       On taxes levied on farm property and assumed farm income, on the
other hand, Project investment would not result in a substantial change,
at least not under present tax legislation. Farmers' tax liability is based
on assessed land productivity, taking into consideration the typical land
use and yield averages in each region, not on actual or declared farm income.
Tax payment appears to be reasonably well enforced and the majority of
commercial farmers pay their taxes. CNCA does not approve loan applications
without evidence that the farmer is not in arrears on his tax obligations.
However, the tax system takes insufficient account of changes in individual
farmers' income. Without a change in farm tax legislation, incremental
farm income generated by Project investment will not have much impact on
Government tax revenue. Farmers will pay tax on additional milk cows, beef
cattle and sheep kept on their farms. These taxes, even in the aggregate
will be negligible.
19.       New legislation on agricultural investment (Code des Investissements
Agricoles) was passed in 1969. Its policy objective is "to create the
maximumii number of viable holdings and to benefit the largest number of
families in defined irrigated and non-irrigated areas." This legislation
will eniance the shift, initiated in recent years, of development support
from government-operated ex-concession land (para 7) to the private sector.
Subsidies were paid (or budgeted) for the following purposes:

Total                14,884    18,125        12l827      15,_15
20.       The 1969 law emphasizes subsidies for mechanization.  While
nearly all farmers investing under the Project in citrus development or
mechanization would be eligible for subsidies of 10% or more of their
investment cost, budgetary constraints will not permit full payments to all
of them. Besides, the investments of farmers financed by CNCA are viable
without subsidy payments.
21.       Since the 1969 law has been effective only since mid-1970, it is
difficult to foresee the direction of its implementation. In computing the
economic rate of return it is assumed that about 25% of farmers investing
in grain farm mechanization and citrus will receive subsidy payments.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
BANKING AND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
I. COMMERCIAL BANKING AND CREDIT
Background
1.        Commercial banking and credit are regulated by a Decree of April
1967, which empowers the Minister of Finance to authorize the establishment
of banks, to determine their minimum capital, and to control banking and
credit operations.  The Minister is helped by a committee 1/, of which he
is President, and which is composed of the Governor and Vice-Governor of
the Bank of Morocco (the Central Bank), several Government officials,
directors of the specialized banks and representatives of the banking pro-
fession. The Bank of Morocco is responsible for implementing all banking,
m.onetary and credit measures, and is assisted by a banking association 2/,
in which all banks are members by law. At the end of 1969 there were 18
commercial banks operating 219 branches, of which 45 were in Casablanca.
2.        Specialized banks and financial institutions (other than commer-
cial banks) are governed by separate laws. Such banks include the Bank of
Morocco, the Caisse de Depot et de Gestion, the Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCA), the Office des Cheques Postaux, the Banque Nationale pour
le Developpement Economique (BNDE), the Credit Inmobilier et Hotelier (CIB),
the Caisse Marocaine des Marches, and the Credit Populaire.
Banking Controls
3.        Under the 1967 Decree, the Minister can determine:  (a) the maxi-
mum ratios between any two or more elements of the assets and liabilities
of each bank; (b) the ratio of short-term Government securities and of re-
serves with the Bank of Morocco to demand liabilities; (c) the minimum or
maximum maturity, volume, interest rates, and conditions for various types
of credit; and (d) the maximum or minimum conditions for holding depositors'
funds.
4.        To ensure their solvency and adequate liquidity, commercial banks
now have to have a minimum equity capital of DH 2 million; their equity,
1/   Comite du Credit et du Marche Financier.
2/   Groupement Professionel des Banques.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
reserves and undistributed profits must represent at least 5% of their
total liabilities; and their short-term assets must be at least 50% of their
short-term liabilities. To control credit to the private sector, an abso-
lute limit is placed on the short-term domestic credit which each bank can
give, but this is relaxed seasonally to help finance the marketing of agri-
cultural produce.
Credit
5.        Credit outstanding by the whole of the banking system was DH 3.3
billion at the end of 1971, of which commercial banks accounted for 70% and
the specialized banks (mainly CNCA, BNDE and CIH) 30%. Short-term credits
were 75%. The bulk of short-term credit and some medium-term came from the
commercial banks; almost all the long-term came from BNDE and CIH (for
industry, housing and hotels). Agriculture and commerce accounted for one-
fifth each of total credit outstanding, the industrial sector 44%. Most
industrial credit was short-term from the commercial banks to finance
production and marketing, but about one-tenth was medium-term. Total credit
increased at an average rate of 14% from 1965 through 1969 (10% short-term,
20% medium-term and 38% long-term).
Interest Rates
6.        Because of banking and strict exchange controls, and low
inflationary pressures, the interest rate structure has been maintained at
levels well below those in many other countries. The discount rate of the
Bank of Morocco (generally 3.5%) has not been changed since 1951. Yields
on Government bonds, held largely by banks, vary from 3.5% for one-year
bonds to 6.35% for 15-year bonds. Rates paid by banks on deposits are
correspondingly graduated to give a spread of about 0.5% between deposits
and bonds of comparable maturity. Interest rates charged by financial
institutions range from about 3% to 12%. In 1969, the estimated weighted
average annual interest rates charged by the specialized banks was 5.6%, by
the commercial banks 7.5%, and by all banks (excluding the Bank of Morocco)
6.8%. For the fifth IBRD loan to BNDE (approved on May 18, 1971), the
Government has come to the conclusion that it would be wise to raise its
lending rates to 9%.
7.        Interest rates for agricultural credit are below (para 14), and
for this particular project in the text of the appraisal report (paras 4.17
and 4.18).

II. AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
Background
8.        For some years after Independence (1956) a comprehensive and com-
plex agricultural credit system, which included commercial banks and Govern-
ment institutions, continued to provide credit mainly to the larger farmers
and agricultural companies. Small farmers obtained the bulk of their credit
through Provident and Agricultural Credit Societies (SOCAP) 1/, which were
initiated by Government. Moneylenders and merchants also provided a sig-
nificant, but unknown, proportion of credit. Dealers in agricultural sup-
plies and farm machinery, formerly important credit sources to the modern
sector, abruptly reduced their loans after Independence. Commercial banks
withdrew from agricultural lending more gradually. By the early 1960's, bad
repayment records and shortage of resources led to a deterioration of the
Government institutions, and to a marked reduction in their scale of lending.
9.        To meet this overall decline in agricultural lending, a new
credit system was established in 1962, under which CNCA (described more
fully in Annex 3) became the principal credit source, although SOCAP was
retained for credit to smaller farmers. Since that date there has been a
gradual increase in confidence among former lenders, and at the present time
the principal credit sources are the CNCA, commercial banks, and dealers
in supplies and equipment. At village level, moneylenders and merchants
remain an important source of seasonal loans.
10.       Credit is available to farmers according to their annual taxable
income ("revenu fiscal") from three separate accounts, as follows:
Annual Taxable
Income (DH)                Credit Account
up to 1,400             SOCAP
1,400 to 4,000          Caisses Locales (para 12 below)
above 4,000 /1          CNCA's own resources
/1   To make additional farmers eligible for its loans,
CNCA has recently instructed its branches to ap-
prove loans to farmers whose fiscal revenue exceeds
DH 3,000 if their individual farm plans meet the
essential criteria of loan appraisal.
SOCAPs are administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, with CNCA managing
their accounts.
11.       SOCAPs provide seasonal credit for about 700,000 small farmers
each year, limited to DH 300 per farmer. Interest rate is only 3% per
1/   Societe de Credit Agricole et de Prevoyance.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
year, and security requirements are less stringent than for loans to larger
farmers. Over the past few years the average loan recovery rate has been
62%, with differences between regions and seasons. There are 93 societies,
each staffed with a secretary and an accountant, who is also the local tax
collector. Twice a year an additional officer helps prepare lists of credit
demands and of repayments. SOCAP officials are poorly paid, and the inter-
est rate to borrowers is too low for the societies to become profitable.
The activities of SOCAP, which are much more socially than economically
oriented, have declined over the past five years (Annex 3, Table 4).
12.       The Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole (CLCA) were set up by
Government in 1967 and are adDinistered by CNCA. There were 53 offices
throughout the country at the end of fiscal 1970. During the year ending
August 30, 1970, CLCA made almost 22,000 loans, amounting to DR 5.8 million
short-term and DH 19.8 million medium- and long-term, a total of DH 25.6
million. At the end of that year, DH 32.1 million was outstanding, of which
-H 4.2 million short-term and DH 27.9 million medium- and long-term.  The
interest rate is 4% on short-term loans, irrespective of the length of time
outstanding, and on 1969 experience is equivalent to about 6.75% per year.
Interest on medium- and long-term loans is 6.5% a year. Loan recoveries
have been good. At the end of fiscal 1970 only DH 0.9 million was overdue
by more than 8 months, representing less than 3% of the total loans port-
folio on that date. Loans are made according to the size of the farm, and
do not take into account the farmer's ability to use the loan effectively.
Credit Size
13.       No data is available on the current volume of credit through
dealers, moneylenders and merchants. At the end of 1971 the outstanding
credit to agriculture for production and marketing purposes through CNCA
and the commercial banks was about DH 597 million, of which about 73%
was seasonal. CNCA's share of this credit was about DH 340 million, or
57%, of which just over half was seasonal.
Interest Rates
14.       Annual interest rates charged to farmers on loans vary from 3%
through SOCAP, 4% and 6.5% through CLCA, to 6% short-term and 6.5% medium-
and long-term through CNCA. Commercial banks generally charge around 8%
for agricultural loans.

MOROCCO
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
CAISSE NATIONALE DE CREDIT AGRICOLE (CNCA)
A. Organization and Management
Constitution
1.        CNCA was set up by Decree No. 1-60-106 of December 4, 1961, as a
public institution responsible to the Minister of Agriculture, with Head
Office at Rabat, and with Regional Offices, to be known as "Caisses Regionales
de Credit Agricole", in the major regions. It is administered by an Adminis-
trative Council and a Management Committee. The Minister of Agriculture is
the President of the Administrative Council. The 22 members of the Council
include nine representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance,
Planning and Interior, one from the Bank of Morocco, and eleven from farmers
and farming institutions in the Provinces. An organigram and a list of
members are in Appendix 1 and 2.  The Council meets once a year in ordinary
session and otherwise as necessary. It is responsible for the general
organization and functioning of CNCA and specifically for submitting pro-
visional annual accounts and the annual lending program to the Ministers of
Finance and Agriculture for approval, for loan regulations, and for conditions
of employment of staff.
2.        The Management Committee of up to eight members includes repre-
sentatives of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture and Interior and CNCA's
General Manager (or his deputy) as Chairman. A list of members is given in
Appendix 2. The Committee is responsible for day-to-day management of CNCA
under the overall direction of the Administrative Council. It is responsible
for approving larger loans (generally above DH 40,000) outside the competence
of the regional Credit Committees.
3.        The General Manager is the chief executive.  He is appointed and
can be dismissed by Decree on the joint proposal of the Ministers of Finance
and Agriculture. He is empowered to sign all documents and contracts on
behalf of CNCA, and may delegate some of his powers, at his discretion.
4.        CNCA can set up Regional Offices on the joint approval of the
Ministers of Finance and Agriculture. To approve loans within its competence,
each Regional Office must set up a regional Credit Committee, consisting
of the Regional Manager as Chairman, five regional representatives of the
Government, and six representatives of local farmers and farming institutions.
Each Regional Office may also set up a regional Council for Agricultural
Credit, made up of 12 members with representation similar to that for the
regional Credit Committees, and the Provincial Governor as President.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
The duties of the Councils include giving advice on regional credit problems
to CNCA and, if required, producing an annual report. At the present time,
no such Councils have been appointed.
5.        The Decree also provides for the setting up of Caisses Locales de
Credit Agricole (CLCA). Article 20 provides for a technical commission to
study and submit to CNCA's Administrative Council a precise plan and program
for CLCAs. No such commission has yet been appointed, and the CLCAs that
were set up in mid-1967 were the result of administrative instructions to
CNCA from the Minister of Agriculture. Those parts of the Decree which are
concerned with the organization and administration of Caisses Locales do
not, therefore, apply to existing CLCAs.
6.        Additionally, the Decree outlines the types and duration of loans
that can be made and the qualifications of recipients, limits the interest
rate to 10%, provides for imprisonment of debtors, exempts CNCA from taxes,
and permits CNCA to receive deposits. CNCA can also operate and manage
credit projects on behalf of Government. Other financial provisions include
the preparation of annual accounts and budgets, the placing of profits to
reserves, and the deposit of surplus funds not immediately required in the
Treasury or Central Bank. A financial supervisor and chief accountant are
appointed by Government.  The Administrative Council appoints two
Commissioners of Accounts to act as auditors.
Organization
7.        CNCA's own operations cover seasonal and longer term credit to
farmers, cooperatives, groups of farmers, provinces and agricultural enter-
prises for production purposes, through Regional Offices for the majority
of loans to individual farmers, and through Head Office for all other loans.
Also, from its own resources it makes advances to a marketing organization
to cover buffer stocks of agricultural produce accumulated during good har-
vests. On behalf of Government, CNCA manages the operations of CLCA's for
a fee. Additionally, it provides accounting services for SOCAP and three
small funds (amounting to about DH 1.7 million) for fertilizer, Mexican
wheat and a revolving credit.
8.        Under the General Manager reporting through a Secretary General,
there are three main sections, each headed by an Assistant Manager for
Credit, Finance and Accounting Services and, Technical and Economic Studies.
Administration of Regional Offices is in the hands of the General Manager
through the Secretary General as is management of CLCA. The internal
inspection department is under the direct control of the General Manager.
9.        CNCA's Head Office is in Rabat.  There are now 17 Regional Offices
in the major agricultural provinces, compared with nine at the end of 1966.
There is also one local office in Taza, under the supervision of the Regional
Office in Meknes.

Management and Staff
10.        The table below shows the evolution of staff over the past five
years, during which time it has more than doubled:
End of Fiscal Year                    1967   1968    1969   1970    1971
Senior management                       18      52       63      59      69
Administrative and technical
grades                               17      12       44     75       87
Secondary grades                       151    210       210    192      255
Non-administrative grades               41      55       71      73      76
Total all grades                  227    329      388    399       487
of which Head Office            110    170      149    145       174
of which Regional Offices    117    159         239    254       313
of which Expatriates             19      19       9       3       -
CLCA (additional to the above)           -    174       178    189       172
Senior management includes the assistant managers and senior staff of the
three main sections at Head Office and the managers and some senior technical
staff of the Regional Offices. The administrative and technical grades
include the rest of the administrative and technical staff. Staff is gen-
erally reasonably well qualified. There is an active training program at
all levels, including overseas scholarships for senior staff and in-service
courses, particularly for promotion of secondary grade staff to the adminis-
trative grade.
11.        The above figures show the major expansion of staff that occurred
in 1968, when over 100 were recruited, of which about a third were at
senior level. At the end of that year, there was acute shortage of staff in
the administrative and technical grades, which has since been rectified.
Head Office staff reached 174 in 1971 and is not expected to increase
significantly in the near future. Average number of staff in each regional
office was about 11 in 1967 and has increased to about 18 in 1971. The last
expatriate left in April 1972.
B. Finance and Operations
Financial Resources
12.       Analysis of loans by borrower and purpose and of recoveries are at
Tables 1, 2 and 3. Condensed balance sheets for fiscal years 1967 through
1971 are at Table 4. For 1967 CNCA's fiscal year ended on June 30. For
1968 onwards the end was changed to August 31, which is more satisfactory,



ANNEX 3
Page 4
since it is sufficiently long after the harvest for seasonal loans to be
at a minimum. The accounts for fiscal 1968 thus cover a 14-month period.
13.       Table 4 shows CNCA's resources.  As at August 31, 1971, about 36%
came from capital grants and reserves, 13% from the liquidation account
(which is regarded as quasi equity), 13% from the long-term IBRD loan, and
38% short-term from rediscounts and deposits. In an effort to meet IBRD's
requirements for the separation of CLCA accounts, the Government grants were
rearranged for fiscal 1970.  DH 15 million was taken from the DH 20 million
SOCAP grant, DH 33.8 million from the liquidation account, and these were
shown as a Government grant of DH 48.8 million for CLCA. This grant was
raised to DH 55.7 million in 1971 through an additional transfer from the
liquidation account. The remaining DH 5.0 million for SOCAP is adequate at
present. The DH 12.8 million general reserves at the end of fiscal 1971 are
well above IBRD's requirements that reserves should reach 15% (DH 7.5 million)
of CNCA's general capital of DH 50 million by that date. Bad debts provisions,
at DH 10.1 million, cover more than 50% of overdue by private farmers but do
not cover loans to provinces.
14.       CNCA has access to rediscount with the Bank of Morocco up to
DH 110 million for its main seasonal operations, and a further DH 10 million
for CLCA, at 3% a year interest. In April, 1971, it went up to its maximum
with the Bank of Morocco, but this was reduced to DH 102 million at the end
of fiscal 1971. CNCA is also able to rediscount with the Caisse de Depot
et de Gestion up to DH 35 million at 5.5% a year interest and has access to
the local monetary market.
Operating Results
15.       Table 5 shows income and expenditure for the last five years
through 1971. Up to end-1968, CNCA received a fee for managing the liquid-
ation account, but paid interest to Government for the use of the funds in
the account. From 1969 onwards CNCA has managed this account without charge,
but has not paid interest for the use of the funds. This has been advanta-
geous to CNCA in the past, although during the last two years DH 40.7 million
from this fund was transferred to a capital grant for CLCA (para 13).
16.       The commission paid by Government to CNCA (DH .93 million in
1971) for CLCA operations represents the difference between CNCA's income
and expenditure on behalf of CLCA. CLCA salaries and wages are included
under CNCA's expenditure and CLCA income from loans in CNCA's income.
Additionally, CNCA incurs expenses to cover its overheads at Head Office
on behalf of CLCA. The shortfall is made up as the commission.
17.       For the last five years table 6 shows some comparative ratios for
CNCA and Government operations combined based on tables 4 and 5. The rise
in administrative costs, from 1.5% of average capital employed in 1967 to
3.1% in 1969, reflects the increase in staff since 1968, which was essential,
particularly in the higher grades, to improve CNCA's efficiency. The ratio
has since declined, showing improved efficiency. Interest earned rose from
4.6% of average capital employed in 1967 to 6.1% in 1968, reflecting the
effect of the increase in interest rates (from between 4 and 5.5% to a minimum



ANNEX 3
Page 5
of 6%), which CNCA agreed to as a condition of the first IBRD loan. In 1968,
6.1% was exceptional, due to penalties on high arrears of short-term loans,
but the figure declined to 5.7% in 1971. The spread between interest earned
and financial charges has averaged about 3.7% of average capital employed
for 1967 through 1971. The equity/loan ratio improved in 1970 and 1971 due
to repayments of the IBRD loan. Comparative ratios for CNCA's own operations
(after separation of accounts) are discussed in para 33.
Lending Policies and Procedures
18.       CNCA lends on its own account to farmers whose annual fiscal
revenue is more than DH 3,000 to cooperatives and to groups of farmers.
Seasonal loans are given for farm inputs (mainly fertilizer and improved
seeds) and cattle fattening, and medium- and long-term for on-farm improve-
ments and purchase of farm machinery (mainly tractors, pumps, irrigation
equipment, and harvesters). All loans to individual farmers are made
through Regional Offices, while all other loans are handled at Head Office.
Loans of above DH 40,000 1/ to individual farmers are processed at Regional
Offices but referred to Head Office for final approval.
19.       The request for a loan from an individual farmer includes details
of fiscal revenue and evidence that taxes have been paid, proposed security,
proforma invoice (for machinery purchase), plans and quotations (for building
construction, wells and pumps), and farm data. Upon receipt of a loan request
at Regional Office, a technician visits the farm and verifies the information,
except in certain cases where the client is well known, and the farming
pattern has not been altered. A visit is mandatory for all short-term loans
for cereal and vegetable production above DH 20,000 (DH 10,000 for maintenance
of vineyards and fruit farms) and for all medium-term loans above DH 20,000
for machinery. After the technician is satisfied, the loan is referred to
tthe regional Credit Committee. Average time from receipt of application to
approval of loan has been less than 21 days for the past two years, which is
commendable.
20.       Seasonal loans for crops are given on the basis of a fixed sum
per hectare for the main crops. For growing maize, groundnuts, and melons,
a slightly higher sum is given if mechanical cultivation is used. Amounts
per ha vary according to the crop, from DH 150 for sunflower and DH 800 for
potatoes, to DII 1,300 for rice (irrigated). These sums represent around
40% of the seasonal costs of growing these crops. Length of loan depends on
the growing period of the crop and can vary from 5 to 10 months. Seasonal
loans for livestock fattening are given on the merits of each individual
case. lialf of most seasonal loans are paid to farmers as soon as the loan
is approved, and the other half after proof that the required farm inputs
have been bought. Security for seasonal loans is invariably a lien on the
1/   This limit is increased to DH 50,000 for maintenance of fruit farms
and cattle fattening, and to DH 150,000 for seasonal credit for rice
and cultivation. It is reduced to DH 30,000 for maintenance of vineyards.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
crops produced. For livestock fattening and larger crop loans, a guarantor
or further collateral security is frequently required.  Interest rate is 6%
a year.
21.       Medium-term loans for tractors with accessories, pumps, harvesters
and other agricultural machinery are usually for periods up to five
years. The loan is a maximum of 70% of the purchase price. CNCA pays the
supplier direct after receiving evidence that the purchaser has paid the
balance. Security Is a chattel mortgage on the machinery. Interest rate
is 6.5% a year.
22.       Long-term loans for on-farm improvements, particularly farm
buildings, are usually for a maximum of 10 years, though the average is
about seven. Security is usually a mortgage on the farm, coupled in some
cases with a guarantor. Interest rate is 6.5% a year.
23.       Applications for loans from production cooperatives, including
Agrarian Reform cooperatives, 1/ and from agricultural enterprises are
considered at Head Office, and loans can be for any of the purposes outlined
above. Loan regulations are also similar to the above. After examination
at Head Office and in the field as required (in which Regional Offices may
assist), loans are referred to the Management Committee for approval.
Security is usually a lien on the crops produced together in the case of
cooperatives, the collective guarantees of the individual members, or
additional guarantees in the case of enterprises. Interest rate is 6.5% a
year.
24.       Applications from groups of farmers ("Groupements de Mecanisation")
for tractors and harvesters are considered by Head Office under procedures
similar to those above. Loans are for a maximum period of five years, at
6-1/2% interest, and security is a chattel mortgage on the equipment being
purchased. Additional security through the collective guarantees of the
members is occasionally required.

/a   Up to and including 1967 the fiscal year ended June 30, thereafter

Buffer stock advances are mainly to cover surplus stocks of agricultural
produce (in 1971, cotton with some wheat). They have declined considerably
from the abnormal 1969 high, which was due to relatively good harvests in
1968 and 1969.
26.       The number of active accounts over the same period for short-,
medium- and long-term loans were:

Separate accounts are kept for advances under these two headings, so that a
farmer (or cooperative) could have accounts under both headings. The number
of accounts decreased in 1970, although the total amount outstanding in-
creased.
27.       A detailed analysis of loans made over the past five years (exclud-
ing SOCAP and CLCA) is given in Tables 1 and 2. Total value of loans to
individual farmers, cooperatives, and other groups has increased considerably
since 1967, and for the past three years has averaged more than one-half of
CNCA's annual lending program. Short-term loans over the same period averaged
50% of total loans to individuals and to other groups, and remained close to
100% for cooperatives. Since 1967 the average size of short-term loans to
individuals for both seasonal farm inputs and livestock has increased, as has
the average size for all categories of medium-term loans.



ANNEX 3

Loan Recoveries
28.       Overdue loans are charged a further 2% interest a year if not paid
within two months of due date.  Each Regional Office has a separate section
working full time on recoveries and since 1968 CNCA, has maintained records
to show overdue loans classified by age.  Details are in para 4.09.  Over the
past four years, total overdues have been reduced by about 24%.  It is
significant that sums overdue by more than 26 months decreased also by 24%
(from DH 8 million to DH 6.1 million) during the past fiscal year.
29.       Provisions to cover bad debts on individual loans in the accounts
are now calculated on the basis of 15% on loans overdue eight to 14 months,
50% on 15 to 26 months, 75X on 27 to 38 months and 100% on those over 38
months. On this basis, provisions for fiscal year 1971 are DH 10.1 million,
more than 50% of total overdues on individual loans; such provisions are con-
sidered satisfactory.
Impact of First Project
30.       Available data permit only limited quantifiable evaluation of the
project's impact on development. Data furnished by CNCA are based on case
studies rather than on representative sample surveys. For on farm investments
which had not yet reached full development (mainly plantations) CNCA could
merely assume standards of performance observed. Elsewhere a fuller discus-
sion on the evaluation of the first project is given in the report in para
2.16 to 2.20. A summary of developments financed under the project is given
in Table 7.
CNCA Financial Reorganizationand Expansion
31.       Although CNCA's operations have improved over the past three years,
there are a number of financial aspects which would require changing before
the project could go forward. These involve the separation of all operations
carried out on government account (Table 8) and strengthening of CNCA's
capital resources. These aspects are discussed in the main report (paras
4.13 to 4.16).
32.       Table 9 gives the project cash flow and tables 10, 11 and 12 CNCA's
projected cash flow, operating results and balance sheets. CNCA's expanded
operations are expected to be financed by increased deposits, additional
equity capital, and borrowings from Banque Centrale Populaire und Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau. The projections in tables 10, 11 and 12 are based on the
following interest charges: 6% on snort-term loans; 6.5% on medium- and
long-term loans to borrowers having a fiscal income of less tihan DH 6,000;
and 8% on uedium- and long-term loans to borrowers having a fiscal income of
nH 6,0)00 and above and on all Project loans for mechanization.
33.       Comparative ratios for CNCA's own operations (after separation of
accounts as proposed in table 8) are shown in table 6. Administrative costs
would rise from 3.0% of average capital employed in 1971 to 3.4% in 1976
(or about 11%) reflecting increase in staff and wages. Cost of capital

Page 9
would increase from 2.1% of average capital employed in 1971 to 2.7% in
1976 as a result of the present loan and other medium- and long-term borrow-
ings from Banque Centrale Populaire (DH 35 million) and Kreditanstalt (DH 3.3
million). Interest earned would rise from 5.3% of average capital employed
in 1971 to 7.1% in 1976 reflecting the increased lending rate for medium-
and long-term loans (from 6.5% to 8% on about 84% of CNCA's operations). The
spread between interest earned and cost of resources would rise from 3.2% of
average capital employed in 1971 to 4.4% in 1976. The debt/equity ratio
would decrease from 1:2.2 in 1971 to 1:1.2 in 1976 when CNCA's borrowings
from IBRD would be at their highest level.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Grain Farm Mechanization
A. Cereal Production and Marketing
Production
1.        Cereals are Morocco's most important crop.  Although nearly all
farmers grow some cereals, production is concentrated in non-irrigated
regions west of the Atlas mountains at elevations below 800 m where annual
rainfall exceeds 300 mm.
2.        Areas planted to cereals normally range between 3.9 and 4.5 million
ha; the lowest reported area was 3.2 million ha in 1957. Variations in area
planted are due mainly to differences in rainfall during November/December.
Lack of rain during this period causes heavy soils to harden, thus hindering
land preparation, especially where animal-drawn implements are used (on around
three quarters of total area).
3.        Average wheat yields vary greatly from year to year (5 qx/ha in
1966/67 and 12.6 qx/ha in 1967/68). In addition there are great differences
between the traditional sector and the modern sector in any one year (Table 1).
Although the modern sector may have some advantages in soil and climate,
these differences indicate the scope for yield improvements via modern
technology.
4.        Government improvement programs in the traditional sector have
centered around the promotion of fertilizer (operation engrais) and partial
mechanization provided by Government-operated stations called Centres de
Travaux (CT).   These efforts have had limited impact, partly because they
were not linked with an effective seed improvement program, but mainly
because of inefficiencies in management. More recently, the Institut
National de Recherche Agronomique (INRA), supported by the US Agency for
International Development (USAID) and Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento
de Maiz y Trigo (CIMMYT), has introduced high-yielding Mexican and Italian
varieties. INRA has obtained yields of 35 to 50 qx/ha on test and demons-
tration plots.  Commercial yields on 10,000 ha in 1970 averaged 17 qx/ha
for Italian and 20 qx/ha for Mexican varieties on rainfed land, including
southern semi-arid regions. As the availability of these varieties increases,
there is more scope for obtaining higher yields. Use of these varieties
requires timely and thorough land preparation, fertilizer and weed control.
The availability of fertilizer and chemical weed killer, either through
Government CT stores or through commercial channels, is reasonably adequate.

5.        Overall cereal production rose to a record level of 6.3 million
ton in 1968, as a result of good climatic conditions. Subsequent harvests were
below that of 1968, yet somewhat above the pre-1968 level.

6.        To satisfy domestic requirements, soft wheat has been imported
every year since 1963, involving a substantial drain of foreign exchange
(Annex 1), Table 2). Imports have averaged nearly 400,000 tons during the
three years ending 1970 and climbed to 670,000 tons in 1971. Per capita output
for the crop year from domestic sources declined from 370 kg/head during
the 1936-45 period to about 220 kg/head during the 10 years ending 1965, due
mainly to population increase coupled with stagnant production.
Marketing and Prices
7.        Government regulates grain marketing and prices.  The Office
Cherifien Interprofessionel des Cereales (OCIC) is vested with the exclusive
right to import and export wheat and barley. OCIC buys wheat and barley
at fixed prices, delivered to up-country buying stations. Farmgate prices
tend to fluctuate around these prices. Owing to strong domestic demand,
hard wheat prices have tended to be above OCIC buying prices.

/b   CIF Moroccan port, in current US$, including US$7/t for distribution.
/c   FOB Moroccan port, in current US$, including US$7 for local transport
and handling.
8.        OCIC is also responsible for stabilizing grain prices for consumers,
and it sells to domestic buyers at fixed prices. While the spread between
its buying and selling prices for wheat may not always cover all costs, OCIC
has tended to incur greater losses on barley -- it buys barley above world
prices and then loses on export sales. These losses are largely compensated
through gains from imports and domestic sale of soft wheat, but net losses
tend to be high in years of low import requirements (1968/69). In view of
the wheat deficit, wheat prices, although above projected 1975 world prices,



ANNEX 4
Page 3
are expected to remain stable, while OCIC may decide to reduce its buying
price of barley to minimize losses.
B. Tractors
Historical and Technological Background
9.        Mechanization of Moroccan grain farms dates back to the 1920's and,
in the decade following 1930, substantial numbers of tractors were imported,
mainly by European settlers. Extensive dry-land grain production was pos-
sible on large farms, with the use of tractors to break the heavy soils and
prepare the land in time to take advantage of the relatively short rainy
season. Intensification and diversification of agriculture have broadened
the use of tractors, partly along with expanding irrigation facilities and
partly with the spread of new technology for cereals and other commercial
crops. The use of tractors is spreading from the modern to the traditional
sector, from large to medium and small farms.
Effects of Tractor Cultivation
10.       Progressive farmers have tried to meet their draft power needs by
using tractors for several reasons. Draft animals can be used only for a
short period of time but must be maintained throughout the year requiring
fodder which could otherwise be used for livestock production. The use of
tractors, while eliminating the fodder requirements for draft animals, also
enables better seed-bed preparation, particularly if rains are late and
ploughing and cultivation must be undertaken when the soil is dry and hard.
AJith animal power alone large areas cannot be planted at all in years of late
rains and drou<ght.
11t       7abor supply is also a factor.  In Morocco as a whole, there is dis-
tinct unemployment in urban areas but there are severe seasonal labor short-
ages in agriculture, particularly during seasons of peak agricultural activ-
ity. Social constraints and the fact that the times of peak demand for labor
are the same throughout Morocco's grain production area have limited possi-
,ilities of large scale labor movements to meet these demands. Mechanization
of land p.sparation and seeding reduces the peak demand for labor for these
operations. But the expansion of areas planted, better seed-bed preparation
and higher le-els of other inputs made possible by timely land preparation
tend to increase the labor required through the cropping period. In addition,
indirect employment opportunities, such as the need for tractor maintenance
and supply services and increased marketing requirements, have a positive in-
fluence on rural employment. Without tractors, much of the land currently
used for mechanized grain production would probably revert to extensive graz-
ing of livestock. With uncertain seasonal rainfall and heavy soils, land
preparation with traditional hand or animal draft methods must be carried out
within the short period between the first rains in October and the middle of
November. Delayed rains can cause sharp reductions in cropped acreage and
reduced yields. The high risks and low returns inherent in such traditional



ANNEX 4
Page 4
systems are not likely to keep such land in cereal production without trac-
tors. Failure to replace tractors on currently mechanized farms could thus
cause substantial areas to revert to grazing which in turn would cause a net
displacement of labor.
Technical and Financial Aspects
12.       Principal advantages of tractors in the Moroccan environment are:
(a) Timeliness and quality of land preparation and seeding on rain-fed
farms. Aside from timeliness, the quality of land preparation is
superior to that obtained with work animals and traditional
implements. Additionally, the use of grain drills, with controlled
depth for placement of seeds and fertilizer, results in improved
water utilization and growing conditions which are increasingly
important for the success of high yielding varieties;
(b) Timeliness and versatility on irrigated farms. With increasing
areas coming under irrigation, possibilities for double-cropping
of rice, maize, cotton, or oil seeds will depend on the timeliness
of land preparation. Further advantages are the convenience in
using tractors for row cultivation in maize, cotton and vegetable
production, for harvesting of fodder, for chemical weed or pest
control, and for transport, on-farm and from farm-to-market.
(c) Seasonal labor peaks. Flexibility is important when farmers are
faced with seasonally high labor requirements for draft power and
human labor. In critical periods, a tractor can be worked 24 hours
per day, whereas a team of animals can only work an 8-hour day.
Also productive employment would be generated because the tractor
would enable additional land to be planted which would have been
left fallow if only animal draft power were available.
(d) Financial aspects. The financial results of the foregoing are
shown in Model 1. Grain farm mechanization, especially when coupled
with other aspects of modernization (seeds, fertilizer, chemical
weed control) would be financially rewarding. Annual tractor
utilization on model farms was assumed at 1,450 hours, of which
about 200 hours would be for transport. On Moroccan farms, a
minimum of about 1,100 hours operation would be required for
economic utilization of a tractor. On smaller farms appropriate
utilization would be assured by evidence that custom work would
be undertaken. CNCA observes these criteria in appraising
applications for tractor loans. The financial rate of return
under assumptions detailed in Table 2 would be 32%. If lower
yields or prices should reduce incremental net benefits to 20%
below best estimates, the rate of return (21%) would still be
satisfactory.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
Economic Return
13.       The direct economic return from the use of tractors in grain farm-
ing cannot be isolated from the farm-system technology which includes the re-
turn of other inputs such as seed and fertilizer. Thus quantifiable benefits
from tractor use are reflected in the project's economic rate of return which
is based on the value of net incremental production. The rate of return
would be 23%, at prices one-fourth below present prices in Morocco which
would be below projected world prices in 1975. In theory it should be pos-
sible to relate the timeliness benefits of tractor use to the rainfall pat-
tern and acreages seeded, but this would require a special statistical study.
For this reason, the tangible benefits from reducing the large areas which
would be left fallow in years of late rains and drought are not included in
the rate of return.
14.       There are several other nonquantified benefits:  Employment oppor-
tunities for tractor drivers and mechanics at jobs requiring higher levels of
skill; reduction of annual fluctuations in employment levels resulting from
large areas which would be fallow in years of late rains and drought; increas-
ing employment in the supply and maintenance of sophisticated equipment and
in the distribution of inputs which would be justified with mechanization;
the increased volume of produce to be transported and marketed; and the mul-
tiplier effect on overall employment levels of the higher level output.
Tractor Supply
15.       Average annual sales of tractors for five-year periods since 1950
were as follows:
Average Annual
Years                Tractor Sales
1950-54                   1,217
1955-59                     880
1960-64                     525
1965-69                   1,363
The high level sales in the 1950-54 period were mainly to European settlers.
since independence (1956) the Government has pursued a policy of encouraging
selective use of power equipment in farming. Initially the emphasis was
placed on the public sector but more recently (since 1967) it has shifted
to the private sector.
16.       The public sector operation was brought about under two programs.
The first involved replacement of mechanized equipment on farms taken over
from European settlers by the Centrale de Gestion des Exploitations Agricoles
(OGEA). Under the first loan (433-MOR) DH 9 million (US$1.8 million) was
spent to help finance OGEA's equipment needs. Under the second, Government
has promoted appropriate mechanization among traditional sector farmers, as
an integral part of its overall extension program (Annex 1 paras 11-14),
through the Centres de Travaux (CT) for rain-fed areas and through the Centres
de Mise en Valeur (CMV) for irrigated areas. In addition to their regular



ANNEX 4
Page 6
input supply and technical services, the CT and CMV have offered tractor and
combine services for the benefit of small farmers.  CT and CMV centers have
also trained tractor drivers and mechanics. Their programs have contributed
to the increased interest in tractor use among traditional sector farmers.
17.       By 1967 the CT and CMV had approximately 1,000 tractors and ancillary
equipment at their disposal, but could not satisfy farmers' demand for custom
services. Since 1967 Governmend reduced its public sector purchases, which
during the preceding five years had accounted for more than half of all
tractor purchases, to insignificant levels. Sales to private sector farmers
have risen substantially since 1967.
18.       Tractor Population.  In 1969 the Ministry of Agricultue initiated,
but has not yet completed, a census of farm tractors in conjunction with
compulsory tractor registration. The number actually on farms in operating
condition in 1970 was estimated as follows:
Tractor Numbers
in Operating Condition
10 to 20 years old                        2,000
5 to 10 years                             1,400
less than 5 years                         6,800
Total               10,200
Even if all these were utilized on grain farms, covering 100 ha each, not
more than 1 million ha or 23% of Morocco's area under cereals (4.5 million
ha) would benefit from tractor operation.
Projected Demand
19.       Tractor sales have varied from about 1,500 to 2,300 over 1968-71.
The portions financed by CNCA increased from a level of 10% in 1968 to 47%
in 1971. The actual figures are shown below, together with projections
through 1975.

ANNEX 4
Page 7
20.       The share of sales financed by CNCA would increase slightly from
1971 onwards when proceeds from the proposed loan are expected to be avail-
able. Overall demand projected from 1971 onwards takes into account replace-
ment needs at an estimated annual rate of 10% of the existing stock. The
additional 800 to 900 units annually would be available for farmers shifting
from animal-drawn to mechanized grain farming, adding each year about 85,000
ha to the area cultivated by tractors. At this rate, approximately 1.5
million ha or 33% of the area under cereals would benefit from tractor
operation towards the end of the Project's disbursement period.
C. Harvesting Machinery
Background
21.       Mechanical grain harvesting has been initially developed and most
rapidly accepted where the dry land farming conditions prevail: low rain-
fall, low and uncertain yields, large fields and the difficulty of attract-
ing large numbers of laborers for very limited periods. These conditions
are common in large, semi-arid areas of the United States, Canada, Australia,
in parts of Russia, and Argentina, where nearly all cereals are harvested
mechanically. Since physical conditions are similar in parts of North
Africa, especially Tunisia and Morocco, it is not surprising that grain
harvesters, introduced by former European settlers, have spread throughout
the commercial part of the agricultural sector.
22.       Northern Morocco has the largest portion of modern grain farms and
the number of those covering at least 50 ha - not a large size under semi-
arid conditions - is estimated to exceed 15,000. Many of these farms are
already mechanized and 80 - 90% of combines financed under the project would
provide for their replacement needs (para 24). Such replacement would not
result in any displacement of labor.
43.       In theory these mechanized farms could revert to hand-harvesting.
however, on such farms it is nearly impossible to marshal the labor force
r2quircd to carry out the harvest operations on a timely basis. With
-adit!onal grain harvesting of 70 ha, for example, a farmer who could
jbiii.,e 10 to 12 laborers at harvest time (for whom he would have little
,-oductive employment the rest of the year) would need 70 work days (80-90
,alendar days) to complete the harvest.  This would greatly exceed the
period of optimal maturity and harvest losses, through shattering, bird,
insect and rodent damage would be excessive. Since all grains mature during
the same short period, and because of social constraints to urban-rural
migration, few farmers, reverting to hand-harvesting, could mobilize
sufficient manpower for the harvest season.
Combine Population
24.       Information on the current combine population is not available, but
is being assembled in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture's tractor



ANNEX 4
Page 8
census and registration (para 18). Annual sales since 1966 and CNCA loans
for combines were as follows:
Combines Sold Combines Financed by CNCA Loans
Number             Number          % Total
1966                 81                 -                -
1967                 56                16               30
1968                366                73               20
1969                257                66               26
1970                184                58               32
1971                209                70               33
Total        1,153               283
25.       Exceptionilly high sales in 1968 are partly due to the record grain
harvest in that year. The total number of combines in operating condition,
estimated three times that of combines sold 1966 through 1971, would be of
the order of 3,500. Assuming full utilization at 400 hours per annum, a
combine would need to be replaced every 9 to 10 years. Annual replacement
needs for about 2,500 combines (all except those purchased since 1966)
estimated at 250, are therefore projected as follows:
Total Combine Combines to be Financed by CNCA
Sales, Number         Number            Z
1972                 220                100              45
1973                 230                110              48
1974                 250                120              48
1975                 280                140              50
As shown by these projections, Government, aware of the potential labor dis-
placement problem when combines are introduced to new areas, does not intend
to increase the rate of combine importation above the levels reached since
1968. Import duties on combines are twice as high as those for tractors
(Annex 1, para 17). Although the estimated total number of combine sales
(250 per year) would just cover the replacement of existing combines, it
should not be ruled out that a small portion (10 to 20%) could be used on
newly mechanized farms. In that case some displacement of seasonal labor
would occur but this would not exceed 1,800 temporary two-month jobs annually,
half of which could be attributed to the project. This estimate is based on
the lost opportunity of 60 days employment for 53 men per combine introduced
on newly mechanized farms.
Technical Advantaes
26.       The principal advantage of combines is the reduction of losses,
and improvement of quality, as compared to the traditional harvesting and
threshing methods. Harvest takes place during high summer heat, and delayed
or slow harvesting results in serious losses due to shattering, etc. Animal
trampling losses and damage are also eliminated. These losses, estimated



ANNEX 4
Page 9
at about 20%, would be reduced to 5% through corbine harvesting. Net savings
would thus amount to about 15%.
Economic Justification
27.       The foreign exchange cost of one cormine (9DH 46,000 or UWS9,200)
would be equivalent to about 130 tons of imported soft wheat, valued at
projected 1975 world prices (US$72 CIF Moroccan port). The savings of 130
tons would be realized from combine harvest of about 900 ha, equivalent to
2.3 years of combine use, while in practice the combine's usefull life (at
3,200 hours) would extend over 8 years.
28.       Based on net annual savings of 15% as the sole benefits, against
investment cost (less taxes), operating costs, and the social cost of
displaced labor, over 8 years, the economic rate of return would be 16%.
The displaced labor would be seasonal in nature, performed mostly by women
at low wages, and the social cost has been valued at the full market
rate. Thus on economic grounds the harvesting machinery component shall
qualify for support under the Project.
D. Institutional Capacity To Appraise and Service Sub-Loans
Loan Appraisal and Supervision
29.       CNCA's branches are staffed by experienced technical and administra-
tive staff. Headquarters staff provides guidance and supervision, especially
in methods and procedures of appraising individual sub-loans. Authority to
approve loans up to DH 40,000 (US$8,700), which is sufficient for tractors
and small combines, is delegated to branch offices. Time lapsed between
receipt and approval of loan applications has averaged 21 days and loan
supervision is adequate. CNCA is capable of implementing the grain farm
lending program on a timely basis.
After-Sales Service
30.       The dealer network of international farm machinery firms is well
established in Morocco. Their agents have repair facilities in 15 to 18
towns throughout the major farming regions.  Additional snall repair shops
are operated by large farmers and village blacksmiths. Farmers' standards
of maintenance are satisfactory, partly due to training of drivers and
mechanics by Government (CT and CMV) and tractor firms.  All firms provide
warranty services, ranging from three to 12 months after sale, and spare
parts are available.

MOROCCO
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
CITRUS AND OTHER FRUIT
Production
1.        Citrus exports (fresh fruit and juice) contributed about DH 430
million (US$85 million) of Morocco's 1969 export revenue (17% of total and
31% of agricultural exports). Area of citrus orchards represented only 12%
of all fruit plantations and 1% of Morocco's cultivated land:
Vineyards                        59,000
Olives                          168,000
Citrus                           63,000
Other                           135,000
Total                     425,000
Vineyard areas and wine production have declined since 1960 because of dif-
ficulties in finding export markets for Moroccan wine. Aside from citrus,
farmers in the modern sector have been investing in new olive, almond, apri-
cot and other stone fruit orchards. New plantations are oriented towards
export in fresh and processed form.
2.        Regional distribution of 1967/68 production, by variety or type of
citrus, other than lemon and grapefruit, is shown below:

3.        The Gharb is still the most important region, accounting for 42%
of total production. However, substantial recent increase in plantings and
output has followed groundwater development in desert areas of the Souss
(near Agadir) and Ben Gherir (southwest of Marrakech). These regions are
especially well suited for clementines. Because of consumer preference and
high prices in European markets, CNCA's clients have planted 60% of their
new plantations in 1969/70 with clementines.
Production Methods
4.        Moroccan citrus growers have attained high standards in produc-
tion techniques and plantation management. The larger growers follow devel-
opments in other countries, through visits and study of information from
many sources. Through selection of proper rootstock and planting material,
improved pruning, water management, fertilization and pest control and in-
centive payments to skilled laborers, they obtain yields ranging from 30-50
tons/ha. Some growers operate their own stations for treatment, grading and
packaging. So far Morocco has no citrus fungus, virus or insect pest that
cannot be readily controlled by known phyto-sanitary practices. "Aspidiotus"
and "ceratitis capitata" (Mediterranean fruit fly) are the most common insect
pests.
Institutional Support
5.        Government supports the citrus industry through the Institut
National de Recherche Agronomique (INRA). In addition to its main Rabat
station, INRA has substations for citrus research near Marrakech and Souss.
INRA has developed virus-resistant varieties. It has not yet succeeded
in its attempt to institute control of planting materials. Due to rapid
expansion of plantations (averaging about 1,500 ha per year), Government
nurseries have not kept pace with the demand for nursery stock and many
growers have established their own nurseries. Once effective supervision
and control have been developed (which may take several years), CNCA should
ensure that its clients obtain planting materials only from supervised and
certified nurseries. For insect and disease control and other aspects of
orchard management Government provides specialized technical services, es-
pecially to small farmers within irrigation schemes. Larger growers acquire
such expertise themselves or hire professional managers, including some from
other countries.
6.        Growers have organized the Association des Producteurs d'Agrumes
du Maroc (ASPAM). The Association, which has some 1,500 members, publishes
and distributes technical and economic information; organizes the feedback
of growers' problems to technical and administrative authorities; orients,
guides and encourages production research; and represents the interests of
regional producers or of the entire industry.
Marketing Services
7.        The Office de Commercialisation et d'Exportation (OCE) has the
exclusive right of exporting fresh or processed citrus (Annex 1, para 15).
It receives all citrus destined for export. After changing several times



ANNEX 5
Page 3
its criteria and procedures for paying producers, it introduced for 1970/71
a schedule of fixed prices and additional incentives for advanced (before
November) or late (after May 2) delivery. Normally the harvest begins in
November and ends in April.
Prices
8.        OCE's 1970/71 average grade buying prices are:
DH/kg                                     DR/kg
Clementines         .65     Salustiana and Vernia             .25
Wilking-Monreals   .40      Washington Sanguines              .23
Maroc-late          .30     Doubles pines and Sanguinelli   .20
Navel               .25     Fines and Sanguines Fines         .17
OCE pays these prices to producers for the portion it accepts and ships
for export.  OCE pays for cleaning, sorting, de-greening, waxing, packaging
(including materials) and other costs of xport sales. It returns culls
and rejects to the grower or sells them for his account on fresh fruit mar-
kets or for processing. Competition in export markets has forced OCE to
exercise rigorous quality control over packing stations. The blended price
of DH 410/ton delivered O.C.E. packing station, which was assumed for
projection of incremental returns, is based on the following unit of varie-
ties and their respective prices:
Weighted Average
Variety      DH/ton    %               DH
Export:        Clementine            620     48            297.60

Marketing Facilities
9.        Marketing facilities belong to one of three categories:  those
operated by individual farmers, by farmer cooperatives, and by commercial
interests. Their estimated capacity in 1967/68 was:

Market Prospects for Citrus
Past Trends
1.        World citrus 1/ production and trade, stimulated by growing de-
mand for fresh and processed products and comparatively high per acre
financial returns, are continuing the upward trend established over the last
two decades. As a result of this trend, competition has increased (without
necessarily depressing prices) and market shares in the distribution of
exports have been gradually changing. This dynamic pattern is likely to
continue for some years to come.
2.        Total world citrus production rose from 21.9 million tons to
30.4 million tons between 1960-62 and 1966-68 2/ representing an annual
increase of 5.6%. The rate of expansion was slightly higher in the
developed countries than in the developing countries. World exports rose
at 4.3 percent per annum in the same period, but exports from developing
countries rose at more than double the rate of developed countries reflect-
ing a faster increase in consumption in developed exporting countries than
in developing (Table 1). The share of developing countries in total
citrus exports increased from 38.5% in 1960-62 to 43.5Z in 1966-68.
3.        The volume of fresh citrus fruit entering international trade
is dependent, to a large degree, on the needs of Western European countries,
which account for over four fifths of world imports. The fruit is imported
chiefly from Mediterranean sources during the winter season, though summer
imports are now rising. Total citrus imports in 1963-68 averaged about
4 million tons yearly, with oranges alone accounting for over 3 million
tons. Shipments fluctuate, however, from season to season, depending on
supplies.
4.        Tariff protection does not influence trade in oranges as much as
it does trade in many other fruits. In this connection, it is interesting
to note that, in spite of the protection, exports of oranges from Italy
(the only producer in the European Economic Community) to other EEC members,
have been declining. Strong domestic demand, varieties unsuited for
export market and poor quality are the principal reasons.
1/   In this Annex, "citrus" refers to oranges (including mandarins, satsumas
and such), grapefruit, limes and lemons.

5.        The Federal Republic of Germany and France are the leading
importers of oranges, followed by the United Kingdom. More than half
of Germany's orange imports come from Spain while other suppliers are
Israel, Morocco, Italy and South Africa. Spain also tops the list of
orange suppliers to France, followed by Morocco and Algeria. Orange
supplies for the United Kingdom come mainly from Israel, Spain and South
Africa; sizable quantities also come from Morocco, Cyprus and Brazil.
The United States is an important supplier to the Netherlands, Belgium/
Luxembourg and France during the late spring and summer when supplies from
most Mediterranean countries approach their seasonal low.
6.        Germany is the largest importer of lemons in the world, buying
about 130 thousand tons per year or 20% of the world total. Italy
supplies about 75% of German requirements. Spain furnishes another 15%;
the remaining 10% is shared by the United States, Turkey and Chile.
7.        Grapefruit has been one of the most buoyant markets, largely
because of remarkable growth in the United Kingdom, which now accounts
for a third of Western Europe's total imports of the fruit. The largest
suppliers of grapefruit to the United Kingdom are Israel, South Africa and
Cyprus.
8.        Citrus fruit production in Morocco is mainly based on oranges,
including mandarins and clementines. Output of the orange group increased
sharply from 243,000 metric tons in 1955-57 to about 775,000 in 1968 at
a yearly growth rate of over 10 %; Morocco's share in the world production
of oranges (including mandarins and clementines) rose from 1.7 % in
1955-57 to 3.0% in 1968 (Table 1).
9.        Exports of oranges (including mandarins and clementines) rose
from about 186,000 metric tons in 1955-57 to about 565,000 metric tons in
1968 (Table 1) at an annual rate of 9.7 percent, slightly slower than the
rate of increase in production in the same period. France is still the
major outlet for Moroccan oranges, but the dependance on this market has
steadily declined from 64% of the end-1950's to 43% in 1969. Morocco has
been successful in increasing its orange exports to the German and United
Kingdom markets and in developing the new markets of Eastern Europe and
the USSR. Exports to Germany increased from 35,300 metric tons in 1958 to
105,200 metric tons in 1969 and exports to the United Kingdom rose from
5,300 metric tons to 34,600 metric tons in 1969. The largest expansion
however occurred in exports to Eastern Europe and USSR markets where exports
increased from a low 3,500 metric tons in 1958 to 144,900 metric tons in
1967 (Table 2).
10.       The composition of Moroccan exports of the orange group has
changed considerably during the past decade. In 1958-60 oranges accounted
for 92.4% of the orange group exports, mandarins 0.7% and clementines 6.9%;
in 1969 oranges accounted for only 79.8% while mandarins increased their
share to 2.9% and clementines to 17.3% of the total (Table 3). This change

was brought about by consumer preference for Moroccan mandarins and clemen-
tines in the Western European markets, although they are higher priced
than oranges.
11.       Since September 1, 1969, Morocco has become a partial EEC
associate. The preferential trade arrangement dropped ad valorem duties
on Moroccan citrus by 80%, providing certain minimum prices were maintained.
However, Morocco lost the duty free quota on 240,000 metric tons of fresh
oranges and tangerines which she has enjoyed on the French market. Evalua-
tion of the total impact of the agreement during the first year of operation
is difficult, but undoubtedly it played a role in increasing Moroccan ex-
ports to other EEC countries than France, principally Germany and it
strengthened incentives to improve and expand citrus production.
Outlook
12.       The main determinant of growth in world demand has been the rise
in incomes. FAO estimates 1/ of income elasticity of demand, for oranges
which take into account the results of family budget data and per capita
consumption levels, are given below. These coefficients represent average
values for the period 1965-66. Since income elasticities of demand normally
tend to decline with rising levels of incomes and/or consumption, the
present values of the coefficient may be lower and may decline further by
1980.
Income Elasticity of
Demand for Oranges
United States           0.3
Canada                  0.4
United Kingdom          0.7
Netherlands             0.4
Germany                 0.7
France                  0.6
Rising population and adequate supplies at apparently attractive prices for
both producers and consumers also contributed to the growth. Although
prices often experience sharp fluctuations because citrus output is highly
susceptible to weather influences, the general trend over the years has been
horizontal (Table 4).
13.       The FAO Study Group on Citrus Fruit, in which principal importing
and exporting countries are represented, periodically reviews the world
market situation and prospects. These consultations, in terms of their
influence on government policies, can be partly credited for the relative
price stability that has prevailed in world markets. The last session of
1/   FAO:  Study Group on Citrus Fruit, CCP CI-69/2, March 3, 1969.

the Study Group, held in May 1969, estimated that world production of
oranRes would rise from 21.3 million tons in the mid-sixties to 34.0 million
tons in 1975. This implies the same yearly growth rate of 4.8% as since
the mid-1950's. Thereafter, we estimate a lower growth rate of production
because of a slowing down in import demand. Production of oranges in 1980
is expected to reach about 40 million tons.
14.       The rate of growth in production for export of oranges, particu-
larly in the developing countries, may be somewhat faster, which indicates
that competition may intensify. However, because major exporting countries
restrict exports in times of surplus, and convert them to the domestic
market, prices should remain close to the level of 1967/68 (Table 4). The
project under consideration has been evaluated at prices paid to the
producers during the 1970/71 marketing season which are slightly lower
than prices paid during 1967/68.
15.       Table 5 summarizes past trends and projections for exports of
oranges for the world and Morocco's share. The projection is based on the
assumption that prices will be maintained close to the 1966-68 level. The
1980 level of world exports of oranges has been estimated to reach 6,050
thousand metric tons. This implies a slight deceleration in the rate of
growth of exports from 4.2% per annum between the mid-1950's and 1966-68
to 4.0% between 1966-68 and 1980. Continued sustained demand in Western
Europe and consumption in Eastern Europe and USSR and the development of new
markets should warrant this rate of growth.
16.       Projections for exports of the orange group from Morocco have
been based on Morocco retaining the share of the market achieved in 1968.
Exports should reach 950 thousand metric tons by 1980 and increase of over
450 thousand metric tons from 1966-68 or a growth rate of 5.2% per annum
from the 1966-68 period as compared to 9.3% per annum between 1955-57 and
1966-68.
17.       The citrus project under consideration will produce largely
clementines and smaller quantities of Maroc-late and Navel-late oranges.
Production is scheduled to begin in 1976 and maximum output of 180,000
metric tons, of which 30% or 54,000 metric tons will be for home consumption
including processing, will not be achieved until 17 years from planting.
18.       The estimated quantity of oranges available for export from
the project by 1980 will be 44,400 metric tons, about 10% of the estimated
increase in total Moroccan export between 1966-68 and 1980 and 0.7% of
1980 world exports.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
WINTER VEGETABLES
Production
1.        Market gardening in Morocco covers about 82,000 ha.  Reliable
statistics on total output and value do not exist because of the importance
of auto-consumption and localized markets. Annual tomato and potato produc-
tion ranges between 400,000 and 600,000 tons. Export-oriented production is
concentrated in the Souss and in the coastal regions: Safi-Casablanca-
Rabat-Kenitra, in Tadla and Berkane. About 8,000 producers, many of them
operating only 2 to 5 ha, are involved in export production, according to
the Office de Commercialisation et d'Exportation (OCE). Exports of fresh
vegetables have averaged about 200,000 tons annually, with a value of about
DH 220 million (US$44 million), about 8% of total and 15% of agricultural
exports (Annex 3, Table 2). Processed vegetables (dried, conserves and
juice) provide additional export revenue.
2.        The following table shows the diversification in fresh vegetable
exports:

ANNEX 6

3.        To assure timely production and export quality , vegetables re-
quire the following investments: windbeaks; groundwater development (ex-
cept in irrigated areas) and land levelling for irrigation; and (except on
very small farms) equipment for land preparation, row-cultivation and pest
control. These are to be financed under the proposed subproject (Table 1).
From its own resources the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) ex-
tends short-term production credit which was previously provided by OCE.
Vegetable growers are skilled and knowledgeable in production techniques.
Small growers receive technical assistance from Government extension staff.
The Institute National de Recherche Agronomique (INRA) has developed virus-
resistant tomato varieties which have been well accepted in export markets.
Seed potatoes are generally imported. There is strong competition among
input supply firms and inputs are readily available.
Marketing
4.        As for citrus, OCE is the sole exporter of vegetables.  However,
unlike citrus, packaging of vegetables, though supervised by OCE, is done
at the grower's expense and OCE acts as the producer's agent in shipping
and marketing each grower's properly identified produce. Sale through com-
mission merchants in the importing country is at the grower's risk. Pack-
aging stations in Morocco are fairly well distributed. Produce of small
growers is handled by cooperative packaging stations or by those of larger
growers. Under OCE's guidance the export pack has been standardized and
is attractively presented, in accordance with market preferences.
5.        Producer prices realized over four years for export vegetables
are shown in Table 2. They are generally higher than assumed in Model 4,
Table 1. Also, the portion in this model sold for export is lower than
that exported by successful growers. Further, to test the sensitivity, it
has been assumed in this model that 25% less than the best estimate would
be exported. Even under these conditions, the financial rate of return
would be 23%, which is extremely profitable and compensates for risks which
cannot easily be quantified.
6.        The incremental production generated by the subproject, at full
development (Year 7), would be:
Export Harkets    Local Markets
---  000 tons-------
Tomatoes                     36                39
Potatoes                      6                12
Squash (zucchini)             7                11
Green beans                   1                 6
These projections are based on Model 4, Table 1. In reality, production
would be more diversified and would include nearly all types of vegetables
listed in Table 2. Given its favorable ecology and experience in producing
and marketing winter vegetables, Morocco should give even greater consider-
ation to:



ANNEX 6
Page 3
(a) diversification in accordance with market preferences;
(b)  shifting export production to the November to April period
when there is little competition from producers within the
Common Market; and
(c) developing markets outside France which at present takes
80% or more of Moroccan export vegetables.
If Morocco moves in this direction, there should be no problem of marketing
the incremental output generated by this subproject.

DAIRY FARM DEVELOPMENT
Marketable Supplies and Milk Processing Capacity
1.        Morocco's annual milk production from all sources (cows, sheep,
goats) for 1967/68 was estimated at 300,000 tons. Only 13% of this (40
million 1. in 1969) was received by pasteurizing plants in major urban markets,
utilizing approximately 65% of their pasteurizing capacity:

These receipts do not include:
(a) substantial quantities sold in the same and other markets by
street vendors;
(b) small quantities received for pasteurization in smaller
urban and rural centers, not unimportant in the aggregate;
and
(c) quantities received in the newly opened Meknes plant
(20,000 1. daily processing capacity).
2.        Milk production in the modern sector is concentrated around the
major urban markets. Well established commercial herds range in size be-
tween 10 and 30 dairy cows, although a few producers have larger herds.
A different production pattern has developed in newly irrigated regions
(Doukkala, Tadla, Gharb and Basse-Moulouya). Government, through its Com-
pagnie Marocaine de Gestion des Exploitations Agricoles (COMAGRI), has dis-
tributed in-calf heifers (mainly Friesian, but also Tarantaise and Red-and-
White) to small producers who keep up to five cows. Government has sup-
ported these schemes through artificial insemination, technical assistance
and milk marketing services. The small producers have been fairly success-
ful and COMAGRI plans to expand its heifer distribution program. In some



ANNEX 7
Page 2
regions (mainly Tadla), marketing problems have arisen because of seasonal
fluctuation in milk production among these small producers. They can be
overcome by (a) a breeding and feeding program that is more evenly distributed
throughout the seasons; and (b) a pricing system that rewards farmers who
maintain a high production level during the low production months. Government
is aware of these problems and is considering appropriate steps and educa-
tional programs.
Availability of Dairy Heifers
3.        Aside from some privately arranged importations, COMAGRI has
been the main importer and distributor of dairy heifers:

In April 1972, COMAGRI had about 2,000 dairy cows in its own stables.  The
offspring of COMAGRI stock will be available for (a) replacement and expansion
of COMAGRI stock; (b) distribution to small farmers in irrigated areas and land
settlement schemes; and (c) individual farmers outside these schemes, including
those investing under the dairy sub-project. Thus it is estimated that COMkGRI
will supply about half of about 1,800 dairy heifers required for investment
under the subproject. In addition, about 200 to 250 heifers are imported
annually by farmers obtaining CNCA loans or by private agents. Provision must
therefore be made for financing the foreign exchange cost of importing about
900 heifers.
Demand for Milk
4.        No reliable statistics exist on national milk consumption, or
even for the major urban markets. Traditional milk vendors continue to play
an important role. Pasteurizing plants, which vary the proportion of re-
constituted milk powder, depending on seasonal supply/demand conditions,
hesitate to disclose all relevant information. In these circumstances
Government finds it difficult to implement effective milk marketing regula-
tions. Changes in the regulations are being contemplated, pending a recently
initiated market study by UNDP/FAO experts.
5.        Data on pasteurized milk sales by the Centrale Laitiere Maroc-
Lait, the largest plant, selling in Casablanca and smaller urban markets,
indicate the rising demand for pasteurized milk.

These results have been achieved in strong competition with milk vendors
and other pasteurizing plants. Maroc-Lait has modernized its plants by
installing three "Tetrapak" units and special equipment for modern packaging
of fruit-flavored yogurt and "raibi", a traditional buttermilk-flavored
drink. Quantities and value of Maroc-Lait's sales in the Casablanca market,
for which most farmers investing under the subproject would produre, reflect
strong and rising demand:

ANNEX 7

These prices have risen only slightly in recent years. While generally ade-
quate for farmers, smaller producers have found it more profitable to channel
part of their sales to street vendors when periods of low production have
coincided with periods of high demand; conversely, they have sent surpluses
in high production periods to Maroc-Lait.  Processors, on the other hand,
have found it difficult and costly to cope with seasonal fresh milk sur-
pluses, due to excessive importations of dry milk and butter. Aware of this
problem, Government (in December 1970) shifted milk powder from the free
import list to that of controlled imports. Other policy changes would de-
pend on recommendations of the milk marketing study (para 4).
Investment under Subproject
7.        Investment categories to be financed under the subproject would be
for (a) pump irrigation to ensure year-round forage supplies, (b) stable and
milk handling facilities, (c) forage harvesting equipment, and (d) purchase
of in-calf heifers. Basic assumptions, net farm cash flow and loan cash
flow are shown in Table 1.

MOROCCO
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
BEEF CATTLE AND SHEEP FATTENING
Production and Supply of Meat
1.        Morocco's national herd in 1968 was estimated at 3.3 million cat-
tle, 15 million sheep, 8 million goats, 214,000 camels, and 345,000 horses
and mules. Its management regime relies on nomadic utilization of 7.5
million ha largely arid pastures, 5 million ha forest and, in addition,
seasonal pastures of cropland. Some nomadic herders keep their animals
mainly for family consumption as they have little contact with the market
economy. Offtake is fairly low, thus pastures are overstocked and quality
of slaughtered animals is low.
2.        The number slaughtered in inspected abattoirs and meat supplied
therefrom for 1967 and 1968 is shown below:

Meat Consumption
3.        Net exports or Imports are negligible.  Based on rather crude
assumptions that all meat from inspected abattoirs was consumed exclusively
by the non-rural population (about 5 million), available meat supplies
(beef and mutton) were 10.6 and 14.4 kg per capita of urban population in
1967 and 1968, respectively, not a high consumption level.
Prices
4.        Statistics on farm prices of live cattle and sheep do not exist.
According to farm interviews, farm prices range from DH 2.8 to DH 3.4/kg
of live cattle and from DH 3.0 to DH 3.8/kg of lamb or fattened sheep.
Meat prices (on the hook), Casablanca Abattoir, were:
1966    1967    1968    1969    1970
Hutton:  high      7.28    7.60    7.70    8.40    8.70
low      4.65    4.12    5.32    6.20    5.80
Beef:    high      5.20    5.00    5.00    5.42    6.00
low      3.27    3.40    4.20    4.44    4.90
The rising trend during a period with otherwise fairly stable prices indi-
cates a strong demand for meat.  Monthly meat price statistics show rela-
tively small price fluctuations, except for mutton for which the seasonal
demand is highest prior to the Ramadan feast.
Marketing
5.        Livestock markets are held regularly every one to two weeks in
rural centers and there is active trading on market days. Animals are nor-
mally moved on the hoof, except for some trucking from small rural to larger
urban markets. The portion of animals killed in Government-inspected abat-
toirs is estimated at 59% for cattle, 45% for sheep and 23% for goats.
Investments
6.        Investments under the proposed subproject would be for stables to
facilitate fattening of cattle and sheep. The Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCA) would complement this investment credit by short-term loans
mainly for purchase of feeder cattle and sheep. These loans would encour-
age simple fattening operations which have become popular with many farmers,
including those on medium- and small-scale farms. Feeder stock is put to
pasture for a few weeks, thereafter barn-fed with a mixture of barley,
pulses, wheat bran and sugar beet pulps, supplemented by straw. After about
three months of barn feeding, the animals are sold for slaughter. Basic
assumptions, farmers' net cash flow and loan cash flow are shown in Model



ANNEX 8
Page 3
6, Table 1. By encouraging feeding operations, this subproject would help
increase demand for feeder stock. This would facilitate the flow of stock
from the traditional sector which would then increasingly benefit from
trade with the market economy. The urban market can easily absorb the
incremental annual output of about 3,400 tons of beef and mutton.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        All inputs were valued at market cost.  Two basic rates of return
are calculated, as shown in Table 1, to estimate returns from the project
of the economy. The first rate is based on current prices, the second on
real prices reduced by 10% below current levels, in line with projected
1975 world prices adjusted for transportation to and distribution cost
within Morocco. The respective rates of return were 18% and 16%. Economic
rates for individual sub-projects, based on current prices, range from 17%
on beef cattle and sheep fattening to 40% on winter vegetables.
Rates of Return
Current Prices         Cereal Prices - 10%
Incremental production value:       +10%       30%                  27%
(due to variation in yield
or prices)                           -10%      10%                    8%
Incremental operating cost:         +10%       12%                  11%
-10%      27%                  24%
Investment and replacement
cost:                                +10%      16%                   14%
-10%      23%                  20%
The above rates are satisfactory.
2.        The benefit streams do not take into account:
(a)  value added to fruit and vegetables in packaging, processing
and other marketing activities;
(b)  demonstration effects of the project on non-participating
farmers; and
(c)  strengthening of CNCA's financial and manpower resources.
