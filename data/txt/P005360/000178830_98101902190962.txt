REPORT AND RECOMbENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 01N
A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
AND A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE CAISSE NATIONALE DE CREDIT AGRICOLE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM-OF MOROCCO
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
development credit for the equivalent of $10 million to the Kingdom of
Morocco, and on a proposed loan to the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole
(CNCA) for the equivalent of $24 million with the guarantee of the Kingdom
of Morocco. The Credit and Loan would help finance a three-year program
for agricultural development through medium and long-term credits provided
by Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA). The development credit
would be on standard IDA terms. The Government would make its proceeds
available to CNCA for use under the agricultural credit program and would
leave the funds permanently with CNCA as a Government capital contribution.
The loan would have a term of 15 years, including four years of grace, with
interest at 7.25 percent per year.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pro-
spects of Morocco" (Sec. R 71-222) was distributed on September 20, 1971.
An economic mission visited Morocco in April. Its findings are reflected
in the present Report. The Government has asked the Bank to review the
next five-year Development Plan (1973-77) presently in preparation. The
Bank intends to organize a basic economic mission for this purpose as soon
as the preparation of the new Plan is sufficiently advanced, possibly in
the spring of 1973.
Characteristics
3.        Forming for centuries a well defined geographical unit between the
Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the Atlas mountains and the Sahara, Morocco has
developed a distinctive civilization with a traditional monarchy. Inde-
pendence was achieved in 1956, after 44 years as a French protectorate. The
Government is highly centralized with supreme power held by King Hassan II,
who acceded to the throne in 1961. Arab-Berber cultures are predominant, and
conservative Islamic tradition, in which the King is the religious as well
as the political leader, remains an important unifying force. France left a
deep imprint on culture, business and administration, and French is the pre-
vailing langtuage in government circles, and in education above the primary
level.



-2-
4.        In the period since independence the traditional social and polit-
ical order has been essentially maintained while the economic structure began
to change gradually. Traditional subsistence rainfed agriculture still ab-
sorbs more than half of the active population. A small but growing modern
type agriculture provides a substantial part of the commercialized agricul-
tural production. Phosphate mining has remained the major industrial
activity. The relative importance of manufacturing industry is growing
only slowly and is oriented toward import substitution. The traditional
crafts and trades provide substantial employment and supply the Moroccan
population as well as a growing number of tourists. Construction of hotels
and the fast growing tourism traffic have made tourism the most dynamic sec-
tor of the economy. In 1971 foreign exchange earnings from tourism amounted
to $151 million; from phosphate, $117 million; from workers remittances, $95
million; and from citrus exports, $77 million. Major constraints to balanced
economic growth continue to be the vulnerability of agriculture to drought,
low savings, and insufficient dynamism of the private sector, especially in
industry. Unemployment in cities and on the countryside is high and large
differences in cultural and economic level between regions and population
groups exist. Rapid growth of the population aggravates the problems.
Policies
5.        The objectives pursued by successive governments since independence
include: (i) acceleration of economic growth; (ii) preservation of social and
political stability; and (iii) promotion of "Moroccanization", i.e. a larger
share for Moroccan ownership and management in foreign-owned land, commer-
cial and financial companies, and selected industries.
6.        The moroccanization policy has been consistent but moderate.    For-
eign businesses have not been nationalized with the exception of the take-over
in 1963 of land held under concession by foreign owners. The number of for-
eigners declined from 400,000 in 1960 to 100,000 in 1971. "Moroccanization"
of the services sector implies the gradual increase of the share of Moroccan
capital and labor in foreign-owned commercial, financial and transport con-
cerns, often associated with an expansion of capital. At the same time new
foreign investment in industry, tourism and mining continues to be encouraged
by the Government. Other recent economic measures include: tariff cuts and
trade liberalization on the occasion of Morocco's association with the Common
Market, slight increases in long term interest rates applied by certain fi-
nancial institutions to reflect better the opportunity cost of capital, and
increase in tariffs for water supply helping to increase public savings in
that sector.
7.        The political and social structures have been resistant to change,
but the Government recognizes that their stability is increasingly in question
unless growth and change are achieved at a more rapid pace, and are accom-
panied by a more equal income distribution. In recent speeches, the King has
stressed several social-economic objectives, in particular redistribution of
income, creation of jobs, land distribution, extension of education and reform
of administration and justice. A new constitution has been enacted and a Gov-
ernment formed to prepare elections which would provide a wider basis for the



-3-
next administration. The Government has increased civil servants basic
salaries and workers minimum wages by 15 percent, extended family allowances,
introduced a modest progressive income tax and reduced the price of sugar, an
important consumption item of the low income classes. It intends to accel-
erate the distribution of ex-colon land, to extend pension and health insurance
schemes, to embark on a wide-scale replacement of slum areas, and to help set
up small farms.
Development Plan
8.        The 1968-72 Development Plan is nearing completion and a new five-
year Plan (1973-1977) is under preparation. During the present Plan period
the production growth in most sectors has surpassed the Plan targets substan-
tially:
(percent average annual growth)
Actual    Plan
1968-71 Targets
Agriculture                           6.4      2.1
Energy                                7.2      5.4
Mining                                2.1      7.9
Industry and Handicraft               5.7      4.3
Building and public works             5.9      8.5
Non-government services               5.4      4.6
Total (government services excluded) 5.6       4.3
9.        Results in agriculture appear better than they really were because
of a mediocre crop in the base year.   But even taking more normal periods as
a base, the average growth of agricultural output has been about 3.5 percent,
well above expectations. Only mining fell below the Plan target, largely
because competition on the world phosphate market depressed production, and
1971 output was only three quarters of the volume planned. Prospects have
recently improved and the Government phosphate company expects to reach the
plan target in 1973. Most other mining declined due to depletion of re-
sources. The political events of tnid-summer 1971 had lindted immediate ef-
fect on the overall growth rate. The acceleration in manufacturing output
and construction activity was interrupted, but good weather helped to in-
crease agricultural output. Total production increased by 5 percent in real
terms, only slightly lower than that of the preceding three years.
10.       The volume of total fixed investment increased by 6 percent annual-
ly during the 1968-71 period, slightly lower than was assumed in the Plan.
Central Government investments accounted for about half of the total and was
close to the targets wlicth were revised upward in 1969. About 70 percent of
the Government investment program in agriculture was allocated to large scale
irrigation schemes. While dam construction proceeded on schedule, Land
preparation lagged behind and progress with regard to rairfed agriculture and



-4 -
livestock was slow. Construction of power stations is in line with Plan tar-
gets. Other government investments did not differ by more 'than 10 percent
from Plan targets except for delays in investments for urban development,
health, education and communications.
11.       Since 'the abortive coup of July 1971, many private investors seem
to be awaiting the outcome of the political reorganization which is under
way, and public investments have also been stagnant largely due to some re-
consideration of policies and changes in cabinet and civil service. Total
fixed capital formation in 1971 dropped by about 2 percent in real terms and
represented 14.1 percent of GDP. Consumer demand was sustained by good crops
and *the social measures taken by the Government since mid-1971. 'The impact
of these measures on government savings was offset by better performance of
public enterpirses, while the good crops and remittances from emigrant workers
stimulated private savings.. However, total gross national savings remain
around 12 percent of GDP, which is low for a 'country at Morocco's stage of
development. The current account deficit was reduced from $144 million to
$78 million, and thanks to larger public capital inflow and SDR allocation,
the reserve position improved and reached a level tbf $235 million in March
1972, equivalent to about two and a half months of imports of goods.
Development Prospects
12.       Appropriate fiscal, monetary and trade policies could ensure that
GDP will continue to grow at about 5 percent per year until 19i7. However,
to achieve this modest target, per capita annual consumption'would have to
be limited to 1.5 percent. This would not be easy in view of the increased
attention given by the Government to social progress, but would be necessary
because a growth rate of 5 percent would require savings and investments to
be raised from about 12 percent and 14 percent of GDP respectively to 14 per-
cent and 17 percent of GDP in 1977. The other growth assumptions could prob-
ably be achieved without major difficulty. On the basis of present trends,
foreign aid disbursements in 1977 might be projected as follows, although the
actual flows will depend on future commitments still to be made by the respec-
tive donors:



-5-
(million of dollars)
Annual Average     Actual     Projection
1966/68 1969/71     1971         1977

France                               (39)    (27)       (30)         (54)

Net Official Flow                     78      93        105          120
13.       While the above projections appear feasible, the Government's tar-
gets are likely to be more ambitious. It is considering an annual growth
target of 6.5 percent for the next Five-Year Plan, and is working out its
implications. These would clearly include stronger growth of gross national
savings and additional foreign aid. If more aid could be obtained, it would
be desirable for it to be on concessionary terms, since the terms of -aid
which is already in prospect are likely to deteriorate as a result of the
decline in grants, especially from the United States, and of the increase in
mediun-term credits wihich would be the normal form of part of the projected
larger French aid.
External Debt
14.       Disbursed foreign debt is at present $804 million and may grow to
about $1 ,500 million in 1977. The debt service ratio may rise from 8.9 per-
cent in 1971 to 12 percent in 1977 and further thereafter. While Morocco
remains creditworthy for substantial additional loans on conventional terms,
a substantial proportion of new external assistance should be made available
on concessional terms if the growth of the debt service burden is to be re-
strained in the long run. The share of the Bank Group in Morocco's total
outstanding external debt is increasing. From about 7 percent at the end of
1968 it had reaclhed 10 percent at the end of 1971 and may rise to 20 percent
by the end of 1975. Projects already approved and those under consideration
would lead to disbursements equivalent to about one-fifth of Morocco's pro-
jected foreign capital needs in the mid-seventies.



-6-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
15.       Bank and IDA lending since the first Bank group project in 1962
amounts to $211.4 million, net of cancellations, for 12 projects, three of
which were financed under IDA credits totalling $28.4 million.    These loans
have helped finance industry ($85 million), agriculture ($71.1 million),
transportation ($14.6 million), education ($10.5 million), and tourism ($17
million). IFC has made investments totalling $2.4 million in the Banque
Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) and a canning factory.
Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC in-
vestments as of,: May 31, 1972 and notes on the execution of on-going proj-
ects with particular reference to those which are encountering problems.
16.       The Bank group strategy is to respond to the requirements of
Morocco's economic and social objectives, which appear in line with most
previous Bank recommendations. Specifically the Bank group program aims at
assisting Morocco in maintaining a growth of GDP at roughly 5 percent per
year, the rate achieved in the recent past, financing key projects in prior-
ity sectors, and devising and implementing policies to limit unempiloyment,
develop agriculture and improve urban and rural living conditions. It con-
templates primarily lending from the Bank, but with some blending of IDA
funds, as in the present case, in order to moderate the build up of external
debt service requirements. In the last three years Bank and IDA lending
ranged between $45 and $75 million. Projects now in course of preparation
could lead to a higher level of lending over the next two or three years, but
this much depends upon Morocco's capacity to prepare projects, upon solving
the difficulties encountered in creating new institutions or in improving ex-
isting ones and upon finding competent management.
Sectors and Projects
17.       The, key sectors on which the Bank concentrates its action are agri-
culture, touzism, urban infrastructure, industry for export and transport.
Amongst these key sectors, agriculture and urban infrastructure provide spe-
cial opportunities to help devise and implement policies responding to the
Government's new emphasis on social development.
18.       In agriculture the proposed $34 million second financing for agri-
cultural credit would help develop modern farming. The problems of tradi-
tional agriculture would be dealt with through a project for the integrated
development of rainfed agriculture now being prepared with the help of
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program; this project would combine consolidation,
basic infrastructure, soil preparation and credit, and could have a substan-
tial effect on rural underemployment. It may be ready for consideration by
FY 1974. A study of the Oum er Rbia basin development was recently com-
pleted in cooperation with the Bank, and an irrigation scheme is now under
preparation. Originally planned for financing in FY 1972, it has been post-
poned to FY 1974 because of delays in initiating the feasibility studies.
The Bank is also helping the Government define and prepare a project to de-
velop the production of off-season fruits and vegetables for export.



19.       Tourism has become the largest source of foreign exchange for
Morocco and its further expansion should help finance the substantial imports
necessary for future development. The Bank finances the Moroccan development
bank for hotels (CIR) for which a second loan of $15 million will shortly be
presented to the Executive Directors. The Bank might also well be Executing
Agency for a proposed UNDP study which could lead to a tourism infrastructure
project for FY 1974. Finally the Bank is helping the Government to coordinate
a number of other studies and reviews of the sector.
20.       Urban infrastructure projects include one for bulk water supply in
the Casablanca-Rabat region for which a $48 million loan will be presented
shortly to the Executive Directors, to be followed by a second project in
FY 1974.  A Bank sector mission has recently reviewed the Government's pro-
posed urbanization policies and identified a site and service project which
may be ready for financing in FY 1974. Finally, a power project planned for
FY 1973 is designed to meet urban needs.
21.       The Government is now placing more emphasis on exports.   The Bank
has assisted this orientation through an industrial review completed 18
months ago and is now helping define the required policies and the measures
to implement them, particularly in manufacturing and mining. In this line,
the Bank is considering two proposed loans for FY 1973, i.e. a sixth loan to
the industrial development bank (BNDE) and a loan for a phosphoric acid plant
whose production would be entirely exported.
22.       Morocco's transport network requires some expansion to meet grow-
ing needs. After a first loan to finance the road between Marrakesh and
Agadir and a transport survey, a transport sector mission visited the country
in late 1971.  A second road project is now under preparation for presentation
in FY 1973.  A port expansion project may also be ready for FY 1974.
23.       Education represents a major bottleneck in Morocco's development:
students represent a low proportion of the school age population, the pro-
portion of drop-outs is high, curricula are not well adapted to economic de-
velopment, graduates are too frequently unable to use the skills acquired
and, as a result, unrest in the student population is high, leading to
strikes and a further lowering of the standard of education. If this dete-
rioration is allowed to continue social stability could be affected while
the qualified personnel needed to insure economic expansion would be lacking.
Projects for education in Morocco undoubtedly have a high priority; two cred-
its already have been made and another is planned for BY 1974. However, its
presentation will depend on a substantial improvement in the execution of the
first two projects and on the completion of the study of higher education
whose financing is included in the second credit (Annex I C. para. 1).
Other Assistance
24.       A Consultative Group for Morocco was formed in April 1967.   The
Group is chaired by the Bank and includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Kuwait, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United kingdom, United



- 8 -
States, IMF, UNDP, OECD/DAC, African Development Bank and European Invest-
ment Bank.  At its last meeting, in October 1971, the Group welcomed Gov-
ernment's new policies and affirmed continued support.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
25.       Agriculture in Morocco contributes about one fourth of GDP, while
the rural population amounts to about 10 million, or about 65 percent of the
total population. Major farm areas are between the Atlantic Coast and the
Atlas mountains where annual rainfall averages 400 to 600 mm. Only about 3/4
of the cultivable area is used in any one year, because traditional methods
of cultivation and climatic conditions require extensive fallows. Major
crops are cereals and citrus; livestock and fruits and vegetables have good
prospects.
26.       There are no recent figures on farm ownership; it has been esti-
mated, that 90 percent of farm families hold less than 1/3 of the arable land
of which 2/3 are in farms of less than 10 hectares. Small farms in the tra-
ditional sector suffer from inadequate agricultural practices, and their pro-
duction is particularly subject to the vagaries of the weather. Considerable
rural underemployment contributes to migration to urban centers and foreign
countries. The modern sector comprises about 1/5 of the cultivated area,
produces most of the cash and export crops and consist mainly of medium and
large farms, often using mechanized techniques. From 1963 to 1970, agrictulture
as a whole grew at a rate of 2.8 percent per year, as compared with 3.6 percent
for the overall economy and 9 percent for modern agriculture. The principal
reason of these disparities is the low productivity of the subsistence-oriented
traditional sector.
Land Reform
27.       In line with its growing emphasis onE social-economic objectives,
the Government has paid increasing attention to the problems of land tenure
and of attaining viable farm sizes. About 250,000 hectares formerly farmed
by foreign settlers are to be redistributed to small farmers and landless
laborers. Land reform in the irrigated zones is the main objective of the
agricultural investment code published in 1969. From 1966 to 1968, about
24,000 ha were distributed. An additional 75,000 ha were to be distributed
from 1969 to 1972, and the Government has announced its intention to accel-
erate the distribution of formerly foreign-held land. Another measure in-
volving about 34,000 hectares aims at the consolidation of small holdings
into economic units.
Major Products
28.       Cereals are the most important crop but there is a chronic deficit
in soft wheat. Import requirements vary from year to year depending on
the weather. Over the past five years, despite better than average harvests,



-9-
the deficit averaged about 500,000 t per year, or about a $50 million worth
of imports. By the end of the decade, Morocco could be self sufficient in
cereals if the appropriate technology, based on seeds, fertilizers and mech-
anization were applied. This would require considerable effort and invest-
ment.
29.       Morocco is one of the leading Mediterranean suppliers of citrus
and citrus exports represent nearly one third of agricultural exports.
Citrus growers have attained high standards in production techniques and
plantation management. Output and exports have grown at about 10 percent
per year over the last decade and present exports are about 600,000 t per
year worth about $100 million. More than one half of Morocco's citrus ex-
ports goes to EEC countries, and since the Association Agreement of Septem-
ber 1, 1969, Morocco has slightly increased its citrus exports to EEC coun-
tries other than France which always has taken, a large share. According to
a 1969 FAO study on citrus fruit, Morocco's potential for exports would make
it possible to increase the country's share of the world market to about 15
percent by 1980. This would imply a growth rate in output of 5.2 percent
which would require substantial investments in plantations.
30.       Market gardening in Morocco provides export revenues of about US$44
million, of which about half is represented by tomatoes. Given its favorable
climate and its experience in marketing vegetable, Morocco should find outlets
for the additional 50,no0 t that will be generated under the project.
31.       Because only a small share of milk produced is marketed through com-
mercial channels, an assessment of the supply-demand situation is difficult.
There are indications, however, of a rising demand in urban centers, while
production suffers from strong seasonal fluctuations sometimes compounded by
excessive import of dairy products.
Policies
32.       Under the current 1968-72 Development Plan, government investment in
agriculture accounted for about $94 million annually, of vhich $65 million for
irrigation, and $17 million for progressive improvement of traditional rainfed
agriculture and livestock development. Bank Group contribution to the agri-
cultural investment program consisted of the Sebou irrigation project and the
first agricultural credit project which is described below (para. 35).
33.       The Government seems now prepared to give more emphasis to rainfed
agriculture, small scale irrigation and livestock, which is in accordance
with economic priorities. A proposed UNDP study for a Water Master Plan with
the Bank as Executing Agency should eventually provide the basis for a more
rational resource allocation to irrigation. The Government is also acceler-
ating land distribution in the Sebou project area. A Bank agricultural sec-
tor review planned for the spring of 1973 should also help in defining agri-
cultural development strategy.



- 10 -
Agricultural Credit
34.       In 1962, the Government established a new agricultural credit system
under which CNCA provides short-term advances as well as medium- and long-term
credit to commercial farmers. It also operates the Caisses Locales de Credit
Agricoles (CLCA) which provide seasonal and longer term credit to smaller
farmers under simplified procedures. Limited advances to subsistence farmers
are made through Societes Agricoles de Prevoyance (SOCAP), separate institu-
tions which do not operate on a commercial basis. In 1971, these credit in-
stitutions together with commercial banks made about 230,000 farm loans.
35.       The Bank's first Agricultural Credit Loan in Morocco (Loan 433-MOR),
in an amount of $10 million, was.signed in 1966. It was for a three-year
agricultural development project, with a total cost of about $26 million,
covering medium and long-term loans to farmers and institutions for machinery,
equipment, processing and storage facilities, to help improve agricultural
productivity. Part A of the project consisted of on-farm development and
Part B of equipment loans for Centrale de Gestion des Exploitations Agricoles
(GCEA), the agency responsible for managing land taken over from foreign set-
tlers.  Initial progress on the project was disappointing.  On-farm invest-
ment loans lagged behind schedule, mainly because of CNCA's shortage of quali-
fied personnel; moreover, the credit policies followed by CLCA, 'seriously af-
fected CNCA's financial soundness. Part B was used satisfactorily until CGEA
was dissolved and its assets transferred to provincial authorities. Because
of these developments, withdrawals under Part A were suspended and the bal-
ance of Part B amounting to $0.2 million equivalent cancelled in February
1968, indicated at that time to the Executive Directors (R68-38). Eventually,
CNCA's and CLCA's accounts were separated, lending programs revised, staff
was strengthened and disbursements under Part A resumed in September 1968
(R68-167), and were completed in September 1969.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       The proposed Second Agricultural Credit Project was prepared by
CNCA and the IBRD/FAO Cooperative Program; it was first appraised by a Bank
mission in November-December 1970. Negotiations were delayed until April
1972 because of the discussions between the Bank and the Government of
Morocco on the question of appropriate interest rates for CNCA's lending.
The initial appraisal of the project was updated and negotiations took place
in Washington on April 10-14, 1972. CNCA was represented by Mr. Lahlou,
General Manager and Mr. El Mesmoudi, General Inspector; the Government was
represented by Messrs. M. Tazi and Ben Mansour of the Ministry of Finance
and MIr. Belkoura of the Prime Minister's Office.
Description
37.       The project would be a three-year program for the developmrent of
farms selected for their development potential and priority. It would help



finance medium and long-term investments for mechanization of grain farms
in rainfed areas, citrus development through groundwater and plantation de-
velopment, winter vegetable production, livestock development and packers'
marketing facilities mainly for export produce. Total expected investment
amount to about $69 million of which more than 50 percent would be for
tractors and other farm machinery, about 22 percent for citrus plantation
development and about 13 percent for winter vegetable production. The
project would involve about 8,000 loans to individual farmers, groups of
farms and operators of packing facilities. Farms receiving loans would
range in size from 5 to 50 ha on irrigated land, or from 15 to 200 ha on
dry land. A description of the project is given in Annex III to this Re-
port. The Appraisal Report (No. PA-95, dated May 15, 1972), is being
circulated to the Executive Directors separately.
Execution
38.       The proceeds of the loan and credit are expected to be committed
over three years starting September 1, 1972, coinciding with the start of
the planting season. The project will be administered by CNCA, a public
credit institution responsible to the Minister of Agriculture who heads its
Board of Administration.   The Chief Executive is the General Manager who is
appointed by a joint decree of the Ministers of Agriculture and Finance.
CNCA is well organized, with 17 regional offices in the major agricultural
provinces. Staff has more than doubled over the past five years and is
generally well qualified. There is an active internal training program at
all levels and, as a result, the last expatriate left this year. Lending
procedures provide that responsibility for loans below DR 40,000 (equiva-
lent to US$8,700) Is delegated to the regional offices, while loans above
that level have to be approved by the head office; these procedures oper-
ate efficiently.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
39.       Total project cost is estimated at DH 320 million (equivalent to
US$69 million), with a foreign exchange component of US$34 million (49 per-
cent) which would be met by the proposed Loan/Credit. These estimates are
based on prices to. farmers of the goods to be financed and therefore include
duties and taxes amounting to about $5.7 million. The Bank loan would be
made to CNCA, to be repaid in 15 years including four years of grace. The
proceeds of the IDA credit would be made available by the Government to CNCA
as part of the Government contribution to CNCA's equity. CNCA would contrib-
ute 21 percent of project cost from its own resources. Thus subloans to
farmers made by CNCA from Bank/IDA and own resources would amount to 70 per-
cent of project cost. Farmers and other borrowers would contribute the bal-
ance of 30 percent. The Government would carry the foreign exchange risk on
the Loan and Credit.



- 12-
Financial Position
40.       At the close of its last fiscal year, August 31, 1971, CNCA's
total resources were about DII 365 million (equivalent to $72 million at
the exchange rate then prevailing) of which 36 percent came from capital
grants from Government and reserves; 13 percent, from a special liquida-
tion account for government operations carried out by CMCA; 13 percent
from the first Bank loan and 38 percent from short-term resources, mainly
rediscounts and deposits. CNCA has been raising funds from individual de-
posits in rural areas since 1970. Financial results including government
operations carried out by CNCA in 1967-71 show a satisfactory operating
position.  Administrative costs averaged less than 3 percent of the capital
employed. Over the period 1967-71, total income on the combined CNCA and
government operations averaged 6.3 percent of total capital employed, and
return on equity, quasi-equity, and general reserve averaged 1.8 percent.
In 1971, these ratios were respectively 6.2 percent and 2.8 percent. The
debt/equity ratio was 1:3.9 at the end of 1971. The repayment record was
good, and provisions adequate in respect of CNCA's own operations.
41.       Recoveries on CNCA's loans made under the direction of Government
remained unsatisfactory, and the Government has now agreed to separate these
operations from those made by CNCA proper so that all costs accruing to CNCA
in connection with Government operations be chargeable to Government. An-
other immediate requirement is to strengthen CNCA's capital structure. To
this end, the Government would authorize CNCA to transfer DI-I 44 million from
the special liquidation account, referred to above, to equity capital, and
would contribute the proceeds of the IDA Credit (DII 46 million) to CNCA as
equity. This additional equity capital together with increased medium and
long-term debt, and deposits would enable CNCA to expand its medium and long-
term lending with limited reliance on short-term resources.
42.       A third basic requirement is the increase of interest rates applied
to CNCA's loans. Public credit in Morocco is traditionally made at preferen-
tial rates, in particular for agriculture. CNCA's lending rate was already
raised to 6.5 percent in connection with the first Bank loan (February 1966),
and a further increase is now both possible and desirable. Higher rates
should foster a better allocation of resources and are well below commercial
farmers' financial rates of return which range between 20 percent and 43 per-
cent. Continuation of existing rates would have implied substantial subsi-
dization of investments in mechanization by medium and larger farmers. Fur-
thermore, CNCA's overall financial stability also requires an increase in
its interest receipts; the cost of resources to CNCA and its administrative
costs are bound to increase substantially over the next few years, and pre-
sent earnings would not be sufficient to cover such increases. The Govern-
ment has therefore agreed to adopt a two-stage interest rate structure based
on the assessment of farmers' taxable income. Farmers whose annual taxable
income exceeds DH 6,000 and all borrowers for mechanization loans (other than
groups or cooperatives having an average taxable income of less than ER 4,000)
would be charged 8 percent. For farmers with a taxable income below DH 6,000,
the present rate of 6.5 percent would be continued. These smaller farmers



- 13 -
will absorb less than 20 percent of the total amount of the Loan!Credit (i.e.,
$6.8 million).  CNCA's income on its own operations only is expected to rise
from i6.0 percent of average capital employed in 1971 to 7.5 percent In 1976.
Return on equity, quasi-equity, and general reserves, derived from CNCA's own
operations, is expected to rise from 2.2 in 1971 to 3.8 percent by 1976.
Procurement
43.       The range of items to be financed is wide, and the quantities to
be procured by Individual farmers are small and would not be suitable for
bulk procurement under international competitive bidding. The main types
of equipment are tractors and attachments, combines, and pump sets which
would be purchased through commercial channels. Major farm machinery manu-
facturers from at least six Bank member countries are represented in
Morocco, their prices are competitive and they have adequate after-sale
services through well established dealer networks. As a result of the 1906
Act of Algeciras, Morocco has no preferential tariffs, despite its associa-
tion with the European Economic Community. Farm buildings are constructed
by local artisans or contractors. Dairy development would require about
1,800 in-calf heifers, which would be partly supplied from Government and
private dairy farms; however, not all Project requirements would be readily
available locally. Provision has therefore been made for importing about
900 heifers through existing livestock procurement channels which are satis-
factory.
Disbursement
44.       Bank/IDA would reimburse 70 percent of CNCA sub-loans.  Disburse-
ment amounts by categories are detailed in Annex III to this report. Wfhile
CNCA's commitments under the lending program would be made over three years,
disbursements to borrowers would require about 3-1/2 years.  Assuming a tim.e
lag of six months between CNCA diabursement to borrowers and IERD/IDA dis-
bursements to CNCA, Bank/IDA disbursement is expected to take about four
years.
Economic Rate of Return
45.       The Project would expand financial support for both commercial
farmers in the modern sector, and agrarian reform cooperatives, thus assist-
ing small farmers in making the transition from the traditional to the modern
sector. By encouraging investment and modernization it would help accelerate
growth in agriculture which, for the last decade, has grown more slowly than
the overall economy.
46.       The Project's overall rate of return to the economy, based on an
average life of 20 years of project investments (30 years for citrus) is es-
timated at about 18 percent if based on present prices, or 16 percent if
cereal prices were reduced by 10 percent in line with pTojected 1975 world
prices, adjusted for transportation and distribution in Morocco.  Financial
rates of return for illustrative farm models range from 20 to 43 percent.



- 14 -
47.       Incremental production generated by the Project would:    (a) re-
duce grain imports and result in annual import savings of about DII 63 mil-
lion (US$14 million); (b) generate additional export earnings of about DH
74 million (US$16 million) annually by 1980, and larger amounts thereafter,
through increased fresh citrus and vegetable exports; and (c) benefit
Mforocco's urban consumers and tourist industry through increased availa-
bility of meat and milk throughout the year. The overall impact on the
balance of payments would be substantial. Import substitution of cereals
and exports of citrus and vegetable, less foreign exchange required for
the replacement of equipment, operating cost and debt service, would be
equivalent to net foreign exchange savings of about US$15 million in 1980,
rising to DH 98 million (US$21 million) in 1985.
Employment
48.       The employment effect of the Project has been carefully reviewed.
While some of the increased labor requirements will take the form of increased
working hours by labor that is already employed, some will generate opportuni-
ties for employing additional people. The investments under the project,
other than mechanization, are expected to create employment for about 18,000
persons through citrus, vegetable and livestock development on about 4,000
farms. Additional employment would also be generated through marketing ac-
tivities, especially for exports.
49.       Tractors financed under the project would probably have a net
positive effect on employment.   While tractors reduce labor requirements for
the operations of land preparation and seeding when measured on a per unit
basis (per hectare planted or per quintal of output). They permit a substan-
tially larger area to be planted and result in higher yields because of much
better seed-bed preparation and because of the short period between the first
rains and the latest optimal planting time. When these changes in production
methods are combined with the higher levels of other inputs made possible by
improved land preparation, the resulting increase in activity and output tends
to increase direct, on-farm labor requirements over the cropping period. In
addition, it seems probable that the net effect on indirect employment oppor-
tunities will be positive in vie.w of the need for tractor maintenance and
supply services, and the increased marketing activities directly required by
increased output, as well as the multiplier effects on overall employmentof
the higher level output.
50.       The effect of mechanical grain harvesting on employment would de-
pend on whether the combines would be used to replace existing ones or to
mechanize grain harvesting in new areas. No displacement would result
through replacement of existing combines, which is estimated at 80 to 90
percent of combines provided for under the Project. The alternative of re-
verting to hand-harvesting on these farms must be ruled out because the
seasonal labor required for relatively short periods could not be mobilized.
On the other hand, combines financed under the Project which could replace
traditional harvesting (10 to 20 percent), would displace approximately 900
temporary 2-month jobs annually.

Ecological Risks
51.       To insure proper use of limited groundwater resoures, current
legislation requires ministerial approval for use of such water in excess
of 200 m3 per day. This approval will be required prior to CNCA granting
any loan for investments involving use of groundwater.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       A draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and CNCA, a draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Bank, a draft
Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Associa-
tion, a draft Project Agreement between the Association and CNCA, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the texts of draft resolutions approving the proposed loan and credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The provisions
of the draft loan and credit documents conform generally to those included
in agreements for agricultural credit projects.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.

C.      Projects in Execution
1.      Delays in disbursements of several loans and credits have been
caused mainly by cumbersome budgetary and accounting procedures, and
administrative inefficiency in submitting disbursement applications,
rather than by delays in the execution of the project. A Bank disburse-
ment officer visited Morocco last November to investigate the problems
and propose solutions. During the recent negotiations further improve-
ments and streamlining of procedure were agreed upon.
2.      Considerable delays have been, and still are, affecting the
execution of the education credits (79 and 266-MOR). Disbursements
under the first credit have been extremely slow and the Closing date
had to be extended twice, from the original date of June 30, 1971 to
March 31, 1973; disbursements under the second credit have not yet
started, ten months after signing. Project implementation has been
affected by inadequate management of the project unit, insufficient
control of construction works, departures from agreed procedures for
procurement, and lack of coordination. The higher education study
needed to prepare a proposed third loan is not yet started. Despite
numerous supervision missions, little progress has so far been achieved.
This situation is under constant review and a new schedule for project
implementation has just been sent to the Government.
3.      The Sebou irrigation loan (643-MoR) is progressing satisfactorily.
Redistribution of expropriated properties to small landowners started more
slowly than expected because of delays in enacting the necessary legis-
lation. Substantial cost increases on a number of important items are
becoming apparent and as soon as they are reviewed, the Bank will discuss
with the Government their consequence for the financing of the project.
4.      The first highway financing (167 and 642-MOR), mainly for the
Agadir-Marrakesh road, is progressing satisfactorily from a technical
standpoint. However, only $2.7 million has yet been withdrawn out of
a combined loan/credit amounting to $14.6 million. The Effective date
was March 16, 1970, and the Closing date is February 28, 197h. The
situation is being reviewed with the Government.
