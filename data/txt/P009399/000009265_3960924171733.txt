SECOND DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Report presents the results of a performance review of the
Second Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Project for which Credit No. 941-BD
of US$22 million was made to the Covernment of the People's Republic of
Bangladesh (GOB) in June 1979. The Credit became effective in November 1979
and was closed in June 1985. The implementing agency was the Dhaka Water
Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA).
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Urban and Water
Supply Division of the South Asia Projects Department, assisted by a
consultant who visited Dhaka briefly for this purpose in December 1984.  It
is based on information obtained from a review of the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 2443b-BD), the President's Report (No. P-2597-BD), the Credit and
Project Agreements, and other Reports related to Project Implementation. A
preliminary Project Completion Report (including project operating and
financial data) was prepared by DWASA and is incorporated in this Report.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower and Executing Agency for comments. Comments received were
reproduced as Attachment 1 to the report.

CREDIT 941-BD
SECOND DHARA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJTrCT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.   The Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) was established
in 1963 in conjunction with the first Association Credit for a Water
Supply and Sewerage Project in Dhaka. The First Project (Cr. 368-BD),
substantially revised in scope, was completed in 1978.
2.   The Second Project was conceived by DWASA and its consultants as a
technically straightforward expansion of water supply and sewerage
facilities. The Project also included the preparation of a revised
long-term development plan, the feasibility study for a recommended
Project, and training for DWASA staff (paras 2.01-2.03).
3.   The Project was appraised in December 1978.  Originally expected to be
completed by the end of 1982, the Project was actually completed by
mid-1985, including an increase of some 20X of most facilities (mainly
tubevells, watermains, water meters and sewers) in the Project. Several
overhead tanks, not expected to be utilized due to water shortages, were
eliminated from the Project. Shortages of local currency and the
increase in the project scale were the principal causes for the delay in
project completion (paras 3.02-3.04).
4.   Actual project costs totalled Taka 942.3 million (US$ 46.3 million)
compared to the appraisal estimate of Taka 645.6 million (US$ 41.7
million). *A total of US$ 20.4 million of the IDA Credit was disbursed
and US$ 1.6 million was cancelled (paras 3.09-3.11).
5.   Water production and sale.: more than doubled during the project period
and water production per capita increased steadily from about 85 to 128
litres daily by mid-1985. However unaccounted-for (including unbilled)
water remained very high, nearly equalling the quantity of water sold.
Despite improvements, DWASA continues to have problems in operating its
systems efficiently (paras 4.02, 7.03).
6.   The great increase in water production and tariff increases in 1979 and
1982 helped generate revenues in FY 1985 which were more than five times
(in current terms) those of FY 1979. Operating expenses rose almost as
fast, however, so DWASA reported operating deficits in every year and
was unable to meet the rate of return targets agreed at Appraisal (paras
5.02-5.08).
7.   DWASA and its consultants prepared a feasibility study for the Third
Project which has been appraised and was negotiated in April/May 1986
(para 3.15).

SECOND DHAKA WAT?R SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    IDA first became involved in the water supply and sewerage sector
in 1963, when Credits were originally made to Pakistan to help finance
Projects to improve sector services in the cities nf Dhaka and Chittagong.
Water Supply and Sewerage Authorities were established in both cities in 196.
to implement these Projects. In 1985, some 5.3 million of the estimated
(now) Bangladesh population of 98.1 million lived in Dhaka and Chittagong.
1.02    The provision of water supply and sanitation services throughout the
rest of Bangladesh is basically the responsibility of the Ministry of Local
Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives. The chairmen of the Water
Supply and Sewerage Arthorities in Dhaka and Chittagong report to this
Ministry.
1.03    The First Dhaka Project supported by IDA proved to be over-ambitious.
The original Credit of 1963 (368-PAK) was reduced from US$26.0 million to
US$13.2 nillion in 1969, at which time the water source for the Project was
changed to groundwater from surface water, in order to reduce costs. During
the Bangladesh war for independence, disbursements on the First Credit were
suspended in December 1971. In April 1973, an IDA Credit for the new
Government of Bangladesh (GOB) of US$13.2 million equivalent (368-BD)
replaced the original Credit; all funds were disbursed by March 1979. The
Project Performance Audit Report for the First Project (No. 3245,
December 1985) noted that water supply was increased substantially and
project physical targets were basically met but institutional and financial
objectives were not fully achieved.
1.C4    The Second Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Project was intended to
increase the capacity to meet the immed-.te needs of the people in the Dhaka
Metropolitan Area for potable water and to provide sewage disposal
facilities. The borrower for the IDA Credit of US$22.0 million equivalent
was the Republic of Bangladesh, with onlending to the Dhaka Water Supply arid
Sewerage Authority (DWASA). Credit 941-BD was signed on June 29, 1979.
Although the Project was scheduled for completion by December 1982, project
completion was delayed until June 1985, about two and a half years later than
,riginally envisaged, due mainly to long lead times required for procurement,
to shortages of local resources during the period of project implementation
and to a modest increase in the scale of the Project. (See Annex 1).

II.   PROJECT PREPARATION
Origin, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01   The First Project was originally based on a comprehensive master
plan prepared by consultants for water supply and sewerage in 1960.
The same consultants were involveu in supervision of the First Project
throughout the 1960s and 1970s. There was no provision in the First Project
for the preparation of a subsequent Project.
2.02    The Second Project was essentially conceived by DWASA, the
consultants and IDA staff as a straightforward, interim Project to be
implemented while a longer term Project was being planned. The appraisal
mission began work in Dhaka on relatively short notice in November 1978 after
a planned appraisal of a similar Project in Chittagong had been deferred 1/.
Several weeks previously DWASA had signed an agreement with the consultants
to prep;re an immediate needs Project. In December 1978, IDA committed
US$450,000 under the Second Technical Assistance Credit (622-BD) for
consultants to complete engineering and preparation of tender documents for
the proposed Project. The consultants report 2/ tias issued in September
1979, after the IDA Credit for the Second Project had already been agreed.
Project Objectives
2.03    The Project was to prevent a major water shortage for the population
in DWASA's service area during the next five years. Additional water was to
be provided to maintain a level of supply of about 90 lcd. The daily supply
would be increased by 40% from 214 mld to 300 mld. Complementary objectives
of the proposed Project, according to the President's Report, were:
(a) Extending the distribution system to an additional 300,000 people
who were without convenient access to safe water;
(b) Improving the quality of water service to about 600,000 present
consumers through removal of system deficiencies, mainly in the Old
City;
1/   The unexpected timing of the appraisal is indicated by the fact that
the final supervision mission of the First Project of October 1978
makes no mention of a subsequent Project.
2/   "Development Plan and Feasibility Study for Immediate Needs Project".



-3-
(c) Extending sewer service to about 300,000 inhabitants in areas
already served by trunk sewers constructed under the First Project;
(d) Preparing a long-term planning and feasibility study for a Third
Water Supply Project; and
(e)  Achieving institutional and financial improvements and developing
a training program.
Project Description
2.04    The Project included the supply and installation of facilities to
augment the water supply and extend the sewerage network, the quantities of
which were revised during the project period as follows:
Original         Revised
Water Supply
Tube Wells (No.)                                   24              29
Water Mains and Fittings (km)                     140             164
Elevated Storage Tanks (No.)                        7              -
Water meters (No.)                             50,000          60,000
Sewerage
Secondary Sewers (km)                              88             108
2.05    The Project also included workshops, offices, stores, vehicles and
miscellaneous equipment to assist DWASA in operating the water supply and
sewerage systems. Consulting services were envisaged to assist in the
implementation of the Project and to prepare a long-term plan and feasibility
study for a subsequent Project, including a study of water and sewerage
tariffs. The final item in the Project was staff training, primarily for
operational staff.
NegotiaUions and Special Conditions
2.06    Credit Negotiations took place in Washington on May 14-16, 1979, six
months after the Appraisal. The Government of Bangladesh and DWASA were
represented by a delegation headed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Local
Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives.



-4-
2.07    Based on experience in the First Project, the following special
conditions were specified in the legal agreements:
(a)  Prior consultation on any major reorganizations of DWASA (Section
3.03.b of Project Agreement);
(b)  Appointment of a training officer by December 31, 1979 and
implementation of a satisfactory overses3 fellowship program
(Section 3.03.d of Project Agreement);
(c)  GOB funds for the Project to be in the form of equity (Section
3.01.a of Credit Agreement and Side Letter);
(d)  Tariff levels, tariff review and rate of return targets of 3.0% in
FY80, 4.0% in FY81 and FY82 and 5.0% in FY83. (Sections 3.02 and
4.04 of Project Agreement and Side Letter);
(e)  Measures leading to DWASA's operational improvements (Sections 3.02
and 4.05 of Project Agreement and Side Letter) consisting of:
(i)   a sewer connection program;
(ii) a waste detection and prevention program, maintenance of a
task force to prevent unauthorized connections and a meter
installation program; and
(iii) a program to improve billing and collection;
(f)  Fixed assets revaluation in FY82 (Section 4.02 of Project Agreement
and Side Letter);
(g)  Limitation on borrowing (Section 4.05 of Project Agreement);
(h)  Establishment of a fund for spare parts (Section 4.03.b of Project
Agreement); and
(i)  Installation of meters on new and existing connections (Section
3.04 of Project Agreement).
DWASA complied with these conditions except as discussed in subsequent
sections of this report.



-5-
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness
3.01    Special Conditions of Effectiveness included:
(a) conclusion of the onlending arrangement between GOB and DWASA;
(b) Government approval of the Project Proforma;
(c) implementation of a water tariff increase of 40%;
(d) appointment of auditors; and
(e)  confirmation that T)ASA could enforce sewer connections or charge
for such connections.
Meeting these conditions took two months longer than foreseen during
Negotiations. The Loan was declared effective on November 30, 1979, some
five months after Negotiations were complete.
Project Revision
3.02    Three elevated storage reservoirs (each of steel, capacity
1.0 million gallons or 4,540 m3) were constructed under the First Project
but have never been in service because normal water pressures throughout
Dhaka have been insufficient to fill the reservoirs. The Second Project
included seven more storage reservoirs but DWASA and the Association later
agreed that there would be little point in constructing them since they could
not be expected to be filled under normal operating conditions.
3.03    There were substantial savings in the foreign exchange costs of the
Project as implementation proceeded, due mainly tco
(a) elimination of the elevated storage reservoirs;
(b) no need for the unallocated contingencies;
(c) lower than estimated dollar costs for imported equipment and
materials.
3.04    Aware of these foreign exchange savings, totalling some US$4 million,
and of the delays in the implementation of the Second and the commencement
of the proposed Third Project, DWASA wanted to use these savings to improve
services by purchasing additional equipment and increasing the scale of the
Second Project, particularly tubewells and water mains. Association missions



-6-
supported this proposed reallocation, which would have utilized the entire
Credit. The Association management formally agreed in March 1984 to an
increase of about 20% in the quantities of the project works, as summarized
in para 2.04.
Implementation Schedule
3.05    Implementation of the Project was slow in the beginning, mainly
because of delays in procurement of materials and problems in acquisition of
land for installation of deep tubewells. Delays were also caused throughout
the project period by shortages of local currency provided to DWASA by GOB.
These factors combined to delay the completion of most components of the
Projects, as initially conceived, by about one y:ar, to the end of 1983.
3.06    The expansion of the Project by about 20%, which was not formally
agreed until early in 1984, delayed completion of the Project until mid-1985,
some 2 years behind the appraisal estimate. The estimated and actual
Implementation Schedules are provided in Annex 1.
Procurement
3.07    International competitive bidding procedures were followed for
materials and equipment, including water meters, while local competitive
bidding procedures were used for civil works contracts. Minor equipment
items, costing less than US$15,000, were purchased locally on the basis of
priced quotations. A preference of 15% was allowed for equipment
manufactured locally.
3.08    DWASA, its consultants and the suppliers and contractors were
familiar with international competitive bidding procedures and Association
requirements from the First Project. There were delays in procurement,
caused by factors including extensive bid evaluation, disagreements about
contract awards, shipping delays and shortages of local currency for civil
works contracts. Procurement procedures were satisfactory overall.
Project Costs
3.09    The final cost of the Project was Taka 942.3 million or 46% higher
than the appraisal estimate of Taka 645.6 million. Table 3.1 summdrizes and
compares the actual costs with the appraisal estimate. The increase of the
project scope by 20%, the 2 year delay in completion and the devaluation of
the Taka were the major factors in the cost increase.
3.10    The actual project costs, expressed in US dollars, totalled
US$46.3 million or only 11% higher than the appraisal estimate of
US$41.7 million because the value of the Taka fell from US$1.00 = Taka 15 at
appraisal to US$1.00 = Taka 27.2 in June 1985. Table 3.2 summarizes the
actual project expenditures and the average exchange rates in each year.

Disbursements
3.11    By June 1983, when the Project was originally expected to be
completed only 54% of the Credit had been disbursed. The Credit took six
years to disburse instead of 3 years as originally expected. A -otal of
US$20.4 million of the Credit was finally disbursed and US$1.6 mi'lion was
cancelled. The delays in disbursements were due mainly to previously
explained delays in implementation. Annex 3 compares actual disbursements
with the appraisal estimate.
3.12    Disbursements under the Credit are summarized in Table 3.3.  Some
'0 major supply contracts accounted for about 57% of the disbursements. A
local firm won two of these con:racts, for sewer pipes, but all other major
supplies were imported. All civil works contracts were won by local firms.

Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.13    The foreign consultants responsible for assisting DWASA in
project implementation had been involved in Projects for DWASA in
Dhaka for more than 20 years at the start of the Project so knew the
situation well. Their small team of expatriates, supported by local
consultants, were responsible mainly for detail design, tender documents and
bid evaluation, not particularly complex tasks in view of the relatively
straightforward and repetitive nature of the Project. They performed these
tasks acceptably and their independent assessments were helpful to DWASA. At
the outset there was some confusion over the consultant's role in supervising
construction but this task was taken over mainly by DWASA's engineering



-9-
staff. However, DT;ASA did tend to rely excessively on the consultants,
giving them tasks not directly related to the Project, tasks which could
have been carried out by DWASA staff.
3.14    A separate assignment for engineering consultants was the preparation
of a long-term development plan and feasibility study for water supply and
wastewater systems. A joint venture of consulting firms presented inception
and interim reports in 1980 and the final feasibility report iA April 1981.
This feasibility study, which included a tariff study, defined a priority
program of water supply and sewerage facilities to be constructed in the
period 1983-1987. The study recommended the development of a surface water
treatment plant at Demra on the Lakhya River. DWASA was not able to implement
the recommended construction program because shortages of local currency
retarded the Second Project and because the Demra site for the proposed water
treatment plant was occupied and not available to DWASA. A water sector master
plan was subsequently prepared in mid-1985 under JNDP/IBRD auspices
(Project BGD/82/003), by consultants who indicated two possible criticisms
of the recommended Demra development:
(a) There may not be sufficient water in the Lakhya River
during low flow periods to supply the Demra plant in
future years, due to the increasing and uncontrolled
abstraction of river water for irrigation.
(b)  Groundwater availability in the Dhaka :egion may be
greater than assumed by DWASA's consultants.
These concerns about water resources in the Dhaka region indicate that the
earlier work by DWASA's consultants needs to be carefully revriewed.
Engineering work on the Demra Plant, to be undertaken under the IDA
Technical Assistance Credit (1440-BD), has been delayed pending a review
by two specialists hired by DWASA with UNDP funds. These assessments are
expected to be completed by July 31, 1986.
3.15    In December 1983, DWASA proposed to plan another interim Project, the
Third to be supported by the Association, since it was anticipated that the
Demra sovrce recommended in the 1981 feasibility study could not provide
water for Dhaka before 1991/92. DWASA decided to take the basic responsibil-
ity for preparing this Third Project, with assistance from consultants.
Accordingly the inception report for the Third Dhaka Project was submitted
in May 1984 and the final report in June 1984. This exercise marked a
transition in the role of the consultants, who worked jointly with DWASA
staff to prepare the Third Project.
3.16    All civil works were awarded to local contractors.  Since the
contractors were experienced in water supply and sewerage works from the
previous Project, they had no difficulty in completing the work
satisfactorily. However, there were some delays in the supply of imported
materials and equipment.

IV. CPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01    DWASA estimates that the project provided water supplies to an addi-
tional 600,000 people and improved the quality of service to a further
600,000 people already served, mainly in the old city. Sewerage was extended
to some 360,000 people. Thus the project improved services to more people
than anticipated at appraisa'l (para 2.03).
4.02    DWASA installed more tubewells as part of the project than
anticipated at appraisal (29 actual compared to 24 proposed). The quantity
of water actually produced was substantially higher than projected (22% more
in 1983) and reached 436 million litres daily in 1985, more than double the
figure at the beginning of the project. Production per capita also rose
steadily, reaching 128 litres daily in FY1985 or some 51% higher than in
FY1980. A total of 25,000 new water connections were expected to be provided
during the project period but this figure was exceeded: 32,700 were provided
between 1979 and 1985. More than 3,000 unauthorized and illegal connections
were regularized in this period and are included in this total. Water sales
rose almost as fast as water production, more than doubling in the five years
1980 through 1985, but unaccounted-for water remained even larger than water
sales and showed little reduction over the project period. Basic operating
data are summarized in Table 4.1.
4.03    The sewer system is less extensive than Dhaka's water supply retwork
and many properties with access to sewers have refused to pay for connec-
tions. During the project DWASA began charging properties within 100 ft of
the sewer lines for sewerage, causing more consumers to request sewer connec-
tions. Data in Table 4.1 indicate that DWASA made 10,000 sewer connections
in the past six years. Nevertheless the number of sewer connections still
totals only 26% of the water connections.
4.04    & major cause of the high percentage of unaccounted-for water and
DWASA's poor financial situation is the lack of metered connections so the
project provided a total of 60,000 new water meters. DWASA was able to
install 27,416 of these meters and replace a further 12,486 during the period
1980-1985 but some 20,000 of these meters were stockpiled because of DWASA's
inability to install them. Thus there were 49,500 unmetered connections in
1985, 50% more than five years previously. DWASA's performance in repairing
meters was also poor: only 2,656 meters were repaired in the past five years
and more than 25,000 meters were reported awaiting repairs in 1984/85. Table
4.2 summarizes data on water connections and water meters. Although MASA
had agreed to a policy of installing meters on all new water connections
(Project Agreement, section 3.04), this policy was not implemented fully
until FY1984.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Operating Results
5.01    Appraisal estimates and actual results for DWASA's Income Statement,
Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheets for the Financial Years 1979-1984 are
provided in Annexes 4, 5 and 6. Financial highlights are summarized in
Table 5.1.
5.02    Although water production exceeded appraisal estimates (Table 4.1),
operating revenues were considerably lower than forecast. The 1978 appraisal
report stated that "the reasons for WASA's inadequate financial position are
the following:
(a) inadequate tariff levels;
(b) inadequate metering resulting in excessive water consumption by
unmetered customers; and
(c) inadequate billing and collection."
Although progress was made in all three areas, the problems remained to be
more fully addressed in the Third Project through initiatives on the tariff
proce3ss, conversion of non-metered connections, leak detection and
computerization of billings and collections.
5.03    DWASA increased water tariffs by about 40% in September 1979 as a  .
Condition of Effectiveness for the Credit. Thereafter, in order to meet
financial covenants, DWASA was expected to increase tariffs by smaller
amounts at intervals of approximately 18 months, beginning at the start of
1981. Tariffs were actually raised by about 40% in April 1982 and by a
further 20% in July 1985 (the month after the closing date for the Project).
Although the metered residential tariff is now 2.4 times the level at the
time of appraisal in 1978, the tariff was highest in real terms when it was
increased in September 1979. Inflation since then has more than offset the
tariff increases. Further information is provided on this topic in Annex 9.
5.04    Low revenues are also caused by the very high number of unmetered
connections, since water tariffs for such consumers are based on the assessed
value of the property and not on the actual or potential water consumption.
Despite having purchased 60,000 water meters under the Project, DWASA reports
that the number of unmetered connections rose in absolute and relative terms
until 1983, when there were more than 50,000 consumers without meters. Meter
data in Table 4.2 indicate that this situation has improved somewhat since
then. Nevertheless DWASA anticipated having some 29,000 meters in stock at
the end of FY 85.



-13-
5.05    The problem of poor performance in billing and collection continued
to affect DWASA's revenues, jeopardizing DWASA's finances throughout the
project period. Elements of the problem included:
(a) large numbers of illegal and unauthorized connections;
(b) inability to issue bills promptly and regularly;
(c) unwillingness of the Government and its employees to pay DWASA's
bills;
(d) unwillingness of the Dhaka Municipal Corporation to pay for water
through standpipes;
(e) unwillingness by DWASA to implement a program of disconnecting
delinquent consumers.
5.06    Billing and collection procedures began to improve in 1982, at which
time the arrears of the government and the Dhaka Municipal Corporation were
settled and DWASA agreed to reform its commercial department. An expatriate
commercial manager was hired under the Third Technical Assistance Credit
(Cr. 872-BD). He made a substantial contribution by rationalizing arrears
accounts and developing a format for monitoring billing and collections.
5.07    Operating expenses began to exceed appraisal estimates in 1981 and
were 33% higher in 1984. The greatest part of the increase was due to
additional costs for water production, particularly power costs, as actual
water production was considerably in excess of appraisal estimates.
(Table 4.1).
5.08    The consequence of lower than projected revenues and higher than
projected expenses was that DWASA operated at a deficit in every year of the
project period. Table 5.1 provides summary results. As a result, DWASA was
unable to comply with the rate of return covenant of the Project Agreement.
Financing Plan
5.09    Although GOB undertook to provide DWASA with all necessary funds for
the Project (Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement), the original subsidiary
lending agreement between GOB and DWASA placed an equity ceiling of
Taka 300 million on GOB financing for the Project and had to be revised. The
allocations provided to DWASA annually were less than required and
contributed to delays in project implementation. GOB eventually provided all
funds necessary to complete the Project, which finally cost 46% more in Taka
than expected at appraisal (Taka 942.3 million vs Taka 645.6 million), or 11%
more in US Dollars (US$46.2 million vs. US$41.7 million).



-14-
5.10    DWASA also constructed a head office building (Taka 94.2 million)
and built additional water and sewerage facilities (Taka 28.2 million)
outside the project. These expenditures, plus the cost over-run and the
necessary subsidy to cover operating losses, meant that GOB provided more
equity funds for DWASA during the project period than tesulted from the
onlending of the credit. The annual statements of sources and applications
of funds in Annex 5 indicate that the onlending of the Credit provided Taka
511.7 million during the seven years 1979-1985. In the same period the COB
equity contribution to DWASA totalled Taka 627.6 million.
Audit
5.11    DWASA agreed to appoint an auditor and furnish the Association with
a copy of the auditor's report within six months of the end of each fiscal
year. DWASA delivered these audit reports within two months of the due date.

VI.  INSTITUTIONAL  ERFORMANCE
6.01    DWASA's organization, depicted in Annex 8, has evolved to meet its
responsibilities. Three departments (Engineering, Commercial and
Administration) and six divisions (Training, Security & Intelligence, Law,
Public Relations. Internal Audit, and Planning, Education & Monitoring)
report directly to the Chairman, who is also the Chief Executive Officer.
Zonal offices, constructed as part of the Project, helped improve
arrangements for dealing with consumers and for maintaining water and sewer
systems.
6.02    DWASA's staffing levels are relatively high; the number of employees
grew from 1,900 in 1979 to 2,223 in 1984, about: 3% per year. However, in the
same period, the number of connections increased by about 10% per year
(Table 4.1) and employees per thousand connections were reduced from 32 to
26; about 14% of the staff were engineers.
6.03    DWASA and the similar authority in Chittagong received a total of
74 man months of technical assistance between May 1978 and June 1982, under a
UNDP Project which was executed by the World Health Organization. This
assistance covered engineering, management and financial topics and provided
useful advice to DWASA. Four training fellowships, each for three month
observation tours in the region, were provided for DWASA staff. The UNDP was
prepared to consider a request for an extension of this Project, but no such
request was received from GOB.
6.04    Although DWASA tended to rely too much on their engineering
consultants, a firm which had worked on Dhak.. Projects for more than 25 years
by the end of the Project, the utility's engineering competence and
confidence reached the point where most of the supervision of project
construction was undertaken by DWASA staff. DWASA also took responsibility,
in conjunction with their consultants, for preparing the next Project
(Dhaka III).
6.05    At its own initiative, DWASA engaged management consultants to amend
some of its internal rules and regulations. Their report was submitted in
1983 and several of the recommended procedures have been adopted.
6.06    DWASA appointed a training officer early in 1980 and set up a
Training Institute in 1982, supported by the Project. The Institute has four
instructors with engineering background and four with finance and
administration background, six of whom have been trained abroad. Since 1983
more than 400 persons were trained at the institute in technical and
administrative courses lasting from 4 to 47 days. This included a program of
orientation for new recruits of 24 Assistant Engineers, 44 Sub-Assistant
Engineers and 34 Rev2nue Inspectors. Participants in the training program
also included personnel from Chittagong WASA and the Directorate of Public
Health Engineering. DWASA also sent a number of persons to various local
Training Institutes.

VII.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01    The fundamental objectives for the Project, originally enunciatec
in the President's Report and repeated previously in para 2.03, have all been
met or exceeded.  The Project provided essential services of water supply and
sewerage at the lowest feasible costs. Although progress was made in
strengthening DWASA as as institutioa, there is scope for further improving
its operating efficiency.
7.02    Water production by DWASA was more than doubled during the project
period. The distribution system was extended by 164 km to serve some
additional 600,000 people with water supplies. More than 34,000 water
connections were provided by 1985, an increase of 66% over the 1979 figure.
The sewer system was also extended to serve some 360,000 additional people.
7.03    A long-term development plan was prepared under the Project for water
supply and sewerage systems to serve the Dhaka metropolitan area. A
feasibility study for a future Project, based on a surface water supply from
the Lakhya River, was completed in 1981. Delays in obtaining land for a
treatment plant for this source at Demra caused a deferral of this Project so
DWASA was able to prepare an interim Project which the Association appraised
at the end of FY 1985.
7.04    DWASA was not able to raise its tariffs and collect sufficient
revenues to meet all of its operating expenditures, resulting in DWASA being
unable to meet agreed financial targets. However, DWASA actually produced
more water from 1981 onwards than was anticipated at appraisal. Although
water sales accounted for only about 54% of water production, the amount of
water actually consumed is estimated to be around 75% of the water produced.
If the incremental water consumption made possible by the Project is valued
at the highest rate actually paid for water during the project period, these
project benefits provide an economic rate of return of 13.2% compared to 5%
estimated at appraisal. Details are provided in Annex 9, along with
sensitivity analyses.



-17-
VIII. ASSOCIATION PERFORMANCE
8.01    The Association was instrumental in the creation of DWASA and has
continued to assist in its development.
8.02    The First Project, completed in 1978, did not explicitly include the
preparation of a subsequent Project. The Second Project was appraised
somewhat hurriedly, before it was fully prepared by DWASA and its
consultants. This may account for some limitations in the Appraisal Report,
including the absence of a comprehensive description of the existing system,
the lack of quantified project objectives and the scarcity of details
concerning projections of water connections, production and sales. It was
accordingly difficult for DWASA and the Association to monitor actual
performance for comparison with original objectives and projections. The
construction schedule was somewhat simplistic, not allowing for the large
numbers of contracts and the seasonal nature of pipe-laying operations caused
by monsoon conditions. On the other hand, the Association's willingness to
help prepare and appraise the Project doubtless accelerated its
implementation, thereby helping to hasten improvements in water supply and
sewerage services throughout Dhaka.
8.03    Nine Project Supervision Missions visited Dhaka, commencing in
Ma' 1980 (five months after the Credit became effective) and visiting
approximately twice a year thereafter. There was reasonable continuity by
Association staff, with the financial analyst and engineer who appraised the
Project being replaced in 1982 and 1983 respectively. Later missions tended
to concentrate on the preparation of the Third Project, a matter of
considerable priority for DWASA. Through staff continuity in both the IDA
missions and implementing agency, the Association developed a very good
working relationship with DWASA.
8.04    The Association acted prudently in encouraging DWASA not to construct
the seven elevated storage tanks originally included in the Project as three
similar tanks included in the First Project have still not been utilized.
The related question of reallocatir,g the resulting savings was raised as
early as the Second Supervision Mission in November 1980. Supervision staff
tended to support DWASA's preference to utilize all savings in project costs
(eventually totalling some US$4 million due to very competitive international
tenders for other contracts as well as the elimination of the overhead
tanks), in order to increase the scope of the Project. Although this matter
was addressed during several subsequent Supervision Missions, DWASA was not
formally advised that the project scope could only be expanded by some 20%
until March 1984. By that time DWASA had already called tenders to utilize
the entire savings so the Association's delay in reaching a conclusion with
DWASA on this matter caused unnecessary confusion for DWASA. Contributing
factors in the delay in reaching a final conclusion on this matter appear to
have included the channel of communications involving DWASA's parent Ministry
and the Association's Dhaka office as well as various sections within the
Washington Headquarters.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
9.01    Capital constraints, as well as site access problems, have forced
DWASA to rely exclusively on groundwater.  Despite the fact that a long-tern
development plan recommending development of a surface water source has been
completed, DWASA is still focussing on an interim next Project using
groundwater. A basic question is whether or not a series of "interim"
Projects, comprising essentially boreholes, water mains and sewers, is noc in
fact preferable to a very large scale Project, which may be financially and
technically inappropriate for Dhaka. Neither DWASA's long-term Plan nor other
Government studies have contributed a comprehensive view of the total water
resources situation in the Dhaka region, including the uncontrolled
exploitation of groundwater by irrigators and private urban and industrial
consumers. The consequences of DWASA continuing to rely exLlusively on
groundwater may not yet be thoroughly understood. This topic is being given
further attention by DWASA under the Third Project and under studies that are
being made to review the justification of the Demra Water Treatment Plant.
9.02    Overall Performance - DWASA's successful completion of the Project
confirmed the ability of the agency to design and construct the basic
elements of Dhaka's Water Supply and Sewerage System. The more than two year
delay in implementing the Project was mainly caused by shortage of funds.
The Project also confirmed that despite improvements DWASA continues to have
problems in operating its systems efficiently. Leak detection, metering,
billing and collections, and increased productivity require a long-term
effort. The main priority of the Third Project is DWASA's achievement of
greater operating efficiency and financial viability.
9.03    Water Supply - From the perspective of water production the Project
has been quite successful, with total production more than doubling and per
capita figures increasing from 85 litres daily in 1980 to 119 litres daily by
1985 (Table 4.1).  However, only about half of water producFion was actually
sold to consumers because DWASA has not been able to make greater
improvements in its operating efficiency, metering and billing performance.
These operational weaknesses, which translate into financial problems, remain
the single most important problem facing DWASA. The matter of water tariffs
is also important but if DWASA could have increased its water sales by about
15% the deficits of recent years would not have occurred. Practical measures
to overcome these problems have been agreed and included in the Operational
Action Plan in connection with the Third Project.
9.04    Sanitation - Wastewater disposal appears to receive much lower
priority by DWASA than water supply. Only 27% of the properties with water
supply connections had sewer connections in 1985. Environmental and health
problems related to the limited sewerage system are substantial. Since the
lack of sewerage connections is largely due to the high costs of installing
the sewers and the connections, GOB, DWASA and Dhaka Municipality are
considering alternative low-cost solutions under the Third Project.



- l9 -
9.05    Land Acquisition - Difficulties in obtaining land for project
facilities impeded project implementation, despite optimistic expectations at
the time of appraisal. Only 11 of 24 tubewell sites had been obtained by
May 1981 for example. However, this problem was mainly overcome during' 1982.
Prior to Negotiations of the Third Project, most of the land acquisition
required during implementation had been finalized.
9.06    DWASA's Engineering - DWASA's engineering competence appears to have
increased during the Project, due to experience gained in implementing the
Project in conjunction with engineering consultants. Also the Training
Institute, developed under the Project, enhanced the skills of the staff at
all levels in DWASA. It would appear reasonable to concentrate future
training efforts to solve the operational and administrative problems which
continue to hinder the agency.
9.07    D,ASA's Finances - DWASA has been consistently unable to meet agreed
rate of return targets although tariff increases were introduced twice during
the project period. The Association's assumptions of tariff increases every
18 months have been unrealistic. DWASA requires greater flexibility in
adjusting its tariffs, within reasonable limits, to cover increases in
operating costs. Under t-he Third Project, GOB is granting DWASA the power to
increase tariffs, without overnment approval, by up to 10% over any twelve
month period in order to         increases in power costs.

SECOND DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
1.    The methodology used to estimate the economi, rite of return is
the same as used in the staff appraisal report.  The incremental
revenues accruing to DWASA as a result of the project are taken as
a  proxy  for  the  minimum  level  of  the  benefits.    The  basic
asaumptions used  in the calculation are listed below.   Project
costs  and estinated benefits  are  listed  for each  year  in the
following Table A.9.1.
2.    The  actual  capital  costs  of  the  project  are  summartzed  in
Annex 2. For this rate of return calculation all taxes and duties
are elitninated, as are the costs for the feasibility study for the
future project. The project costs thus totalled TK 697.8 million,
expressed in current prices of the project construction period.
The foreign exchange component was TK 343.3 million, 49.2% of the
total project cost.
3.    Project   iaplementation  lasted  from  late  1979  to  mid-1985
(Annex 1).  Project expenditures are assumed to be distributed by
fiscal years in accordance with total project expenditures
(Table 3.2).
4.    The  project   involves  additional  recurrent  expenditures  for
operation and matntenance.   These are taken to be equivalent to
the  increases  in  total  direct  expenses  for  system  facilities
between FY 1980, the year before the project began to operate, and
FY 1986, by which time the full capacity of the project is
expected to be utilized.   Actual direct expenses for the years
FY 1980 through FY 1984 are available from the income statement of
Annex 4 and estimates have been made for FY 1985 and FY 1986.
5.    All costs are reported in current prtces but for economic analysis
are expressed  in constant  prices of FY 1979.   Prices  in other
years are adjusted to those of FY 1979 by means of the GOB
consumer price index for middle income families, as follows:
Financial Year    1979  1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  1985 1986
(Est)
Rate of
Inflation (x)      3.2  18.5  12.5  16.3   9.9   9.7  14.0  10.0
Index (mid-year) 100.0 113.3 130.9 149.7 169.3 185.9 207.8 232.7
6.    Benefits  are  defined  as  the  Incremental  sales  of  water  made
possible by the project. It is assumed that water sales in excess
of those of FY 1980 are attributable to the project.   Although
unaccounted-for water has been reported to average around 60% of

total water production, much of the unaccounted-for water is
actually used by consumers who lack meters or whose meters are not
functioning properly.   (See Table 4.2 which explains  that  less
than half the connectons are actually metered). Project officials
estimate that perhaps 75% of all water production is actually
utilized  by  consumers.       Accordingly  the  water  consumption
attributable to the project is estimated to be 75% of all
production  in excess of  the FY 1980 figure.   Actual data from
Table 4.1 are used between FY 1980 and FY 1984, and estimated
figures for FY 1985 and FY 1986, at which time it is assumed that
the full capacity of the project will be utilized.
7.    The value of the incremental water consumption is assumed to be at
least equal ta the highest price in real terms paid by metered
consumers during the project period.   Tariffs were increased in
September, 1979 and April, 1982 as noted in Annex 7. Tariffs were
increased in July, 1985 to Taka 8.75 per 1000 gallons for
residential consumers and Taka 28.50 per 1000 gallons for
commerical and industrial consumers.  Although the latest tariffs
are the highest in financial terms, the tariffs reached their
highest level in constant prices (based on the inflation factors
outlined as above) when they were increased in September, 1979.
Tariff increases since then have been more than offset by price
increases due to inf'ation.
8.    Roughly  80%  of  water  constumption  in Dhaka  is  by  residential
consumers, who presently pay only 30% of the tariff charged to
commerical and industrial consumers.  The weighted average tariff
is accordingly 1.45 times the domestic tariff. The rate of return
calculation uses constant prices at the level prevailing in the
middle of FY 1979 (or the price level of January, 1979).   The
domestic  tariff  introduced  in  September,  1979  (Tk  5.00  per
1000 gallons) would then have had a weighted average of Tk 7.25
per 1000 gallons in current prices for all consumers then or
approximately Tk 6.70 per 1000 gallons in constant prices of
mid-FY 1979. Th4s is equivalent to Tk 1.48 per m3 and is the rate
used to evaluate incremental consumption made possible by the
project.
9.    The estimated economic rate of return for the project, based on
the foregoing assumptions and the figures of Table A9.1, is 13.2%.
10.   The sensitivity of this rate of return has been tested for two
changes in assumptions, one concerning estimated benefits and the
other the estimated costs.
11.   If actual water consumption is only 60% of the water production,
instead of the assumed figure of 75%, benefits would be reduced in
each year an in total by 20%.   Tn this case the rate of return
would drop to 8.6%.

12.   Costs in economic terms might be lower than shown in Table A9.1 if
foreign exchange costs and local labour costs are shadow priced,
as in the appraisal report.
a) The local currency may be over-valued against foreign
exchange. The conversion factor of 0.75 used in the staff
appraisal report seems reasonable. Costs are expressed in
Zaka and the foreign exchange component is esttmated at
roughly 50% of the total  costs.   The  foreign exchange
component is accordingly overvalued by about 33%, meaning
that the overall project costs should be decreased by
16.5%.
b) The labour comnponent of the local currency component of
project costs ts expressed in financial or market terms in
the cost estimates but the real cnst to tnie economy may
be somewhat lower. If labour is assumed to account for 70%
of local costs and if the shadow cost of labour is 70% of
the market cost (the assumption used In the appraisal
report), the local costs are effectively overstated by 21%
in economic terms.   Since local costs  represent 50% of
total costs, the overall project costs should be decreased
by 10.5%.
These two adjustments, added together, result in a reduction of
stated project costs by a total of 27% to reflect the shadow
prices  for  foreign  currency  and  local  labour  costs  maore
accurately.
With these reductions in the project costs the economic rate of
return would increase to 21.6%.
