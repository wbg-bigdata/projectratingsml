BANGLADESH
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND DACCA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Status of Service
1.01      Bangladesh has a population of about 85 million people (1978
estimate). Dacca has 2.3 million and Chittagong, the second city, about
700,000. These two cities plus the other 76 areas classified as urban bring
the total urban population to about 7 million. The location of the country
on the Ganges/ Brahmaputra delta and the monsoon rains, generally more than
1,500 mm annually, result in abundant surface water, which, while plentiful,
is heavily polluted. The high incidence of cholera and other water borne
diseases reflects the extensive USE! of untreated water from streams, tanks
and dug wells. Fortunately, groundwater is also abundant; it requires little
treatment and is relatively inexpensive, so public water undertakings use it
as a principal source of supply. At present about 46 million of the popula-
tion have access to reasonably safe water but about 37 million still depend
on easily contaminated traditional sources. Water borne sewerage has been
introduced in parts of Dacca but elsewhere there is general use of night-
soil conservancy, direct disposal to fields and, to a very limited extent,
pit privies and septic tanks.
1.02      Bangladesh has been more successful in developing safe water supply
facilities than waste disposal services. Overall, about 56% of the popula-
tion has access to wholesome water while only about 8% benefit from waste
disposal services. This compares with an average level of 38% access to
water and 33% to waste disposal in all developing countries.
Sector Development
1.03      The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has been trying to satisfy the
increasing demand for water arising from rapid population expansion, parti-
cularly in the urban areas where the effects of natural growth have been
aggravated by rural migration. Sector development, interrupted in 1971 by
the war of independence and its aftermath, started slowly, but has gradually
improved.
1.04      Sector development may be subdivided into the following three cate-
gories:
(a)  development in rural areas;
(b) development in district towns; and
(c) development in larger urban centers.



- 2 -
1.05      In rural areas, a program sponsored by the United Nation's Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), has increased the number
of hand pump tubewells in service to about 360,000 at a total cost of US$47
million making safe water available to a total of about 40 million people.
UNICEF plans to continue this program through 1985. Its contribution, about
50% of the total cost, takes the form of materials. GOB obtains contributions
amounting to about 10% of the cost from local consumers and provides the
remaining 40% in the form of grants. Despite this significant increase in the
supply of safe water in rural areas, water borne diseases have not receded as
much as was anticipated since hygiene and sanitation practices have not
improved sufficiently.
1.06      The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has indicated its intention to
assist in financing projects for water supply in district towns. An ADB tech-
nical assistance grant has been approved for the preparation of feasibility
studies for projects designed to satisfy the needs through 1990 of the towns
of Comilla, Bogra, Barisal, Mymensingh and Jessore. Additional district towns
may be included in subsequent projects.
1.07      In the past the Association has financed water supply and sewerage
development in the larger urban centers of Dacca (Credit 368-BD) and Chitta-
gong (Credit 367-BD) where high population densities have created serious
sanitation problems. The proposed project will expand water and sewerage
services in Dacca. GOB has also asked IDA's support for a similar project in
Chittagong. With the assistance of the Government of the Netherlands (GON) a
feasibility study is being carried out for a water supply project in Khulna
for which the Government has requested IDA's financial support. In addition,
GOB is expected to ask GON to assist in the execution of a feasibility study
for a project in Rajshahi.
1.08      The main constraints on sector development are shortage of funds and
insufficient numbers of trained personnel. Project financing as well as ope-
rating subsidies, particularly for the water supply operations of the finan-
cially ailing municipalities, are being provided from Government budget funds.
Over the past five years, investment in the water supply and sewerage sector
has been about 7% of GOB's development expenditures, a level which is unlikely
to increase in future due to the competing demands of other sections of the
economy. Trained manpower at the operating level is generally available in
major urban centers but is in short supply in rural areas where adequate
maintenance of hand pump tubewells is a problem.
Sector Organization
1.09      Central Government exercises control over the sector through the
Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLGRD).
The agencies operating under MLGRD are the Department of Public Health
Engineering (DPHE), the municipalities and, in the cases of Dacca and
Chittagong, Water and Sewerage Authorities (WASAs). DPHE develops water
supply projects countrywide and operates and maintains water works through-
out the rural areas. In urban areas DPHE generally hands over operational
and maintenance responsibilities to the municipalities except in the case of
Dacca and Chittagong where the WASAs have responsibility for all aspects of
water supply and sewerage.

II. POPULATION, WATER CONSUMPTION AND SEWERAGE
SERVICE DEMtAND IN THE PROJECT AREA
Population
2.01       Since the 1930s, Dacca has undergone successive transformations
from an insignificant district town to the provincial capital of East Pakistan
in 1948 and, since 1971, to the national capital of Bangladesh.  In 1961,
the population was only about 550,000. Projections made in 1962 estimated
Dacca's population to increase to about 850,000 by 1971 and to about 1.3
million by 1982, an average increase of about 4.5% per year.  However, the
population reached a level of about 1.2 million in 1971 and is presently
(1978) estimated at about 2.3 million, indicating an actual average increase
of approximately 8% per year through 1971 and about 10% per year between 1971
and 1978. Although in the long run the population growth may abate somewhat
due to GOB's population program, migration from rural areas, the more signi-
ficant factor for Dacca's population growth, may increase. Under conserva-
tive assumptions the metropolitan area of Dacca is likely to reach a popu-
lation of 3-1/4 million by 1982 (Annex 1).
2.02      Dacca's extension generally along a broad strip reaching northward
from the old riverside city, has created fringe areas with insufficient water
and sewer service. These are the main target areas of the proposed project.
They surround the older core of serviced developments and house about 30% of
Dacca's population.
Water Demand and Consumption
2.03      The large population increase due to migration from rural areas
is expected to have its greatest impact on the peripheral areas. Conse-
quently, demand is likely to grow most in the outer districts; but there
are also shortages in parts of the serviced area and in the old city where
low pressure in the water distribution system causes long delays for the
people dependent on public standpipes. It is not uncommon to find water
receptacles for over 30 families in line beside a slowly discharging stand-
pipe.
2.04       Industrial and commercial consumption represents about 3% of WASA's
production and only a modest growth pattern is expected for these categories.
A number of industrial and commercia-L enterprises have their own tubewells;
although WASA would like to take over responsibility for all supplies through-
out the city this is unlikely to happen. WASA will remain unable for quite
some time to guarantee supply and for large industrial consumers the cost of
operating their own tubewell is likely to be less than the cost of water under
a tariff structure in which industry subsidizes domestic consumers (para
5.03).
2.05      Until the mid 1960's, the per capita supply of water had increased
from about 50 lcd in 1940 to about 110 lcd in 1964 (Annex 1). Thereafter per



capita supply dropped to a level of about 86 lcd in 1979 although total pro-
duction had increased from about 75 mld in 1964 to about 214 mld in 1979 illus-
trating the fact that extensions to the water supply system failed to keep
abreast of the population increase during the same period.
2.06      The following table indicates the expected development of water
supply, population and per capita consumption during the five-year period
1978-1982:

Assumptions
/a   After deduction of supplies to industry, commerce, and losses,
(See Table 2.2).
/b   Small increase in production due to upgrading of existing tubewells.
7&   Increase in production and distribution facilities under proposed
project.
The proposed project is designed as an interim measure to prevent a major
water shortage for the next five years.  Increased supply on a per capita
basis can only be expected after commissioning of a larger, long-term project
(para 4.04). With a level of supply of about 90 lcd, Dacca has a lower
standard of service than many other cities in South Asia. Calcutta, for
example, has more than 200 lcd. The comparable indicators for cities in
developed countries range from about 250 lcd to about 1,000 lcd depending
on the magnitude of the industrial demand.

Water Utilization
2.07      The current and projected utilization pattern is set out in Table
2.2. Domestic consumers 1/ account for about 75% of production and industry
and commerce for about 3%. Losses due to leakage, and waste are estimated
by WASA at about 22% (para 5.09).

/a   Domestic consumption for 1978 includes 143, 7 and 11 mld for residential
supplies, community properties and public standpipes respectively.
/b   At present 22% reducing to 18% by end of project period.
The above data are only indicative because metering of water production is
insufficient and defective, and only one-fifth of the water production is
metered. WASA's meter installation program, which forms an important part
of the project, is expected to improve the situation.
2.08     At present, there are about 52,000 connections of all categories
serving about 1.8 million of Dacca's 2.3 million people. The project will
provide about 25,000 new connections of which about 12,000 will immediately
provide access to safe water for an additional 300,000 individuals. The
remaining 13,000 new connections wiLl be used within the existing area, which
with the increased supply from the additional tubewells included in the
project, will initially improve water services to about 600,000 of WASA's
present consumers and will help accommodate future demand arising from
population growth in the service area.
Sewerage Service Demand
2.09      The need for sewerage service in Dacca is great.  Although the main
sewerage system (branch and trunk sewers, pumping stations and pumping mains)
covers at present some 75% of the ciity's total area of 28 square miles (sq
mi), there are only about 8,500 connections. This low connection rate is
due to the following reasons:
(a) WASA has not pursued a vigorous connection program; and
1/   They include consumers dependent on public standpipes as well as com-
munity premises such as hospitals, schools and religious institutions.



-6 -
(b) many of the potential customers are unwilling to meet the
expense of a connection because they do not yet fully appre-
ciate the need for improved sanitation and are content to
continue using septic tanks, open drains along the edges
of the streets and manholes leading directly into the
city's sewer system.
The proposed project will attack this problem by introducing an organized sewer
connection program (para 5.06).
III. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      Dacca WASA, the beneficiary, was established under the East Pakistan
Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Ordinance 1963 (as modified) to construct,
improve, expand, operate and maintain water and sewerage works and other facil-
ities relating to environmental sanitation in the Dacca metropolitan area.
Management and Organization
3.02      The principal officer of WASA is its Chairman, who is appointed by
GOB. He is responsible for overall management. The present Chairman has
brought valuable qualities of enthusiasm, resourcefulness and determination
to the position. He is assisted by a secretariat, a commercial division
and two engineering divisions, one dealing with project planning, design
and construction, and the other with operation, maintenance and distribution
of the system. Internal audit, security and public relations are directly
under the Chairman (Annex 5). Six zonal administrative units, which are to
be the base for staff concerned with operation, maintenance and billing, have
been created. Leakage and waste detection equipment, workshops and offices
for the zonal staff are included in the proposed project. The new organiza-
tion is appropriate for WASA's needs and will facilitate future operational
improvement. During negotiations WASA has confirmed that it will afford IDA
a reasonable opportunity to comment on any further reorganization.
Staffing
3.03      WASA's total manpower is about 1,800 but it is proposed to be
increased to 2,300 by 1982. The additional employees would include 70 pro-
fessionals and 430 artisans, operators and laborers.  The staffing levels
are high in relation to the size of the undertaking.  Reduction in staffing
to more efficient levels will be possible in the long term as operational
efficiency of the staff improves with experience and training.
Training
3.04      Training, both in Bangladesh and abroad, was provided to WASA's
staff under the first project. Supplementary assistance for training was
received during that same period from multilateral and bilateral sources.
Although some of this training was received at the operational level, the
thrust of the formal programs was directed at the upper levels of the
organization. The nucleus of suitably trained mid-level managerial and
technical staff now available provides a foundation for further institu-
tional development.



- 7 -
3.05      The training element in this project is directed at the operational
staff. Recommendations regarding a program are provided in Annex 20. Its
objective is for WASA to develop its own in-house training capability based
on making optimal use of its staff's expertise. Some of the responsibility
for implementing the program would be borne by Chittagong WASA. Ultimately,
the training organization may develop as a center for providing vocational
training for the country's entire water and sanitation sector. A training
officer will be appointed by December 31, 1979. In addition to the in-house
training, a limited overseas fellowship program will be carried out under the
project.
Management Systems
3.06      When WASA was created, it was with the objective of transforming
what was essentially a municipal engineering organization into a public
utility. Accounting and budgeting systems, financial controls, management
systems, staffing policies, and institutional priorities were to be re-
oriented from those used in municipalities to those appropriate for a com-
mercial enterprise. This transformation has been slow and difficult and
is still far from complete. Continuing institutional development is a key
objective of this project.
3.07     WASA has received consulting assistance to develop accounting
procedures and managerial techniques to provide a framework for its opera-
tions as a public utility. This endeavor resulted in the introduction of
management systems by consultants. Unfortunately WASA personnel is still
not fully familiar with the operation of these systems so that the antici-
pated benefits have not been fully realized. The project includes training
measures designed to achieve an improved management system.
Insurance
3.08      WASA is presently investigating the relative merits of either estab-
lishing a fund for self insurance or of entering into insurance contracts with
the national insurance company. Either of these measures would be acceptable.
Accounting
3.09      WASA's accounting procedures were recommended by consultants and,
with minor modifications, have been in use for a number of years. They follow
the commercial accrual method and are appropriate for WASA's needs.
WASA's Past Performance
3.10      The background to the first project is in para 4.01.  Implementa-
tion of the first project, described more fully in Annex 2, met with techni-
cal, managerial and financial problems. Disbursements of the credit were
suspended during Bangladesh's war of independence. Sweden provided an
interim credit from June 1972 to April 1973 at which point Credit 368-BD
replaced an original credit to Pakistan. The Credit has been fully disbursed.
The scope of the project was substantially reduced and was completed in
October 1978, approximately 9 years behind schedule.



- 8 -
3.11      Technical problems included slow delivery of materials, contractual
delays and delays of customs clearance. In addition, electric power connec-
tions to sewage pumping stations were frequently late. These and other prob-
lems can be traced to a weak senior management. Over the last two years the
benefits of having a new strong chairman have been felt and improvements have
occurred in all aspects of project performance.
3.12      Progress in making WASA a financially viable utility has been slow.
However during the last two years tariffs have been sufficient to cover
operating and maintenance expenses, interest charges and depreciation. In
response to a continuous dialogue between WASA and IDA, WASA's financial
problems have abated but more needs to be done. WASA's financial position
will improve further when the measures outlined in Chapter V are implemented.
IV. THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      In the early 1960's GOB, with the assistance of consultants,
established a water supply and sewerage development plan for Dacca. This
plan envisaged the development of an abstraction scheme at Demra to the east
of Dacca including a treatment plant, pumping arrangements and about 150 miles
of water mains. However, the scope of the proposal was beyond the financial
and institutional means of the newly established WASA and the scheme was
revised in 1968. The river abstraction plan was deferred in favor of tube-
wells and the extent of the proposed mains reduced. The final sewerage plan
provided for some 170 miles of sewers with pumping stations and a sewage
treatment plant designed for about 400,000 people. It was fundamentally
unchanged from the original plan although the mileage of sewers was reduced.
4.02      If the reduction in scope of the first project is considered together
with the city's burgeoning population growth (as described in Chapter 2), the
reasons for system's current inadequacies become easily understood. This
project is intended to remedy those inadequacies:
(a) About 25% of Dacca's population is without convenient
access to safe water. This project will extend distri-
bution to bring safe water to those pockets of population.
(b) Certain areas of the old city, especially at the extremities
of local distribution systems, are receiving inadequate
supplies due to very low mains pressures. This project
will increase water production in the affected areas.
(c) Branch sewers will be provided in about 25% of the city
area where these are lacking but where trunk sewers have
been constructed under the first project.



- 9 -
4.03      Groundwater would be the exclusive source in the proposed second
project as it was in the first. Availability of further groundwater supplies
has to be investigated and a fundamental question now to be faced is whether
continued exploitation of groundwater is feasible or development of a surface
water source must be undertaken. Consequently the proposed project includes
a feasibility study to determine if, when , and to what extent WASA should
shift from groundwater to surface water.
Project Description
4.04      The proposed project consists of the following main components
(for details see Annex 2 and maps IBRD No. 14205 and 14206):
Water Supply
(a) Twenty-four tube wells of which twenty will be located in the
peripheral areas and four in the old city. All wells will
be metered.
(b) Water mains including meters, fittings and valves in sizes
ranging from 100 mm (4") to 450 mm (18") totalling 140 km
(87 miles).
(c) Seven elevated storage tanks varying in capacity from
340 cu m (75,000 g) to 910 cu m (200,000g).
(d) 25,000 service connections with meters.
(e) 25,000 meters for existing service connections, and leak
detection equipment.
Sewerage
(f) Secondary sewers in sizes ranging from 150 mm (6") to 450 mm
(18") including manholes and branches totalling 88 km (55 miles).
Common Services
(g) Workshops, offices and stores.
(h) Vehicles and miscellaneous equipment.
Additional Items
(i) Engineering consulting services for the preparation of contract
drawings and documents, and for supervision of project imple-
mentation.



- 10 -
(j) Consulting services for the preparation of a long-term plan
and a feasibility study to develop solutions to the water,
sewerage and sanitation problems of the metropolitan Dacca
area, including a comprehensive analysis of water and sewerage
tariffs.
(k) Staff training.
4.05      As mentioned in paragraph 2.06, the proposed project will assure
that Dacca's per capita water supply will remain around today's levels (about
90 lcd) until benefits of a long-term project materialize. The total daily
water supply will increase by about 40% (300 mld versus 214 mld) but so will
Dacca's population. The number of standpipes will be increased providing
additional water supply to the poorer segments of the population. 1/ The
project also provides for small diameter sewers to extend the sewerage system
developed under the first project (Credit 368-BD). WASA will also be provided
with all necessary meters and other equipment needed to implement comprehensive
metering and waste prevention programs (para 5.10).
Cost Estimate
4.06      The estimated cost of the project is Taka 646 million (about US$42
million) including contingencies, customs duties and taxes. The estimated
costs are summarised in the following Table 4.1 and shown in greater detail
in Annex 3.
1/   At present, about 200,000 individuals in Dacca depend on about 1,400
standpipes, about 150 persons per standpipe. The number of standpipes
is expected to increase by about 150 per year during the next several
years.

4.07      WASA's estimates for civil works and equipment are based on the
cost of comparable work undertaken during 1978 and on bids for similar equip-
ment recently obtained in connection with the previous project (Credit 368-BD).
Physical contingencies of 15% have been included. Price contingencies of about
10% per year for the local cost and about 7% for the foreign cost have also
been included. Customs duties and taxes have been added in accordance with
local regulations. The cost estimates are adequate.
Project Financing and Relending Terms
4.08      The project would be financed by an IDA Credit of US$22 million
equivalent 74% of the total project cost, net of duties and taxes, of US$29.9
million equivalent. The Credit would cover all foreign costs (US$17.3 million
equivalent) and US$4.7 million of local costs. GOB will contribute US$7.9
million equivalent as well as US$11.8 million of duties and taxes. Agreement
has been reached during negotiations that the Government contribution will be
in the form of equity. GOB will relend to WASA the proceeds of the proposed
Credit for 25 years, including 5 years of grace, and at an interest rate of
7% per year. GOB will bear the foreign exchange risk. Execution of the Sub-
sidiary Loan Agreement between GOB and WASA is a condition of Credit effec-
tiveness. To cover advance payments for equipment and material needed for
the construction of tubewells, retroactive financing of payments made after
March 1, 1979 up to US$250,000 is proposed.
Project Implementation
4.09      WASA is responsible for the implementation of the project but will
be assisted by consultants in design, drafting of bid documents, bid evalua-
tion and construction supervision. Foreign consultants are expected to asso-
ciate themselves with a local firm. It is estimated that the total cost of
consultants services for project implementation will be about US$2 million
representing some 150 man-month by foreign consultants (US$8,000 per man-
month) and about 2,100 man-months by local consultants (Tk 4,000 per man-
month). 1/ Project construction will be carried out by local contractors.
All construction is straightforward and the local contractors are experienced
in this type of work. Tubewell construction and laying of water mains will
proceed throughout the year although some delays must be expected during the
monsoon season. Work on sewer construction will be phased over the construc-
tion period of the project but will stop during the monsoon season. All
major construction is expected to be completed by mid-1982 and project
completion in all respects is scheduled for December 31, 1982 (Annex 4).
1/   The estimated cost of consultants' services for the feasibility study
in connection with the long-term project is about US$1.9 million repre-
senting about 120 man-months by foreign consultants (US$8,000 per man-
months) and about 2,800 man-months by local consultants (Tk 4,000 per
man-month).



- 13 -
Procurement
4.10      All contracts for equipment, materials and meters will be awarded
under international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the
Association's guidelines. Exceptions will be made for items costing less
than US$15,000 having an aggregate value not exceeding US$350,000 which can
be procured through international or local shopping on the basis of at least
three priced quotations. The bulk of expenditure would be for pipes, mainly
asbestos cement and PVC for water mains. PVC pipes are manufactured locally
in the smaller diameters but until now have been more expensive than imported
pipes. Vitrified clay pipes are ideal for sewers in the smaller range of dia-
meters and are highly resistant to chemical and biological attack. With local
preference, the project affords an opportunity for Bangladesh's small clay
pipe industry to participate.
4.11      In evaluating bids for equipment and materials, domestic manufac-
turers would be given a preferentiaL margin equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs
of the competing imports or of the existing rate of customs duty, whichever
is lower.
4.12      Civil works include pipe Laying, tubewell construction and con-
struction of a few small elevated tanks; the works would amount to about
US$6.5 million equivalent made up of contracts of US$0.3 million equivalent
or less. The work is scattered throughout the city, mainly around the fringes.
Only the tubewell work requires special equipment which is available in the
country. The scope of individual contracts, the simplicity of the work, its
familiarity to the local contracting industry and its labor intensive charac-
ter are such that international bidding would not be practical. Instead
local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA, would be applied.
Disbursement
4.13      The proposed Credit would be disbursed against the following items:
(a) civil works (US$2,135,000 equivalent). 65% of total expendi-
tures for civil works contracts procured under local competi-
tive bidding;
(b) equipment and materials (US$13,425,000 equivalent). 100% of
foreign expenditures for directly imported goods, or 100% of
local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured goods,
or 50% for goods procured locally;
(c)  training (US$340,000 equivalent).  100% of total expenditures;
and
(d) consultants' services (US$3,900,000 equivalent). 100% of
total expenditures.
An unallocated sum of US$2.2 million is provided for contingencies.



- 14 -
Land Acquisition
4.14       Land requirements are small and amount in all to about 8 acres (3.5
ha) in parcels of about 1/3 acre or less for tubewell and tank sites. Around
Dacca's periphery, where most of the wells will be located, sites are readily
available; even in old Dacca, there is a sufficient number of sites. Exact
location of tubewells and elevated reservoirs is not critical and this factor
together with availability of alternative sites, some owned by Dacca Municipal
Corporation (DMC) or GOB, give adequate assurance of ease of acquisition.
WASA has already obtained assurances on sites controlled by DMC which will
permit a quick start to be made on well sinking. WASA is protected by legis-
lation which prevents any injunction on WASA on the use of an acquired site.
Wayleaves are not required for either water mains or sewers as all are to be
laid in public roads and footpaths. GOB will take all action necessary for
WASA to acquire the land required for the project.
Project Approval
4.15       As in the case of other projects in Bangladesh, GOB approval of
the Project Proforma is a condition of credit effectiveness.
Environmental and Health Impact
4.16       The project will have a favorable environmental and health impact.
It will, in general, enable WASA to maintain the levels of water supply on a
per capita basis in those areas already served and will raise the per capita
supply to similar levels in the peripheral areas where the project will have
maximum impact. In the old city, the project will reinforce existing supplies,
improve water main pressure and reduce the waiting time at public standpipes
by about 50%.
4.17      The extensions to the sewerage system will spread the benefits of
the trunk system to a wider area of the city. The works will reduce contamin-
ation in the streets, footpaths and dwelling areas and create an improved
environment for the 300,000 people who live in areas to be served; its effect
will not be limited to those areas, however, since any local reduction in
disease will have city-wide benefits.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
4.18      During negotiations WASA agreed to maintain such records as are
required by IDA for monitoring and evaluating progress during execution of the
project and at its completion (Annex 6).
V. FINANCES
Past and Present Financial Situation
5.01      During the past three years, WASA's rate of return on net fixed
assets in operation has been low. It reached 0.6% in FY76, 1.7% in FY77
and 1.1% in FY78. Expectations are that WASA will only break even in FY79.

Despite the low return, WASA has been able to generate sufficient cash inter-
nally to cover its operating expenses and debt service, and to finance a
small portion of its investment program (on an average about 14%). However,
this internal cash generation could be reached only because WASA's debt
service requirements have been insignificant leaving most of the depreciation
charge available for investment financing.
5.02      The reasons for WASA's inadequate financial position are the
following:
(a) inadequate tariff levels;
(b) inadequate metering resulting in excessive water
consumption by unmetered customers; and
(c) inadequate billing and collection.
Tariffs
5.03      The present tariff (Annex 11) has been in force since January 1,
1978 and is based on a tariff structure introduced in FY76. In accordance
with this structure, residential consumers are subsidized by industrial and
commercial customers who are being charged about twice to four times the resi-
dential tariff. Since FY76, charges to industrial consumers have increased
by 200% and to commercial consumers and offices by 350%, whereas domestic
tariffs were raised by only about 75%. Unmetered customers are being charged
on the basis of a percentage of the assessed property value; the percentage
has been doubled from 5% per year in FY76 to 10% in FY78 for residential
customers and from 2.5% to 5% for comnmercial/industrial customers and offices.
WASA has, in the past, levied only nominal charges for the water supplied
through standpipes. There are two kinds of sewer charges, namely, charges
for users of the sewer facilities actually connected to the system and
charges for potential customers situated within 100 feet of a sewer line.
Connected customers pay a fee equivalent to 100% of the water charge.
According to the published tariff structure, WASA can charge unconnected
customers 3% per year of the value of property holdings.
5.04      While some improvement in WASA's financial performance is expected
to result from increased operational efficiency, substantial further tariff
increases will be required to enable it to continue to cover its recurrent
expenses and to generate funds from internal sources sufficient to finance a
reasonable portion of its investment program. To achieve this goal:
(a) WASA will set and maintain rates for water supply and
sewerage services at levels which will provide sufficient
revenues:
(i) to cover operating expenses, including taxes, if any,
and interest;
(ii) to provide for adequate maintenance and depreciation;
and



- 16 -
(iii) to meet repayments on long-term debt in excess of depre-
ciation, and any increase needed in working capital.
(b)  In connection with the annual budget procedures, GOB will,
in consultation with WASA, review the water and sewerage
tariffs and will forward the results of such review to IDA
for comment.
(c)  Implementation of a water tariff increase for metered and
unmetered connections averaging 40% is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
5.05      The 40% tariff increase for metered consumers has already been
approved by GOB to become effective by September 30, 1979, whereas the tariff
increase for unmetered customers is expected to be approved shortly, and will
be implemented at approximately the same time. Recently WASA reached an
agreement that DMC will pay for the water drawn from street hydrants and
standpipes at the prevailing domestic rate, based on estimated consumption
(para 5.14).
5.06      Sewer charges for customers connected to the sewer system are equiv-
alent to the respective water charge. Consequently, they will be increased
in step with the water tariffs. As mentioned in paragraph 2.09, only about
8,500 customers have sewer connections at present although the trunk sewer-
age system covers about 75% of the city's total area and access to it will
be further extended under the proposed project. This low level of utiliza-
tion is undesirable from a sanitation point of view and GOB and WASA recognize
that connections to the sewer system must be considerably accelerated. WASA
will accelerate sewer connections for properties or households within 100
feet of a sewer. As an incentive to connect to the sewerage system Dacca
WASA will charge sewage fees whether or not a household is actually connected.
5.07      The consultant's feasibility study for the long-term project (para
4.04) will include a comprehensive analysis of WASA's water supply and sewer-
age tariffs. It will pay particular attention to the problem of tariffs
for unmetered consumers.
Metering and Waste Detection Programs
5.08      Although some metering of water consumption was included under the
first project (Credit 368-BD), only about 25% is metered of the residential
consumption With about 75% of consumption unmetered, losses can only be
estimated. More importantly, however, waste of water and excessive consump-
tion by unmetered customers is not discouraged and WASA loses substantial
amounts in revenues.
5.09      As mentioned in paragraph 2.07, WASA estimates its total system
losses at only 22% of production but it must be assumed that this estimate
is conservative. A significant portion of the unaccounted- for water is
used by non-metered customers who pay a low fixed charge (para 5.03) irres-
pective of the amount of water consumed.



- 17 -
5.10      In order to extend metering throughout WASA's supply area as quickly
as possible, to reduce waste and to discourage unauthorized connections, WASA
will:
(a)  prepare a program to detect and prevent waste in its water
system and submit this program to IDA for review and couxaent
by October 31, 1979. It will thereafter carry out this pro-
gram in accordance with appropriate engineering practices;
(b) maintain task forces to discover and eliminate unauthorized
connections, and will monitor the effectiveness of these task
forces; and
(c) install meters on all new connections under the proposed
project and establish and maintain a program for installa-
tion of meters on existinsg connections.
Billing and Collection
5.11      WASA's billing and collection record has been unsatisfactory.  In
the past, WASA collected only about 70% of its billings and in FY78 collec-
tions from non-Government users were only about 65% of billings.
5.12      GOB has now made administrative arrangements which have resulted
in reasonably prompt payments by Government authorities. In FY78, for
instance, WASA was able to collect 101% of its Government billings indicating
payment of arrears in addition to current charges. Furthermore, GOB has
instituted a procedure for deducting water and sewer charges from salaries
of employees residing in Government housing and remitting them to WASA.
5.13      Net customer receivables increased by Tk 9.1 million to Tk 36.7 mil-
lion during FY78. On an absolute basis, this represents an increase of 33%
over FY77 and in proportion to operating revenues the increase is 13.4%. Net
customer receivables represent 12.5 months of operating revenues. Considering
this, WASA's practice of writing off only 2% of gross customers receivables
annually is not realistic and results in overstatement of WASA's financial
performance. WASA's management plans to make a significant extraordinary
write-off of customer receivables considered uncollectible and to review the
appropriate amount for future annual write-offs in the light of the improved
billing and collection procedures w!hich have been introduced.
5.14      During negotiations agreeiment was reached on the following measures
which are designed to further improve WASA's billing and collection:
(a) by January 1, 1980, WASA will take measures, satisfactory to
IDA, to improve its billing procedures and collection perform-
ance, and will report periodically on the progress of such
measures;



- 18 -
(b) in order to improve billing of and collection from its non-
Government consumers, WASA will introduce or continue the
already introduced measures as follows:
(i)  reorganizing its revenue department with the objec-
tive of minimizing the number of persons involved
in the preparation and issuance of consumer bills
and identifying the responsibility for failure to
realize collection of the billed amounts;
(ii) stepping up its program for disconnecting delinquent
accounts; and
(iii) introducing procedures to warn delinquent customers
of imrpending disconnection;
(c) as an indication of the effectiveness of the improvement
measures, WASA will take all steps to ensure that the fol-
lowing minimum targets are realized:
By the End of           Collected Bills as a Percentage
Fiscal Year                     of Bills Sent Out
1980           70% of Taka value and number of invoices
1981           75% of Taka value and number of invoices
1982          80% of Taka value and number of invoices
1983           85% of Taka value and number of invoices
By the end of FY83 at the latest, WASA will review with
IDA the total progress made in improving its billing and
collection of receivables from non-Government customers,
and mutually acceptable targets for the period after FY83
will be agreed among the Government, WASA and IDA which
will be designed to lead to the maximum achievable percent-
age in WASA's collection of such receivables; and
(d)  GOB will continue to pay, or cause to be paid, promptly to
WASA:
(i)  charges for water supplied through public standpipes
by DMC at not less than the prevailing domestic rate
(see also paragraph 5.05); and
(ii) charges for all water supplied by WASA to the various
departments and agencies of the Government and its
employees residing in Government-provided housing.

Future Improvement
5.15     In order to provide a measure of the success of the above-mentioned
measures as well as the Government's willingness to permit WASA to adjust its
tariffs as and when required, it was agreed during negotiations that WASA
will take all necessary steps to ensure that the following rate of return
targets on non-revalued net fixed assets in operation are realized (para 5.20):
FY80         3%
FY81         2% 1/
FY82         2% 1/
FY83         5%
5.16      Financial projections for FY78-87 are set out in Annexes 12-16.
The assumptions used in preparing the projections are given in Annex 16.
Salient features of WASA's finances are summarized in Table 5.1 below:

Fixed Asset Revaluation
5.19      WASA has not revalued its assets to reflect inflation in general
or the devaluation of the Taka specifically. General revaluation is not a



- 22 -
recognized accounting practice in Bangladesh. The adjustment to accounts
for increased liability for the IDA foreign exchange credit will be made in
the FY79 statements. As part of this foreign exchange adjustment WASA will
adjust the capitalized value of consulting services, most of which were
obtained early in the first project when local currency had substantially
greater value relative to hard currencies. To date, WASA has not amortized
this account and intends to write it off over 30 years starting in 1979.
5.20      Asset accounting on a non-revalued basis results in a provision for
depreciation that does not reflect adequately the cost of asset replacement.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that WASA, in consultation with
IDA, will develop by FY81 a method of revaluing its assets, and will intro-
duce asset revaluation not later than the start of FY82.
Borrowing
5.21      At present, WASA's long-term debt consists of the principal and
accrued interest for the Government loan representing the Taka equivalent
of Credit 368-BD. Both principal and accrued interest were recorded at
their original Taka value but will be revalued to reflect the change in the
exchange rate Taka versus US dollar. As can be seen from Table 5.1 (para
5.16), WASA's debt/equity ratio is low (39/61 in FY79) and the debt service
coverage is expected to remain within reasonable limits. WASA has agreed not
to incur any long-term debt unless its 12-month net revenues out of the
15-month period preceding the intended borrowing covers at least 1.25 times
the maximum future debt service requirements on all its long-term debt. WASA
has also agreed not to incur short-term debt except for working capital pur-
poses in the ordinary course of its business.
Spare Parts
5.22      There is a need for streamlining WASA's policy on procurement of
spare parts. In order to ensure that future purchases of spare parts will
be in line with requirements, WASA will establish a separate fund for spare
parts and maintain in such fund an amount limited to that necessary for the
ensuing three month period. GOB will provide the foreign exchange for this
as and where required.
Audit
5.23      WASA's accounts are audited annually by an independent firm
appointed by MLGRD. Due to delays in appointing auditors, WASA has not been
able to issue audited statements within six months of the close of the fiscal
years as required under Credit 368-BD. To assure that in future auditors
are appointed in a timely manner and that audits on a continuous basis are
carried out, GOB and WASA will appoint an acceptable auditing firm at the
start of each fiscal year. Appointment of auditors for FYs 79 and 80 is a
condition of credit effectiveness.

VI. JUSTIFICATION
Background
6.01      The long term answer to Dacca's water supply needs may involve a mix
of ground and surface water. The process of determining the appropriate mix
and designing and constructing a long-term project to realize it is expected
to take several years. Without the proposed project, decreased water produc-
tion and increased population could reduce daily per capita supplies to about
60 liters by 1982, an unacceptable level.
6.02      Dacca's sewerage system has been widely extended under the first
project but there are several unserved areas. The system for collection,
conveyance and disposal will be extended by the project from the basic trunk
sewer system by small diameter sewers without need of further pumping stations.
6.03      The proposed project will improve the functional capacity of Dacca
WASA by providing additional training for technical, administrative and,
especially, operational staff, which will will enhance WASA's commercial
viability and technical efficiency.
Impact on the Urban Poor
6.04      The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics uses household expenditure indi-
cators and its data suggest that a minimum of 15% of Dacca's population spends
less than 1/3 of the national average of 1,700 Taka per annum. However,
according to a family income survey conducted by Dacca University the number
of poor may be nearly 40% of the total. Other guides to the number of urban
poor are the percentages of the population dwelling in slums (20-25%) and
suffering from malnutrition (about 45% of children and 27% of the population
as a whole). Using sufficiency of nutritional intake as the indicator, nearly
one out of every three residents of Dacca lives below the poverty line.
6.05      This wide range of indicators suggests that the number of urban
poor in Dacca is at least 25-35% of the population. Most of the poor are
concentrated in the old city and the fringe areas; even higher income dis-
tricts have enclaves of shanty dwellers.
6.06      The project will address inter alia the problem of providing addi-
tional supplies to those areas within the city and its fringes with large
concentrations of urban poor. More standpipe water will be available in the
old city; the construction of additional tubewells there will reduce waiting
at standpipes and lessen use of the expensive alternative of purchasing water
from street vendors. The construction of sewers, which will benefit some
300,000 people directly, will provide the indirect benefit of improved sani-
tation.
Impact on Health
6.07      Waterborne diseases are endemic in Bangladesh.  All diarrheal
diseases taken together have mortality and prevalence rates of 3.5 and 16.5



- 24 -
per 1,000 respectively (1976 figures). The relationship between mortality and
prevalence is probably accurate, but the figures are based on reported cases
which may understate the actual problem by a factor as large as ten. 1/
Annual figures do not reveal seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of water
borne diseases.
6.08      There is a high incidence of scabies and other skin diseases
largely due to the lack of wholesome water supplies needed to maintain a
reasonable standard of personal hygiene.
6.09      The health impact of inadequate water and sewerage services most
greatly affect the poor who cannot afford privately owned facilities such as
storage tanks, pumps and septic tanks. Because their resistance is lowered
by malnutrition, they are easy victims of disease. Health authorities are
convinced that the first priority in combating disease among the poor is
improved sanitation and hygiene, for which improved water supply and sewerage
are essential prerequisites.
Marginal Cost and Tariffs
6.10      Using a discount rate of 9-1/2%, the average incremental cost (AIC)
of water supply and sewerage is Taka 10.8 per thousand imperial gallons of
additional water supplied. An expanded presentation of the AIC calculations
appears in Annex 17, including a separate analysis from which the sewerage
component from the AIC calculation is excluded.
6.11      The AIC compares with FY79 projected average revenues of Taka 2.4
per thousand gallons (total water and sewerage revenue divided by the quantity
of water supplied). A more reasonable frame of reference, however, is the
FY79 projected revenue per 1,000 gallons which, at Taka 5.6 is about 52% of
the AIC.
6.12      The present average tariff level will be increased (para 5.04) to
levels which approximate more closely the average incremental cost of supply,
and which will permit WASA to realize the financial targets specified in
paragraph 5.15.
6.13      Cross subsidization is justified for Dacca for social reasons;
still, since 75% of water revenues are realized from the residential sector,
which consumes 92% of the accountable production of water, there is a limit
to the potential revenue realizable from cross subsidization. Furthermore,
care must be exercised to maintain some reasonable relationship between the
industrial tariff and the AIC; otherwise, it will prove economically bene-
ficial for these consumers to obtain water by drilling their own wells. This
further limits the amount obtainable through cross subsidization. WASA is
aware of this problem which will be considered in the tariff study included
in the feasibility study for the long-term project (para 4.04).
1/   Cholera Research Laboratory Report for 1977.



- 25 -
Economic Rate of Return
6.14      Assuming the incremental revenue accruing to WASA is a proxy for
the minimum level of benefits derived from the project an economic rate
of return of about 5% is indicated. Annex 18 presents ERR calculations with
tariffs increasing in stages to various peak levels.
Affordability
6.15      Most of the very poorest households have their water subsidized.
Many depend upon obtaining their water from wealthier households who, in
turn, pay for their consumption in accordance with normal practice. The
remainder obtain their water from standpipes at no financial cost (though
DMC is to compensate WASA).
6.16      Dacca's median household has monthly expenditures of about Taka 400
per month (US$26 per month at the official exchange rate). This median
household currently pays an average of Taka 1 per month per person for water,
representing slightly under 1.3% of its monthly per capita expenditure. By
increasing the household rate to Taka 9.5 as would be necessary to cover
average incremental cost, this median household will pay an average of
Taka 2.9 per month per person, representing 4.0% of monthly per capita
expenditure which is about as high as is feasible. It is generally recog-
nized that expenditures for water should be in the 1-4% range.

THE SECOND DACCA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Project Description
A. WATER SUPPLY
History
1.        Dacca's water supply system dates back to 1872 when a small surface
water abstraction was built on the Buriganga River. The associated treatment
plant at Chandnighat delivered 0.9 mld (0.2 mgd) into a network of distribu-
tion mains extending in all to about 4.5 miles. By 1939 the plant could
supply 11 mld (2.4 mgd) and the reticulation had increased to 57 miles.
Subsequently periodical extension were made, in each case in association with
a tubewell (or wells) and not always interconnected. Under the first IDA
project, the water supply network was formed into a cohesive whole and the
number of tubewells increased to 72; at the same time the undertaking was
placed in the hands of WASA, newly established for the purpose. At present,
of the 214 mld (47 mgd) put into supply, 93% comes from tubewells and the
remainder from the Buriganga River. The water main reticulation now extends
to about 650 km (400 miles).
2.        When IDA took an interest in Dacca's water supply problems in 1963
it was first proposed to build a new surface water abstraction on the Lakhya
River at Demra a few miles east of the city but the project was subsequently
revised and the surface water scheme dropped in favor of a groundwater scheme.
A site at Demra had been acquired however and has been filled to a suitable
construction level with material dredged from the river. GOB has permitted
the use of the site as a settlement for landless people and at present it is
estimated that some 30,000 people live there.
3.         In the event that the third Dacca Water Supply Project proposes a
surface water scheme, GOB and WASA will be faced with the problem of either
relocating the present occupants of the site or relocating the proposed
water treatment plant. Both GOB and WASA are aware of the situation and
are considering plans for dealing with it.
4.         Under the first project the following works were completed.
(i) 46 tubewells;
(ii) rehabilitation and modification of the surface water plant
at Chandnighat;



--29 -                        ANNEX 2
Page 2
(iii) installation of about 200 km (120 miles) of water mains
with service connections, meters and street hydrants; and
(iv) three 1.0 IMg elevated storage tanks.
Water Supply Under the Proposed Project
4.        The project would provide for extensions of the existing system
by means of additional tubewells, water mains and elevated storage tanks.
Because existing tanks are not fully utilized the number of tanks to be
constructed would not exceed seven and may be reduced in number if technical
assessment at detailed design stage reveals that underutilization is likely.
Water production would be increased from 214 mld to 300 mld.
5.        The districts to benefit directly under the project are shown
in the following table together with salient items of work (see also Map
IBRD 14205):

6.        The quality of groundwater in the Dacca area is satisfactory and,
apart from chlorination, treatment is not proposed.
B. Sewerage
History
7.        Dacca's sewerage system originated in 1923 when a combined storm
and sewage system was developed. By intermittent works the system was
extended to cover most of old Dacca and because of the flat terrain it
incorporated not only the sewers but a gradually increasing number of lift
stations (or pumping stations). The focal point of the system was the major
pumping station at Narinda from where the whole flow was pumped to a treatment
plant on the south eastern outskirts of the city.

Page 3
8.        Dacca's expansion and increasing sewage flows in the serviced areas
overloaded both Narinda and the treatment plant and in 1963 proposals were
made for improvements.
9.        The first Dacca Water Supply and Sewerage Project provided 200 km
(120 miles) of sewers, seven minor pumping stations, a new principal pumping
station at Narinda with a capacity equivalent to 3 x dwf from 400,000 people,
a sewage treatment plant designed to cater for 400,000 people and an effluent
outfall sewer to the Buriganga River.
10.       The proposed project will provide about 88 km (55 miles) of sewers
designed to serve areas presently unsewered but which can drain by gravity
to the trunk sewers constructed under the first project. The areas to be
served are shown on IBRD Map No. 14206. Sewers to be constructed within
those areas are as follows:

11.       Sewer design has been carried forward from the previous project
and is based on the water usage in the area.  It has been assumed that 70%
of water used finds its way to the sewers and peak flow rate has been taken
as a 3.5 x 0.7 multiple of average water usage. An additional allowance for
infiltration has been included; this amounts to 28,000 liters/km/24 hours.
Minimum velocity for design purposes is 2 feet/second. Manholes, which would
be of brick (local) construction, would be located at all changes of gradient
and direction.

BANGLADESH
SECOND DACCA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Notes for Financial Statements and Projections
General Notes
1.        The financial statements for FY75-FY77 are presented in Annexes 7,
8 and 9 in a manner consistent with WASA's own audited presentations. Certain
changes were considered in an effort to provide a true representation of
WASA's performance during that period; however, WASA had not sufficiently
broken down the underlying accounts so that any contemplated modification
would have been based on conjecture and the resultant presentation would
hardly have provided a better picture than WASA's own figures.
2.        The financial statements for FY78, which appear in Annexes 7-9
and reappear in Annexes 13-15 are actual year end figures formulated by
WASA and are subject to finalization by independent auditors in accordance
with section 4.01(c)(ii) of the Development Credit Agreement governing
Credit 368-BD.
3.        WASA has indicated it is likely to make certain changes in account-
ing practices, which will be applicable to their statements. Where possible,
these have been incorporated into the projections taking effect in the year of
expected implementation. Where the effect of these changes proved difficult
to quantify, projections are presented using the practices traditionally
followed by WASA.   No attempt was made to evaluate the retroactive effect of
these changes; rather, the projections were formulated to permit an analysis
of the impact of the introduction of each change in future.
Income Statement Projections
Revenues
4.        For the part of the city already served with water the ratio of
number of connections to number of households during the last four years
was used to establish a trendline for the future. For each future year, that
ratio derived from the trendline was multiplied by the number of households
projected for the area giving the number of connections to be served in that
part of the city. Similarly, a trendline was established to allow projection
of gallons consumed per connection. By multiplying the number of connections
by the demand per connection, demand figures were determined.

ANNEX 16

5.        In parts of the city for which water service is to be provided from
this project, it is assumed that utilization will be limited by WASA's ability
to connect households to the system until such time as the connections per
household level reaches that which applies to the rest of the city. At that
time, the number of connections in the new area increases at the same rate
as in the old area. Prior to that, the number of connections in the area
increases in accordance with the following schedule:
FY                1981   1982   1983  1984   1985   1986   1987
Number of connections    1,000  2,500  5,000 6,500  8,000  9,000  10,000
6.        Once the yearly demand in gallons was obtained, this was multi-
plied by a price per 1,000 gallons derived from modifying that year's average
household rate by a distribution factor which allows for sales to unmetered
connections, special sales of water and system losses. The distribution
factor increased from 40% in FY79 to 50% in FY86 and was assumed to remain at
that level thereafter. The reason for basing pricing and the distribution
factor on the household rates is that they have accounted for 92% of annual
water service consumption and represent a similar percentage of accounts.
7.        Tariff increases were assujmed so that the household rate would
be Taka 5 per 1,000 gallons and the average rate would become Taka 8 per
1,000 gallons as of July 1, 1979. Thereafter, further increases
of Taka 1.5 per thousand gallons in the household rate ancl Taka 2.0 per
thousand gallons in the average rate were assumed to take effect every 18
months through FY87.
8.        Connection revenues were based on the computed number of new
connections per year multiplied by the current average connection charge
of Taka 750. No increases were assumed in the connection charge.
9.        Hydrant revenues are projected to increase arithmetically beginning
with the Taka 2,200,000 committed to WASA in FY79. Although tacit agreements,
which should substantially increase these revenues exist, it is assumed that
the sums provided for will prove difficult to realize.
10.       Sewerage demand was projected in a manner similar to water demand
in the area currently served, a trendline giving the household penetration
rate was developed from which the number of connections served per year
could be derived. In the area of Dlacca coming on stream now (resulting
from works completed only at the end of the first project) it was assumed
that 1,000 connections would be madle per year until the city's average pene-
tration rate was reached, at which point, growth would continue in accordance
with the trendline. Similarly, growth in the second project area would be
based on 1,000 new connections per year beginning in FY82 until the city's
average penetration rate would be reached, after which growth would follow
the trendline (since this occurs after FY89, this condition had no practical
value).

11.       Each year's sewer connections were multiplied by a price derived
from the relationship of sewerage billings per connection to water billings
per connection. The same distribution factor used in establishing the water
price per connection establishes the counterpart figure for sewerage.
12.        Sewerage connection revenues were computed by multiplying the
number of projected new connections by the current average connection charge
of Taka 800. No increases in connection charges are assumed.
13.       Although WASA has been asked to obtain and implement the right to
bill all consumers within 100 feet of sewer lines for its use, regardless of
whether or not they are connected, no additional revenues have been projected
as a result of this change. It is assumed that a lengthy period may be needed
to introduce the new system and get it to work properly.
14.       Other income has been projected to increase arithmetically each
year. It has been placed before expenses because much of its underlying
content is related, even if not directly, to the sale of water and sewerage
services.
Operating Costs
15.       Between FY80 and FY84, all direct costs have been increased in
direct proportion to additions to the systems. Additionally, it is expected
that prices for power, maintenance and chemicals will inflate by 15% annually,
despite an average national inflation rate of 9-1/2% for the same period.
Historically, direct costs have increased at a faster rate than inflation and
the 15% rate was chosen in the interest of conservatism.
16.        Indirect overhead, which consists primarily of short term interest
and certain insurance premiums, is assumed to increase arithmetically during
the period.
17.       Employment is expected to increase from a present level of 1,800
to a post project level of about 2,300 between FY79 and FY82. Additionally,
salaries are expected to inflate by 15% yearly in contrast to an average
national inflation level of about 10%. Fringe benefits are expected to
inflate at the annual average rate.
18.       Other management expenses are projected to increase by about 10%,
in accordance with inflation.
19.       Depreciation of fixed assets is computed on the expected life of
assets at an average rate of 2.6% annually. A portion of depreciation
results from write offs from expenses which were capitalized during the
first project and of accrued interest applicable to the second credit.
20.        Interest for the first credit is computed at an annual rate of 3%
and the repayment period is 30 years. For the second credit, on-lending terms
are computed at 7% and 20 years repayment following a five year grace period.

21.       The continuing build-up of receivables indicates that WASA has
overstated the collectibility of these accounts by limiting annual bad
debt write-offs to 2%. In order to more correctly reflect the situation,
a 50% extraordinary write-off of receivables, in addition to the annual 2%
write-off, was projected for FY79, after which the annual rate was increased
to 10%.
22.       When revaluing assets to reflect appreciation of their foreign
exchange component, it is necessary to revalue the stores of replacement
equipment, much of which were bought using foreign exchange. Stores have a
fixed asset component which should be depreciated; however, quantifying this
component and setting rules for depreciation is unreliable in the absence of
more detailed information regarding these assets. A write-off equal to the
foreign exchange adjustment was prolected in the form of an extraordinary loss
in FY79.
Sources and Applications of Funds Projections
Sources of Funds
23.       Internal cash generation is expected to cover cash operating
expenses, cash debt service, and working capital requirements unrelated to the
second project during FY80-FY82. As of FY83, because revenues of substance
are realizable from incremental areas being served by the second project and
from the continuing program of tariff increases, WASA is expected to build up
increased reserves of cash.
24.       External financing will cover the second project in its entirety.
$22 million will be obtained through onlending of the IDA credit. The
remaining $20 million will be provided by GOB as equity. Of this portion
$13 million will be used to cover duties and taxes, a situation in which WASA
is really acting as an agent in the transfer of cash from one public sector of
the economy to another. After deducting this factor, GOB infusions of equity
will supply only 25% of WASA's investment needs for the second project.
25.       Collections, which have remained relatively steady at 70% of
billings during the last four years, are projected to increase gradually
to 85% during the term of the project and though expected to continue
improving, are projected to remain at that level thereafter. It is further
assumed that government and related accounts will remain relatively current
in accordance with the favorable experience in FY78.
Applications of Funds
26.       The first project was completed in FY79 and most investments related
thereto projected for the current year are expected to be incurred in the form
of non-cash reconciliations of accounts.
27.       Minor expenditures under the second project may be recorded during
FY79 for the purpose of advance ordering of materials and equipment needed to
implement the contemplated construction schedule. It is expected that actual



-. 48 -                          ANNEX 16
Page 5
work on the project will be undertaken during the FY80 - FY83 period. During
this period, it is expected that project expenditures are entered as work-in-
process into the Advances for Materials and Services account in the year in
which incurred. These are transferred to the fixed assets account in the
following year.
28.       Working capital increases, exclusive of those which relate directly
to work in process fixed assets, increase gradually. The biggest component
is the cash buildup resulting from widened and improved operations. Stores
and Advance for Materials and Services are expected to increase only in FY81-
FY83, on a basis of 25%, 15% and 1% in each respectively. Current liabilities,
which have historically been low, are projected to increase by 20% annually.
Balance Sheet Projections
29.       Fixed assets are shown on a non-revalued historical cost basis
adjusted for the appreciation of the foreign exchange component of their
purchase price. WASA has agreed to maintain an asset register permitting
revaluation of assets in memorandum form by FY82; however, they are not
required to incorporate revaluation into their annual audited statements.
30.       It was assumed that the taka would not sustain further devaluation
relative to the dollar. It is understood that any future currency shift
would necessitate further adjustment of fixed assets to reflect the appre-
ciation of the foreign exchange component of underlying fixed assets.
31.       Capitalized engineering and consulting expenditures are assumed
directly related to the acquisition of fixed assets under the first project.
This account will be transferred to fixed assets effective in FY79 and depre-
ciation over a 30 year period will begin thereafter.
32.       The process of capitalizing portions of on-going overhead is pro-
jected to cease in FY79 and the net amount capitalized will be written off
over a 10 year period. Henceforth, all overhead and management expenditures
will be expensed in the period incurred.
33.       First credit accruals of interest will cease in FY79 as WASA is
expected to begin making full cash payments covering interest and principal
repayments in accordance with 3% interest of 30 years. These capitalized net
accruals will be expensed over the next 10 years.
34.       Interest accruals applicable to the second credit will be capital-
ized during the five year grace period in accordance with the accounting
practices used to accrue interest under the first credit.
35.       WASA's liability pertinent to the first credit is projected to be
adjusted in FY80 to properly reflect WASA's assumption of the foreign exchange
risk applicable thereto. Accrued interest amounts, by which principal has
been increased, are not being increased by corresponding factors because
no foreign exchange risk is associated therewith.

Economic Rate of Return
Economic rate of return calculations are based on the following:
The labor component of all costs has been estimated both
at full market price and at 70% of the market price.
Foreign equipment and materials costs are expressed in
CIF terms. Identifiable taxes and duties are netted out
of local costs, which are converted to border prices by
converting at the current official exchange rate of Tk 15.5
per US dollar and then by multiplying by the average stand-
ard conversion factor for Bangladesh of 0.75.
Costs and benefits are expressed in "border" dol'Lars (costs
are converted to border prices as above while benefits are
similarly converted by use of the official exchange rate
and the standard conversion factor).
Construction is assumed to be carried out during the four-
year period of FY1980-FY1983 (some advanced ordering of
equipment is assumed for FY1979). All new facilities con-
structed under the project will be operational by the end
of 1982, incurring most of the incremental cost by that
time. There is a gradual increase in incremental operating
costs during the years of construction.
Incremental revenues should begin in FY1981 and increase
gradually until FY1989 by which time new additions will be
in full use. It is assumed that all incremental revenues
will occur from metered consumption as is intended by the
project.
Tariffs will be increased in accordance with paragraph 5.17
until the household rate of Taka 9.5 per thousand gallons and
the average rate of Taka 14.5 per thousand gallons have been
reached. At that point, marginal revenues will slightly
exceed the average incremental cost computed in constant
FY1979 prices. Other tariff increases are considered not
directly related to the provision of new facilities and
are netted out.

As in the AIC computation, an average life of 40 years for
all water and sewerage works is assumed, with no residual
value at the end and no major replacements during the period.

SECOND DACCA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
RECOMMENDATION ON TRAINING
1.        The training components to be financed under the Second Dacca Water
and Sewerage Project should include provisions for setting up and developing
the local training resources and expertise required to design and implement
systematic training programs both on and off-the-job. Priority attention
should be given to meeting basic and refresher training needs at the sub-
professional employment levels, particularly those of about 100 sub-assistant
engineers collectively employed by WASA. Training programs should also be
introduced for commercial and administrative support staff in addition to the
more manpower intensive area of operation and maintenance of pumping, water
treatment and water distribution plant and systems. The initial portfolio
of training programs should be developed in the form of a series of self-
contained training modules, complete with simple training aids, models and
manuals, relating to the following work activities:
(a)  mains and service pipe laying and jointing;
(b)  sewer inspection and maintenance;
(c)  treatment plant operations;
(d)  tubewell and pumping operations;
(e)  pressure and flow recording;
(f)  waste detection and prevention;
(g)  water meter installation, calibration and repair;
(h)  water meter reading;
(i)  maintenance of standby equipment;
(j)  billing and revenue accounting;
(k)  store keeping; and
(1)  occupational safety and hygiene.
2.        The detailed design and implementation of the training program
would require the assistance of a training consultant retained for this pur-
pose on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
3.        The existing site of the Dacca meter repair/laboratory premises
would provide a most suitable location for the development of a training unit
which should initially comprise the following:
(a)  one open sided training bay with a hard standing gradient
floor and charged but replaceable water pipes with pressure
gauges for basic and refresher training in mains and service
laying, maintenance, repair and modification of pipework
systems;



_ 61 -                         ANNEX 20
Page 2
(b) one small training workshop for stripping, assembly,
adjustment and maintenance of electrical, mechanical and
pumping equipment, valves andl hydrants, and
(c) a training store.
During the development phase the training unit should be administered as an
extension of the services currently provided by the WASA's Secretariat. A
full time training staff should be established which, in order to cover
training both on and off-the-job, should comprise three instructors drawn
from existing sub-assistant engineers (possibly on rotation), and headed
up by a training officer at assistant engineer level. At least one instructor
should be nominated by Chittagong WASA..
4.        Overall supervision of the training scheme should be vested in a
Joint Training Committee with appropriate representation from each Dacca
and Chittagong WASA. The Chairman of each WASA could possibly alternate as
Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Training Committee which, inter alia, would
screen and approve the annual training budget. The Joint Training Committee
would be required to draw up a policy statement on training which would
give effect to the operation, direction, priorities and financing of the
overall manpower development program.
5.        In addition to the management and operation of the training unit,
the training staff, assisted by the training consultant and guided by the
Joint Training Committee, would formulate and implement, within the project
period, an overall training plan for specialized, semi-specialized and non-
specialized staff, incorporating, where appropriate, the local and/or national
vocational training and technical education facilities which exist in the
public sector. A complementary objective would be the creation of a stronger
link between the water sector and the formal education sector.
6.        The selection of candidates, if any, for overseas fellowships and
training attachments/secondments should be made and arranged in conjunction
with the fellowship programs being provided under the current: UNDP project.
7.        The proposed training program should include provision for establish-
hing, from within WASA's existing manpower resources, a service laying/house
connection capability. Failing this, or until this is achieved, all licensed
private plumbers should be obliged to undergo, and successfully complete,
relevant training provided through the joint training scheme, in order to
remain under license to WASA.
