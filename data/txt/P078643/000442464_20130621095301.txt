F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The project's development objective was to increase the safety and efficiency of navigation. This
was to be achieved by establishing a demonstration marine highway to guide ships around
environmentally sensitive areas and through selected busy sea lanes and by supporting the
widening of the regional agreement on port state control and the implementation of its
provisions.

The project's medium to long-term global environmental goal was to reduce the risk of ship-
based environmental contamination (such as oil spills from groundings and illegal discharges of
ballast and bilge waters) and to strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical
spill emergencies in the region.

The project had three specific global environmental objectives: The first was to ascertain the
economic, technical, and institutional feasibility of introducing modern aids to navigation
systems in the region, such as an electronically supported marine highway, to guide ships
through sensitive areas and to encourage monitoring of the movements and activities of fishing
and other vessels operating within countries' territorial waters. The second objective was to
support the widening of the existing regional agreement (June 5, 1998) on port state control and
the implementation of its provisions. The third objective, focusing on Kenya, Mozambique,
South Africa, and Tanzania, was to reduce the risk of environmental damage to beaches, fishing
grounds, and other domestic resources from spills of oil and chemicals. This was to be achieved
by supporting the efforts of Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania to become part of
a regional oil spill response plan, by completing the identification and mapping of
environmentally sensitive areas along coasts and sea lanes, and by supporting regional
collaboration with the other Western Indian Ocean island states.

1       Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.      The coastal and marine environment of the Western Indian Ocean is of global
importance. Home to two large marine ecosystems in the Agulhas and Somali currents, the
region exhibits high biodiversity and endemism. The economies of the riparian countries and
livelihoods of many communities depend on the health of these ecosystems, which are threatened
by several anthropogenic pressures, including overfishing, pollution, destruction of coral reefs,
and unsustainable development of coastal zones.

2.      At the time of appraisal, the shipping lanes along the East African coast were among the
busiest in the world, carrying over 30 percent of the world’s crude oil supplies. Over 5000 tanker
voyages per year took place in the sensitive coastal waters of the region, passing in close
proximity of the World Heritage Site of Aldabra atoll (Seychelles). Oil and gas exploration
programs also operated in the region. The risk of oil spills was therefore significant, which
would severely harm the exceptional ecosystems and the economies that rely on them.

3.      Most of the countries in the region are party to the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and had declared a 200-mile exclusive economic zone to establish a
claim to the continental shelf. However, they lacked the institutional and financial capacity to
effectively monitor activities of vessels and to enforce their control over activities taking place
within their jurisdictions and responsibilities. Accordingly, there was mutual recognition about
the need to work together to improve the safety of navigation and protect the marine and coastal
environment.

4.      The project included Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles,
South Africa and Tanzania, and aimed at protecting the globally-significant marine and coastal
resources of the Western Indian Ocean. It had the worthwhile aim of reducing the risk of oil
spills by improving safety of navigation in the regional seas and supporting the beneficiary
countries in enhancing their monitoring capacity. It also targeted the response to oil spills by
building national and local capacity to combat oil spills, and through the creation of a mechanism
for regional cooperation.

5.      The countries of the region were not likely to coordinate and undertake activities that
demand local resources but provide regional and global benefits. This project was designed to fill
this gap and support the countries in this much needed initiative. The initiative also benefited
from the positive experience gained in the earlier project in supporting countries’ efforts to work
cooperatively in regional seas, international waters and trans-boundary pollution.1 The
involvement of the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was also a
significant factor in mobilizing resources from other sources.



1
 The (FY99) West Indian Ocean Islands Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project (P036037), was financed by the
GEF, and implemented between February 1999 and June 2004.

                                                      1
6.       The proposed project was in line with the Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) of the
participating countries. The Kenya CAS (2004) named the proposed project as important not
only to protect coastal and marine resources, but also to promote regional integration. The
Mozambique CAS (2003) and the Country Partnership Strategy for Mauritius (2006) emphasized
the importance of protecting coastal and marine resources to promote sustainable development of
tourism, a major contributor to economic growth in the countries. The Madagascar CAS (2003)
placed environmental protection at the center of its strategy, noting the strong linkages between
environmental degradation and high levels of poverty. The Interim Strategy Note for Comoros
(2006) and the CAS for Tanzania (2000) discussed environmental protection as a key element of
their strategies for sustainable development. At the time of appraisal, no recent CASs had been
produced for Seychelles or for South Africa. Both countries had, however, taken strong action to
protect their coastal and marine resources in recognition of the importance of the tourism and
fishing industries to their respective economies.

7.      The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Global Environmental Objectives
(GEOs) of the project were also consistent with the objectives of the Nairobi Convention for the
Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the
Eastern African Region, to encourage regional initiatives and cooperation among the states for
the protection, management, and development of marine and coastal resources of the eastern and
southern African region. They were also consistent with several conventions of the International
Maritime Organization (IMO), which, collectively, require signatories to take coordinated action
to protect marine and coastal resources and ensure the safety of navigation. Similarly, they were
aligned with GEF goals and criteria.

1.2       Original Project Development Objective, Global Environmental Objectives and Key
          Indicators

8.     The PDO, as defined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), was to increase the
safety and efficiency of navigation. This was to be achieved by establishing a demonstration
marine highway to guide ships around environmentally sensitive areas and through selected busy
sea-lanes and by supporting widening the regional agreement on port state control and
implementation of its provisions.

9.        Key performance indicators included:

         Number of passages of vessels traveling through the region using the marine highway
          and its electronic charts for navigation; and
         Number of ship inspections carried out at major ports in the region.

10.     The project’s medium-to-long term global environmental goals were to reduce the risk of
ship-based environmental contamination (such as oil spills from groundings and illegal
discharges of ballast and bilge waters) and to strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to
oil or chemical spill emergencies in the region.

11.    The project had three specific GEOs: The first was to ascertain the economic, technical,
and institutional feasibility of introducing modern aids to navigation systems in the region, such
as an electronically supported marine highway, to guide ships through sensitive areas and

                                                 2
encourage monitoring of the movements and activities of fishing and other vessels operating
within countries’ territorial waters. The second objective was to support widening the existing
regional agreement (June 5, 1998) on port state control2 and implementation of its provisions.
The third objective, focusing on Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania, was to reduce
the risk of environmental damage to beaches, fishing grounds and other domestic resources from
spills of oil and chemicals. This was to be achieved by supporting the efforts of Kenya,
Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania to prepare a regional oil spill response plan, by
completing the identification and mapping of environmentally sensitive areas along coasts and
sea lanes, and support regional collaboration with the Western Indian Ocean island states. Key
performance indicators included:

         Modern aids to navigation systems (forming the pilot highway) installed and the
          feasibility of the approach for the region assessed with the full involvement of industry
          groups. Should the concept prove feasible, a plan for further development is put into
          place;
         Action plan for monitoring of fisheries activities developed by mid-term review, and
          some of its main recommendations implemented thereafter;
         Agreement reached with Madagascar and Comoros to join the regional agreement on port
          state control, signed on June 5, 1998; and
         Agreement reached by all eight states participating in the project on the arrangements for
          cooperation in cases of major pollution incidents.

1.3       Revised PDO, GEO and Key Indicators

12.       The PDOs, the GEOs, and key indicators were not revised during project implementation.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

13.     The beneficiaries identified in the PAD are the participating States, namely Comoros,
Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa and Tanzania.
Furthermore, it can be deduced from the project description and implementation that the primary
target groups were the stakeholders residing in, or living off healthy marine and coastal
ecosystems, primarily coastal communities and individuals involved in relevant economic
activities (including fishing and tourism). Port authorities, the maritime sector and passengers
benefited from the increased safety and efficiency of navigation under the project.

1.5       Original Components

14.   The project was approved by the Board on May 22, 2007, and consisted of four main
components:

15.    Component A: Development of a regional marine highway and institutions. The first
component was intended to support the establishment of a marine highway to improve safety of
navigation, through: (1) production of nautical charts and publications incorporating information
on environmental assets; (2) maintenance of these charts and publications; (3) survey and
2
 The regional agreement refers to the Indian Ocean Memorandum of Understanding on port state control (IOMOU),
which aims at controlling the plying of sub-standard ships in the region.

                                                     3
rehabilitation of the main aids to navigation on the route of the marine highway; (4)
establishment of an automatic information service; (5) support to search and rescue activities;
and finally (6) the evaluation of the demonstration phase and preparation of a second phase if the
demonstration phase proves to be feasible and sufficiently beneficial to justify costs.

16.     Component B: Capacity building for prevention of coastal and marine
contamination. The second component was intended to undertake preparatory work for oil spill
response planning, through: (1) support to seminars and workshops on environmental sensitivity
mapping, issues related to implementation of conventions, marine navigation safety, prevention
of marine and coastal pollution, risk assessment and development of appropriate response
strategies, and related matters; (2) creation of site-specific pollution prevention and contingency
management plans for coastal and marine hotspots; (3) development of a methodology to
identify and assign values to the key environmental resources in the region; and (4) development
of a regional database and a geographic information system on the marine environment, marine
and coastal resources, ship movements, ship waste, and sea-based activities.

17.     Component C: Building capacity for regional oil spill response. The third component
was intended to improve regional oil spill response capacity, in Kenya, Mozambique, South
Africa, and Tanzania, through: (1) translation of relevant IMO conventions (primarily
International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation (OPRC),
International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil
Pollution Damage (FUND), and International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution
Damage (CLC)) intended to protect the marine and coastal environments and to improve the
safety of navigation into national laws and regulations, and capacity building to implement the
provisions of the conventions; (2) the development of national oil and chemical spill contingency
plans; (3) an assessment of the needs and provision of specifications for the required equipment;
and (4) the facilitation of regional agreements, the development of a regional contingency plan,
and the establishment of a Regional Coordination Center (RCC) to coordinate national actions
and to monitor environmental conditions and causes of degradation and damage across the
region.

18.     Component D: Port state control, fisheries monitoring, and project coordination
and management. The fourth component was intended to further enhance the impact of the
project by: (1) supporting the adoption of port state control; (2) supporting the monitoring of
fisheries activities; (3) coordinating with other GEF-supported projects; and (4) supporting
project coordination and management.

19.     Institutional and implementation arrangements. The Recipient of the Grant was the
Republic of South Africa, on behalf of the participating countries. Given its dual (shipping /
environment) technical nature and the large number of countries involved, two agencies were
chosen to implement the project. A regional project management unit was established, headed by
a regional coordinator based at the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA), in Cape
Town, South Africa. This regional unit was responsible for implementing components A, D1 and
D4, and for overall coordination of the project. A sub-regional project management unit was also
established at the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), headed by a sub-regional coordinator. This
latter unit was responsible for implementing components B, C, D2 and D3. National project
coordinators from the Ministry of Transport or the Ministry of Environment of each participating

                                                4
country were appointed to coordinate implementation of the national-level activities. To
accommodate for early issues with the dual technical nature of the project, most countries later
appointed a second national coordinator from the other Ministry.

1.6       Revised Components

20.       The components of the project were not revised.

1.7       Other significant changes

21.     During the five-and-half-year implementation period, the project underwent three
restructurings. They are detailed in the following paragraphs.

22.     The first restructuring was approved on December 23, 2010: Given the delays after
effectiveness, reflecting the extensive coordination efforts required across the eight countries and
several international agencies, the Recipient requested an 18 month extension of the closing date
of the Grant from June 2011 to December 31, 2012 in a letter dated November 13, 2010. This
followed the recommendations of the mid-term review, and intended to facilitate full
implementation of all project components. The extension request was endorsed during the
Project Steering Committee meeting, involving representatives from all participating States (i.e.
Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania)
and which took place during the week of April 19-23, 2010.

23.     The second restructuring was approved on August 8, 2011: In a letter dated June 17,
2011, the Minister of Environment and Water of South Africa requested a reallocation of grant

24.     The proposed reallocation was necessary to reflect: (i) the longer project period
considering the extension of the closing date to December 31, 2012, already approved under the
previous restructuring; (ii) the actual costs of the various works, goods and consulting services;
and (iii) the larger than anticipated in-kind contributions from the various participating States
and organizations (resulting in for instance lower expenditures under Category 1).

25.     The third restructuring was approved on September 26, 2012: Based on the same
letter as the second restructuring, dated June 17, 2011,3 in which the Minister of Environment

disbursement categories in accordance with the recommendations of the mid-term review, a new
reallocation, as detailed in the following table, was agreed and implemented:

2         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

      (a) Soundness of the background analysis


3
  The formal notice of this second reallocation (third restructuring), in a letter dated September 14, 2012, refers to
the formal reallocation request dated June 17, 2011. However, this formal request corresponds to the first
reallocation (second restructuring), and does not request the reallocation of funds that has been granted in the second
reallocation (third restructuring): $475,000 from “Unallocated? category to “Goods IOC? category. A formal
reallocation request has been sent by IOC in a letter dated March 26, 2012, but the subsequent approved reallocation
also differs from it.

                                                          6
27.     The (FY07) GEF Funded Western Indian Ocean Marine Highway Development and
Coastal and Marine Contamination Prevention (P078643) was conceived to support the
outcomes of the earlier (FY99) West Indian Ocean Islands Oil Spill Contingency Planning
Project (P036037), which was also financed by the GEF and implemented between February
1999 and June 2004. The latter aimed to safeguard the marine and coastal ecosystems of the
western Indian Ocean islands (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles) from the risks
and consequences of oil spills. The FY07 operation was designed to extend the positive results
realized in the earlier operation, and build on the lessons learned, and extend oil spill
contingency planning to four additional coastal countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and
South Africa), to strengthen the regional cooperation, and improve the safety of shipping.

28.    The preparation phase of the FY07 project lasted just over 3.5 years from the Concept
Review Meeting on October 14, 2003 and Board Approval on May 22, 2007. The length of the
preparation phase reflected the considerable difficulties faced in coordinating and building
consensus among the countries and other stakeholders. The project preparation phase was funded
from a GEF Project Development Fund (PDF) Block B grant4 of US$700,000. During the
preparation phase, there was an appropriate mix of consensus building and collaboration with
other multilateral organizations, industry groups representing both the shipping and oil industry,
and additional analytical work. However, a review of implementation and outputs revealed a
number of limitations relating to the preparation stage of the project, which are discussed below.

    (b) Assessment of the project design

29.      Ambitious and complex project design. The project was very ambitious, involving
eight countries, two implementing agencies, with activities in several sectors. It also realized
significant benefits in a number of areas including, inter alia, enhancing safety of navigation, oil
spill response and cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean. Hydrographic surveys of the major
routes used by vessels in the Mozambique Channel as well as approaches to and sites of several
ports were conducted, charts were updated, the Aldabra (Seychelles) lighthouse was
rehabilitated, and automatic information systems (AIS) base-stations were installed. Finally, the
project fostered substantive regional cooperation, and was considered a success by all
stakeholders.

30.     Unfortunately, many of these benefits are not reflected in the formal results framework,
reflecting a disconnect between objectives and activities at design stage. For example, although
the project description refers to a pilot initiative, to test the technical, financial and institutional
feasibility of a marine highway in the region, the actual project endeavored to comprehensively
address maritime safety and marine pollution across a large region.

31.    The result was an overly complex design, with a gap between the components, the results
framework, and what could be actually achieved. As one example, the nautical charts produced
during the project were originally intended to include information on the environmental
conditions and biological resources of the region’s waters, including nurseries, major fish
migration routes, and environmentally-sensitive areas. Whilst this objective is laudable, inclusion

and the essential supporting documentation. PDF B grants are approved by the GEF Chief Executive Officer.

                                                        7
of this information in nautical charts would require significant additional surveying, over and
above that already included in the project, and no additional support was provided to achieve
this.

32.     There was a similar disconnect between the stated objective and the defined support for a
number of other components: The AIS were supposed to be used to transmit real time
information on hydrographical and oceanographic, environmental and weather conditions, and
the position and movements of ships in the area, but this would have required the provisions of
services and interconnection that were not included in the effective design and budget of the
project. Similarly, the sub-component on environmentally sensitive areas (ESA) mapping
required extensive geographic and environmental data that either did not exist at the time, or was
not easily available.

33.     Lack of consistency in project design. The defined goal and activities differ between
the project description, the description of the discrete components and sub-components, and the
results framework. This lack of consistency extended, in some cases, to the difference between
the project description, and the activities as actually implemented. For example, the project
description in the PAD placed fisheries and their monitoring at the center of the project; but there
was only one small subcomponent on fisheries, whilst in practice this was not implemented due
to redundancies with other projects in the region.5 Several subcomponents overlapped or were
redundant, while others had to be reinterpreted.

34.     Inadequate quality at entry. Some of the preparatory activities were deferred until
implementation stage. Whilst this in itself is not unusual for smaller components in a project, in
this case it applied to the design of some of the major components: The project activities related
to surveys, aids to navigation (AtoN) and AIS were all started during implementation by an
assessment of the situation and the identification of needs. The concomitant to this approach,
apart from considerable variation between budget estimates and actual expenditures, was that the
subsequent pragmatic decisions undermined the strategic perspective that underpinned the design
stage.

35.     With hindsight, the project would have been more effective if it had avoided these stand-
alone needs assessments of each technology, and designing a more comprehensive strategy to
improve safety of navigation in the area, prioritizing actions to be conducted with the limited
resources available. In addition, some specific needs were ill-assessed during preparation:
Communication links between search and rescue centers actually existed and were functioning
well, but support to establish these links was included in the project. Similarly, it was not
anticipated that some oil spill equipment provided under the previous project6 was actually
missing or dysfunctional due to lack of maintenance. Finally, the lack of availability of
geographic data for the ESA maps was not identified.

 (FY99) West Indian Ocean Islands Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project (P036037), financed by the GEF
between February 1999 and June 2004.

                                                      8
      (c) Adequacy of government’s commitment

36.    The involvement of the eight countries in the preparation phase of this regional
project was uneven. Some technical agencies and focal points complained that they were not
aware of the project until after its effectiveness, reflecting in part the long gestation and the
change in responsible personnel over that period, and that were not given any means to influence
its scope. The project was often endorsed at the government level, without in some cases
adequate consultation at a technical level. These points led to a deviation between the project and
needs in some cases, also undermining ownership and sustainability, and causing delay.

37.     Institutional responsibilities do not appear to have been fully considered in
designing the implementation arrangements. The delineation of responsibilities for project
activities between the maritime and environmental authorities in the participating countries does
not appear to have been given sufficient attention during the preparation of the project. Initially,
the defined implementation arrangements required the nomination of a unique focal point per
country, generally in the maritime sector, under the transport administration. Unfortunately, this
led to a downgrading of focus on the environmental activities in the project, and in some cases,
engendered tension between the respective line Ministries. This prompted the designation of an
additional focal point during implementation, most often in the Ministry of the Environment, to
advance the environmental activities and resolve communication issues.

      (d) Assessment of risks

38.     The assessment of risks and mitigation measures at appraisal was adequate. Most
risks were identified and appropriate mitigation measures were defined, but not always
implemented. The project did however fail to recognize the importance of political buy-in from
participating countries in ensuring smooth project beginning, and the consequences of the
complexity of the project on implementation and outputs.

2.2        Implementation

39.      Progress towards attaining the GEO and Implementation Progress were both rated
satisfactory (S) in the Bank’s Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISR) throughout the
life of the project. This was despite the initial delays and several other key factors that negatively
affected implementation and achievement of the Project outcomes.

40.     Initial delays. The scope and complexity of the project and the shortcomings of the
preparatory phase resulted in significant initial implementation delays. The project was approved
by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank on May 22, 2007, and was declared
effective on January 24, 2008, after a slight delay as the Grant Agreement need to be cleared by
the President’s office in South Africa, before it was signed by the Minister of Environmental
Affairs and Tourism on September 21, 2007. The respective project agreements with SAMSA
and the IOC were signed on the same date. However, project activities were delayed initially for
two main reasons: (i) delays in the appointment of the national coordinators7 meant that the
7
    The last national coordinator, from Kenya, was appointed in August 2009.

                                                          9
official launch of the project did not take place until February 8-12, 2009 when SAMSA and the
IOC organized the First Project Steering Committee meeting8; and (ii) delay in trust fund
activation which led to a delay in disbursement, although this was anticipated by the Bank team
and offset by the use of retroactive financing.

41.     Mid-term Review. Initially programmed to take place before June 2009, the mid-term
review had to be postponed to October 2010 in view of the initial delays. A report, prepared by a
consultant to inform the mid-term review, identified a number of design and implementation
problems and made suggestions to overcome them before the closing of the project. Three main
concerns were highlighted as requiring urgent attention: (i) getting buy-in from the appropriate
officials in some of the participating countries; (ii) ensuring that the sustainability question is
addressed; and (iii) that the completion of activities are properly concluded and handed over. The
mid-term review also suggested extending the project by at least another year and reallocating
some of the unspent funds for (a) the development of a regional sensitivity atlas, (b) the
information web site, (c) the training of additional maritime lawyers in the region, and (d) the
first year of operation of the RCC. Most of these suggestions were taken into account, which led
to three different restructurings (cf. below).

42.     Restructurings. During the five-and-half-year implementation period, and in light of this
mid-term review, the project underwent three restructurings, detailed in section 1.2. These
restructurings followed the recommendations of the mid-term review by extending the Grant
closing, and reallocating unutilized funds from the shipping components to the oil spill and
regional cooperation activities. In addition, a late third restructuring reallocated some funds to
the purchase of oil spill and Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC) equipment.

43.    However, the mid-term review did not fully address the design flaws and disconnect
between the project description and results framework on the one side and the effective
implementation of its activities on the other. This was in part a reflection of the difficulty in
undertaking a level I restructuring of such a complex project, with so many stakeholders required
to come to agreement on restructuring scope and details.

44.     Deviations from original design. The ambition and complexity of the design led to some
deviation in implementation and two components were not implemented (monitoring of fishing
activities and evaluation of the pilot phase) while others were adapted (search and rescue,
development of a regional database and geographic information system, among others). These
deviations are described in section 3.

45.     Interest and involvement of other stakeholders. The project generated considerable
interest which resulted in higher than expected in-kind contribution (surveying vessel and on-
board training) from the French hydrographic agency, Service Hydrographique et
Océanographique de la Marine (SHOM), which proposed to survey the route and conducted
some training for 60% of what was budgeted. It also caught the interest of the European Space
Agency, which offered spatial observation services for a period of six months in 2011 on real
time oil spill detection and polluter identification. These services yielded interesting results but
were not continued because of their cost and the loss of the satellite.

8
    Some activities started before the official launch of the project.

                                                              10
46.      Exogenous issues affecting implementation. The growth of piracy in the region had an
unfortunate impact on the shipping components of the project. The piracy threat is concentrated
along the coast of Somalia, but some attacks have been reported further south and further east.
As a consequence, many ships now choose to avoid the Mozambique Channel – on which the
project focuses – and substantially extend their route by passing south of Madagascar and
Mauritius, east of the Maldives and along the coast of India before heading back to the Gulf of
Aden, and vice versa. The pattern of risk to the region’s ecosystems has therefore changed,
increasing the exposure of the south coast of Madagascar, Mauritius, Rodrigues and the
Maldives. Besides, anti-piracy security guards board or alight vessels in Mauritius, making them
come closer to the island. Moreover, it was reported that most of the vessels that do ship in the
Mozambique Channel now commonly turn their AIS off to avoid revealing their position to
pirates.

47.     Slow disbursements. Disbursements have been slow and 31% of the Grant has not been
used at project closing (US$3.41 million out of US$11.0 million). This in part due to higher than
anticipated in-kind contributions from participating countries (South Africa on the AIS activity)
and partners (SHOM on the surveying), and to incomplete or redesigned activities. It is also a
consequence of large uncertainties around the appraisal estimates of many activities, reflecting
insufficient knowledge of the cost and scope of several activities at preparation. More details are
given in section 3.3 and Annex 1.9

2.3        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

48.     M&E Design. The monitoring and evaluation framework comprised 6 key performance
and 17 intermediate indicators. Although most indicators were straightforward, easy to measure
and a direct translation of the activity they were monitoring, some were not entirely reflective of
the activities that they were designed to measure.10 As a result, despite the considerable progress
made and the substantive benefits realized during implementation, a number of the objectives
were not met by the end of the project.

49.   M&E Implementation. Excepting the above, the monitoring and evaluation framework
was implemented adequately.

50.    M&E Utilization. The M&E framework has little usefulness beyond the project: all the
exploitable indicators were direct translations of an activity and their relevance ends with the
sub-component they were monitoring.

    To be confirmed once the final interim financial reports have been received from the Implementing Agencies.
10
     For instance:
       - The first PDO outcome indicator (“Number of passages of vessels traveling through the region using the
            marine highway and its electronic charts for navigation?) is difficult to measure, has not been measured
            and its target values were the same as the first GEO outcome indicator, relating to the implementation of
            the marine highway;
       - The target values second intermediate result indicator (“Charts and publications maintained and updated?)
            do not reflect its meaning its objective, as they account for the number of charts published and are the same
            as the first intermediate result indicator.

                                                            11
2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

51.    Safeguard. No safeguard policies were triggered during this project; the safeguard
screening category was S2 (no safeguard issues) and the environmental screening category was
C (no adverse environmental impact).

52.    Financial Management. The two implementing agencies maintained adequate financial
management (FM) arrangements. There were no major FM issues. The two implementing
agencies were adequately staffed for carrying out the FM functions at all times. FM was handled
by qualified and experienced finance officers and finance assistants in SAMSA and IOC. The
interim financial reports submitted to and reviewed by the Bank during implementation were
found satisfactory, in a format acceptable to the Bank, and with minor or no issues identified.
Acceptable annual audit reports were received; no major internal control weaknesses were
reported and they identified ineligible expenses related to minor value added tax payments which
were duly refunded.

53.     Procurement. There were no major procurement issues during the implementation
period of the project. The management of procurement activities was the responsibility of
SAMSA and IOC for their respective components. They were adequately staffed with two full
time procurement staff from SAMSA and IOC and were supplemented by external experienced
consultants (firm or individuals) on an as-needed basis. The procurement of works, goods and
consulting services was carried out in accordance with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines.
Procurement of all goods and works contracts was done using National Competitive Bidding,
International Competitive Bidding and Shopping.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

54.     Some activities of the project were not completed by project closure. The installation
of the AIS equipment at Ponta Zavora, Ilha de Moçambique and Maputo in Mozambique and the
rehabilitation of the lighthouse at Ponta Zavora were not completed by project closing because of
custom delays.11 Similarly, the national validation of several National Oil Spill Contingency
Plans (NOSCP) is still pending and Madagascar has not signed the Indian Ocean Memorandum
of Understanding (IOMOU) on port state control. Although it was not a requirement of the
project, the marine highway has not been recognized by the IMO. The Government of South
Africa is leading the process to have it endorsed at the next IMO session (June 2013) (cf. section
3.1 below). Of greater importance, the RCC is not operational at project closing due to internal
policy processes in South Africa. Being designed as the cornerstone of post-completion
operations, this is of significant concern. However, South Africa is aware of the situation and has
assured to operationalize the Center by mid-2013. The other participating countries pledged to
sign the agreement subsequently.

55.     The question of a follow-on operation has been raised by most of, if not all, the
participating states and agencies. There is recognition of the benefits of the numerous initiatives
introduced by the project, and a perception that whilst awareness on important issues was raised,
and a considerable start was made, there is need for further support to realize the full potential
11
  Mozambican authorities advised in April 2013 that they have completed the lighthouse and that funding for the
installation of the AIS base stations is currently being secured by the IMO.

                                                       12
benefits. Areas considered to need further attention are continuing to improve safety of
navigation, building further capacity to combat oil spills, which despite the project remains
inconsistent across the region, and effective regional cooperation.

3        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

      (a) Relevance of Objectives

56.    The overall outcome objective of the project to protect regional marine and coastal
ecosystems remains very relevant at project closing: the most recent CASs and interim strategy
motes of the participating countries12 all insist on the importance of protecting coastal and
marine ecosystems and ensuring their sustainable management for poverty alleviation. More
broadly, the importance of the Western Indian Ocean ecosystems as global public goods has long
been recognized and their protection is still on the agenda of the international community.
Marine and coastal biodiversity as a whole is given increased attention, be it through the United
Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and its Aichi biodiversity targets for 2020, or the
numerous initiatives that have emerged in the recent years to promote a global protection of the
oceans. The Western Indian Ocean islands and seas are themselves recognized as one of the main
biodiversity hotspots on the planet.

57.     As described in the PAD, increasing the safety of navigation and the capacity of the
riparian countries to respond to noxious spills is essentially a means to contribute to the
protection of these ecosystems. In a context of growing and changing maritime traffic, as well as
future offshore oil and gas production, the need to develop substantive capacity in preventing
and managing spills therefore remains a necessity to coastal and marine biodiversity protection.
Finally, the regional integration approach promoted by the project remains a key objective of the
participating countries’ CASs or interim strategy notes.

      (b) Relevance of Design

58.     As detailed in section 2.1, the design of the project, from the perspective of the PDOs
GEOs and components, lacked clarity and consistency. It was also very complex and ambitious,
involving eight diverse countries in comprehensively addressing major issues in two different
sectors.

59.    On the substance, the oil spill response activities (components B and C) benefited from
the lessons learned from the previous project13 and their design was suitable. Furthermore,
marine pollution is a complex threat to address that requires regional coordination and the project
adequately integrated four relevant coastal countries to the regional initiative. It also adequately
included the widening of the IOMOU on port state control to Madagascar and Comoros.


12
   Comoros (2010), Kenya (2010), Madagascar (2012), Mauritius (2006), Mozambique (2012), Tanzania (2011),
Seychelles (2012) and South Africa (2007)
13
   (FY99) West Indian Ocean Islands Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project (P036037), financed by the GEF
between February 1999 and June 2004.

                                                     13
60.     However, based on current knowledge, the relevance of the marine highway concept to
increase the safety and efficiency of navigation in the Mozambique Channel is questionable.
Indeed, marine highways, formally named Traffic Separation Schemes, are selected routes
supported by modern navigation aids and close monitoring, organizing intense traffic through
difficult passages in two distinct lanes to avoid collisions. Such schemes are for instance found in
the English Channel, Singapore and Cape Horn. The Mozambique Channel is not appropriate for
such as scheme for two reasons: it is wide (400 km wide at the narrowest point), and the density
of the traffic is relatively low.

61.     The limited relevance of such a design was gradually recognized during preparation and
the project’s activities under the navigation safety component were changed to focus on
enhancing the safety of navigation in specific areas of the Mozambique Channel, which was both
necessary and worthwhile. Unfortunately, the project kept its “marine highway? title and
description, engendering a number of misunderstandings amongst stakeholders, including the
participating countries themselves.

62.      Furthermore, the rationale for including a component on monitoring of fishing activities
in this project is debatable, and has been questioned during implementation.14

      (c) Relevance of Implementation

63.    Implementation arrangements were appropriately chosen to facilitate implementation of
the components. The dual-implementing-agencies configuration was a risk but proved worth
taking and yielded very positive results. To some extent, the implementation stage has allowed
compensating for the shortcomings of the design and preparation phase.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environmental Objectives

64.     The project achieved significant success in enhancing safety of navigation, oil spill
response and cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean. Hydrographic surveys of the major
routes used by vessels in the Mozambique Channel as well as approaches to and sites of several
ports were conducted, charts were updated, the Aldabra (Seychelles) lighthouse was
rehabilitated, AIS base-stations were installed. This has undoubtedly enhanced the safety of
navigation in these specific areas and to some extent in the region. The project provided very
valuable support to all participating countries in implementing the provisions of international
conventions, including and most importantly national oil spill contingency plans, reinforced by
substantial training and equipment. Furthermore, the project has contributed to raise technical
awareness of the importance of the coastal resources of the participating countries by providing
or updating ESA maps and capacity building on ecosystems valuation. Finally, the project
greatly fostered regional cooperation on the subject. All participating countries and stakeholders
emphasized its successes.

65.   The project was not successful in achieving the PDOs and GEOs. The project had 6
GEO and PDO outcome indicators: 1 indicator has been achieved, 4 have not and 1 has not been
monitored. The project had 17 intermediate indicators: 7 (41 percent) have been achieved, while

14
  In particular, a letter from the UNDP dated April 5, 2005 remarks that the project does not note the existence of
the Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (SWIOFP), funded by the GEF and implemented by the World Bank.

                                                        14
10 have not. This is a reflection of the design of these objectives themselves and the scope of the
project rather than the realized achievements, which are considerable. If the PDO or GEO had
been more specific to the actual interventions, and the outcome and intermediate indicators more
realistic, project outputs would have been more in line with the expected outcomes.

66.     Since the PDOs and GEOs as stated in the PAD lack clarity, consistency, sometimes
overlap and do not faithfully reflect the substantive progress that has been achieved within the
project, the choice has been made in this Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR)
to use intended objectives, inferred from the design and the effective implementation:

        Objective 1: Establish a demonstration marine highway to guide ships around
         environmentally sensitive areas and through selected busy sea lanes.
        Objective 2: Strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical spill
         emergencies in the region.
        Objective 3: Organize regional cooperation on oil spill response and safety of navigation.
        Stand-alone activities: Economic valuation of ecosystems; Coordination with other
         (GEF-funded) projects; Supporting monitoring of fishing activities.

Annex 4 reconciles the objectives used in this report with the PDOs and GEOs listed in the PAD
and the Legal Documents and lists the outputs per component with more precision. What follows
is a brief description of the contribution of outputs to achieving the objectives of the project.

         Objective 1: Establish a demonstration marine highway to guide ships around
         environmentally sensitive areas and through selected busy sea lanes.

67.     The establishment of the marine highway involved several distinct components, the
ultimate goal of which was to enhance the safety of navigation in the region. Hydrographic
surveys were conducted along the busiest route in the Mozambique Channel and in 5 ports and
their approaches.15 The corresponding electronic nautical charts have been published and are
automatically distributed to the industry. The Aldabra lighthouse in Seychelles has been
rehabilitated; the rehabilitation of a second lighthouse at Ponta Zavora (Mozambique) could not
be completed before the end of the project. Four AIS base stations were installed to monitor
close-range traffic in specific sites.16 Finally, the MRCC in Mauritius was upgraded through the
installation of Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) equipment.
Comprehensive training was provided under each of these activities. These activities have made
a considerable contribution to starting to improve navigation in the region, thus contributing to
the lowering of the risk of oil spills from collisions and groundings.

68.   Although it was not included in the initial project design, the participating countries and
implementing agencies aimed at having the surveyed and charted route officially endorsed by the
IMO as a recommended route, to ensure safe passage of vessels in the Mozambique Channel.

15
  Mahajanga and Toamasina (Madagascar), Anjouan (Comoros), Maputo (Mozambique), Zanzibar (Tanzania).
16
   AIS base stations have been installed in Moroni (Comoros), Mombasa (Kenya), Zanzibar (Tanzania) and
Mahajanga (Madagascar), with a link to Antananarivo (Madagascar); two have also been installed on Coast Guards
vessels in Seychelles. The typical range of AIS station is approximately 100 km. However, the planned installation
of two base stations and one monitoring station in Mozambique could not be completed due to important delays in
clearing the equipment at customs.

                                                       15
However, the IMO decided in June 2012 not to officially recognize it. This was the result of a
mix of political and technical reasons, including the fact that it might not be necessary to
concentrate the traffic along two narrow lanes in such a wide channel, without the means to
monitor it and in a context of piracy. As long as the route is not recognized by the IMO, it
remains voluntary for users. The Republic of South Africa is seeking official recognition in June
2013.

69.     Main challenges. The implementation of the marine highway activities suffered from
insufficient knowledge of conditions on the sites chosen to install AIS base stations and AtoN.
This resulted in unexpected delays and additional costs to the project. In Madagascar, the
location identified to receive the equipment was not suitable, and a link to Antananarivo had to
be installed. Mozambique had problems in clearing goods through its customs causing severe
delays in implementation and jeopardizing the rehabilitation of the lighthouse and installation of
AIS base stations in Ponta Zavora and Ilha de Moçambique, and monitoring station in Maputo,
which were not completed at the end of the project. The sustainability of some of the training
remains questionable, as trainees frequently did not remain in the same posts, or left the public
administration. Finally, the search and rescue activity had to be reconfigured at the start of
implementation as the communication links between the MRCCs of the region and existing
regional cooperation on search and rescue were of very good quality.

        Objective 2: Strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical spill
        emergencies in the region.

70.     The set of activities under this objective was based on the previous GEF funded project,17
which supported Madagascar, Comoros, Seychelles and Mauritius in drafting first NOSCPs.
Under this new project, these four countries were therefore more advanced than the others, for
which the subject was new (with the exception of South Africa). The activity benefited from the
earlier experience of the Indian Ocean Commission, which was the implementing agency of the
previous project, and substantial work has been done to create new or upgrade existing
NOSCPs,18 and design site-specific oil spill contingency plans around ports. Tabletop and full-
scale exercises were also conducted in each of the participating countries.19 The recognition
during the course of the project that some countries did not have the necessary equipment to
combat oil spills, led to a reallocation of funds to finance equipment purchase for Tanzania,
Mozambique, Comoros and Mauritius. The indicator for this activity was the validation of the
NOSCPs but at project close, whilst all NOSCPs have been completed20 and training organized,
four out of eight official validations remain pending.

71.     ESA maps have been produced to support the NOSCPs. These maps detail coastal
ecosystems and sensitivities and have been integrated in the NOSCPs to serve as tactical maps in
case of an oil spill. ESA maps can also serve other purposes in other contexts; for example, some

17
   (FY99) West Indian Ocean Islands Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project (P036037), financed by the GEF
between February 1999 and June 2004.
18
   It should be noted that NOSCPs are an obligation under the OPRC Convention, to which all the countries of the
project are party.
19
   Activities in Comoros were implemented through an agreement the country has with France (La Réunion). South
Africa was not a beneficiary of the exercises.
20
   With the singular exception of the Tanzanian NOSCP.

                                                       16
countries employed them as a planning tool in other environmental projects. The development of
these maps was constrained by the lack of available data in some countries. As a result, precise
‘operational’ maps that describe the necessary logistics in an oil spill situation remain under
development at project closing.

72.     Additional activities were also conducted as part of these activities, on the initiative of
the implementing agency: the countries drafted dispersant policies, which will eventually be
integrated to the NOSCPs; they have also engaged in the area of hazardous and noxious
substances (HNS), with a view to drafting specific policies in line with the HNS protocol to the
OPRC convention.

73.     Main challenges. Despite the concrete achievements in creating and/or updating the
NOSCPs, these plans are not static and sustaining their usefulness requires the appropriate
resources to be maintained in a state of readiness, which involves regular training, including
simulations of risk events with all stakeholders and ideally once per year, and adequate
resources. Currently, there is concern that the current response capacity will be sustained in all
the participating countries, particularly where ownership and commitment was found to be
lagging during implementation. Some countries took the opportunity to update parts of their
maritime law or to launch a national effort on disaster preparedness, but others struggled to
affirm the capacity of the national competent authority to take the necessary lead in the response.
The development of ESA maps is constrained by the fact that several stakeholders are waiting
for compensation for spending time on the activity or sharing the geographic data.

         Objective 3: Organize regional cooperation on oil spill response and safety of
         navigation.

74.     One of the major goals of the project was to establish cooperation between the eight
participating countries on oil spill response. This cooperation had three pillars: The first pillar
was a regional agreement that ensures cooperation among the countries in case of major oil spills
for which the affected country does not have the capacity to respond on its own. It has been
signed by all eight participating countries; although included in the cooperation effort, La
Réunion (France) had not signed it as of project close.21 A regional oil spill contingency plan
(ROSCP) has also been developed, as a second pillar, in order to define roles and responsibilities
in case of a trans-boundary spill. The ROSCP has been signed by all eight participating countries
and is now operational. It has however not been tested in a simulation exercise.

75.     The third pillar is the RCC, which was designed to be the keystone of this objective and
of the project as a whole, but remained to be established at project closing. The intention is for
the RCC to serve as a regional platform to “coordinate regional actions, to monitor region-wide
environmental conditions and causes of degradation and damage, and to eventually operate the
marine highway? (PAD, p. 42). The functional establishment of the RCC, designed as one of the
key outputs of the project to ensure sustainability of its outcomes, is critical. Ideally, the RCC
would have been operational one year before the end of the project to allow for necessary
adjustments, and a work program and budget were defined for its first year of operation
21
  France participated in the project as a partner, through La Réunion island. It was involved in several components,
as a major stakeholder in the Western Indian Ocean. It would be expected to play a significant role in a regional oil
spill prevention scheme.

                                                         17
(originally planned to be2012). However, SAMSA has been selected to host the RCC but
obtaining the necessary domestic approvals has meant that the signing of the Host Country
Agreement had not taken place by project close. This is expected in 2013.

76.     Two other measures to enhance regional cooperation, although not directly on oil spill
response or safety of navigation, were conducted: The project supported countries in ratifying
relevant IMO conventions and worked with Comoros and Madagascar to sign the Indian Ocean
Memorandum of Understanding on port state control. Although Comoros is now a party to the
IOMOU, Madagascar had not signed it by project close, mainly because of the current political
situation in the country. The PAD also mentioned ensuring domestication of ratified IMO
conventions, but beyond the oil spill contingency plans and the training of a few maritime
lawyers, the activities conducted under this aspect have been minimal.

77.     Main challenges. At the end of the project, most stakeholders were explicit in the need to
organize a regional response capacity to combat major oil spills; at the same time they expressed
concern that the agreements are, for the moment, mainly theoretical and should be put into
practice. Unfortunately, there has been no opportunity to test the ROSCP and the evidence from
the only event that occurred during the project major enough to require regional cooperation was
inconclusive.22 Furthermore, the issue of compatibility between oil spill equipment of the
countries of the region was not addressed in the project; with existing incompatibilities forming a
technical barrier to cooperation during major spills.

78.    The participating countries have not been consistently responsive during the
implementation of the regional cooperation which led to delay. In this context, and based on the
experience of a similar regional center in the Mediterranean,23 SAMSA decided not to ask for
financial contributions from the other countries to operate the RCC. This decision is both
pragmatic, but also reflects the commitment of South Africa and SAMSA in particular towards
the RCC.

79.    It should be noted that this is the second attempt to establish a regional center on oil spill:
the previous GEF project established such a center in Madagascar, which is no longer
functioning24. Whether the lessons from the previous experience were reflected in the design of
the new is unclear, but the commitment of South Africa and SAMSA will undoubtedly ensure
sustainability in some form.

         Stand-alone activity: Economic valuation of ecosystems.

80.    Alongside the three previous objectives described above, the project developed an
ecosystems valuation activity, which organized two regional workshops and established national


22
   In August 2011, a Panamian cargo ship “Angel 1? grounded on a coral reef off Pointe d’Esny, to the South East of
Mauritius. To prevent a large oil-spill, the country decided to deploy the contingency plan. However, it did not have
the capacity to respond and address unilaterally, and could not call on the other countries of the region to provide the
required assistance. It was instead assisted by India and Sri Lanka.
23
   The Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea (REMPEC) assists the
Mediterranean coastal States in ratifying, transposing, implementing and enforcing international maritime
conventions related to the prevention of, preparedness for and response to marine pollution from ships.
24
   The Government of Madagascar have expressed their interest in reviving the previous center by hosting the RCC.

                                                          18
working groups that developed case studies in 5 of the 8 participating countries.25 The end
product is a report that describes different methodologies available to conduct economic
valuation of ecosystems.

81.     The activity contributed to raising awareness on the value of coastal ecosystems in the
region, but did not achieve the goal described in the PAD of developing an economic valuation
methodology to “enable governments to carry out baseline studies and to identify the key
environmental resources of the region and assign indicative values to the resources?. It seems
clear that the objectives set for this activity were too ambitious, compared with the resources
available and the lack of experience in the region on this technical subject. The few case studies
and the final report produced are not comprehensive enough to be used to influence political and
investment decisions, or to support potential compensation claims after an oil spill. Instead, the
project could not do much more than raise awareness and organize the necessary working groups
at the national level. Stakeholders expressed concerns that neither the working groups nor the
awareness will be sustained after project closing.

82.     Main challenges. Mozambique, South Africa and Seychelles did not participate in the
activity; one of the reasons advanced is the lack of dedicated financial resources. Furthermore,
although the task was very ambitious, national working groups had insufficient support from the
project consultants on this activity and had to rely almost exclusively on scarce national expertise
to conduct the exercise.

         Stand-alone activity: Coordination with other (GEF-funded) projects.

83.     Since the beginning the project internalized the importance of coordinating with similar
projects in the region. Its component D3 focuses explicitly on collaboration with GEF-funded
projects, including the Agulhas and Somali Current Large Marine Ecosystems Project
(ASCLME) and Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (SWIOFP). Coordination with these
projects, implemented respectively by the United Nations Development Programme and the
World Bank, has proven difficult on the ground and stakeholders expressed some frustration
regarding the lack of response. However, the exchange of information improved towards the end
of the project, mainly in the form of cross-participation in steering committees and contribution
to the GEF International Waters website.26 A comprehensive website27 has also been created for
the project, and its maintenance should be handed over to the RCC once operational.

84.     Beside GEF interventions, this regional project was implemented in a context of multiple
related donor-funded projects, including by the European Union and the World Bank.
Constructive coordination with these projects has been considerably enhanced by two main
factors: First, because IOC serves as a regional focal point for environmental projects of other
donors, it has been able to orchestrate their implementation in a constructive manner. Second,
this scheme has been reproduced at the national level, with some focal points serving as hubs for
different, and sometimes all, environmental projects in one country. The National Environmental
Management Council in Tanzania, for instance, was able to incorporate the activities within a
25
   Mozambique, South Africa and Seychelles did not participate in this activity.

broader framework of donor-funded environmental activities, avoiding duplication of tasks and
breaking the isolation that these projects sometimes suffer from.

     Stand-alone and non-implemented activity: Supporting monitoring of fishing activities.

85.     The description of the project in the PAD included support to the monitoring of fishing
activities, as overfishing is another major threat to the environmental and economic health of the
region. Component D2 specifically targeted the “development of an action plan for fisheries
monitoring?, as well as the “implementation of its main recommendations, assuming finance is
available and no other organization or project are able to finance these?. However, during
implementation it was realized that similar activities were adequately conducted by other
projects in the region.28 It was therefore decided to not implement this sub-component.

3.3      Efficiency

86.     Consistent with the requirements for GEF-supported projects, the PAD included an
incremental cost analysis, rather than the estimation of a net present value or economic rate of
return in a cost-benefit analysis. The incremental cost principle of the GEF is usually understood
as the additional costs associated with transforming a project with national/local benefits into one
with global environmental benefits as well. It argues that without the GEF alternative (i.e. the
project), the participating countries would most likely not have undertaken the activities related
to the development of the marine highway, the widening of the regional IOMOU on port state
control and strengthening capacity to implement it, and regional oil spill cooperation.

87.     The incremental cost of the GEF alternative was estimated at US$24.4 million, and the
baseline cost at US$1.6 million; the GEF provided a grant of US$11 million out of which only
US$7.59 million were disbursed. The difference reflecting higher contributions from partners
and incomplete or redesigned activities (cf. Annex 1). It is clear in retrospect that most of the
activities funded by the GEF under this project would not have been implemented without it – at
least not in the short to medium term –, they are also much needed and yield considerable global
environmental benefits. Regional cooperation would not have been progressed without the
project.

88.     The outputs of the project also significantly benefited the shipping and oil and gas
industries. This has been confirmed by the interest they showed during the preparation and
implementation phases, and has been used by Madagascar to finance its oil spill center through a
levy on oil imports in the country. These industries are therefore a potential source for financing
the marine highway and the oil spill preparedness in the region, and might be more efficiently
integrated in the future.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

89.     The Overall Outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory for the following reasons.
As noted above the relevance of the design is questionable and there were severe shortcomings at
preparation, over-ambitious objectives, and underprepared activities with concerns about
sustainability prevalent in some cases. In addition, the outcomes of the project are below the
level set in the PAD: the project completed only 1 of 6 GEOs and PDOs.

90.     Nonetheless, the project objectives are still highly relevant to the national and global
priorities and, set aside the results framework as defined in the PAD, the project has contributed
considerably to important and much needed progress in the region on maritime safety and oil
spill prevention: The survey of the route made navigation in the Mozambique Channel safer, the
navigational risks in approaching key ports and sites are reduced thanks to the more detailed site-
specific surveys and the AIS base stations, the Aldabra World Heritage Site’s integrity will be
enhanced by the new lighthouse, the capacity of countries to respond to oil and chemical spills is
undoubtedly improved and regional cooperation on all these issues has been initiated and should
be reinforced soon. Overall, the shortcomings at preparation stage and in the design of the
project and its results framework wounded the project at birth, and justify the proposed rating.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

91.    The poverty impact of the project is indirect and long-term, but nonetheless significant;
by reducing the risks of oil spill and severe pollution of ecosystems people rely on, it prevents
important losses of revenues and livelihoods for some of the poorest communities in the region.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

92.    One of the key outcomes of the project is the institutional strengthening on oil spill
response, which also triggered some broader consideration of similar disaster risk management.
For instance, the consolidation of the oil spill contingency plan in Mauritius and recent events
led the country to consider creating a national disaster center that would be in charge of
responding to a broader range of disasters. Some countries also took the opportunity of the
project to revise large portions of their maritime law. Many stakeholders also stressed the
contribution of the project in bridging the cooperation gap between coastal and island countries
on such issues, as well as breaking the language barrier.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

93.    As described in section 2.2, the project was selected as a pilot by a European Space
Agency / World Bank partnership, which purpose was to mainstream the use of satellite data in
the Bank’s lending operations. The European Space Agency offered satellite imagery that was
used to detect oil spills in real time and identify polluters, which was a very positive
development offering a step change in detecting and responding to oil spills. The pilot project
yielded some very interesting results, but unfortunately was not continued due to a lack of
funding and the loss of the satellite.

4         Assessment of Risk to Global Environment Outcome

94.       The Risk to Development Outcomes rating is High for the following reasons.

95.      Piracy in the region poses several risks to the development outcomes of the project, as
described earlier. It has redirected traffic from the Mozambique Channel to a more eastern route,
reducing the utilization of the highway in the Channel and increasing risks elsewhere. It has also
decreased safety in the Channel as many ships frequently turn off their AIS communication when
traveling in pirate zones, increasing the risks of collision. In that context, a densification of
traffic along a recommended route might yield the opposite result than the one that was intended,
i.e. increasing safety.

96.    The sustainability of the previous project29 was rated as likely, and its ICR listed as a
lesson learned that “obtaining government commitment during project preparation to specific
arrangements for institutional and financial sustainability, and continuing to focus on the issue
during implementation helps to ensure that project investments will be sustained after the project
closes?.30 This lesson was included in the design of the project, and the participating
governments were required to commit by mid-term review to establishing mechanisms to sustain
the outputs of the project.

97.    The mid-term review report (October 31, 2010) however stressed that it had no
information on the establishment of such mechanisms and operational manuals for the handover
of the various activities were missing. It insisted on the need for immediate action to have
Governments commit to providing mechanisms for sustainability, and warned that the GEF
funding activities that should have been financed by the counterpart would undermine
sustainability further.

98.     At the end of the project, sustainability remains a significant concern. Madagascar,
Mauritius and South Africa have established concrete mechanisms to integrate the project’s
activities in their operations and ensure sustainability of their oil spill prevention efforts.
Mozambique has indicated it has signed an agreement with a private company to provide
assistance in case of oil spills. On other activities or for other countries, the commitment to such
mechanisms (including budgeting) is lacking, or the information was not transmitted.
Sustainability remains problematic at many levels of the project’s outputs and the main areas of
concern are the following:

         Different types of equipment have been provided through the project: AIS antennas and
          monitoring devices, oil spill and GMDSS equipment. Several stakeholders explained that
          they lacked the capacity to maintain, and sometimes operate, store and handle the
          equipment. Past experiences also reveal that ‘free’ and donor-funded equipment are not
          always given appropriate consideration, reducing their lifetime. Most of the equipment
          provided under the West Indian Ocean Islands Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project
          was unusable or untraceable a few years after project closing, and the lesson seems not to
          have been learned.

      The maintenance of lighthouses might also prove problematic, as no mechanisms are in
       place to ensure sustainability. Past experiences also show that AtoN suffer from a lack of
       maintenance in the region.
      To be efficient, an oil spill response strategy requires regular and comprehensive oil spill
       exercises, including at the regional level in the case of the ROSCP. Once again, the
       mechanisms to ensure such regular exercises are not in place in several countries, which
       undermines the outcomes of the oil spill response activity of the project.
      Similarly, the future regular updates of nautical charts and ESA maps, although stated in
       the PAD, are not guaranteed.
      The economic valuation of ecosystems will most likely not be pursued, as the activity did
       not reach a level of maturity that could allow for regular usage of such technique. The
       project served more as an eye-opener and all the stakeholders pushed for a follow-on
       activity to pursue the effort.
      The RCC should have been the cornerstone of the sustainability arrangements planned in
       the project, keeping its momentum by organizing national and regional activities to
       update components of the project and ensure collection and dissemination of information.
       South Africa is committed to operationalize the RCC by the end of the year, too avoid
       decreased momentum and jeopardized efficiency due to the delay.
      Training is a primary component of the project, and has been developed in part to ensure
       sustainability of the rest of the project. Lessons have also been learned from the previous
       West Indian Ocean Islands Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project, after which many
       trained staff left their position. In this current project, trainees have been asked to commit
       to remain in their position for a certain number of years to avoid such situation. However,
       other sustainability issues arise from training: Some students were indeed trained on
       equipment they did not have or for tasks they were not in the position to undertake, and
       many stakeholders expressed the need to have more and regular training on these issues
       in the future. They would also have liked having more national and regional experts
       trained and involved in the project, which could have enhanced longevity of some
       activities.

99.    The project therefore suffers from a significant lack of sustainability of its outcomes,
which can be traced to several causes. A first cause stems from preparation and implementation
per se: Although adequate arrangements were planned in the PAD, taking into account the
lessons from the previous West Indian Ocean Islands Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project, it
is unclear whether these arrangements were given enough weight in the discussions with the
governments. Initial delays also led to postponing most of the activities of the project, and the
implementation of these arrangements has been pushed off the table in the process.
Implementation incentives from the donor side and along the project chain focus more on
disbursement and less on sustainability, which might further reduce its weight.

100. A second cause is the deficit of ownership that the project activities suffered from. Many
governments of the participating countries considered the type of activities as essentially driven
by the donor community. This feeling has been reinforced by the lack of involvement of most
technical agencies in the design and the preparation of the project, which many initially saw as
an external, top-down burden. Furthermore, in resource-limited contexts, the lack of
consideration given to political engagement resulted in the project being given low priority. As a

                                                23
consequence, some national coordinators were appointed late and counterpart funding to the
national implementation unit has been either slow or inexistent in some countries; this led to
inefficiencies and lack of motivation. The sustainability of the project outcomes has been
hampered by this low ownership of its activities.

5      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

101. The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory for
the following reasons.

102. The project addressed critical threats to the exceptional marine and coastal ecosystems of
the region, and made an effort to cover many aspects of navigation safety and pollution
prevention that were lacking attention. It also adopted a necessary but innovative regional
approach. Its long preparation phase involved many stakeholders from the international
community, the private sector and national governments. The choice of two implementing
agencies was ambitious and yielded many positive results, although it sometimes reinforced an
impression of two distinct projects.

103. However, as previously mentioned, the design and preparation phase suffered from major
shortcomings that hindered the implementation of the project and the delivery of outputs. The
design of the project lacked clarity, in particular in the concept of the marine highway, and in the
organization of and distinction between activities. This lack of clarity is also found in the
numerous PDOs and GEOs, which choice does not reflect the actual implementation of the
activities, placing emphasis on minor (e.g. port state control) or unimplemented components (e.g.
evaluation of the pilot phase, monitoring of fisheries), misrepresenting activities (e.g. the oil spill
contingency plans are only mentioned for four of the eight countries that took part in this
activity), and understating main parts of the project (e.g. regional coordination). There are
notable inconsistencies between PDOs and GEOs stated in different sections of the PAD, the
Results Framework and the Legal Agreements.

104. The project was also too ambitious in comparison with its means and what it eventually
implemented: The project scope was too broad, with activities sometimes not related to the rest
of the project, and most of the activities were too complex and wide-ranging to be covered
simultaneously in a project of such a size. For instance, the project description in the PAD
largely covers the monitoring of fishing activities, to which it devotes a sub-component.
However, nothing happened under the project on that aspect, in part because it was an entire
other subject which several other projects addressed in the region. In parallel, and partly
consequently, it lacked the holistic approach that was necessary to optimize the efficiency of its
engagement. In the end, the project was complex, involving many countries and several
counterparts in each country, as well as many activities that were conducted simultaneously.
Therefore, and despite adequate time given to the preparation of this project, the right balance
between ambition and innovation on one side, and pragmatism and efficiency on the other, was
not found.


                                                  24
105. Furthermore, it appears that the Bank’s effort in ensuring early political buy-in and
involving national technical agencies in the design of the project was uneven among
participating countries. As stated earlier, some countries barely signed the initial Memorandum
of Understanding and did not circulate the information nor promoted the project internally.
Besides, technical agencies which were going to implement the project have not always been
given adequate voice in the preparation phase. Both these aspects resulted in low ownership.

(b) Quality of Supervision

106. The Bank performance in ensuring quality of supervision is rated Moderately
Satisfactory for the following reasons:

107. Despite major early delays that stemmed from the preparation phase, most project
activities achieved important results in the short timeframe that was available. The regional
aspect and the complexity of the project, with eight participating countries implementing many
different activities, was a challenge for the supervision, which however managed to maintain
regular oversight on these activities through the closer monitoring from the regional and sub-
regional implementing units.

108. The Bank could have been more proactive however to reduce early implementation
delays, by setting-up kick off missions with the implementing agencies in the countries that
lagged behind, or by moving the role of formal task management to the field earlier. This could
have hastened the process of ensuring buy-in, both at the government level and technical
agencies, as well as promoting communication on the project between the different entities
involved. It could also have employed its convening power to facilitate the operationalization of
the RCC in South Africa.

109. The opportunity of the mid-term review to restructure the project was not fully realized
by the Bank. Indeed, the team could have recognized the lack of relevance of the PDOs/GEOs
and adjust components and indicators to align them with the realities of implementation. Instead,
the restructurings were minimal and could not avoid the final gap between the project’s outputs
and its formal objectives. As explained in section 2.2, the potential complexity of a level I
restructuring in the multi-country, multi-implementing agency setting of the project might
account for this missed opportunity. Besides, the Bank did not fully take into consideration the
recommendations of the mid-term review, particularly on redirecting attention towards
sustainability efforts.

110. Project implementation progress was adequately reported, although some of the project
reports lacked clarity and continuity in the description of the activities. Some shortcomings were
difficult to trace to resolution.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

111. Bank overall performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory consistent with the
evaluation of each section above.

5.2        Borrower Performance
(a) Borrower and other Participating Governments Performance:

112. The Borrower was the Republic of South Africa, who coordinated the commitment and
implementation responsibilities amongst all participating countries and implementing agencies.
The Borrower and Participating Governments performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory
for the following reasons.

113. The Participating Governments performance varied widely between countries. On the
subjects of ownership, commitment to achieving development objectives, financial contribution,
appointment of key staff (including national coordinators), timely resolution of implementation
issues etc., countries have performed very differently.31 While some countries struggled with
difficult political contexts and relied more on exterior support, others were able to integrate the
activities of the project in their national initiatives. One of the strength of this regional project is
to have been able to cluster such a diverse array of countries and use this to support development
in the least performing.

114. As stated earlier, all the participating countries faced the difficulty of communication
between the transport and the environment ministries and agencies. This has slowed the
implementation of the project, reduced its efficiency and required to appoint a second national
coordinator on the environment side of the project, increasing the impression of two distinct
projects. This seems to be a recurring difficulty with environment projects however, which most
of the time deal with the competency of another sector without having the institutional means or
power to influence decisions in the sector, nor the necessary consideration from the ministry in
charge.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance:

115. The Implementing Agencies performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory for the
following reasons.

116. Two implementing agencies, SAMSA and IOC (respectively regional coordinating unit
and sub-regional coordinating unit) were chosen for this project, taking into account their in-
house expertise and the two-sided nature of the project. The two implementing agencies did not
have the same experience or capacity. IOC had been managing several regional projects for
many years, successfully implemented two World Bank projects before this one and was well
versed into the political aspects of such projects. SAMSA was a more technical agency, had less
experience with regional integration and had not worked with the World Bank before.

117.    Both agencies made substantial contributions to the performance of what was a complex
and difficult initiative, in part compensated for and endeavoring to address the issues arising
from the preparation stage, as far as feasible. SAMSA adapted to the numerous changes that
were required in the implementation of the shipping activities and managed to hasten
implementation to complete most of the activities. Both SAMSA and the IOC displayed good
ownership of the project and together greatly assisted implementation.

31
     More details are available in IOC’s final report.

                                                         26
118. They took up a leadership role in establishing the policy dialogue in some countries to
effectively start the project, monitored the implementation of the activities very closely in many
countries and have been proactive in realizing the benefits, such as adding activities to the oil
spill component (on HNS and dispersant policies) and combining finances available from other
projects. IOC, being a focal point for many regional projects in the field of environment, also
fostered coordination between projects, avoiding redundancies, creating synergies and
disseminating information.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

119. The Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory consistent with
the evaluation of each section above.

6      Lessons Learned

120. Keep it simple. If the project is regional, keep it simpler. The sheer scale and
complexity of this project has negatively affected both implementation and outcomes. A more
appropriate project design would have been to focus on either the shipping or the oil spill
activities and avoid adding other aspects. Regional projects are difficult and entail specificities
that require close attention: they often progress at the pace of the slowest stakeholders, as all
countries face different implementation contexts, and coordination with different cultures and
languages is a challenge. In that setting, the design of any regional project should be kept simple,
unambiguous, and streamlined wherever possible.

121. Quality at entry is crucial. One of the key lessons of this project is that inadequate
preparation and design has lasting impacts on its implementation, efficiency and eventually its
outcomes. Once again, in the context of a regional project, robust preparation work is even more
essential, and the true commitment of each government and its agencies should be ensured
before the start of the project. Insufficient preparation in this project has in particular led to
stand-alone needs assessment of each technology during implementation, which, we argued
earlier, undermined the required holistic approach to maritime safety and thus the efficiency of
the project.

122. Using two implementing agencies contributed significantly to the project. It was
feared at preparation stage that having two implementing agencies might be detrimental to the
project. On the contrary, through adequate collaboration and positive cross-stimulation, SAMSA
and IOC have been able to advance their own field of expertise with very good results and in part
compensate for a suboptimal preparation. It has been noted however that pairing two
implementing agencies is likely to complicate any substantial restructuring the project might
require.

123. Ensuring the sustainability of the project’s outcomes is difficult but essential. In
several of the countries, the activities face questions of sustainability, in part because of low-
ownership. Other comparable projects, including many environmental endeavors, face similar
ownership challenges which translate into poor sustainability of outcomes. Obtaining buy-in and
ensuring sustainability are therefore far from being straightforward, and should be given more
explicit consideration at design stage for this type of project. More importantly, sustainability

                                                27
arrangements can quickly become collateral casualties of difficulties that arise during
implementation.

124. In the specific context of this project, other stakeholders than the countries of the regions
benefit from the activities developed, i.e. increasing the safety of navigation and reducing the
risks of pollution of the marine and coastal ecosystems of the region: The shipping and oil and
gas industries, and the tourism and the fishing sectors. Moreover, the protection of these
ecosystems being a global public good, there is a rationale for some international commitment. It
might therefore be useful to re-consider sustainability through this prism and take stock of the
difficulties many countries face in integrating the recurring needs that arise from ensuring safety
of navigation and pollution prevention in the region. Other financing solutions could be explored
to pursue the activities undertaken here, which importance to the sustainable development of the
region is widely acknowledged. A regional scheme that would involve financial contributions
from the different sectors (e.g. through levies) and the international community might be an
option. It could also include an insurance scheme against ship-born pollution, involving the
benefiters listed above in the payment of the premiums, linked to the RCC, and under the
umbrella of the IMO and the Nairobi convention.

INTRODUCTION
This report covers Project activities up to the completion of the Project on 31 December 2012.

A financial analysis illustrating expenditure controlled by SAMSA is attached. (Annex A).

N.B It may be noted that savings in excess of US$ 1.8 million were made in the Project Co-ordination and
Management allocation during the period of the Project.

COMPONENTS.
         Components B and C were under the regional project management of the Indian Ocean Commission
with a separate budget allocation. They have, I believe reported to the Bank.

Component A. Development of a Regional Marine Highway and Institutions

A.1. Nautical Charts and Publications

         A.1.1 Status of surveys and Charts.

       This component was completed in accordance with the Project Implementation Plan and reported on
in December 2011.

          A.1.3 Route Survey.
        The Service hydrographique et océanographique de la Marine (SHOM) completed the survey of the
‘route’ through the Mozambique Channel in July 2010, as per the Project Implementation Plan and in
accordance with international standards, including additional routes to the port of Mahajanga (Madagascar).
This data was made available to the coastal States involved and with their permission the data was forwarded
to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and included in both small scale and large-scale charts and
electronic nautical charts of the region by December 2010.
          In July 2012 a formal submission was made to the IMO Navigation Sub-Committee (NAV) for
recognition of the survey as the ‘recommended route’. This would be in the interests of environmental
protection and would be supported by the latest upgrades to the aids to navigation in the region.
         To allow for the submission of additional information required, the NAV Committee postponed
consideration of the proposal until the NAV Committee meeting in July 2013. This would be outside the
project time-frame.
         It was therefore agreed by the Project Management Team with the charting authorities in the region,
UKHO and SHOM to proceed with charting action to reflect the intention of the Project albeit unofficially at
this stage. The display and wording that will appear on official charting and in the relevant publications is
shown in Annex B. Should the coastal States concerned still wish to consider a further application to IMO
NAV, this will have to be at their own initiative but it would be supported by South Africa and France.

      A.1.3. A2.1, A 1.4 – Training.
      Various training courses have been conducted involving the recipient States and are listed below.

        a) A.1.3 On-Task Training in Mozambique Channel

     Future courses may be offered by the Southern African and Islands Hydrographic Commission (SAIHC), an
official regional commission of the International Hydrographic Organisation, who have also assisted with this
Project.

            A.2.3 – Hydrographic instructions for port and approach surveys.    Completed

         Surveys of the Northern approach to Maputo and the Northern, Western and Southern approaches to
Zanzibar were also completed during 2012. All data has been passed to the coastal States concerned and to their
‘charting authority’ See Annex C.

            A.2.4 – Port and approach surveys. Completed

           The port surveys of Mahajanga, Tamatave (Madagascar) and Anjouan (Comoros) have been
completed by SHOM. See Annex C.

            A.2.5 – Production of ENCs.

             UKHO and SHOM have upgraded critical ENCs and will incorporate the route survey and other
data on their paper charts.

             In accordance with the requirements of the MTR, copies of paper and electronic charts (ENCs) will
be passed to each of the participating States once these become available.

    A.3. Aids to Navigation

            A.3.1 – Inspection of Aids to Navigation (AtoN) sites. Completed

            A.3.2 - Repairs or Upgrades to the AtoNs. See Annex D
    The replacement of the lighthouse on Aldabra Island in the Seychelles was completed.

    Due to delays in clearing the equipment through their Customs by the local authorities there was insufficient
    time to complete the light installation at Ponta Zavora Lighthouse in Mozambique. The lighthouse building
    has been repaired and the equipment is on site. It is now capable of having a new light and AIS base station
    fitted. The Mozambican Authorities are in direct contact with the contractors to complete the installation
    themselves. See Annex D

          A.3.4 – AtoN Maintenance Training Courses.

    A special course on Maintenance of AtoN was held in Durban from 8-12 November 2010 under the direction

    A.3.4 - Aids to Navigation training course

    Held from 8-12 November 2010 in Durban, South Africa, seven delegates from four recipient countries
    attended the course. The course was intended to cover most of the aspects of the Aids to Navigation
    environment. The programme included a technical visit to the Port of Durban and to a lighthouse.

    The delegates were of very diverse disciplines, ranging from technical maintenance and support, harbour
    management (Harbour Master) to maritime affairs / management.
    It became evident that training of more people, more often, is required. A suggestion was also made for
    interpretation to take place to allow more non-English speaking persons to receive training.

    The Project also resulted in the revitalisation of the Southern African Regional Co-Operation Group on
    Safety of Navigation and Marine Environment Protection (acronym SAGNEP) and will, with the assistance of
    IALA (International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities), endeavour to
    sustain the progress made during this Project with the provision of training and advise to regional States. The
    IALA World-Wide Academy (WWA) held an Aids to Navigation Awareness Seminar back-to-back with the
    3rd SAGNEP meeting.

    “The Southern African ad hoc Regional Co-operation Group on Safety of Navigation and Marine
    Environmental Protection? (acronym SAGNEP) has been re-established and will, with the assistance of
    IALA, endeavour to sustain the progress made during this Project with the provision of training and advise
    to regional States.

A.6 Project Evaluation and Extension.
       Consideration has been given to the sustainability of the Recipient States to maintain the standards
attained during the Project and to develop the means of continuing the process and improving on it.
A number of key areas have been identified and informal discussions held with international and other
interested bodies on how best to proceed.
It has become obvious that efforts, over many decades, to improve the maritime services in some regions do
not reflect the final success rate.

      The matrix Annex E indicates the linked process of these services and where assistance in the past has
been given.
It was felt that more consideration should be given to the infrastructure and the awareness by the national
authorities of their responsibilities in international law, conventions and in the interests of the coastal States
to provide assistance to, or to control, maritime trade

Training methods invariably remove important staff from their normal posts and responsibilities for
relatively long periods of time and there is usually no one available to replace them. On their return the same
infrastructure is in place and the expertise gained as a result of the training is usually not retained or fully

utilised. Methods utilising internal, ‘in-situ’ training or ‘virtual training’ are possible and could result in the
same knowledge being imparted while the recipient is still fully occupied and their services retained.

The Indian Ocean Commission has produced an extensive project completion report, which
could not be reproduced in its entirety here. The following pages compile the sections of the
IOC’s completion report that are most relevant to this ICR.




General Remarks

The expected result per component implemented by the IOC has been completed. Capacity development
was key to these components and all the countries have acquired and or improved their capacity to
respond to oil spill. NOSCP, dispersant policy, ESA map are in place in most countries although some are
yet to be approved by the local authorities. Equipment has been provided to four countries namely
Comoros, Mauritius, Mozambique and Tanzania.
Legal training has also been provided; four lawyers have been trained on maritime law at the IMLI
University in Malta and several legal officers have received training to help them better understand the
IMO conventions. Awareness on HNS protocol has been raised and national plan developed. At a
regional level, the framework for the regional oil spill contingency plan is in place. It is a dynamic
document that would require continuous update. All eight beneficiary countries have signed the regional
agreement for cooperation in response to oil spill in the region. However despite the results achieved,
countries and the region will still need assistance to compile, document and maintain environmental
databases and GIS information.


The activities of the project started later than the original expected date and the implementation of most
activities were also shifted. The implementation environment in most countries was adequate although

                                                   52
some challenges were encountered for example the political situation in Comoros and Madagascar. In
other cases, the poor understanding of the support that is required from the beneficiary countries in
preparation of national workshop caused some activities to be rescheduled or it had some impact on the
quality of the exchange in the workshop for example some participants were expected to be remunerated.
At the time of the midterm review, it was found necessary to extend the duration of the project to allow for
completion of some activities. Most activities have been completed fully except for the regional
implementation centre that is yet to be operational due to the administrative procedure in South Africa
that was not foreseen.

Status of Physical Project Implementation with regard to meeting all the objectives of the project
and by country


COMOROS

Institutional and Financial Arrangements
 The Ministry of Transport and Communications is the National Coordinating Ministry for the project with
the Ministry of Environment responsible for the implementation of the environmental components B and
C. Neither ministry had made any budgetary provision to support the project. The PMU (IOC) had to
provide all the support required at country level.

National Coordinator Monsieur SALIM SAID, Directeur Maritime de L’Union des Comores

General Remarks: The political-socio-economic situation has gradually improved since the start of the
activities  in 2009. One of the major project constraints with regard to implementation was the lack of
resources put at the disposal of the National Project Coordinator by the Government of Union of
Comoros. The National Coordinator did not even have the appropriate tools and facilities such as, a
computer and had to use the local cyber-coffee shop to access the emails sent from Project Management
Unit. Nonetheless the project managed to implement most of the activities with the support of the France/
Réunion.

Status of progress
    1. NOSCP: the project has prepared four Oil Spill Contingency Plans, namely one at the National
       level and one for each of the three autonomous islands namely (i) Anjouan, (2) Grande Comoroo
       and (3) Moheli. These have been presented to the government of Union of Comoros as well as to
       the autonomous authorities of each island for formal approval.
    2. ESA (Tactical, Strategic and Operational) maps have been prepared, printed and handed over
       to the office of the Vice President of Union of Comoros in September 2012.
    3. Policies on Dispersant: Comoros has national policies on use of dispersant and this has been
       approved by the Government of Union of Comoros since 2004.

Number of persons trained under the project in various skills as well as project management run into
hundreds over the four year period. Most national activities related to the NOSCP were supported by
France through La Réunion. Comoros also benefitted from the regional trainings and support for the ESA
maps through the services of BRL/OTRA.

Specific Constraints: The National Coordinator (CR) was not provided with adequate support by his
Government for the management of the project in Comoros. Despite this very acute shortcoming, the NC
did show great initiatives and endeavours to coordinate activities with all parties concerned including
maintaining communication and follow up of activities with the three autonomous islands of Grande
Comores, Anjouan and Moheli.

Institutional Problems
 Comoros is one of the participating countries which has its particularities and specificities
characterized by its limited financial resources and institutional capacity. The country has gone

                                                    53
through some changes at administrative and political level and this has also contributed to some
implementation difficulties. One of the main problems associated with implementation of the project
in Comoros was the limited political awareness, resources and facilities to implement the activities.
Since the policy and decision makers were not sensitize at the start up of the project it resulted in
low priority given to the project at national level. This was reflected through the quality of the
facilities allocated to the national coordinator to follow up on the activities of the project, for instance
basis facilities such as adequate office space, internet and telephone were minimal.

This problem could have been overcome, if at the start of the project, the project management team
under the guidance of the regional project coordinator and the WB had effected a joint start up
mission to this country to sensitize the government on the importance of the project and assess
the local capacity to coordinate activities at national level. Based on the findings the project should
have taken into account the specific condition of the country and be more flexible to provide
assistance to the local authority to better follow up on the project activities. Neither the Regional
Coordinator nor the representatives of the WB ever carried out a mission to this country during the
implementation of the project to emphasize the importance of this project to alert the Governments
at highest level of the importance of this project. As resources in Comoros are very limited, the
project did not have a “priority status’ and consequently no resources were ever allocated for the
implementation of this project. The national coordinator did not have a proper office with the basic
tools such as a computer / email / telephone for the implementation of the project.

Special Fund for the project
The creation of a special Fund was one of the conditions for the grant from the World Bank under
the 1998 to 2002 project. Furthermore, it was a critical issue raised by the Institutional and Financial
sustainability study in 1999 (previous WB funded project). The creation of this fund is imperative for
the sustainability of the project and it is a matter of concern that even now in 2012, Comoros has
not as yet confirmed nor indicated the creation of such a fund.
At the meeting the SRPC had with the Minister of Interior and Defence and acting Minister of the
Environment on 22 September 2010, the minister had stated that the Government of Comoros has
agreed to create a special fund for the project in the 2011 Budget. However, this was conditional to
the approval of this budget by the to-be newly elected Government in December 2010.
As at the time of the writing of this report, no sustainable FUND has been set up in Comoros

Oil Spill Response (OSR) Equipment: Union of Comoros was provided with Oil Spill Response
Equipment in 2002. However, during an uprising the equipment in Anjouan was destroyed and
hence this autonomous island had no equipment to deal with any spill. It is to be noted that the port
of Mutsamudu in Anjouan is the main port with deep water berthing. Under this project at Mid Term
Review, a decision was taken to provide Anjouan with a set of OSR equipment comprising 200
meters of booms etc to deal with a Tier 1 spill..
This was officially handed over to the authorities represented by the Vice President of Union of
                                                            st
Comoros and the governor of the island of Anjouan on 21 September 2012. Comoros have Oil
Spill Response Equipment to deal with a tier 1 (up to 50 tonnes of Oil) incident in each of the three
islands of Anjouan, Grande Comoros and Moheli.

HNS National Plan: A national workshop was held from 5 to 7 April 2012 in Moroni with participants from
all three islands and a national HNS plan was prepared with the assistance of an expert from IMO. This
plan is yet to be approved and adopted by the authorities.

ESA maps: ESA maps have been prepared for all three countries and have been technically adopted
approved and handed over to the Vice-President on 21 September 2012.

Revision and updating of NOSCP of Union des Comoros and the three respective islands were carried
on two occasions in 2009 and in 2012. On both occasions, over one hundred national participants were
also trained to forecast oil drift during a spill, preparing local containment plans as well as in the skills of
deploying their Oil Spill Response Equipment.


                                                       54
Experts provided by France Reunion, were the main resource persons used for the revision of the plans,
for training of national and for testing of the islands plans.

Sustainability
The Government of Comoros has the very good intention to sustain the activities of the project but the
lack of resources is a challenge. The trained personnel available is an asset that Comoros would need to
make good use of. However, France/ Réunion have offered to continue providing support to Comoros.

KENYA

Institutional and Financial Arrangements.
The project was placed under the responsibility of the Ministry of transport of Kenya and the national
coordination was delegated to Kenya Maritime Authority and the national focal point is based in
Mombasa. NEMA which is the National Environment Management Authority based in Nairobi was
identified to contribute to the project.

National Coordinator: MRS NANCY KARIGITHU, Director General, Kenya Maritime Authority,
       Mombasa, Kenya

General Remarks
All activities have been finalized in Kenya despite the late nomination of the national coordinator. The
National Coordinator, a very high profile person was only nominated in August 2009 after various
attempts by the project management unit of the IOC. As the DG of KMA and as the chair of committees at
IMO in London at that time, the effective coordination was lead by the deputy Mr. Peter MBIRIRI, Marine
Safety Officer at KMA lacking. Communication and coordination with Kenya was not that effective until
late into the implementation phase. The situation led to rescheduling of activities at various occasions.
However, on the positive side, the Kenyan Oil Industry Association (OSMAG) was very keen and willing to
participate and bring their contribution for the revision of the NOSCP.

Specific Constraints
The project at national level was coordinated through the Kenya maritime Authority based in Mombasa.
One of the initial problems with the implementation was the huge delay in the nomination of the National
Coordinator to lead the project. This problem was only resolved after the SRPC had a meeting with the
Minister of Transport of Kenya in August 2009 in Nairobi. Up to that point Mr. Peter Thuo, Director
General of Maritime Services of Kenya based in Nairobi was deemed to steer the implementation of the
project. However, his direct involvement in the project was limited.
At the meeting with Minister Hon. Ambassador Chirau Ali Mwakwere in August 2009, the SRPC made a
presentation of the project and asked for the Government’s support and subsequently, Mrs Nancy
Karigithu, the DG of KMA was appointed.

Status of progress

    1. NOSCP: A National Technical Working Group was set up to review the draft NOSCP in March
       2010 and again in September 2011. On both occasions the PMU had provided technical
       assistance to help the revision process. Once the NOSCP was finalised, Training for TIER I and
       Tier II were delivered to nationals in Mombasa. Furthermore, the NOSCP was desk top tested in
       September 2011. In May 2012, a full scale exercise was organised to test the NOSCP with
       deployment of Oil Spill Response equipment

    2. ESA: a national workshop was organised in June 2010 and again a national working Group was
       set to work on the preparation of the ESA maps under the supervision of the BRLi/OTRA
       consultant. The NTWG got the job done through various working sessions which were supported
       by the project.




                                                    55
    3. Policies on Dispersant: again, a workshop was held and guidelines and a road map was
       prepared and given to Kenya in 2010. The authorities are now supposed to validate the policies
       for incorporation in the NOSCP.

Development of Ecosystem valuation methodology: Kenya participated in both regional workshops
held in December 2010 in Mauritius and that of July 2012 held in Dar Es Salaam. National coastal experts
had been assisted and provided with lead to prepare the appropriate national ecosystem valuation
methodologies.

HNS PLAN. The national HNS plan was prepared at a workshop organised by PMU on 5-7 March 2012
in Mombasa. Kenya therefore has a National HNS plan. Arrangements were in place to ratify the OPRC
90 and the HNS2000 protocol

Interest to host RCC: Kenya had shown keen interest to host the RCC and had submitted their offer for
consideration, assessment by the independent team composed of UNEP, IMO and REMPEC.

Lawyer trained at IMLI: A national lawyer nominated by the Ministry of Transport namely Mr. Omar
Ahmed Ali was sponsored by the project to read for a Masters Degree in International Maritime Laws. The
purpose of funding his one year’s study was to provide specialized capacity to better manage and service
the IMO Conventions and more specifically for the domestication of IMO conventions.

 Number of persons trained: some 80 persons have been initiated to the NOSCP process for the
revision, updating and testing of the NOSCP

Total number of persons involved in the project through workshops/training: over 150

Sustainability
Kenya is one of the countries with a good level of capacity and well equipped to continue with the
activities after project completion; it has put in place a program for training of its officers. It will work
closely with OSMAR.

MADAGASCAR

Institutional and Financial Arrangements
The Ministry of Transport of Madagascar is the focal Ministry for the project. OLEP is the National Centre
for NOSCP created under National Legislation in 2003 and is funded through a national tax of 5 MGF per
litre of fuel imported in Madagascar. For the components B and C, the project worked closely with OLEP
which is the national institution responsible for oil spill management and also it was mandated by the
Indian Ocean Council of Ministers in 2004 as the sub regional coordination centre to respond to oil spill in
the sub region.

National Coordinator: Mr. Raniriharison Fetra Harilanto, Director for technical and Security
Services of the Agency for Port and Marine and Mr. Roland Rakotondrasata, Director of OLEP

General Remarks
OLEP (Organe de lute contre la pollution) is the national and the only dedicated and full time legally set
up Organisation to deal with Oil Spills. It is based in Antananarivo and is the sole agency dealing with and
implementing the project on behalf of the Government of Madagascar. They are accountable and
answerable to the Ministry of Environment.

OLEP is self financed through a levy of 5 Malagasy francs per liter of fuel oil imported into Madagascar.
This has been in place since 2002, under the previous WB funded project. They have adequate
resources, many vehicles, own their office building and generally do a very good job of revising and
updating the local plans, training people in the districts. OLEP is highly visible in Madagascar as most of
their activities and events are well covered by the national and local media.


                                                        56
Specific Constraints
The only constraint noted was that the Directors of OLEP hang on to the National Oil Spill Plan rather
than creating self sustaining units for oil spill management at local levels. However, during the project
implementation, this issue was addressed and marked improvement in communications between OLEP
and the Provinces had been noted and effectively made.

Status of progress:

1. NOSCP: Madagascar has a national and 12 other provincial and local plans. They also have a fully
   dedicated and full time team of nationals who permanently go round training and updating the
   NOSCP. They also have local OSCPs and have created a lot of capacity to deal with spills at District
   levels.

2. ESA: The National Technical Working Group with (ONE) Organisation National de L’Environnement)
   as lead agency has prepared the Tactical, operational and Strategic sets of ESA maps.

3. Policies on use of Dispersant: National policy on use of dispersant has been worked out with the
   assistance of the project consultant since 2010 and is now adopted at National level by the National
   Authorities.

4. Development of Ecosystem valuation methodology: Madagascar has participated in the two
   regional workshops for the development of ecosystem valuation methodology. After review of the
   various international and regional Ecosystem valuation methodologies, Madagascar has prepared
   and adopted its national methodologies. This economic tool will be widely used by the ministry of
   environment for the purposes of EIA and other environmental assessments exercises.

5. Interest to host RCC: Madagascar had shown interest to host the RCC as they had been running
   the sub-regional coordination office, created under the 1998-2002 WB funded project.

6. However, when the trio of International organizations comprising IMO, UNEP and REMPEC made an
   assessment of the four countries ( Kenya, Madagascar, France and South Africa) proposals to host
   the RCC, South Africa’ offer was found to be the best and was selected to host the RCC. Madagascar
   has expressed its intention to revitalise its sub regional centre, to work closely with the RCC in South
   Africa and has offered to conduct regional exercises.

7. HNS plan: Madagascar was the first country to have prepared its national HNS plan following a
   national workshop in the capital. They have also prepared the instruments to ratify the OPRC 90 and
   HNS 2000 protocol but this has not been possible because the present Government is not
   internationally recognized.


Sustainability

Madagascar has a well organised set up and has the capacity to continuously provide training for the
update of the NOSCP. It also has the capacity to conduct national exercises and has offered to assist in
conducting the regional exercises and the coordination with the island states are mandated by the
Council of Ministers of the IOC in 2004. Nonetheless it will still require support for some specialised
expertise and equipment s for specific actions

MAURITIUS

Institutional and Financial Arrangements
The project was placed under the responsibility of the Ministry of National Development, Infrastructure,
land transport and shipping. However, the Ministry of Environment has the responsibility for the NOSCP.

National Coordinator: Premchand Bhowon, Secretary for Shipping, Ministry of Transport,

General Remarks:
Mauritius has been able to implement all the activities programmed under the project. The participation in
the project implementation has been very broad based with most authorities involved as well as the
University of Mauritius which played a leading role in preparation of the case studies leading to the
adoption of appropriate ecosystem valuation methodologies for the region and for Mauritius in particular.
Mauritius was also able to secure much needed high seas booms and other ancillary equipment following
their request made during the project Steering Committee meeting in December 2011.
Mauritius is one of the countries that has good level of capacity to combat oil spill and has included in
their national budget funds dedicated to activities pertaining to oil spills and to participate in regional
efforts.

Specific Constraints.
Initially some difficulties were encountered by the National Coordinator, who is from the Ministry of
Transport to coordinate the implementation of environmental activities under components B and C.
However, the Ministry of Transport, through the lead role played by the Permanent Secretary, ably
managed to galvanize all the multitude of agencies and ministries to work together. The Ministry of
Environment, Ministry of Housing and University of Mauritius played important roles during
implementation f the project.

Status of progress

    1. NOSCP: NOSCP was revisited and updated in June 2010 and in 2012 with the assistance of
       experts provided by the project. Furthermore the NOSCP has been fully tested, and training of
       nationals for Tier I and Tier II were carried out in September 2010. Tier III training for the leading
       persons was provided in December 2010.
    2. ESA: ESA maps have been prepared by the GIS unit within the Ministry of Housing and Lands
       and supported by the expert provided by the project. These ESA maps have been printed and
       handed over to the Mauritian Authorities in December 2012
    3. Policies on Dispersant: national policies on use of dispersant already existed but the Project
       had provided an expert to review the same. New Policies have been technically approved and
       remain to be approved by the highest competent authorities.

    4. Development of Ecosystem valuation methodology:

     Mauritius has very actively participated in both regional workshops and was one of the leading
    research groups in the development of the regional ecosystem valuation methodologies. The
    Mauritian team was lead by the University of Mauritius. It is to be noted that UoM has also been doing
    similar researches and had contributed very much in this regional process. Furthermore, University of
    Mauritius runs courses in environmental economics and could still play an important regional role in
    the future in the further fine tuning and propagating of the use of this methodology in the assessment
    and CBA of projects in environmentally sensitive areas, e.g. when carrying out EAIs etc.


    5. Number of persons trained:
    Over 200 persons have been trained at national levels in the preparation of NOSCP, on the roles and
    responsibilities of interveners and in the science of oil spill management.


                                                    58
    6. Ratification of the conventions:
    Mauritius has ratified all the IMO conventions that had been targeted by the project such as
    OPRC 90, CLC92 and International Funds of 92. However, these IMO conventions still needed
    to be incorporated into the Marine related national laws. The Government of Mauritius is in the
    process of doing so.

    Sustainability

    Funds have been incorporated in the national budget to support activities post project
    completion.

MOZAMBIQUE

Institutional and Financial Arrangements:
 INAMAR is the lead agency for this project under the aegis of the Ministry of Transport of Mozambique.
The project has had many meetings with the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport (who had
actively opened and closed all workshops) to make budgetary provision for the sustainable management
of the oil Spill/HNS national plans during post project closure period.

National Coordinator:
Captain Mario Guilherme from INAMAR from 2009 to March 2012. From March 2012 to December 2012
Mr Albano Gove has been the new NC. The handing over was not done under the best of conditions and
it took some time before the new NC got going.

General Remarks:
Mozambique is a Portuguese speaking country and this presented a challenge to the project
management unit, as the PMU had to have most documents if not all translated into Portuguese as well
as run all workshops and training programmes in Portuguese. Despite untimely change of National
Coordinator during the fourth year of project implementation; all the objectives of the project were fully
met. Ports of Maputo, Beira and Nacala are equipped with Tier I Oil Spill response equipment comprising
of 200 meters of booms etc. Furthermore, INAMAR had invited the oil industry as well as the port
authorities to participate in the project.
The project also understands that INAMAR would be entering into a contractual agreement with a private
company, SubTech of South Africa, to respond to any future oil spills.

Specific Constraints:
Mozambique is a country with extended shoreline. The size of the country and working with the various
ports and various local INAMAR representatives proved to be a major challenge both in terms of travel
and cost and meetings/workshops organisation. It is also to be noted that initially for the first three years
of the project, all activities were only carried out in Maputo.
Only during the fourth year that Maputo decided to decentralize the preparation of local plans and
empowering the local authorities in this respect.
Due to social unrest and violence in the streets of Maputo, all missions to Mozambique were put on hold
from June 2010 to January 2011.
This caused major delays and dislocation of activities already planned and scheduled.

Status of progress:

    1. NOSCP: NOSCP was revisited and updated in June 2010 and in 2012 with the assistance of
       experts provided by the project. Furthermore, the NOSCP has been finalised and submitted to the
       authorities for approval and adoption. Training for Tier I and Tier II oil spill were carried out in
       September 2010. Tier III training for the leading persons was provided in December 2010. Full
       scale exercise to test the NOSCP was organised in September 2012 in Maputo.



                                                     59
    2. ESA: ESA maps have been prepared with the participation of CENECARTA and INAHINA. The
       latter had undertaken to make prints of these at Cenecarta for circulation to appropriate
       authorities.
    3. Policies on Dispersant: national policies on use of dispersant were first prepared in June 2010
       and the project supported the national ministry of Environment to run national consultations for
       technical approval. This is being adopted after approval by the cabinet of ministers.

    4. Development of Ecosystem valuation methodology: Mozambique did not participate in either
       of the two regional workshops for the development of ecosystem valuation methodology. The
       nominated participants for the first workshop did not turn up at the workshop. Therefore, as the
       second workshop was a follow up of the work started at the first workshop, Mozambique did not
       participate in the second workshop either.

    5. Number of persons trained: Details on participants who had attended the numerous workshops/
       training sessions organized in Maputo, in Beira, in Nacala and at regional levels run into
       hundreds and are given in various reports.

    6. HNS Plans: a national workshop was organised in February 2012 following a regional workshop
       held in Mombasa in 2011 and consequently a national HNS plan was prepared and adopted

    7.    Training of lawyer as a specialist in Maritime International Laws.
         Ms. Susan Tembe was nominated by INAHINA (Ministry of Transport) to follow a Master’s course
         at IMLI. She is now the specialist in IMO (maritime) conventions and provides all inputs with
         regard to servicing, domestication of these conventions.

Sustainability

Provision has been made in the national budget to support activities related to oil spill. Mozambique is
expecting to enter into an agreement with a South African company to provide assistance. Assistance
shall also be provided by the US Coast guard.


SEYCHELLES

Institutional and Financial Arrangements
At the start of the project implementation, the Ministry of Transport and Environment was the project
implementing authority. Latter the portfolio for Environment was shifted to another Ministry but the project
remained under the responsibility of the Ministry responsible for Transport. The Ministry of Environment
has the responsibility for the management of NOSCP and a very good level of support was provided by
the legal officer of that Ministry to boost up activities at national level. The required special fund to
support the implementation of the project was not in place at the time of project closure despite repeated
requests to do so.

National Coordinator
Captain Joachim Valmont, Director General of Seychelles Maritime Safety Authority. However, effectively
for the purposes of implementation of components B and C, Mr Joubert Flavien of the Ministry of
environment was the lead person.

Captain Ernesta was the national focal point at the start of the project but was replaced by Mrs Fiona
Robinson, the Director General of Seychelles Maritime Safety Administration from 2009 to 2010. There
was another change in national coordinator and from 2011 to 2012, was the National Project Coordinator.




                                                    60
Specific Constraints
No specific constraints were encountered as the high level authorities were always kept informed by the
SRPC. The permanent liaison officer to the IOC from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a very
important and active role in ensuring that the authorities were kept informed of progress made for the
activities under implementation as well as the constraints and bottlenecks encountered. However, the
change of national coordinator slowed down some of the activities but it was not difficult for the country to
pick up due to its experience in addressing matters related to oil spill. It is to be noted that during the
duration of the project, the Seychelles had changed the National Coordinator three times. This was due to
the high level of mobility of staff and changes in the government structure.

Status of progress

    1. NOSCP: NOSCP was revisited and updated in June 2010 and in 2012 with the assistance of
       experts provided by the project. Furthermore the NOSCP had been tested and training of
       nationals for Tier I and Tier II were carried out in September 2010. Tier III training for the leading
       persons was provided in December 2010. Successful Full Scale Exercise to test the NOSCP was
       organised in June 2012.

    2. ESA: ESA maps have been prepared with the participation of GIS department of Seychelles.
    3. Policies on Dispersant: national policies on use of dispersant were first prepared in June 2010
       and was adopted by the GOS

    4. Development of Ecosystem valuation methodology: Seychelles participated in the first
       regional workshop in Mauritius and the three participants did not prepare the required national
       papers nor collected any data to be used in the development of the regional and national
       ecosystem valuation methodologies which were deemed to be inputted at the second regional
       workshop. Consequently, they did not participate in the second workshop despite being invited to
       do so. Seychelles would require more in house assistance to train the nationals on the application
       of the methodology.

    5.   Number of persons trained

       Participants from various ministries including all staff of Department of Risk and Disaster
       management (DRDM) and members of coastguards participated in all workshops, all training
       programmes for Tier I and Tier II. Selected high level officials were trained at level Tier III and
       also as trained Trainers. Over 100 persons were trained in Seychelles.
       .
Sustainability

Seychelles has out in place a national disaster management committee and funds have been earmarked
in the national budget to support some activities related to oil spill. The Seychelles will also benefit from
on ongoing collaboration with the US Coast Guard

SOUTH AFRICA

Institutional and Financial Arrangements:
The department of environmental affairs and water was designated as the authority to coordinate the
activities of the project at national level. It is also the Ministry responsible for the office of the national
focal point of the GEF and recipient of the project Grant.

National Coordinator: Dr Yazeed Peterson of Department of Environmental Affairs

General Remarks
South Africa had not been very active at the start of the project. There was some confusion as to whether
they were to participate at their own cost {because of the fact that some countries with a high GDP do not

                                                      61
qualify for WB funding}. This point was clarified during the Inception Project launch in 2009, in Mauritius.
Thereafter, South Africa identified their needs for activities for components B and C, which were mostly
the same as for the other participating countries.

Another major delay was on account of the Football World Cup organised in South Africa. South Africa
had indicated that they did not want any activities organised before the end of the football world cup, in
July 2010.

Specific Constraints
The main concern was the eligibility of SA to the funds and the project was challenges by the
administrative procedure for approval and decision making specifically with regarding the regional
agreement and the hosting of the regional coordination centre for oil spill response.

Status of progress

    1. NOSCP: the National Oil Spill Contingency plan was revised on two occasions with the
       assistance of experts provided by the project. Numerous recommendations were made to
       complete the plan. However because of institutional reforms with regard to responsibilities for
       dealing with oil spills by coastal local authorities, another level of consultations and agreements
       on the set ups were needed and this is still ongoing at this stage of the project.

    2. ESA: South Africa had indicated that they would prepare the ESA maps themselves and did not
       need assistance from the project

    3. Policies on Dispersant: South Africa had its policies on use of dispersant

    4. Development of Ecosystem valuation methodology: Three participants from South Africa
       participated in the first Regional workshop held in Mauritius. One participant was from University
       of Cape Town and the other two were private sector. Environmental consultants. At the
       workshop, a work plan was adopted to prepare national reports and to carry out case studies etc.
       Unfortunately, the South African participants, who had attended did not participate in any of the
       set assignments. Despite, many reminders to participate in the process for the second regional
       workshop which was going to adopt the regional valuation methodologies, South Africa did not
       take any part in the rest of the activity.

    5. Interest to host RCC: South Africa was one amongst other three countries also interested to
       host the RCC. An independent team comprising IMO, UNEP and REMPEC had recommended
       South Africa to host the RCC. However, internal administrative issues have not been finalised to
       enable the RCC to become operational as at end of November 2012.

    6. Number of persons involved in the project through workshops/training: over 60

    7. HNS plan: Following regional and national workshops, South Africa had prepared in February
       2012 its national HNS plan. South Africa had also indicated its intention to ratify the HNS
       convention, as the country is a major manufacturer and exporter of chemical products.

Sustainability

South Africa will continue to finalise the National Oil spill contingency plan and put in plan the remaining
regional plan through its own budget. SAMSA will through its own funds finance the RCC

TANZANIA

Institutional and Financial Arrangements
The Ministry of Transport and more specifically through SUMATRA is the lead agency for the project. The
national Environment Management Council (NEMC) is the national institution responsible for
environmental affairs and support for the project was also provided by NEMC.

National Coordinator: Capt. King N. Chiragi, Director of Maritime Safety and Security – SUMATRA
email: king.chiragi@sumatra.or.tz
Focal person for the environmental components: Ms. Rose Sallema Mtui - Senior Environmental
Management Officer working under the Directorate responsible for Environmental Planning and
Research, the focal point for the environmental components. nrsallema@yahoo.com

General Remarks: The activities in Tanzania start off very slowly nonetheless the activities picked up
towards project completion and all the activities in Tanzania had been carried out. It is one of the
countries with experience in ecosystem valuation method and has hosted the regional workshop on
ecosystem valuation. Tanzania has hosted two missions to-date and three national technical working
groups have been set up to work specifically on three products which are as follows: (1) NOSCP, (2)
ESA, (3) Policies on Dispersant. Zanzibar was not much involved in the project, a few officers were
training on NOSCP but it is to be noted that Zanzibar does not have a plan.

Specific Constraints: The activities in Tanzania started off very slowly and it took time before Tanzania
was fully involved in the activities. There was a perception that the Authorities at National level are not
involved and therefore the strong message coming from the top is missing. Consequently, those involved
in the implementation view this project as another add-on to their usual responsibilities and provided the
necessary inputs, as and when they could. Often, scheduled activities under the project had to be
rescheduled. This heavily impacted on the implementation at national level and led to postponement of
activities and in taking of decisions. The points highlighted could have been overcome if at the start of the
project implementation, the project management team including the World Bank had conducted joint
inception meetings in Tanzania to better understand the procedure in place and to sensitize the decision
makers.

Status of progress

      1. NOSCP. The existing draft NOSCP was revisited and updated in June 2010with the assistance
         of experts from BRLi/OTRA. A National Technical Working Group was set up to take onboard
         the recommendations made at the workshop and to complete the NOSCP. The NOSCP was
         again revised in 2011 and again recommendations were made for the authorities to take on
         board the recommendations. The main missing component in the NOSCP was with regard to
         the OPERATION aspects of the plan. It needed to define how information is channelled to the
         authority from the time a spill is observed. Next it was important to define what happened to that
         information, who evaluates this information and what action is taken? Is there a need to mobilize
         resources and if so who does what? It needed to compose the various cells such as who would
         be in the evaluation team? Who would be in the operational team? Who would be in the
         Logistics cell? Who would be in the Financial and Historical teams? This SUMATRA had still not
         done in November 2012.

      2. Testing and Training for Tier I and Tier II - National training for the onsite responders and On
         Scene Commanders and for the National training of the personnel of the National Incident
         management organization were organised in country in 2011.




                                                     63
3.    ESA: a national workshop was organised and a road map was prepared at the workshop and
      a NTWG was set up to prepare the ESA maps in 2010. Thereafter progress was very slow. In
      June 2012, the technical working group was reactivated and a national workshop was again
      organised and this group was able to prepare and technically validate the Strategic,
      operational and the tactical ESA maps for the coastal areas of Tanzania. These have been
      technically adopted and widely circulated to the various ministries for final comments and
      approval. This is also posted onto the NEMC website for viewing by a wider public and onto
      the Nairobi Convention website.

 4. Policies on Dispersant. The draft national policies discussed and proposed in July 2010 is
   still under discussions between the Vice President Office, NEMC and SUMATRA. As advised by
   vice president’s office that the draft policy would have to go through an appropriate regulation
   prepared under the Merchant shipping Act. SUMATRA would have to take a leading role in
   developing the regulation via the Merchant Shipping Act of 2003.

5. Development of Ecosystem valuation methodology: the second regional workshop was held
   in Dar Es Salaam because in Tanzania there are a large number of mangroves where
   numerous informal large scale economic activities take place in them. Therefore by holding the
   workshop in Dar Es Salaam, the participants were able to visit one of these mangroves and get
   a very good feel for the need to evaluate economic values of such sensitive areas, that are host
   to a lot of ‘economic? assets.

6. Interest to host RCC: The Government of Tanzania had informed of their none intention to
   host the regional coordination centre in October 2010

7. Oil Spill Response Equipment handing over in June 2012 in the port of Tanzania. The
   project has provided Tanzania with basic oil spill response equipment as a starting point to
   enable Tanzania to be able to deal with a tier I spill. The philosophy being that Tanzania will
   appreciate the need to build on and add to this lot and be in a state of preparedness at all time
   to deal with a spill and especially to contain and manage a spill at the very start of a spill. The
   OSR equipment comprising of 200metres of 750 mm deep self inflated (foam filled) with
   skimmers, storage tanks, absorbents, PPEs etc are kept in three trailers ready to be mobilized
   to any site where a spill might occur. The OSR equipments are in the custody of the Tanzanian
   Port Authority.

8. Lawyer trained in International Maritime Laws: Lawyer Ms Asma Salemeni was selected
   and proposed for training at IMLI by the Ministry of Transport of Tanzania. She followed a one
   year full time course to the level of Masters in International Maritime laws. On return to
   Tanzania, she became an important legal resource person especially with regard to the
   domestication of the IMO conventions.

9. Number of persons involved in the project through workshops/training approximately
   300 plus

10.Sustainability

     Provision in the national budget will be made to support the activities. None the less support
     would be further required to better equip the port of Dar es salaam and actions on Zanzibar.
     Tanzania is one of the countries that would need more assistance.

MAJOR LESSONS LEARNT, AND RECOMMENDATION

4.1       Coordination
The agreement between the participating countries and the World Bank on the implementation of the
project was obtained in 2006. The participating countries individually signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Worlds Bank in which the countries agreed to participate fully in the project. The
project appraisal document (PAD) was approved by the World Bank in April 2007 and the grant
agreement was signed in September 2007. The process for the recruitment of the project sub regional
coordinator to assist the IOC with the project implementation was launched and the coordinator effectively
in position in 2008. In order to further assist the IOC in the implementation of the activities, a contract was
established between IOC and BRL/OTRA in 2009. The PMU at the IOC was placed under the
responsibility of a charge de mission nominated by the Secretary General to represent the regional
authorizing officer. The secretariat also provide secretarial and support for accounting. The PMU was
sufficiently well equipped to perform its duties. The establishment of the project Unit for the overall
coordination of the project based in SAMSA South Africa took some time and the coordination
mechanism between the two implementing institutions suffered some set back. There was the need to
improve on communication to facilitate its implementation. The project coordinator based in SAMSA had
a bigger role to play in the overall project implementation. The link and exchanges with the grant recipient
South Africa should have been reinforced during the project implementation. More project management
meeting between the two implementing institutions and the recipient of the grant South Africa could have
been organised.
Coordination of activities with the recipient countries was satisfactory although there have been cases of
delayed responses from the countries which led to activities being rescheduled or delayed. The project
launch and the steering committee had to be rescheduled due to lack of responses from the recipient
countries. In other cases, not all countries were present due to short comings in the preparation of the
meetings and flight logistics.

4.2      Support from the World Bank office
The project appraisal phase was conducted from 2004 to 2007 under the guidance of the World Bank.
The project was originally being supervised by the World Bank office in Washington responsible for the
Africa Bank for East Africa. Various visits to the participating countries and the regional consultative
meetings were organized and supported by the bank. These meetings in which the bank played a very
instrumental and effective role helped to clarify a number of issues regarding the co financing and to
agree on the implementation arrangements. It also helped to get the consent of the countries on the
appraisal of the project. There was a change of the project manager at the World Bank office almost one
year after the grant agreement was signed. The World Bank office in South Africa responsible for a
number of Eastern and Southern African countries had the responsibility to supervise the project and the
support provided has been satisfactory. The request for approval and the delay in obtaining the non
objection of the Bank for procurement was adequate. The supervisory missions both operational and
financial were appropriate and timely. The financial supervisory mission provided much desirable
guidance for the management of the grant.

4.3      Project Steering Committee
In accordance to the project appraisal document, the Steering committee comprising of senior officials
responsible for transport or Environment or both of each beneficiary country, the chief executive of
SAMSA, the Secretary General of the Indian Ocean Commission was to meet as required but at least
once a year to monitor the overall implementation of the project. The committee met four times during the
timeframe of the project. The first steering committee is the forum for the senior officials from the Ministry
of Transport or and environment of the participated countries to meet and assess the progress made on
the project. It is a forum whereby the technical and political aspects of the project is converging and
provide guidance for its implementation. The first steering Committee took place in 2009 after the dates
had been postponed on several occasions, two years after project effectiveness. The first steering
Committee was also considered as the launch of the project but it did not bring together all the
participating countries. The representation of the countries and member ship to the Committee were
corrected at the second meeting held in Mauritius. Although the PAD gave clear indication of the

                                                      65
composition of the Steering Committee, it was always a challenge to organize the meeting and the
number of representatives per country. The need to bridge the gap between the shipping and the
environment department became very apparent, therefore the need to relook at the composition of the
steering committee in order to enhance its effectiveness and to bring the desired output. A special
session of the committee was organized in December 2011 in which decision makers at the level of
Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of environment, shipping, Foreign Affairs and the judiciary were
invited. The session was important as a decision on the Regional coordination centre was required and
also to discuss the sustainability of the project output post project completion.

4.4      National commitment
The project appraisal was conducted in 2004 to 2005 and in 2006 all the participating countries had
signed the MOU to partake fully in the project. The MOU although of a general nature had provisions for
the participating governments to provide inputs to facilitate the project implementation at national level.
France on behalf of Réunion Island, a member of the Indian Ocean Commission, was also fully engaged
and contributed in the implementation of the project but due to its particular status it was not required to
sign the MoU nor would it benefit from the grant. However it has contributed immensely to the
implementation of activities under component B and C in Comoros and Rodrigues Island of Mauritius. It
also funded its own participation to the steering committee and the various regional workshops organised
under the respective components.
 A national coordinator from was appointed in each country to support the project implementation at
national level. The national coordinator was an employee of the respective government who provided his
services from its respective work station. In some countries, an alternate national coordinator was also
designated and was mostly representatives from the Ministry of Environment. Other than the appointment
of the national coordinator, it has been observed that generally most of the countries have not been able
to meet all their obligations under the MOU and furthermore some countries took time in nominating their
national coordinator. The low commitment of the countries could be a result of various factors:
        i.        The late start of the project. It took a long time between the project appraisal and the
                  effective implementation of the project and by then there has been changes of personnel
                  involved in the process and as a result could have led to gaps in information
                  dissemination at national level.
        ii.       The implementation modality was not made clear to the countries; there were inadequate
                  sensitization activities at institutional level therefore leading to inadequate information
                  available to policy and decision makers.
        iii.      There is a general lack of coordination at national level between the ministries involved in
                  the project. There seems to be no internal reporting system to highlight to the highest
                  authorities the benefit accruing from the project

The implementing institutions could have been more proactive in sensitizing the governments at the offset
of the project implementation. At the inception phase of the project, the two implementing agencies along
with the project coordinators could have undertaken joint visits to the participating countries to introduce
the project and assess the situation in each participating country. However, the above mentioned
situations gradually improved in some countries and better results have been obtained. Most activities in
the countries are completed. In countries like Mauritius, towards the third year of the project
implementation; the national authority was fully engaged in the project, funds were committed in the
budget to support the RCC. In Kenya, more stakeholders were mobilized and partake in the project. In
Madagascar despite the current political situation prevailing in the country, the National Centre has been
able to implement a number of training and exercises at national level and in the various ports. The centre
was also prepared to host and co finance the first regional exercise to test the regional plan but the
request was not approved by the Bank due to the timing of the activities which was close to the end date
of the project.

        4.4.1    Recommendations

The overall implementation of the project has been satisfactory. The fact that there were two project
management units with distinct components to implement , the project was often perceived as two
different projects and it brought about some confusion at the start of the project This set of
recommendation is aim to provide guidance for improved implementation of complex regional projects.
                  A national steering Committee supported by the project could have been encouraged
                  as a forum for information sharing and enhance coordination at national level. It would
                  also help to raise awareness and mobilise political commitment at national level.
               The situation in each country should have been taken into consideration to establish the
                  level of support that the project could have provided for the coordination of activities at
                  national level. The level of development in each country differs and the national
                  administrative structure is also divers. Most of the participating countries are
                  characterised as low income earning countries.
               Joint visits to the countries by the project management units should be encouraged to
                  meet with the governments officials and to raise the political awareness. It would have
                  help to clarify the status of the project at national level and more synergies between the
                  implementing agencies.
               The implementing agencies and South Africa, as the recipient of the overall grant,
                  should have established formal exchange mechanisms for monitoring of the project
                  and it would have help the Authorities in SA to better understand the hosting of the
                  Regional Coordination centre.

4.5     Implementation Schedule

        The effective implementation of the project started almost one year after the grant agreement was
        signed. It also took some time for the countries to nominate their national coordinator and in the
        absence of a national coordinator it was difficult to commence the activities on time thus leading
        to delays in implementation and therefore impact on the end date of the project. The project
        picked up its momentum almost three years after the original implementation date. At the midterm
        review, the need to extend the project completion date was established. An extension period of
        18 months was approved which brought about a reallocation in the budget of the project. The
        amount allocated to the components B and C were increased to further support the activities
        under the two components. This extension and revision of the budget allocation was useful to
        allow the completion of most activities and also to meet the emerging needs raised in some of the
        countries such as the request for equipment for Mauritius and all activities pertaining to the HNS
        protocol which was initially not foreseen in the project.

4.6      Communication and sensitisation
Communication around the project has been fairly good. The project website Wiomprcc-ioc.org had
much to do with it. All the activities implementation reports together with selected pictures of activities and
participants were regularly posted on the website. The website provides most of the project information in
both English and French. Furthermore, media was always invited to cover and report on the activities in
the respective countries. Media coverage in Comores, Madagascar, Tanzania and Seychelles were
excellent.
Also articles in the IOC newsletter were posted occasionally, the local media were invited to capture the
national regional workshops were also and in certain countries, the national activities were broadcast over
the national media. Visibility at international level was limited. The IOC participated in the International
waters conference in Cain, Australia and a video clip which comprise of an interview by the sub regional
coordination was posted on line. The IOC had developed information brochure, flags for the
organizations open day and exhibition in 2010. The development of the website was originally not
foreseen in the project but the need for information dissemination has become apparent so as to sensitize

                                                      67
the various stakeholders, general public on the project. It is the tool for communication to a wider public
which needs to be sustained for dissemination of information to sensitization the general public and the
maritime community. Upon project completion the website is expected to serve as the main regional
website for information on maritime navigation and pollution. It is expected that the website will be the
communication tool for the Regional Activity Center or better referred to as Regional Coordination Center
established under the project. Since the RCC is not yet operational, the IOC has taken the decision to
transfer most of the information and data onto its web portal.

            4.6.1        Recommendation
             Communication around the project could have been more active, the implementing
                agencies should have jointly put in effort to communicate more on the project and to
                produce joint communiqués on the activities of the project.
             The RCC in SAMSA should make provision to host the web site or to secure and update
                the information of the website.
             Countries should be encouraged to provide information to update the information on the
                website and the web portal of the IOC.

4.7     Environment Sensitivity Area Maps (ESA)
        The ESA maps is an essential element for the contingency plan, be it at national or regional
        aspect. It is part of the activities implemented through a contract with BRL/OTRA. The maps for
        all the countries have been prepared and these include tactical and, specific strategic maps need
        that are useful for the operation of the national and regional contingency plan and to put in place
        trainings. The maps have been compiled into an Atlas; they have been printed and made
        available in an electronic format for the countries. Hard copies of the map are useful to facilitate
        the planning and execution of operations in cases of emergencies for both at national and
        regional use. These maps would be an essential tool to support and guide the actions of the
        Regional Activity Centre. A set of each of these map are to be made available both to the IOC
        and the RCC.

            4.7.1       Recommendation

               Countries should make provision for continuous update of these maps. The countries
                should made use of the various experts and means available at national level to do so.
                These maps would also serve as a base for the economic valuation of the ecosystem for
                compensation in the event of spills and damage caused not only by oil spill but for other
                type of damages. The SWIOFP in collaboration with the FAO is compiling an electronic
                atlas for the region to show the impact of climate change on fisheries and marine
                biodiversity; these maps should be made available to regional entities as well as the
                UNEP, the secretariat of the Nairobi convention. They will contribute to the monitoring of
                the State of the marine environment.

4.8     Regional Coordination Centre or Regional Activity Centre

    At the project completion date, RCC in South Africa was still not operational. One major constraint
amongst others that have delayed its operations is the fact that no host country agreement between the
Government of South Africa and SAMSA has been signed yet. The Project Steering Committee Meeting
in December 2011 had approved an activity plan together with a budget of $350,000 USD to support the
activities of the centre for the year of 2012. This activity plan was not implemented and one of the major
consequences of this was that the Regional Oil Spill Contingency plan was not tested. However, it was
reported by SAMSA in mid December 2012 that progress has been made towards the signing of the host
agreement by the local authorities. Some amendments had been brought to the original agreement and
the proposed amendments have been brought to the attention of the national Coordinators at the project
completion meeting.

                                                    68
 The RCC was deemed to be the “engine? of the post project completion to keep up the momentum of the
project by organising national and regional activities for the revision, updating and testing of NOSCPs and
ROSCP; organise regular Regional Oil Spill Exercise, regional training and ensure regular technical
information dissemination to all parties.

The conditions for the establishment of the RCC have been met by the project. The concept of the RCC
was to have in the region a multidisciplinary centre to cater for a wider scope of maritime related activities
to coordinate action and respond to major oils spill in the region, to provide guidance and information on
navigation, response to emergency, for search and rescue, response to natural disasters including marine
and costal pollution. The centre should be equip with the basis essential equipments and tool for its
operation amongst which it should be equipped with a regional database on environmental data useful
for navigation, pollution control and a VMS system for information exchange on shipping movement. The
ownership by the region should be encouraged therefore attention should be given to its operational
structure. A light structure could be put in place and provision be made for the establishment of a regional
fund to ensure it sustainability beyond project completion

A call for expression of interest from participating States and an evaluation process were put in place.
The selection and evaluation process was implemented with the assistance of REMPEC, IMO and the
Nairobi Convention. The Sea watch and rescue centre based in SAMSA in South Africa was selected as
the most appropriate centre to host the RCC. In Decemebr2011 at a special steering Committee meeting,
the countries approved the choice of the centre to be set up in South Africa as well as the budget and
activities for the year 2012. Assistance was provided to SAMSA to assess its requirement for the centre to
become operational and a host country agreement to be signed between the government of South Africa
and SAMSA was prepared, reviewed by the participating states and submitted for the signature. The
centre is to date not operational and the country host agreement has not been signed. Despite all the
preparatory work done and the support provide in an effort made for the RCC to become effectively
operational, the project management has encountered a number of administrative challenges in place in
South Africa. Due to the unseen administrative procedure in South Africa, the process has taken more
time than was originally foreseen and to that effect it is very unlikely that the centre will be operational by
the end of 2012. The fund that was earmarked to support the activities of the centre for the year 2012 has
not been utilized and as a result the regional plan has not been tested.

        4.8.1 Recommendation
        The current project has provided the baseline and the essential tools and materials for the start-
        up of the centre and it should have been equipped to allow its operation on a twenty four hourly
        basis. Basic equipment such as telecommunication devices, VMS systems, search and rescue
        equipment and pollution control equipment could be considered to combat operation at open
        seas, international waters.
         The RCC which has been set up in South Africa is yet to become operation.
             SAMSA and the Government of South Africa will need to strengthen their efforts to
                 formalize the status of the centre and to put in place a mechanism for the participating
                 countries to be kept informed and partake in the activities.
             South Africa and SAMSA should seek to mobilize the regional institutions and work with
                 the Nairobi Convention Secretariat, IMO and Indian Ocean Commission to get the
                 commitment and engage the countries more into reporting on the implementation the
                 various protocols in place.
             Countries signatory to the Nairobi Convention has mandate the secretariat to establish a
                 regional activity centre for the convention. In that respect South Africa / the Centre should
                 seek to establish MoU with UNEP/ Nairobi Convention secretariat to collaborate and seek
                 the feasibility of making the centre the regional activity centre for the Convention. The
                 advantage would be to have only one centre of excellence for the region, country will
                 financially contribute to one centre and thus reduce the financial stress on the country’s
                 financial contribution.

                                                      69
4.9     Equipments
        The national centre should have a direct link to the regional centre and a mechanism be put in
        place to allow the mobilisation of resources, personnel and equipments from the national centre
        for regional or bilateral actions. The provision of equipments for national centre was not foreseen
        in the project but assessment conducted at the start of the project has revealed that some
        equipment for combating oil spill provided to the Island states have worn out and need to be
        replaced and in other countries, such need to be provided to ensure that all countries have the
        basic equipment required that could also be mobilized for regional or bilateral actions in the event
        of emergencies. Tier I equipment has been provided for four (4) ports namely , the port of
        Anjouan in Comoros, Beira and Nacala in Mozambique and Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania while
        Tier 11 equipment has been provided to the Port of Maputo in Mozambique and Port Louis in
        Mauritius.

4.10    Capacity development

        Capacity building has been a key element in the project. Training has been provided not only for
        the management of the national plans, but also to assist countries to be more conversant with
        the international laws governing maritime affairs and pollution control. In the present project
        provision was to provide training for one lawyer in Maritime law per country for Kenya, Tanzania
        and Mozambique. More countries have expressed the need to assist in the training of lawyers.
        Face with emerging challenges in the maritime affairs such as oil exploration, piracy issues and
        illegal fishing, amongst others. Training at master degree level was provided for one lawyer from
        the following countries, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, and Tanzania. A training session in
        collaboration with IMO was also conducted for legal advisors in the maritime and environmental
        sectors to enhance their capacity in the understanding of the IMO conventions.


                4.10.1 Recommendation
        Training is an essential component for the sustainability of actions at national level. The project
        provided for training of trainers for the management of the plan.
             Countries should capitalize and make use of trained trainers to continuously train and
                develop capacity at national level.
             Countries should put in place the necessary facilities to retain the trained lawyers
             Due to the high turnover off staff, most countries will still require a certain level of
                capacity building. Support would still be require for ecosystem valuation, management of
                data and handling of hazardous substances.
             Regional efforts should be further mobilised to support continuous capacity building of
                national institutions.

5.0     ASSESSMENT OF CONTRIBUTION OF PARTNERS

The project document indicated that a large number of partners will provide support for implementation of
various activities. The support provided for the implementation of Component B and C has been mainly
been the contribution of France/ Réunion and the secretariat of the Indian Ocean Commission through its
regional projects. These would include projects implemented by the IOC funded by the European Union
and the French GEF.

       5.1          Contribution of the Indian Ocean Commission

                                                    70
It has honoured its commitment by providing in-kind support of office space and office operational costs,
secretarial services, and financial management and accounting services required to maintain the project
accounts according to Bank guidelines and procedures.

        IOC project contributing to attain the object of the project are:
            o Regional project for the sustainable management of the coastal zone (ReCoMaP).
                Activities mainly concerned sensitisation and awareness raising on coastal and marine
                resources working government institutions and NGOs
            o Regional Network of Marine protected areas which provided for some baseline
                information on the mapping of the sensitive areas in the region
            o The regional plan for fisheries surveillance and monitoring in the Islands States,
                members of the IOC. The project provide training in fisheries inspectors, tools for
                fisheries monitoring and conducted joint regional maritime and aerial patrol in the region
                to detect illegal fishing.

        5.2           South African Maritime Safety Authority

SAMSA has served as the Regional Project Management Unit, responsible for overall project
coordination and for implementing components A and D. SAMSA will provide in-kind support of office
space and office operational costs, secretarial services, and financial management services and
accounting services required to maintain the project accounts according to Bank guidelines and
procedures.

        5.3           International Maritime Organization

The mandate of the IMO is to encourage and facilitate the adoption and implementation of the highest
practical standards in matters concerning maritime safety, security, efficiency of navigation, and the
prevention and control of marine pollution from ships. The IMO will contributed to the project by
providing in-kind support and advice through participation as observer in relevant meetings, including the
project steering committee meetings; such contribution to be done taking due account of IMO’s staff
constraints.

IMO provided in-kind support and advice on the regional agreement, regional contingency plan and
regional coordination centre. It provided assistance and organised jointly workshops on IMO conventions
and NHS protocol. :

        5.4           Recipient governments

The governments of the beneficiary countries will provide in-kind resources during project
implementation, specifically they will:

        Support relevant staff out of their own resources to participate in seminars, workshops, and
         training courses.
        Appoint and provide the resources for coordination of activities at the national level, such as an
         office within a ministry of environment or transport.
        Participate in promotional activities and public awareness campaigns and the like aimed at raising
         awareness of the project, its benefits, and the role that the public can play to reduce the risk of
         catastrophic damage from oil and chemical spills.
        Provide support to a regional centre in accordance with agreements made during the
         implementation of the project.

        5.5          France/ Réunion

France Réunion has contributed immensely to the implementation of activities in Comoros and Rodrigues
Island of Mauritius. It has provided its expertise in the revision of the Oil spill plan and training.


                                                    71
6.0     FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

The financial management of the project was undertaken by the finance department of the IOC in
compliance with the procurement procedure of the World Bank. A project manual for the financial
management of the project was put in place at the start of the project to guide the internal procedure. An
auditing firm was contracted to undertake annual auditing of the project account. The expenditures were
recorded in a financial database, SARA and quarterly reports were produce of per the requirement of the
bank. The financial status of the project is indicated in Annex 1.

7.0     SUSTAINABILITY

Most of the activities of the project can be sustain through national budget. The countries have the
necessary know how to revise their national contingency plans, organise national exercised to test their
plans. Madagascar has offered to coordinate and test the regional plan while la Réunion has offered to
provide its services to the countries in the detection of oil spill using satellite images. This will allow
networking of the national centres. The countries will provide updated information on the hot spot areas to
be monitored and details of the contact person of all the national centres. Countries will also build on the
cooperation that exists with other countries such as the USA, South Africa and France for capacity
development.
Although provision has been made by the countries to sustain some activities, they will still require
training for junior staff in various fields and there will also be the need to renew oil spill combat
equipments.

 8.     CONCLUSION

The overall implementation of the project has been satisfactory and the activities carried out in the
countries within the framework of the service contract establish with BRL/OTRA has been well
appreciated. During the implementation phase of the contract, the partnership with IMO was developed
to undertake certain training with regards to the IMO conventions. The involvement of IMO in the project
has allowed for the IOC to develop a long term partnership with this institution through the signing of a
Memorandum of Agreement in 2011. The agreement provides for the two institutions to collaborate in
matters of common interest in the field of specialisation of IMO.
The project has also provided scope for strengthening of the IOC collaboration with the secretariat of the
Nairobi convention to address matters with regards to coastal and marine pollution and for the
enforcement of the marine pollution protocol under this convention.
