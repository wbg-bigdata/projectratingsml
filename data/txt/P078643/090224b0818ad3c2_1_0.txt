                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's medium to long-term global environmental goals are to reduce the risk of ship-based environmental contamination (such as oil spills from groundings and
                         illegal discharges of ballast and bilge waters) and to strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical spill emergencies in the region. The project has
                         three specific global environmental objectives. The first is to ascertain the economic, technical, and institutional feasibility of introducing modern aids to navigation
                         systems in the region, such as an electronically supported marine highway, to guide ships through sensitive areas and to encourage monitoring of the movements and
                         activities of fishing and other vessels operating within countries' territorial waters. The second objective is to support widening the existing regional agreement (June 5,
                         1998) on port state control and implementation of its provisions. The third objective, focusing on Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania, is to reduce risks of
                         environmental damage to beaches, fishing grounds, and other domestic resources from spills of oil and chemicals. This will be achieved by supporting efforts of Kenya,
                         Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania to become part of a regional oil spill response plan, by completing the identification and mapping of environmentally sensitive
                         areas along coasts and sea lanes, and support regional collaboration with the west Indian Ocean island states.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress in the implementation of the project remains satisfactory and December 2012 is the final month as the Project is to close on Dec. 31, 2012. Based on the latest supervision
                         review in October 2012 there remains good progress in implementation and the Global Environmental Objectives of the Grant will be met in accordance with the project objectives.
                         Port state control vessel inspections has reached an all time high of 606 in 2011 well above the target set for the Project of 475. The Marine Highway along the Mozambique Channel
                         has been developed and is now available in Electronic Nautical Charts and has the status of a surveyed corridor available to all vessels. The Regional Cooperation Agreement on
                         Preparedness and Response to Oil, Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution in the Western Indian Ocean has been effective since December 2011 and has been signed by all
                         the participating States. The signature by South Africa of the Host Country Agreement ("HCA") for the Regional Coordination Center for Preparedness and Response to Oil,
                         Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution in the Western Indian Ocean (“the Center?) to be hosted by SAMSA is pending. All other participating countries have pledged to sign
                         the HCA after South Africa signs. Project disbursements are in accordance with projections and the balance of the Grant will go unused, reflecting greater than expected
                         contributions in kind from the participating States and global institutions received by the project, however all project objectives will be met. All contracts including the Automatic
                         Information Stations (AIS), navigation aids, port surveys, technical assistance are either completed or under advanced implementation. The Grant received from the European Space
                         Agency (ESA) produced breakthrough earth observation products for the Mozambique Channel in support of Project activities including: (i) oil spill detection in real time, and (ii) coral
                         reef monitoring.

                         The Project has introduced innovative technology to detect oil spills in real time. With funding from the European Space Agency, a product was developed to detect oil spills and
                         identify polluters in real time, using radar satellite images to detect oil slicks on the sea-surface and matching them with Sat-AIS data to identify potential polluters. The application
                         was developed based on several years of research by ESA and this was a first opportunity to combine oil spill detection and satellite AIS to identify the potential polluters anywhere.
                         Over the course of 5 months the monitoring included 117 satellite images spread over the Project Area which covered 17.5 million km2, identifying 38 oil spills (of which 23 were
                         confirmed oil spills and 15 with features of interest), a monitoring that is unprecedented in the Western Indian Ocean. The frequency of occurrence, which is higher than anticipated,
                         was 32% per image or 2.2 spills detected per million km2 covered. Six potential polluters were identified and Port State Control was activated by the participating countries. The
                         distribution was: Comoros 3, Kenya 1, La Réunion 2, Mauritius 4, Mozambique 6, Seychelles 1, and South Africa 6. Some of the spills were significant in length (i.e., min 1.5 km and
                         max 144 km) with a mean value of 21 km and median value of 10 km. The observed time between the satellite pass and notification had a median of 70 minutes and a mean of 135
                         minutes; these values are expected to be significantly reduced with the recent opening of a radar satellite antenna in La Reunion. The user feedback was extremely positive since for
                         the first time, the issue of oil spill occurrence was assessed on a regional scale and found to be significant. The Product also allowed the monitoring of a ship wreck which happened
                         in Mauritius on August 30, 2011 with high resolution imagery.

                         The Government of South Africa ratified the Agreement on the Regional Contingency Plan for preparedness for and response to major marine pollution incidents in the Western
                         Indian Ocean, the last of the eight participating countries to do so.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A survey of the ‘route’ through the Mozambique Channel was carried out by the Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine (SHOM) in July 2010, as per the Project
                         Implementation Plan and in accordance with international standards, including additional routes to the port of Mahajanga (Madagascar). This data was made available to all coastal
                         States involved in the Project and with their permission the data was forwarded to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) and was included since December 2010 in both
                         small scale and large-scale charts and electronic nautical navigation charts of the region.

                         Procurement was completed for the Aids to Navigation and Automatic Information Stations (AIS). The AIS contract is well underway. The acceptance test were done for all
                         equipment at the beginning of October, and the equipment will be shipped before October 15, 2012. The installation program will end in Mozambique on Dec. 17th. One main
                         contract remains under implementation. The Aldabra Lighthouse is installed and operational since December 16, 2012.
