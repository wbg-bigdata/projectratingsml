                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's medium to long-term global environmental goals are to reduce the risk of ship-based environmental contamination (such as oil spills from groundings and
                         illegal discharges of ballast and bilge waters) and to strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical spill emergencies in the region. The project has
                         three specific global environmental objectives. The first is to ascertain the economic, technical, and institutional feasibility of introducing modern aids to navigation
                         systems in the region, such as an electronically supported marine highway, to guide ships through sensitive areas and to encourage monitoring of the movements and
                         activities of fishing and other vessels operating within countries' territorial waters. The second objective is to support widening the existing regional agreement (June 5,
                         1998) on port state control and implementation of its provisions. The third objective, focusing on Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania, is to reduce risks of
                         environmental damage to beaches, fishing grounds, and other domestic resources from spills of oil and chemicals. This will be achieved by supporting efforts of Kenya,
                         Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania to become part of a regional oil spill response plan, by completing the identification and mapping of environmentally sensitive
                         areas along coasts and sea lanes, and support regional collaboration with the west Indian Ocean island states.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation remains satisfactory and is now entering its last six months as the Project is expected to close on Dec. 31, 2012. Based on the latest supervision review the
                         Development Objectives of the Grant continue to be met in accordance with the project objectives. Port state control vessel inspections has reached an all time high of 606 in 2011
                         well above the target set for the Project of 475. The Marine Highway along the Mozambique Channel has been developed and is now available in Electronic Nautical Charts and has
                         the status of a surveyed corridor available to all vessels. The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Preparedness and Response to Oil, Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution
                         in the Western Indian Ocean is effective since December 2011 and has been signed by 7 of the participating States. The signature by South Africa of the Host Country Agreement
                         ("HCA") for the Regional Coordination Center for Preparedness and Response to Oil, Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution in the Western Indian Ocean (“the Center?) to be
                         hosted by SAMSA is pending. All other participating countries have pledged to sign the HCA after South Africa signs. Project disbursements are in accordance with projections and a
                         balance of the Grant will probably go unutilized since greater than expected contributions in kind by participating States and global institutions have been received by the project. All
                         contracts including the Automatic Information Stations (AIS), navigation aids, port surveys, technical assistance are either completed or under advanced implementation. The Grant
                         received from the European Space Agency (ESA) produced breakthrough earth observation products for the Mozambique Channel in support of Project activities including: (i) oil spill
                         detection in real time, and (ii) coral reef monitoring. The Project is evaluating the possibility of extending the earth observation activities with Project resources. The IOC has
                         requested a small reallocation within disbursement categories.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Regarding the development of the marine highway along the Mozambique Channel after the publication of the electronic nautical charts of the "surveyed corridor" the Project
                         submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) the proposal for approval of a Voluntary Marine Route. The initial review meetings were recently held in London and a final
                         review will take place in June 2013. The application process was led by SAMSA and DOT from South Africa, alongside the Governments of the participating States.

                         Procurement was completed for the Aids to Navigation and Automatic Information Stations (AIS). The final training events on hydrographic and port state control training are being
                         scheduled for the second semester of 2012.

                         Environmental consulting services (components B,C and D) with M/s BRLi/OTRA are being wrapped up with major events in each country including full scale exercises for oil and
                         chemical spill controls. Working groups in all countries are concluding the work related to national level training activities for National Oil/Chemical Spill Contingency (NOSC) Plans,
                         preparation of Environmentally Sensitive AreaMaps (ESA), and policies for the use of dispersants.
