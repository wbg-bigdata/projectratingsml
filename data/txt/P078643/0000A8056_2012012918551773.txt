                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's medium to long-term global environmental goals are to reduce the risk of ship-based environmental contamination (such as oil spills from
                         groundings and illegal discharges of ballast and bilge waters) and to strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical spill emergencies in the
                         region. The project has three specific global environmental objectives. The first is to ascertain the economic, technical, and institutional feasibility of
                         introducing modern aids to navigation systems in the region, such as an electronically supported marine highway, to guide ships through sensitive areas and to
                         encourage monitoring of the movements and activities of fishing and other vessels operating within countries' territorial waters. The second objective is to
                         support widening the existing regional agreement (June 5, 1998) on port state control and implementation of its provisions. The third objective, focusing on
                         Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania, is to reduce risks of environmental damage to beaches, fishing grounds, and other domestic resources from
                         spills of oil and chemicals. This will be achieved by supporting efforts of Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania to become part of a regional oil spill
                         response plan, by completing the identification and mapping of environmentally sensitive areas along coasts and sea lanes, and support regional collaboration
                         with the west Indian Ocean island states.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is satisfactory. Development objectives of the Grant are being met in accordance with the project objectives. An important milestone was achieved during the
                         Project Steering Committee Meeting which took place Dec. 13 and 14, 2011 in Cape Town with the signature by Tanzania as the 7th country of the Regional Cooperation Agreement
                         (the agreement is already effective after the 6th signature with effect from 26 November 2011 ). Also, agreement was reached by delegates on the text of the Host Country
                         Agreement ("HCA") for the Regional Coordination Center for Preparedness and Response to Oil, Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution in the Western Indian Ocean (“the
                         Center?) to be hosted by SAMSA in South Africa. Once South Africa signs all other participating countries have pledged to sign the HCA thereafter. Project disbursements are in
                         accordance with projections but a disbursement delay is expected during the first quarter of 2012 since the procurement for the Automatic Information Stations (AIS) is delayed and
                         will require re-bidding. The Grant received from the European Space Agency (ESA) has produced two earth observation products for the Mozambique Channel in support of Project
                         activities including: (i) oil spill detection in real time, and (ii) coral reef monitoring.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         All the decisions reached at the Mid term Review were followed and implemented during 2011.

                         Regarding the development of the marine highway along the Mozambique Channel after the publication of the electronic nautical charts of the "surveyed corridor" the Project has now
                         finalized the formal documents for submission to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for approval of a Voluntary Marine Route. The application process to be championed
                         by SAMSA and DOT from South Africa, alongside the Government of Mozambique entails the following: (1) finalize routing application by South Africa (SAMSA and DOT) and
                         Mozambique by January 1, 2011 (complete), (2) brief South Africa’s permanent representative at IMO about process being followed, (3) submit signed hardcopy of routing application
                         with all necessary data to the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) and Navigation Subcommittee (NAV) of IMO in London on or before Feb. 7, 2012, and (4)              NAV sub-
                         Committee deliberations May 16-25, 2012, and MSC sub-Committee deliberations July 2-6, 2012.

                         Following the recommendations of the hydrographic consultants, procurement has been started for the Aids to Navigation and Automatic Information Stations (AIS). The AIS will be
                         re-bid. Major training events on hydrographic and port state control training will take place again in 2012.
