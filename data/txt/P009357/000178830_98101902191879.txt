INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR A
NORTHWEST REGION TUBEWELLS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and reconmendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $14 million
to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on standard IDA terms, to help finance
the completion of the Northwest Region Tubewells project. This credit would
replace a US $14 million development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
of June 1970 (Credit No. 208-PAX, which would be cancelled) on the basis set
out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of my Report and Recommendation to the Executive
Directors dated September 15, 1972 on the Second Chandpur Irrigation Project
(IDA/R72-77).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The findings of an economic mission which visited Bangladesh in
July and August 1972 are summarized in Part I of my Report referred to above.
A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
3.        The operations of the Bank Group in Bangladesh are described in
Part II of my Report referred to above. Annex I lists a Bank loan and IDA
credits for projects wholly in the present territory of Bangladesh.
PART III - THE PROJECT
4..       The food requirements of Bangladesh are increasing under its growing
population pressure. Appropriately, the overriding priority in the Govern-
ment's economic policy is to reduce the country's dependency on food imports
and provide gainful employment in the rural areas; since 1965, the Bank
Group has been making various studies and preparing investment programs with
this objective. Completion of the proposed tubewells project will permit
the irrigation of large areas of good paddy land which cannot be irrigated
by surface water. Tubewells can be drilled relatively quickly over wide
areas, thereby benefiting farmers on a wide geographical basis. In 1969,'
the Government launched a major five-year tubewell development program under
which about 21,000 tubewells were to be drilled,including the 3-,000 provided
for under Credit No. 208-PAK. By 1970/71 a total of about 1,500 tubewells
had been drilled, irrigating about 200,000 acres of land.
5.        In June 1970 the Association made a credit of US $14 million
(Credit No. 208-PAK) for this tubewell project jointly with Sweden, which
provided US $6 million equivalent (R70-108).; Simultaneously, Canada'made
a parallel loan of about US $6.5 million equivalent to finance the purchase
of fiberglass screens and casings for the tubewells. The project was de-
signed to irrigate about 180,000 acres of farm land and provide technical



-2-
assistance together with essential improvements in agricultural supporting
services. Specific project works included the drilling of about 3,000
diesel-powered tubewells each with a capacity of two cubic feet per second,
earth distribution channels to be built by farmers' cooperatives, and three
field trial and demonstration farms.
6.        The events of 1971 delayed implementation of the project but the
consultants continued to provide the necessary technical assistance. When
disbursements were suspended from the IDA credit on December 29, 1971, and
from the Swedish credit on February 1, 1972, no contracts had been awarded
under the project. By September of this year, the bidding process had been
repeated and the bids received are currently being evaluated.  In the mean-
time, sites for the proposed wells are being selected and it isfexpected that
enough sites will be approved to ensure that the drilling schedule for the,
1972/73 season can be realized. Early this year the Government of Bangladesh
requested financial assistance to complete the project. In response to this
request, Canada converted its previous credit to a grant in the reduced
amount of US $6 million equivalent, while, in consultation with Sweden, the
Association sent- a mission to Bangladesh in May 1972 to reappraise the pro-
ject. A technical note dated October 4, 1972 describing the findings of the
mission is attached as Annex III. The proposed project is among the high-
priority formerly IDA-supported projects for which Sweden is providing
interim financing (R72-74).
7.        The proposed project would remain fundamentally the same as that
financed under Credit No. 208-PAK, with the following modifications- which
have been agreed with the Government: (i) to increase production as soon
as possible, the area for tubewell site selection has been reduced from
about 5,800 square miles to about 3,800 square miles; (ii) under the ex-
perimental tubewells program, small as well as large wells will be tested;
(iii) the agricultural support program in the project area will employ the
"Comilla" approach to agricultural extension which has proved successful so
far in Bangladesh; and (iv) because of cor.tinuing flooding behind the
Brahmaputra right embankment and the lack of maintenance leading to breach-
ing of the embankment during the recent civil war, provision has been made
under the proposed project to (a) undertake a study of the drainage conditions
of the area, and (b) purchase vehicles and other equipment needed for the
repairs and continuing maintenance of the embankment. As originally en-
visaged, the project will be executed by the Agricultural Development
Corporation (ADC) in conjunction with the Ministries of Agriculture and Local
Government, and the repairs to) and study of drainage conditions behind; the
Brahmaputra right embankment will be executed by the Bangladesh Water Develop-
ment Board (BWDB).
8.         The total cost of the project, net of duties and taxes, is estimated
at US $40.9 million equivalent expre9sed in current dollars, including about
US $23.1 million (56.5 percent) in foreign exchange. As defined under Credit
No. 208-PAK, the project was to have cost a total of US $44.6 million equivalent
in 1970 US dollars (which, in current dollars, would amount to US $48.5 million)
including about US $22.8 million (51 percent) in foreign exchange. There is
thus a reduction in the estimated cost of the project of some 16 percent which
is due to the devaluation of the Bangladesh currency, and a reduction in the
consultant services.  When disbursements under Credit No. 208-PAK were suspended,
expenditures incurred for the project totalled about US $210,000 equivalent in
foreign exchange, of which about US $171,000 equivalent had been disbursed from
the joint IDA/SIDA credits.



-3-
9.        The proposed joint IDA-Swedish credits would finance:  (i) pre-
payment of amounts previously disbursed under Credit No. 208-PAK (about
US $118,000) and under the original Swedish credit (about US $53,000 equiva-
lent); (ii) unpaid project expenditures incurred in 1971 representing
amounts owing to consultants (about US $100,000); (iii) reimbursement to
Sweden of the portion of Sweden's interim credit that will actually have
been disbursed for the project by the time the Association's credit becomes
effective; and (iv) 100 percent of the foreign exchange expenditure and
about 17 percent of the local currency expenditure to complete the project.
The effectiveness of the IDA and Swedish credits would be conditional on
each other. Together with the Canadian grant, the credits would contribute
about 65 percent of the total cost. The corresponding figure under Credit
No. 208-PAK was 60 percent. Procurement procedures would remain the same as
they were under Credit No. 208-PAK, with contracts for well drilling and the
supply of pumps, engines, vehicles, and miscellaneous equipment subject to
international competitive bidding. Local contractors are expected to win
some of the civil works contracts.
10.       The proposed project is sound and economically justified, promising
an economic rate of return estimated at about 18 percent, with labor valued
at 50 percent of financial cost for farm wages, and foreign exchange valued
at the official exchange rate. With all farm labor valued at 100 percent
of the financial cost for farm wages,,and foreign exchange valued at the
official exchange rate, the economic rate of return of the project would
be 10.7 percent. The Northwest region of Bangladesh has the highest poten-
tial of any region in the country for rapid agricultural expansion. At
full development (seven years after well drilling), current farm production
will triple, compared with its doubling without the project. The project
will also provide knowledge useful for future tubewell development in the
country.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
11.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic
of Bangladesh and the Association, the draft Joint Financing Agreement among
the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Associa-
tion, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The provisions of the draft agreements conform substantially to the provisions
of the prior Development Credit and Joint Financing Agreement with the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan. Special provision is made in Schedule 1, paragraphs 7
and 8 of the Joint Financing Agreement for repayment of amounts disbursed
under the original and interim Swedish credits and Development Credit No.
208-PAK. I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
12.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the'proposed
Development Credit.

BANGLADESH
TECHNICAL NOTE
ON
NORTHWEST REGION TUBEWELLS PROJECT
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        This technical note is based on findings of a mission which
visited Bangladesh from May, 15 to June 3, 1972, to reappraise the Northwest
Region Tubewells Project M . The Project was originally appraised in late
1969 and a joint credit with the Swedish International Development Autho-
rity (SIDA) was signed in June 1970 (208-PAK; IDA US$14.0 million, SIDA
US$6.0 million). At the same time, a parallel credit of us$6.5 million
was negotiated with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).
Project execution was interrupted by the conflict in 1971. In December
1971, disbursements under the joint IDA/SIDA credit were suspended. In
early 1972, with the emergence of-Banglades h, the CIDA credit was cancelled
and a grant of us$6.0 million equivalent 2/ was given to Bangladesh as part
of Canadian rehabilitation assistance. In June 1972, the Government of Bangla-
desh included the Project among the ongoing development projects for which
Sweden provided interim financial assistance. Bangladesh has now requested
a new IDA credit of US$14 million for the Project. SIDA would provide joint
financing of us$6.0 million equivalent as before, and the IDA/SIDA credit
would complement the CIDA grant.
B. BACKGROUND
2.        Bangladesh, with a population of about 75 million growing at an
annual rate of some 3%, already has one of the highest population densities
in the world. At least 80% of the population is dependent on agriculture,
mainly the cultivation of rice and jute. The unsettled conditions during
the past year have imposed an almost total hiatus on the country's economy.
Rapid progress in agricultural production is crucial to help compensate for
losses during the disturbances and to keep abreast of population growth.
The Government has adopted a new policy for land and water use, with emphasis
on quick-yielding-and widespread development activities. The Northwest
Region Tubewells Project fits in well with this new strategy.
3.        Groundwater is a major untapped resource of Bangladesh agriculture.
Over much of the country, there are aquifers suitable for pumping, and the
recharge is high. Tubewell development would pennit irrigation of large
areas of good paddy land which cannot be served by surface supplies. In
1/ Mission headed by R. Picciotto and including S.V. Allison and U Hpu of IDA.
Y/ Amount reduced from US;6.5 million to US$6.0 million equivalent to reflect
realized contract price for Canadian-supplied well components.



-2-
1970/71, there were about 1 ,500 irrigation wells in operation, irrigating
about 200,000 ac. Of these; 385 were installed by the Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) during the early sixties at Thakurgaon in
Dinajpur District. The remainder are scattered wells installed by the
Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) since 1967. About 500 of these
are in the Northwest Region. Current plans call for the construction of
another 21,000. In addition to the 3,000 to be drilled in the Northwest
Region under this Project, 5,000 are being constructed in the Central Region
under a U.K. suppliers' credit, 1,000 are expected to be installed under a
Yugoslav suppliers' credit, and ADC proposes to install 2,000 wells through
force account or local contractors.  Arrangements are being made for con-
struction of the remaining 10,000.
C. THE PROJECT
4.        The Project would provide irrigation on about 180,000 ac of a
gross area covering some 9,400 sq mi in the Northwest Region of Bangladesh,
together with technical assistance and essential improvements in supporting
services for agricu'ltrual development. The Project would be executed by
the Agricultul5l Development Corporation (ADC) under the Thana Irrigation
Program (TIP) 'I. Supporting services to the Project would be provided by
the Ministries of Agriculture and of Local Government, Rural Development
and Cooperstives.  Project works include about 3,000 diesel-powered 2-cusec
tubewells with a service area of about 60 ac each,'unlined earth distribution
systems to be built by farmers, and two field trial and demonstration farms.
Project History and Status
5.        An association of two firms, Sir M. MacDonald and Partners and
Hunting Technical Services, was retained in August 1970 as consultants to
ADC for the Project. The consultants have: (a) reviewed previous ground-
water development and planning studies of the Project area; (b) finalized
siting criteria and prepared a manual on well site selection; (c) prepared
a design report on optimum depths for Project wells; (d) prepared designs,
drawings, specifi'cations and contract documents, and (e) prepared criteria
and admiinistered a prequalification exercise for drilling contractors.
6.        Well drilling contractors were prequalified in November 1970 and
bids received in September 1971. The delay was due to the disturbed condi-
tions in Bangladesh at that time. The few bids received were very high,
reflecting the risks involved. Since independence, the documents have been
updated and the prequalification exercise repeated. Bids for the construc-
tion of wells were opened on September 1, and those for the supply of pumps
and engines on September 2, 1972, and are being evaluated by ADC and Project
consultants. Details on the status of procurement activities appear below
(para 26).
1/ The TIP operates through local Union and Thana Committees. It provides
organized groups of farmers with rented tubewells and portable pumps.



3-
7.       Throughout 1971, preparatory work on the agricultural support
program was delayed due to a combination of unsettled security, delays by
the Government in agreeing on an approach to agricultural extension, and
inadequate liaison between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Planning
Commission. Security in the rural areas has now been re-established, and
the Government has formulated and is implementing an agreed agricultural
extension policy (para 14). Under the new credit the Goverrment would
prepare and approve, by November 30, 1972, the standard budget control
documents (Form PC-1), assuring required Government financing for the
Project.
8.       Well site selection has been proceeding on the basis of a
manual prepared by the consultants. Site selection committees have been
established in all districts included in the Project, applications from
about 2,000 potential cooperative groups have been received, and enough
sites are in the process of evaluation that sites for all construction
in the first construction season are assured.
9.        The principal foreign exchange cost incurred before December 1971
was about US$210,000 equivalent for consulting fees. Of this amount,
US$170,000 equivalent was disbursed from the IDA/SIDA credit. The consultants
are seeking approval for disbursement of the remainder for services performed
from October through December, 1971. Between January and June, 1972, a fur-
ther US$66,000 equivalent of consulting fees was incurred. Against this, some
US$28,000 has been disbursed to date, from a total of US$4.7 million equiva-
lent allocated to this Project under the Swedish interim financing arrange-
ment (para 1).
Project Reappraisal
10.       The Project would remain fundamentally the same as provided for
under Credit 208-PAK (Appraisal Report PA-49a dated June 9, 1970). However,
certain lessons have been gained since the Project was originally appraised.
These have led to the following modifications which have been discussed and
agreed with the Government: (a) reduction of the gross project area from
about 10,600 sq mi to about 9,400 sq mi, and within the gross area, reduction
of the area for tubewell site selection from about 5,800 sq mi to about 3,800
sq mi; (b) modification of the experimental tubewell program to test smaller
as well as larger than 2-cusec wells;  (c) modification of the agricultural
support program to fit the new Government's agricultural development policies;
(d) inclusion of a study of drainage and water supply for irrigation in the
area partially protected by the IDA-financed Brabmaputra Right Embankment
(Credit 39-PAK, 1963)(para 18); and (e) provision of vehicles and other
equipment required for the repair of the embankment (para 18).
11.       Project Area. The Project wells would be scattered over some
9,400 sq mi gross area in the Northwest Region (see map). With the objec-
tive of achieving the quickest possible production results, the new area
for tubewell site selection was chosen on the basis of analyses, conducted
since the original appraisal, of soils, topography, depth of flooding, and
expected yields from irrigatecl agriculture. In particular, the new area



- 4 -
excludes more than 400 sq mi in Pabna and Rajshahi Districts subject to
excessive flooding. On the; other hand, it includes some additional areas
with high production potential in Pabna, Dinajpur and Rangpur Districts,
and reflects refinements within the gross area based on new soils analyses!X
Also, about 1 ,000 sq mi of the original gross area in northern 1ymensingh
District has been excluded because another tubewell project, financed under
a U.K. suppliers' credit, is being executed in this area. This last exclu-
sion has the additional advantage of concentrating tubewell construction
under the proposed Project in a more manageable area.
12.       Despite the reduced area, the number of tubewells would remain
unchanged and tubewell siting would continue to be "extensive"; wells would
still Ibe about 1-1/4 mi apart, as in the original project, with the possi-
bility of intermediate siting of wells in later projects. Recent analyses
of groundwater hydrology  / confirm that the potential groundwater recharge
is adequate to support full irrigation development of the Northwest Region,
with average tubewell spacing of less than 1-1/4 mi.
13.       Agricultural Support Program. The Project will be less complex
agriculturally than originally planned. First, well site,pelection will
be directed towards two instead of three main soil types _.  Second, in
accordance with the Govervnent's food self-sufficiency efforts, rice will
now be the principal crop; there will be no major move toward crop diver-
sification in the immediate future. Because of this reduced-complexity,
and because Bangalee experts are available to assist with project imple-
mentation, the need for expatriate agricultural consultants has been
reduced. Also, the composition of consultant services has been adjusted
to reflect latest knowledge of the agriculture sector. Specifically, a
trained Bangalee agricultural economist has been made available to assist
the chief agriculturist in the Project office, so an expatriate agricul-
tural economist is no longer needed. Second, a single foreign irrigation
agronomist, rather than three, will be sufficient to advise on setting up
and operating the two field trial farms, because of reduced farm size
(para 16) and the recent availability of two Bangalee irrigation agrono-
mists. Finally, at the request of the Government, a plant protection
specialist has been added to the consultant team because of the increased
importance of Jest control with the expected increased crop yields in the
Project area _

14.       After discussion with the Government, the original concept of
agricultural extension in the Project area, which would have required
600 additional union level extension workers, was modified. This change
follows the "Comilla approach" to extension, where "model farmers" visit
the thana headquarters to obtain and then disseminate latest information
and techniques, rather than rely solely upon agricultural extension workers
at the union level. Funds for training these model farmers, who are members
of the low-lift pump and tubewell irrigation groups, are provided in the
TIP. In addition, since most incumbent District and Thana Agricultural
Officers (DAO's and TAO's) have little or no experience with irrigated
agriculture, the agricultural support program will provide additional
training and personnel to deal mainly with irrigated agriculture in the
Project area.
15.       The Government has agreed to make immediate arrangements to train
DAO's and TAOts at the Gaibanda Agricultural Training Institute in Rangpur
District in the Project area, and at the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Deve-
lopment at Comilla. Officers from ADC, the Bangladesh Water Development
Board (BWDB) and the Directorates of Soil Survey, Agricultural Extension
and dooperatives, as well as Project consultants, wm ld assist in the
training program. The consultant team includes training specialists to
organize courses, produce training materials, and advise upon training
methods and course content. Training would cover identification of tube-
well sites according to soil suitability, operation and maintenance of
project works and, for agricultural staff, field irrigation techniques and
crop production with irrigation and pest control. Under the new credit the
Government would prepare a Training Program for Project staff and send it to
IDA for review by January 31, 1973.
16.       The field trial and demonstration farms have been reduced from
three of 50 ac each to two of 25 ac each. This reflects the reduction from
three to two different soil types (para 13), and the scarcity and fragmen-
tation of cultivable land in the Project area. The farms will be established
on existing Government farms in the Project area, thereby avoiding the prob-
lem of acquiring agricultural land in a country where 25 ac may represent
the livelihood of 15-20 families.
17.       Experimental Tubewells.  As before, the Project would include
funds to construct tubewells of capacities other than 2 cusecs, together
with improved distribution systems, to investigate the feasibility of using
such wells and systems in the fature. A number of technical problems must
be investigated. In many areas, depth to groundwater at critical times of
the year exceeds the suction lift capability of available low cost centri-
fugal pumps. Installation of the pump in a pit is not always practical due
to flash floods and the rapid rise of water levels. The use of propeller
pumps might solve this problem. Other major technical areas which require
experimentation are: (a) the use of low cost materials such as plastic
for wellscreens and casings; (b) the development of methods to cut slots
in screens so fine that a well does not have to be gravel packed; and
(c) the use of jetting with water instead of drilling to install screens
and casings. Although it can be shown that the unit cost of water is lower
(at any given level of technology) for bigger wells, economies of scale are
often offset by diseconomies due to inefficient use of larger quantities of
water. Under the Project, small as well as large wells would be tested.



-6-
18.     Brahmaputra Right Embankment Study and Repairs. A 135 mi long,
12 ft high embankment along the right (West) bank of the Brahmaputra in the
Northwest Region was completed in 1968 with IDA financial assistance. The
embankment was designed to provide flood protection to the area behind it,
amounting to about ten percent of the Northwest Region Tubewells Project
area. The findings of a Review Mission in September 1972 were that, in
spite of minor negative effects due to the exclusion of flood waters, the
initial effectiveness of the embankment was high. Four years after comp-
letion, however, the embankment has been breached in several places.
Normal maintenance activities were prevented by the disturbances of 1971,
and many items of maintenance equipment were damaged or destroyed. The
1972 monsoon has been light and stop-gap measures have sufficed to prevent
flow through the major breaches. However, for future floods even slightly
above normal, the consequences in the protected area could be extremely
serious. Drilling tubewells in this area will certainly have'to be res-
tricted until repairs are complete. For these reasons the project was
modified slightly to include:
(a)  the replacement of vehicles and imported equipment urgently
required for the embankment repair and maintenance program
of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). (The costs
of this repair work would be borne by the Government of Bangla-
desh from funds already allocated for this purpose, and would
not be included under the present project.)
(b)  A study of drainage conditions and water supply for irriga-
ti6n in the protected area. This study woild be executed
by BWDB and would cover the cause and seasonal pattern of
flooding, drainage requirements by gravity and/or pumping
and methods and phasing of water development for irrigation
as required to complement the effects of improved flood
protection and drainage. A consulting hydrologist or
hydraulic engineer acceptable to the Association would be
employed by BWDB to coordinate and supervise the study.
D. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
19.     Project Costs.  Because ofinflation and war-related economic
disraptions since the originai appraisal, the estimated total Project
cost including foreign exchange, net of duties and taxes, has increased
by about 40% from Tk 212.0 million to Tk 297.4 million. The estimated
local currency requirement has increasea from Tk 103.8 million to
Tk 129.5 million. Most of this increase is due to an estimated 25%
increase in local tubewell construction costs from Tk 68.0 million to
Tk 84.8 million.
20.     In dollar terms, total project costs are estimated at US$40.9
million equivalent expressed in current US dollars, net of duties and
taxes, of which foreign exchange is US$23.1 million equivalent. In the



-7-
original appraisal, estimated total costs in 1970 US dollars were $44.6
million (which, in current US dollars, would amount to $48.5 million)
and foreign exchange costs US$22.8 million. There is thus a reduction
in the total estimated dollar costs of about 16% for two main causes.
First, although local costs for well construction are 25% above previous
estimates, the foreign exchange equivalent of these costs is reduced from
US$1 4.3 million to US$11.7 million equivalent because of the 53% devaluation
which followed independence. Second, the estimate for foreign consultant
services was reduced because of the reduction in scope of agricultural con-
sulting services (para 13). New cost estimates are summarized as follows:

21.       These estimates are based on current contract unit rates in Bangladesh,
and assume that local drillers will win contracts for the construction of 900
wells. Estimates for fiberglass well components are based on actual contracts
awarded for this project, so no contingency allowance is required for this item.
Because well construction operations of this magnitude are unprecedented in Bangla-
desh, 25% of the civil works cost has been allowed for contingencies. Costs for
manufacture and supply of mechanical equipment (pumps and engines) are better
known, so that 15% has been allowed for contingencies on this item. There is no

to the Brahmaputra Right Embanlment would be completed during the 1972/73.
and 1973/74 construction seasons, so that tubewell siting and construction
in the protected area could proceed during the two remaining construction
seasons.
E. PROCUREMENT
26.       Procurement procedures would remain as for Credit 208-PAK.
Contracts for well construction and supply of pumps, engines, vehicles
and miscellaneous equipment are subject to international competitive
bidding. Final designs and contract documents have been prepared and
approved by IDA for 5 contracts: ADC/1 - Supply of wellscreens and
casings; ADC/2 - Tubewell construction; ADC/3 - Supply of pumps and
engines; ADC/4 - Transport of pumps, engines and wellscreens from port
of entry to Project area; ADC/5 - Supply of miscellaneous equipment and
vehicles. The status of procurement is as follows:
(a)  Contract ADC/l, in the amount of us$6.0 million equivalent,
was let by ADC under CIDA parallel financing, following
competitive bidding am'ong Canadian manufacturers. Manufac-
ture is in'progress and about a quarter of the total
required quantity is complete and ready for shipment.
(b) Contract ADC/2 required prequalification of well drilling
contractors. This process was completed initially in 1971,
but had to be repeated following independence. The second
round was completed in June 1972, with a total of 22 firms
judged to be qualified (6 local, 3 joint ventures local/
foreign, and 13 foreign). This is considered to be a good
response and should ensure adequate competition among all
bidders. The project has been subdivided into 10 contract
units of 300 wells each (see map). The capacity of each
contractor seeking prequalification was assessed in terms
of the number of contract units he would be able to com-
plete within four construction seasons. This procedure
was designed to provide maximum opportunity for partici-
pation of small but capable local well drillers. Bids
were opened on September 1, 1972 and are being evaluated
by ADC and Project consultants.
(c)  Contract ADC/3, for-the supply of mechanical equipment
(engines, right angle gear drives and deepwell turbine
pumps) attracted widespread interest. Over 100 manufac-
turers or agents from around the world have taken contract
documents for the supply of the full 3,000 units. Bids
were opened on September 2, 1972 and are being evaluated
by ADC and Project consultants.
(d)- Contracts ADC/4 and ADC/5 will be let after contracts on
major project components have been awarded.

F. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
27.       The Northwest has the highest potential of any region in the
country for rapid agricultural development and expansion of food supply.
A large part of the region consists of high land suitable for conversion
to IRRI aman varieti'e`s, even without irrigation. Much of this land,
except on the Barind Tract (about one-third of the Project area), could
also produce a broadca'st IRRI aus crop without irrigation, to r,eplace
local a,us varieties.  Groundwater is readily available for irrigation
throughout the Region." Although irrigation would make IRRI aman produc-
-tion mre s.,ecure in dy years, the major purpose of irrigation, ,would be
t,o enable ,,tiya,t,iqnf , ,econ4 trannsplante,d rice crop'i,n,.thp dry .eea-
son.'"T,his would'b'e especially benefi'cial o,n the Barind', the gr&,>e,ter part
of which, produces only a single amnan crop at present.  On the floosdplains
irrigation would provide lesser -- though still important -- benefits,
since IRRI boro or transplanted aus would be substituted for existing
broadcast aus and jute. With irrigation, boro or transplanted auis could
-be grown on'all excep;t the most permeable ridge soils.  On permeable ridge
soils, a wide range of dryland wirnter crops could be produced.
28.       The quantifiable benefit from the Project would be an increase
in annual farm production with the Project at full development. (seven years
after tubewell construction) to about three times present levels, and double
that of the level that could be achieved by growing IRRI rice with inputs
but without irrigation. Compared to "inputs only"'conditions, the Project
would produce an additional 200,000 lg tons of rice annually (300,000 lg
tons of paddy), and reduce the need for imports by that amount. This would
mean an annual saving of some US$22 million equivalent in foreign exchange.
The Project would raise farm incomes, improve living standards in the area,
and enable farmers to expand both yield and cropping intensities through
larger and more certain supplies of irrigation water.
29.       The economic rate of return on the Project is expectpd to be
about 18%,'with foreign exchange valued at the official exchange rate of
Tk 7.28   US$1.00. With foreign exchange valued at a shadow, r;.te 50%
higher than the official rate (i.e. 'Tk 11 = Us$1.00), the rate, of return
would be about 26%. Because of seriousiunemployment and underemployment,
the economic value of unskilled farm, labor is considerably less than its
financial cost. Therefore, the base analysis was made with hired labor
(which approximates 50% of the total labor input) valued at full financial
cost and farm family labor valued at zero, since there are no,alternative
employment opportunities.  Thus, in effect, the total inpu,t of farm labor
is valued at 50% bf the financial Cost of fanm wages. With fann.family
labor valued at the sazme rate as hired labor the rates of return would
fall to 10.7% at the official rate of exchange and 21.9% at the rate of
Tk 11 = US$1.00.



G. RECOMMENDATIONS
30.       It is recommended that a development credit of US$14 million
equivalent be made to the Government of Bangladesh for the Northwest Region
Tubewells Project.
31.       Most of the conditions of Credit 208-PAK would still be applicable.
The following conditions have been reaffirmed by the Government:
(a)  ADC, the Ministries of Agriculture, Local Government, Rural
Development and Cooperatives and consultants would collaborate
in designing distribution systems and guiding farmers in their
construction. The constitution of the irrigation groups would
require that members construct a distribution system in accor-
dance with this design within six months of the completion of
the tubewell; if they fail to do so, ADC would construct the
system at the groups' expense within a farther six months;
(b)  the Government would submit, for review by the Association,
an Agricultural Program and a Training Program. for Project
staff by January 31, 1973;
(c)  the Government would collect rental charges on a graduated
scale rising to ensure recovery by the tenth year of full
annual operation, maintenance and replacement costs of
Project tubewells;
(d)  within five years of signing the proposed credit, the Govern-
ment would consult with the Association on measures to be taken
to recover as much as practicable of the capital costs;
(e) the Government would establish and make initial payments into
Construction and Agricultural Revolving Funds;
(f)  the Government would maintain the organization of the Tube-
wells Division of ADC, and the appointment of an appropriately
qualified Senior Officer to direct Project construction acti-
vities to the satisfaction of the Association;
(g) the Government would appoint an appropriately qualified Senior
Officer to direct agricultural development activities in the
Project area; and
(h) the Government would employ engineering and agricultural con-
sultants under agreed terms of reference.
32.       In addition, the following conditions have been agreed to subse-
quently by the Government:
(a)  The Government would prepare and approve, by November 30, 1972
the standard budget control documents (PC-1 forms) for the



- 12 -
engineering and agricultural programs (para 7); and
(b)  the Govemment would employ a consulting hydrologist or hydraulic
engineer under agreed terms of reference to coordinate and super-
vise the study of drainage and water supply for irrigation in the
area partially protected by the Brabhaputra Right Embankment
(par5 18).
