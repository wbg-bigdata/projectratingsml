INDIA
RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION AND WORKSHOP MODERNIZATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I.   BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting and Transport Sector
1.01      For a country with the size and diversified economic structure
of India, transport plays a vital role. It must provide efficient and
reliable transport services, and, given the scarcity of financial
resources in the economy, it must accomplish these objectives at a minimum
cost. It is of paramount importance, therefore, to ensure that the vital
production activities of the economy are not hindered by lack of
transportation.
1.02      Traditionally transport kept pace with economic development in
the country. During the late seventies, however, the discipline and
morale of labor in transport agencies and their freight users alike
markedly decreased, while investments in transport infrastructure and
facilities were given lower priority than those for sectors such as
agriculture, energy and industry. Other factors such as substantial
changes in the volume as well as in origin and destination of traffic
flows, further compounded the problem. 1/ As a result, ports (particularly
Bombay) and railways, the backbone of the country-s transport system, were
unable to adequately meet traffic demand, and the road transport system,
never designed to carry such traffic, had difficulty covering the railway
transport shortfall and did so only at high cost to the economy. All this
resulted in supply shortages of vital commodities such as coal, cement and
fertilizer, which brought about stoppages and dislocations to critical
economic sectors. However, in 1980-82, the general situation in the
sector, and specifically in railways and ports, has substantially improved
mainly as a result of better railway and port management.
1.03      The railways have traditionally been the main mode of mechanized
transport in India and retained their relative position more or less
unchanged up to the beginning of the 1950-s, when the railway share of
1/ One of the most important changes was the cessation of foodgrain
imports into the country. Before this occurred, the foodgrain
requirements in the North were met mostly from imports through the
southern ports. Now, all the deficit areas, including the south, are
supplied from surplus northern states, reversing therefore the direc-
tion and changing the volume of this type of traffic.



-2-
mechanized land transport was estimated at 90% of total ton-km and 75Z of
total pass-km. Over the following two decades, those railways' shares
declined to 65% and 40% respectively, with a corresponding increase in the
share of road transport, values which have remained practically constant
during the 1970s. With respect to freight the increase of highways' share
was due to the increasing market for high-value goods moving by road over
short and medium distances, where highway transport has inherent
advantages over railway transport. With respect to passenger traffic, the
main reason for the reduced railway share is that long-distance passenger
traffic has tended to increase at a slower rate than short-distance
commuter traffic, which can generally be carried more economically by road
except for large and dense population centers such as Bombay, Calcutta and
Madras.
1.04      Compared with railways and highway transport, the other modes
of tra_sport are at present of minor importance as general goods and
passenger carriers: coastal shipping and pipelines each carry about 3X of
the total freight traffic in terms of ton-km; air transport carries about
1% of total pass-km. These modes are, however, important within their
specialized areas, and there is scope for considerable expansion within
each mode because of the size of the country and its geographical
features. Consequently, projects for expansion of coastal shipping of
coal and pipelines for transport of crude oil, gas and petroleum products
are currently being undertaken by the Government.
B. Transport Planning and Coordination
1.05      The Indian transport sector is under the jurisdiction of various
ministries: ports, shipping and roads are under the Ministry of Shipping
and Transport; railways are under the Ministry of Railways; civil aviation
under the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation; and pipelines under the
Ministry of Petroleum. Planning and coordination is undertaken within the
context of overall national and regional plans.
1.06      The present institutional arrangements for transport and
coordination at the Central Government level consist of: (a) a Cabinet
Committee on Transport and Tourism; (b) a Secretaries' Committee on
Transport, Tourism and Aviation; (c) a Transport Development Council and
an Inland Water Transport Board, which coordinates policies between the
Centre and the States; and (d) an Interstate Transport Committee which
regulates interstate road transport. The committees described under (a)
and (b) are not concerned with the day-to-day process of planning. They
provide a forum for discussion and their recommendations are not binding.
While railways are exclusively under the Central Government, highways and
road transport, minor ports and inland water transport are under the
jurisdiction of both Central and State Governments.



-3-
1.07      This organizational set up, which has resulted in insufficient
coordination within the transport sector, was a matter of concern and of
frequent exchange of views between Government of India (GOI) and the Bank
Group for several years. In view of the increasing importance of
addressing on a sectoral basis this problem together with issues such as
the high share (63% in 1979/80) of the transport sector's oil consumption
in the country's oil bill, and of formulating investment, pricing and
operating policies aimed at minimizing the resource cost to the economy of
the transport sector's services, a special study group, the National
Transport Policy Committee (NTPC), was created in April 1978. The NTPC,
with the assistance of experts provided by UNDP, carried out a study which
was presented to GOI in 1980. A review by the Bank indicates that the
study-s suggestions and recommendations are basically sound and that they
will provide a framework for better development of the country's transport
sector. GOI approved most of NTPC recommendations in a cabinet resolution
of March 1982. The Bank is now focussing its transport sector work in
India in defining, together with GOI, an adequate implementation program
and monitoring system, for the main NTPC's recommendations.
1.08      For national transport investments, the Planning Commission
assesses and approves for inclusion in the national plan, the investment
proposals emanating from the transport sector. The national plan thus
formulated by the Planning Commission must subsequently be approved by the
Government and the National Development Council.
1.09      For transport pricing, the overall responsibility lies with the
Central Government, except in the case of road transport where the
responsibility is shared by the Central, State and local authorities. As
a result, the type, level and structure of taxes and road user charges
vary considerably from one state to another. A number of studies 1/ have
recommended improvements to make the system more efficient, less costly in
terms of time and requirements and development of a tariff structure which
is cost based. These issues are going to be addressed by the Bank in the
context of the sector dialogue with GOI indicated in para 1.07. In the
case of railways, as mentioned in paras 5.04 to 5.06, a committee convened
by Government has studied the rail transport's rates and fares structure
and has recommended a number of measures to improve, inter alia, the
tariff structure.

C. 1Tansport Policy and Investment Allocations
1.10      The GoverDmenefs economic objectives were stated In the Sixth
Five-Year Plan (SFYP) 1980-85. The Plan represents an attempt at
realizing high average growth in the economy by increased emphasis on
irrigation, rural development and power. The transport sector policy
would be implemented through increased support to the highway sector wlth
particular emphasis on facilitating transport in rural areas;
encouragement of increased efficiency of railway transport operatlons; and
discouragement of growth in and decongestion of the central businses
distrLets of large metropolitan regions. Of the total public investment
in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Rs 101.6 billion or about 10% would be
allocated to transportation. Transport investment outlays are shown below
(1951-78 representing outlays in current prices and 1980-85 planned
outlays in 1979-80 prices):

a/  Public Sector Road Transport Corporations, mainly
for passenger transport.
1.12      The relative share of railways and road transport has
substantially changed along the years, in line with the rapidly expanding
role of road transport.  The large port investment allocations during the
period 1969-78 reflect an expansion program on the east coast which is
substantially completed. The Sixth Plan port allocation includes only a
nominal amount for the construction of a new port at Nhava Sheva, which
was approved by GOI in early 1982. The inclusion of full allocation of
funds for this project would substantially change the indicated
percentages.
II. INDIAN RAILWAYS
A. Organization, Management, Staff and Training
2.01      The network of IR is owned and managed by GOI.  Its operations
are controlled and directed by a Board of five members headed by a
Chairman who is ex-officio a Principal Secretary to the Government of
India reporting to the Minister of Railways. One board member, the
Financial Commissioner, has discretionary powers to report directly to the
Minister of Finance on financial matters. The Board, therefore, performs
the dual functions of a Secretariat to the Ministry of Railways and of an
executive body responsible for railway operations. In financial matters



-6-
the Government of India, through Parliament, oversees implementation of
recommendations made by the Railway Conveution Committee and other
parliamentary committees.
2.02      IR is the nationes largest single undertaking, with a capital
investment of some Rs 75 billion and a total staff strength of about 1.7
million. There are nine Zonal Railways, each of which is under the
control of a General Manager, and each zone is a large system on its own
account. IR also has three factories engaged in the manufacture of
locomotives and rolling stock and two new factorles are under
construction, one for production of wheels and axles (para 2.22) and the
other for remanufacture of critical diesel locomotives components
(para 2.24). IR's organization chart is illustrated in Chart 18812. The
quality of senior staff at Central and Zonal Headquarters is high and
their knowledge of modern railway technology is good. Training of staff
is given high priority and is considered crucial by IR Management in
maintaining a high standard of operations. Various forums inside and
outside the country are utilized for training, including IR's own training
schools.
B. Infrastructure
2.03      IR operates over 60,000 route kilometers (RKM), of which about
13,000 RKM have multiple track. IR's trackage is shown below by gauge and
category (in km):
Running     Sidings                  Of which
Gauge         Track        Yards       Total     Electrified

Source: IR Year Book 1982/83
About 63X of total track is broad gauge (BC), 33% is meter gauge (MG), and
the remaining 4% is narrow gauge (NG).  About 20% of BG and 1% of MG track
are electrified. Of total BG running track, 24,000 km or 15,000 RKM
constitute the heavy density lines over which average traffic density
exceeds 20 million GTKM per RKM per year.

C. Motive Power
2.04      As of March 1983, there were 2,638 diesel electric and diesel
hydraulic locomotives, 1,137 electric locomotives and 6,292 steam
locomotives on IR (details of type and age group of IR:s traction are
shown in Table '). Re-examination of IR-s traction policy confirms the
need to hasten the pace of steam traction replacement. In order to obtain
maximum benefits from diesel and electric traction, however, it is
essential to accelerata; the electrification program in the main trunk
lines where traffic volumes have reached levels which justify the
conversion, to improve the performance and availability of locomotives, to
reduce their operating and maintenance costs and to provide greater
flexibility in train operations (further notes provided in Annex B).
2.05      In the 1960-s, IR began manufacturing diesel electric, diesel
hydraulic, AC and DC electric locomotives in order to reduce dependence on
steam traction and reduce foreign exchange requirements for motive power
modernization. At the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW), manufacture of
diesel electric loccmotives was set up in collaboration with ALCO, United
States; at the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW), the diesel hydraulic
locomotive manufacture was set up in collaboration with MAK, Federal
Republic of Germany, and the AC electric locomotive manufacture was also
set up in collaboration with the 50 Hz Group (France, Germany, Switzerland
and Belgium). At CLW, IR also manufactures a limited number of DC
electric locomotives for replacement of DC traction around Bombay, which
has the oldest electrified section of the Railways and the only DC section
in India.
D. Rolling Stock
2.06      The current passenger stock includes 52 diesel rail cars, about
2,600 electric multiple units (EMU); and some 25,000 coaches. The present
fleet of freight wagons is about 390,000 units, equivalent to about
540,000 four-wheeler wagons, IR's standard measure of freight capacity.
Details of IR-s rolling stock fleet by type and age group are also given
in Table 1 and Annex B.
Coaches
2.07      To cater to the requirements of the increasing passenger
traffic, IR has augmented the number of passenger carriages and their
aggregate seating capacity over the years. Additions to the fleet have,
however, not been commensurate with the growing needs of traffic. While
passenger traffic has gone up by about 180% since 1950 the increase in
passenger coaches has only been in the order of about 120%. This has
resulted in an acute shortage of coaches and the occupation ratio exceeds
100% on many trains. These factors have resulted in considerable
over-crowding at the expense of travel safety, loss of revenues, and
higher operational costs.



Wagons
2.08      During 1950-s practicaLly all freight was being carried in
general purpose wagons - covered, open high sided and open low sided
wagons. To be able to cope with the pattern of traffic, the proportion of
the special type of stock has been increasing over the years. Now a
number of new bogie wagons, with emphasis on higher payload and
specialized facilities for Loading and unloading, have been put into
service and the number of such wagons is increasing.
E. Workshops
2.09      IR-s maintenance workshops were set up and equipped in the
latter half of the nineteenth and early twentieth century by the then
State and Company Railways. At the time of integration of the Railways in
1952, there were 41 workshops dealing with the overhaul of rolling stock
and motive power. The size of these workshops varied from 150 to 15,000
employees. The workload and product mix in these units were governed by
the need for self-sufficiency of each individual State/Company Railway,
resultirg in a proliferation of diverse activities for different types of
rolling stock in individual workshops, which continues today.
2.10      Workshops mainly undertake periodical (programmed) overhauls and
manufacture and remanufacture of parts and components.  Inspection and
servicing (renew brake blocks, change engine lube oil, add water, refuel,
etc.) and running repairs are performed in a Large number of Locomotive
sheds and carriage and wagon depots dispersed throughout the country.
These smaLl repair units are generally referred to as maintenance depots
(para 3.23) and so far have been provided with limited machinery and
plant, mainly through transfer of old machines from workshops.
F. Hanufacturing Units
2.11      IR-s main manufacturing units are the Chittaranjan Locomotive
Works (CLW) at Chittaranjan, the Diesel Locomotive Works (DL1) at Varanasi
and the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) at Madras. The CLW was set up in
1948 for the manufacture of steam Locomotives. Production in this shop
was diversified in the mid-1960-s, and by 1972 this unit had switched
entirely to the manufacture of electric locomotives, diesel hydraulic
shunters and a variety of components for diesel electric locomotives and
other equipment. The ICF commenced production of coaches in 1955 and
later added electric multiple units to its product line. The production
of coaches at ICF needs to be increased (para 3,23). The DLW began
production of diesel electric locomotives in 1964. A large proportion of
the original equipment installed in the three production units has already
served its useful economic life. Also, WRs manufacturing,
remanufacturing ant maintenance activities are growing and rapidly
becoming more complex. A need to upgrade manufacturing units and



-9-
strengthen IR-s organization and management to adequately cover these
expanding activities has become evident and has been the subject of
extensive discussions between IR and the Bank (para 2.23).
G. Operating Performance
2.12      IR-s operating performance for the period 1973174 to 1982/83
is given in Table 2. The best performance level for the most significant
operating indicators during the ten-year period has been underlined in
Table 2 for easy reference. The overall performance of IR compared to
other railway systems in developing countries remains generally
satisfactory. While the last years results show definite upswings in many
of these indicators, a number of them, especially in motive power and
rolling stock equipment, need further attention and improvement.
2.13      The reasons for the fluctuating level of IR-s performance can be
classified into three general categories: (i) factors external to IR and
over which the railways have little, if any, control; (ii) events external
to IR but to which the railways should be able to adapt smoothly and with
reasonable promptness; aud (iii) problems largely within the realm of IR-s
management to resolve. The first category includes a deterioration of law
and order in the country which resulted in damage and theft of railway
property affecting operations adversely, a reduction in efficiency of
major railway users in loading and unloading wagons thus increasing ille
time of wagons, congestion at major ports which lead to diversion of
traffic to minor ports where handling facilities and railway capacity was
limited, and an insufficient level of investment in maintenance and
renewals in recent years, resulting from reduced priority for railway
funds in India-s recext five-year plans. The second category comprises
changes in traffic-flow patterns of major commodities. For example, as
India-s foodgrain production increased, imports were reduced
significantly. For this and other commodities (e.g., fertilizer, cement)
the haul distances increased sharply and the commodity flow patterns
changed drasticaLly. Given the size and complexity of the system, IR's
management could not respond to the changes in a timely manner. The third
category includes a drop in productivity of railway staff; insufficient
attention to the potential for reducing costs; and the need to increase
operating efficiency, improve railway technology, and adopt modern
management tools (paras 2.25 to 2.28) which would considerably enhance
IR-s ability to cope with these problems. A detailed discussion of these
matters was outlined in the Second Railway Modernization and Maintenance
Project, SAR Report No. 3431-IN dated October 26, 1982, Section H, paras
2.24 to 2.37.



-10-
H.  Traffic
2.14      IR's freight and passenger traffic statistics from 1950/51 to
1981/82 are shown in Table 3. In the last 31 years, railway freight
traffic has increased at an average annual rate of 3.1% in terms of total
tonnage and 4.5% in terms of ton-kilometers. The corresponding growth
ratios for inter-city passenger traffic are 2.3% and 3.7%. These
long-term trends do not reflect, however, gradually changing patterns of
growth. While the annual rate of growth of inter-city passenger traffic
has increased from 0.5% (for passengers) and 1.0% (for
passenger-kilometers) in the decade of the 1950s, to 3.3% and 6.1% in the
last decade, the rate for freight traffic in the same decades has
decreased from 5.3% (tons) and 7.1% (ton-kilometers) to 2.0% (tons) and
2.9% (ton-kilometers), respectively. Meanwhile, during the last four
years, total tonnage moderately increased from 237 to 245 million tons or
about 0.8% per annum and ton kilometers increased by 1.7% per annum (from
163 to 174 billion) due to a continuing rise in average haul of freight.
Suburban traffic, meanwhile, has grown at a sustained rate of 5.4% for
passengers and 6.3% for passenger-kilometers during the last 31 years.
Growth has levelled off in the last four years however, suppressed by
shortages of rail equipment and terminal facilities. Traditionally, seven
groups of commodities have made up the bulk of railway transport in India.
In 1981/82 these seven commodities (coal, inputs and production of steel
plants, iron ore for export, foodgrains, petroleum products, cement and
fertilizers) comprised about 80% of revenue earning traffic in terms of
tons moved and 75% in terms of ton-kilometers (see Table 4).
2.15      Details of freight traffic forecasts are provided in Table 5
and in Annex D. Three different alternatives have been analyzed and
commodity-wise projections show that a total rail traffic ranging from 186
to 198 billion ton-kilometers, with a medium forecast of 191 billion
ton-kilometers can be expected by the end of the Sixth Plan in 1984/85.
In addition, by 1990/91, total traffic would range between 212 and 258
billion ton-kilometers. Passenger traffic, moreover, is expected to reach
between 246 and 292 billion passenger-kilometers by 1984/85 and from 307
to 444 billion passenger kilometers in 1990/91. The freight traffic
forecasts are less than the Sixth Plan estimate of 220 billion
ton-kilometers of total freight traffic in 1984/85. However as indicated
(para 2.16), the limitations of the Sixth Five-Year Plan are such that
even assuming an efficiency similar to the 1981/82 level, the Plan
allocations would be generally insufficient to cover the needs of the
railways.
I. Railway Investment Plan
2.16      To support projected traffic growth and finance asset
replacement, IR-s approved investment for the Sixth Five-Year Plan (SFYP)
period 1980/81 to 1984/85 totals Rs 51,000 million, including Rs 3,050



-11-
million for metropolitau transport projects and investment in road
services. The broad features of the Plan are responsive to the country-s
needs although improvements are possible. The plan allocations are
particularly short in telecommunications and in replacement of motive
power and rolling stock. The amount allocated for telecommunications
excludes the investment needed to implement an operating information
system, for which only a nominal sum has been provided in the 1983/84
budget. Similarly the replacement of motive power and rolling stock is
not adequately covered, especially when considering the importance of
phasing out steam traction to improve IR-s maintenance and operations and
to optimize the use of coal and the age and condition of a sizeable
portion of the freight wagons and coaches. Even if IR-s efficiency is
maintained --as expected-- at the 1981/82 best historical levels, there
would be little safety margin when compared with the conservative
estimates of future traffic growth presented in para 2.15, not to mention
the need to reduce operating expenses by phasing out obsolete motive power
and rolling stock. The detailed investment program is presented in
Table 6 and is summarized below:

Source: Sixth Five-Year Plan
IR has proceeded at a fast pace in the implementation of the Plan and its
investments in the first four years (1980/81 - 1983/84) are expected to be
of the order Rs 48,560 million. The feasibility of enhancement of the
total plan outlay during the current Sixth Five-Year Plan is at present
under examination but it has already been decided that the IR outlay will
be substantially increased. IR is now in the process of preparation of
its detailed investment plan for the Seventh Five-Year Plan period 1985186
- 1989/90. Its preliminary estimates indicated that funds needed for the



-12-
the Seventh Plan Period would be tn the order of Rs 110 billion. This
wo%..Ld take Into account the urgent need for early replacement of overaged
assets and modernization of its operations. IR's Seventh Five-Year Plan's
focus would be largely on investments for replacements of motive power and
rolling stock; electrification and modernization of workshops and aids to
operational management, which, as in the past, would be continuously
discussed with the Bank during the plan period. At negotiations, it was
confirmed by GOI that this project is an integral part of the IR capital
investment plan and as such, has the Planning Commission's approval.
J. Railway Planning
2.17      Under Credit 280-IN (Eleventh Railway Project), a corporate
planning exercise was initiated by IR with the objective of ensuring
adequate provision of rail transport services for both passenger and
freight in areas in which railways could confer optimum benefit to the
economy. The exercise was completed in 1976 and resulted in a 15-year
Corporate Plan for the total railway system, consolidating the corporate
plans of the individual zonal railways on which IR is based. The Plan
outlines a proposed development strategy for IR for the period 1977/78 to
1988/89 and covers passenger and freight traffic, traction and rolling
stock, line capacity, yards and terminals, shops, production units,
research and development, management and manpower and financial aspects.
2.18      The Corporate Plan exercise provided the first comprehensive
look at shortfalls and choices in the post-investment level. The Plan
also provided GOI with an indicative statement of the impact on the
national economy. The Plan stated the need and the framework for modern-
ization which was subsquently further elaborated by the Rail Tariff
Enquiry Committee (RTEC) and the National Transport Policy Committee
(NTPC). Both committees concluded their comprehensive studies and
presented their recommendations to GOI in 1980.
2.19      GOI's acceptance of the need for IR's modernization has been
reflected in efforts to increase the resource allocation under the
development plans (para 2.16) and implementation of various measures aimed
at improving WRs maintenance and railway technology (para 2.22), opera-
tions (paras 2.20 and 2.21) and finances (paras 5.04-5.06). The Bank has
been closely involved and has supported GOI/R-s efforts and the proposed
project is a continuation of these efforts.
K. Modernization Efforts
2.20      There are multiple reasons behind the problems noted in previous
paragraphs, for the periodical deteriorating capacity and shortcomings in.
the performance of the railways. With a rapidly growing number of diesel
and electric locomotives nearing their mid-lives and in need of major



-13-
overhaul, IR has taken up the immediate need for a change in investment
priorities in favor of modernization of maintenance facilities and motive
power and rolling stock design. In support of IR-s move in these new
directions, the Bank Group approved the First Railway Modernization and
Maintenance Project, Credit 844-IN in July 1978, for an amount of US$190
million equivalent and the Second Railway Modernization and Maintenance
Project, Loan 2210-IN/Credit 1299-IN in December 1982 for an amount of
US$400 million equivalent.
2.21      The major modernization issues addressed in the recent past
years on which the Bank Group has assisted GOI/IR efforts are as follows:
(a) a master plan study for modernization and rationalization of
workshops; (b) relative economics of diesel and electric motive power;
(c) accelerated electrification; (d) railways motive power plan, medium
and long range; (e) railways passenger vehicle technology and
requirements; (f) unit exchange spares and maintenance system for diesel
and electric locomotives; (g) modernization of 1,500 DC Banking
locomotives; (h) railways real time information need for freight operation
and passenger reservation; (i) the revision of the Corporate Plan based on
changes in IR-s operating and traffic environment; and (j) resource
mobilization and tariff rationalization.
Maintenance and Technology Improvements
2.22      Under the ongoing Credit 844-IN, which is almost complete, the
main items dealt with were modernization of IR-s manufacturing unit CLW
and four major repair workshops, introduction in some workshops of a
modern unit exchange concept of maintenance program and the establishment
at Yelanhanka in Karnataka State of a wheel and axle plant (IRWA). This
plant will be in operation shortly which would help save scarce foreign
exchange. The measures taken under the project have enhanced IR's
maintenance capability and has resulted in reducing cost of maintenance as
well as improving performance and availability of IR's diesel and electric
locomotives.
2.23      While under the Credit 844-IN some key maintenance problems
related to IR-s diesel and electric locomotives were tackled, further
measures were needed (identified under the Master Plan Study) to upgrade
this activity, which the Bank Group supperted under Loan 2210-IN/Credit
1299-IN. Under this ongoing project, the physical thrust of the project
aimed at: (a) further modernization and improvement of locomotive
maintenance and reliability; (b) improvement of technology and performance
of the AC mainline electric locomotives; and (c) improvement of
technology, design and operation of heavy bulk movements. In addition,
among other areas, examination of IR organization and management,
operations and finances continues.



-14-
2.24      Major components of the ongoing Railway Modernization and
Maintenance II Project, which have a bearing and complement the proposed
project, are: (a) the construction of Diesel Components Works (DCW) plant
to be constructed and equipped at Patiala, in Punjab State to
remanufacture/manufacture diesel electric locomotives critical
components/assemblies which IR will utilize to operate a unit exchange
maintenance system at DCW and its other workshops; (b) the acquisition
and testing of about 20 prototype high-power modern high adhesion AC
electric locomotives, which will serve present and future needs for heavy
freight trains capable of hauling up to 4,500 GTT on all IR 25 KV
electrified lines; (c) the acquisition of components and materials for
construction of corrosion resistant high capacity wagons; and
(d) acquisition of test equipment for training to improve IR's train
operations and fuel efficiency.
Modern Management Tools
2.25      While IR's management continues to take measures to resolve some
of the key problems, it is constrained in the extent of actions it could
initiate, because of lack of modern management tools, which are critically
needed and other large railways have successfully employed.  Experience
has proven in other complex railways, that adoption of a real-time
operating information system and of a modern communication capability
would, inter alia, immensely help reduce traffic congestion, considerably
improve rolling stock and motive power utilization and facilitate
maintenance of motive power and rolling stock, and enable IR to quickly
adjust to changing traffic patterns all of which will reduce operating
and capital costs of the railways.
2.26      Adoption of a real-time Operating Information System (OIS) which
would help resolve most of the problems described above has been under
discussion between GOI|IR and the Bank Group for several years. The Bank
Group's audit of the Eleventh and Twelfth Railway projects also
recommended the use of modern technologies to provide real-time up-to-date
information on freight carrying capacity and its optimum utilization.
2.27      GOI has endorsed the need for and approved introduction of an
online/real-time computer-based OIS for freight operations and management
of IR and the related telecommunication and data transmission network.
The basic configuration of the integrated computer based freight OIS would
be a combination of centralized and decentralized functions. The core
functions, like control of wagons, locomotives, train movements, routing
of traffic and empty wagon distribution will be performed centrally and to
perform this central function IR has decided that a system operating on
Canadian National Railways System or British Railways System will be
adapted and implemented to suit the needs and conditions of the IR.



-15-
2.28       Satisfactory progress by GOI/IR in selection and implementation
of a computerized Operating Information System (OIS) and related
telecommunication was a pre-requisite to processing the Second Railways
Modernization Project, and during its negotiations an understanding was
reached on a plan of action for implementation of the OIS and related
telecommunication. Progress in implementing the plan of action to date
has been somewhat slower than was agreed. Delays were unavoidable given
the substantial change in the railways Board personnel, which occurred in
February/March 1983. However, the development of a well-integrated
Telecommunication/OIS network remains a top priority for IR and since
January 1984 steps have been taken towards implementation of
Telecommunication/OlS system. To expedite progress towards implementation
of the telecommunication portion of the integrated telecommunication/OIS
and data transmission network system, GOI/IR indicated during negotiations
that a consultant will be selected by August 31, 1984 and the
telecommunication project will be sanctioned (approved) by the IR-s Board
by March 31, 1985. It was also agreed during negotiations that selection
of collaborators/consultants to assist GOI/IR in adaptation and
implementation of the OIS will be a condition of effectiveness of the
loan.
L. Performance Under Previous Bank Group Projects
2.29      Through seven loans and nine credits approved between 1949 and
1982, the Bank assistance to IR totalled over US$1.4 billion dollars
equivalent. Prior to 1978, Bank Group loans and credits were based on one
to three-year slices of IR investmeut programs and covered foreign
exchange for acquisition of: (a) materials, parts and components for
manufacture of motive power and rolling stock; (b) machinery and plant for
IR manufacturing units; and (c) materials and equipment for line
improvement works and telecommunications.
2.30      Previous projects, audits have been carried out for Credits
280-IN and 448-IN (Eleventh and Twelfth Railway Projects) and the findings
are contained in the Project Performance Audit Report No. 1658 of June 30,
1977. A Project Completion Report and draft Project Performance Audit
Report have also been prepared on the Thirteenth Railway Project,
Credit 582-IN.
2.31      The Project Performance Audit Report concluded that the Bank's
contribution to the country's development through its involvement in
railway projects has been substantial. Bank assistance provided the
foreign exchange resources without which IR-s replacement and expansion
programs would have been very difficult to carry out. The report also
po'nted out the need to:  (a) improve the planning, both at the sectoral
level and within the railways; (b) introduce a better reporting system
of the results of Bank-financed projects; and (c) use computers to provide
immediate information to optimize the utilization of its carrying



-16-
capacity. Additionally, the report mentions IR-s difficulties in paying
the fu_l dividend on Capital-at-Charge which IR is obliged to pay GOI
annually.
2.32      The issue listed under (a) in para 2.31 has already been
addressed by GOI as mentioned in paras 2.17 to 2.19. Additionally, start-
ing with Credit 844-IN, a thorough and adequate reporting and monitoring
system (issue b) was introduced and has been functioning satisfactorily.
A first step towards resolving issue (c) has been addressed by GOI/IR as
described in paras 2.25 to 2.28.  Regarding the dividend problem, although          (
IR has met the full dividend payment to GOI between 1976/77 and 1978/79,
it has run into difficulties in meeting this financial requirement
(paras 5.03-5.06 and 5.09-5.11).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01      The basic objectives underlying the Bank Group's past assistance
to IR have been to assist in rehabilitating and subsequently modernizing
railway infrastructure, motive power, rolling stock and in improving
railway operating efficiency, maintenance, administration and planning.
The Bank Group has had a continued involvement in development, preparation
and review of the work mentioned above and for the proposed project. Bank
Group missions to IR have been supplemented by consultants in such fields
as heavy engineering, manufacturing, electric and diesel traction technol-
ogy, maintenance including upgrading of repair workshops, signalling and
telecommunication, organization and operating information systems and
intermodal transport. Also, arrangements were made at various times for
IR officers and those of other Government agencies to visit transport and
industrial organizations outside India. Findings and preparation of the
various subjects have been extensively discussed with IR and GOI, espe-
cially the Ministries of Finance and the Planning Commission. These
findings and discussions form the basis for the formulation of a number of
projects by IR, including the proposed project.
B. Objectives
3.02      The main objectives of the proposed project are to:
(i) increase capacity to meet growing traffic demand; (ii) improve
utilization of motive power, rolling stock and roadway; (iii) improve cost
effectiveness; (iv) utilize energy-efficient traction; (v) improve
technology of locally-manufactured components used in electrification of
lines; and (vi) strengthen the organization in selected operational areas.
3.03      As a means to achieve these objectives the proposed project
comprises two major components, namely, electrification and workshop



-17-
modernization. The electrification component will contribute, inter alia,
by completing energization of the heavy density main trunk lines which
have enough traffic to economically justify the conversion (see
Chapter IV). The operation of the completed electric network will allow
through-train operation of higher tonnage at greater average speeds and
increased motive power and rolling stock kilometers per day. The workshop
modernization component will contribute by increasing availability and
reliability of rolling stock at lower costs. In addition, it will provide
needed capacity to the presently inadequate coaching stock production and
maintenance system. Further, it will streamline workshop operation and
management practices.
C. Description
3.04      The proposed loan would support the electrification of about
3000 RKM of IR-s accelerated Electrification Plan; and modernization of
six workshops, one manufacturing unit and selected maintenance depots
largely through replacement of old obsolete machines with modern and
efficient ones. The proposed project is estimated to cost about
US$1,212.7 million of which US$280.7 million equivalent is proposed for
Bank financing.
3.05      The project consists of:
(a) electrification:
(i) electrification of the already partially electrified main
trunk routes (paras 3.06 to 3.13);
(ii) acquisition of OHE Recording/Testing Car (para 3.14);
(iii) acquisition of OHE maintenance vehicles for electrified
lines (paras 3.15 and 3.16);
(iv) improvements in technology for domestic manufacture of
components used in electrification of lines (para 3.17);
(v) improvement of Ghat Operations (paras 3.18 and 3.19); and
(b)  workshop modernization:  consisting of modernization of six
major shops, the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) and selected
maintenance depots (paras 3.20 to 3.26);
(c)  staff training (paras 3.27 and 3.28).



-18-
(a) Electrification
(i) Completion of Electrified Network
3.06      While most of the world's railways have been in the process of,
or have completed, the conversion from steam to diesel or electric
traction over the last 25 years, IR is, because of its very large size
and lack of funds, only about halfway through this conversion. In 1983,
on broad gauge, IR locomotive fleet was comprised of 3,523 (52%) steam,
2,061 (30%) diesel and 1,137 (17%) electric units. Obvious priority to
improve the operational and financial position and service capability of
the railway is to accelerate the conversion from the costly and
inefficient steam traction to diesel and to electric traction on heavy
density lines, where it is economically feasible to do so.
3.07      IR's policy (Annex A and B) towards conversion of traction has
been to: (a) phase out inefficient steam traction; (b) convert from
diesel and steam to electric traction where traffic densities make this
economically viable; (c) improve through electrification the performance
on high density lines by a combination of higher sustained average speeds,
higher trailing tonnage per locomotive and greater number of locomotive
and rolling stock kilometers per day of utilization; (d) reduce
congestion, operating and maintenance costs through elimination of steam
and diesel on main lines; (e) build up a suitable and modern motive power
fleet and infrastructure to meet the demands of increasing freight train
loads to 4,500t and increasing passenger train size to twenty two coaches;
and (f) modernize signalliug and telecommunication system as a consequence
of necessary changes made during the conversion to electrification.
3.08      The high cost of imported fuel (HSD) is of concern in the
country because of the adverse foreign exchange implications. In the
immediate future, the railway is one of the few areas where the country
could significantly substitute electric power for HSD. At present India
imports about 10% of its HSD needs which is equivalent to about the amount
that is used by the railways. Moreover, the railways needs are on the
rise, which would mean higher imports of HSD.
3.09      While all these reasons suggest a strong case for
electrification, because of acute resource constraints, IR was only able
to allocate about 3% to 5% of its annual investment outlay for this task
since 1958, when it commenced electrification works. By May 1983 only
about 5,800 RKM were electrified, which constitutes about 10% of the total
network. The 10% electrified route services corresponds to 28% of GTKM
carried by IR.  Table 7 shows the pace of electrification on IR since
1956.



-19-
3.10      The slow pace of electrification has constrained the development
of an integrated operational network. As a result, the partially complete
electrified system is a detriment to efficient operations since incomplete
electrified lines mean change of operations and equipment at points where
traction changes, resulting in costly constraints in operations and
capacity.
3.11      As part of the national program for the oil conservation
program, IR is to accelerate electrification of about 7,500 RKM of its
main trunk lines under the Sixth and Seventh Five-Year Plan period 1980 to
1990. This program calls for increasing the pace of electrification from
the present 300 RKM to 1,000 RKM annually. With completion of the
electrification program by 1989/90, IR expects to haul 65% of the total
GTKMs (goods and passenger) by electric traction. In order for IR to be
able to handle this volume, GOI/IR indicated during negotiations that
sufficient motive power to meet requirements of the newly electrified
lines will be supplied.
3.12      The plans relating to the electrification program and the
proposed Bank assistance to it, have been extensively discussed with
GOI/IR. The proposed loan would support part (3,U0O RKM) of the
accelerated electrification program which requires importation of material
and equipment to augment the domestic manufacturing capacity. This will
complete electrification of the main trunk routes connecting the
quadrilateral formed by the four metropolitan cities of Calcutta, Delhi,
Bombay and Madras and its diagonals (Map 17454) and the heavy density coal
traffic routes of Bilaspur-Annupur-Katni-Bina. The project would assist
in the electrification of the following lines:
1.  Jhansi-Itarsi                 (381 km)
2.  Itarsi-Bhusaval               (301 km)
3.  Bhusaval-Nagpur                (393 km)
4.  Wardha-Balharshah              (133 km)
5.  Balharshah-Vijayawada          (454 km)
6.  Bhopal-Nagda                   (239 km)
7.  Itarsi-Nagpur                 (298 km)
8.  Nagpur-Durg                    (265 kn)
9.  Bina-Katni-Anuppur             (429 km)
10.  Anuppur-Bilaspur              (151 km)
TOTAL                 (3,044 km)
Details of each of the above lines are described in Annex E. At
negotiations, GOI/IR confirmed that electric power supply for IR-s
electrified system will be available on a priority basis and that high
tension power transmission lines connecting railway substations with State



-2U-
Electricity Boards (SEBs) will be provided sufficiently in advance of the
planned line energization date so that the commissioning is not delayed.
3.13      This proposed project component is estimated to cost Rs 6,821.7
million (US$631.6 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of
some Rs 1,143.0 million (US$105.8 million equivalent). In addition,
training for this project component is provided as described in para 3.28.
(ii) OHE Recording/Testing Car
3.14      At present there is no overhead equipment rccording/testing car
with IR and thus manual and time consuming methods are employed resulting
in a low standard of maintenance. For efficient operatiou of electrified
lines, it is considered essential to have an OHE recording/testing car
to measure and record the various parameters of OHE and pantograph under
dynamic conditions in monitoring current collection for laying down a
rational maintenance and overhaul schedule for OHE (Annex E). This car
will be imported and is estimated to cost about Rs 21.1 million (US$2.0
million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of Rs 14.5 million
(US$1.3 million equivalent).
(iii) OHE Maintenance Vehicles
3.15      IR now operates a large number of indigenously manufactured OHE
inspection/maintenance tower vehicles, which are used to attend to OHE
breakdowns on the electrified tracks. Due to the obsolete design and low
speed, these vehicles are inadequate to perform the necessary maintenance
efficiently. Since the heavy maintenance/repair of OHE is done during
common power/traffic blocks, it is extremely important to complete the
work expeditiously to minimize traffic disruptions. Therefore, IR needs
to develop high-speed vehicles, namely, road-rail vehicles, 4-wheeler
self-propelled tower wagons and bogie-type 8-wheeler self-propelled tower
wagons to attend to minor, normal and heavy breakdowns respectively.
3.16      Based on IR's current and future needs (Annex E), the Bank would
help finance the import of some 20 vehicles with the delivery of 1irst ten
by 1984/85 and the balance in 1985/86. The proposed project component is
estimated to cost about Rs 59.0 million (US$5.5 million equivalent) with a
foreign exchange component of Rs 39.0 million (US$3.6 million equivalent).
(iv) Improvements in Technology for Manufacture of Components
3.17      IR uses predominantly locall.' manufactured components such as
high-tension circuit breakers, interruptors and power transformers in
electrifying its lines. These and other items could be upgraded to tech-
nological standards existing elsewhere outside India. To assist i1 bring-
ing about technological improvements in local manufacture of critical
components, the project will also finance all such Items. Inclusion ef



-21-
these items in Bank financing will enable the local manufacturer to enter
new or update existiEg collaboration agreements and manufacturing
facilities. The Bank and IR will ensure that the technology improvements
will materialize through tender specification and resulting evaluation of
bids. The value of these components, included in the overall
electrification cost (para 3.13), is estimated to be about US$30 million
equivalent.
(v) Improvement of the North-East Ghat Operations
3.18      The main line DC electrified routes Bombay-Kalyan-Igatpuri and
Bombay-Kalyan-Pune sections run over steep ghat sections (Annex B,
para 4). Both sections are serious bottlenecks in train operations and
the conversion of these DC sections to AC to achieve compatability with
the rest of IR-s electrified system have been the subject of discussion
for some time between IR and the Bank. Because of the complex
techno-economic issues involved in the conversion from DC co AC, a study
would be needed to evolve an appropriate long-term strategy. At
negotiations, IR explained that a multi-disciplinary committee is in the
final stages of preparing a report and indicated to the Bank that a
decision on the report will be taken by June 30, 1985.
3.19      As an immediate short-term measure to improve operating
efficiency in these difficult sections, it is essential that voice
communication between the drivers of leading locomotives and the drivers
of banking locomotives and signal cabins be provided to improve line
operations and reduce delays. The proposed project would provide for
necessary radio communication equipment and is estimated to cost Rs 7.3
million (US$0.7 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of
Ks 5.4 million (US$0.5 million equivalent). At negotiations, IR indicated
that it will procure and place into operation a communication system for
the Ghat sections by December 31, 1985.
(b) Workshop Modernization
3.20      Over the last 25 years, the need and pressure to acquire
additional carrying capacity have resulted in a widening of the gap
between maintenance requirements and investment allocations. Investment
in workshops has averaged only 3.5% of the investment made in rolling
stock and motive power, instead of the normal 7% to 117. for railways in
developed countries. Moreover, about 45% of this investment in workshop
machinery and plant has been exclusively for the manufacturing units:
DLW, CLW and Integral Coach Factory (ICF). A 1977 detailed survey showed
that of a total of 24,546 machines, 77% of those in mechanical workshops,
53% in production units and 46% in diesel and electric locomotive
maintenance depot lines were over 15 years old. At the same time, the
level of parts and components available for maintenance has been
substantially lower than required by the Railways.



-22-
3.21      During this period of low investment in maintenance facilities,
extensive changes in the mode of traction from steam to diesel and
electric aud consequent diversity of product mix introduced new
complexities in repair practices and technology, which further strained
the maintenance system. In addition, an increased proportion of older
stocks of locomotives, coaches and wagons has measurably added to the
quantum of attention needed in POH and rehabilitation. Increased demands
for periodic repairs to rolling stock were met by piece-meal expansion of
existing facilities. Maintenance capability was further underminrd by a
heavy backlog in replacement of overaged machinery and plant item3
resulting from investment constraints.
3.22      Under Credit 844-IN, GOIIIR had agreed to develop a workshop
"Master Plan" and this has been prepared as outlined in the Summary Terms
of Reference (Annex C). The plan was reviewed and evaluated by the Bank
and found to be well-conceived and meets the requirements asked of IR
under Credit 844-IN. The proposed workshop modernization component is
based on this plan and aims for the most part, at improvement of
carriage-wagon maintenance. In view of the physical and finencial
constraints, a selection process was devised for choosing the workshops
and maintenance depots for the proposed project for modernization. The
selection has been governed by the following factors: (a) economic rate
of return on proposed investments; (b) change in the product mix;
(c) sophistication of product, present and new; (d) priority for
improvement in product performaace and reliability; (e) arrears and
backlog in workload; (f) changes in future workload; and (g) size, age and
antiquity of unit. Using the above criteria, the six major workshops and
ICF and maintenance depots were selected.
.3.23     In summary, the project component consists of rationalization
and modernization of six selected workshops (Map 17456), namely, Parel,
Liluah, Jagadhri, Golden Rock, Kharagpur, Ajmer and the Integral Coach
Factory (ICF), and replacement of old obsolete machines and equipment in
several maintenance depots (Annex F). In both cases, the selected shops
and the maintenance depots, the approach is directed towards:
(a) rationalization of periodic overhaul workload; (b) rationalization of
production activities; (c) provision of improved material handling
equipment and suitable workshop layout changes; (d) provision of unit
exchange spares; (e) replacement of machinery and plant including testing
equipment for better quality control, communication equipment for better
inplant management, and cleaning equipment and technology;
(f) modification and extension of existing workshop structures to cater to
increased periodic overhaul (POH) load and in the case of ICF, to increase
production and better work flow; and (g) development of adequate personnel
support through organized training.



-23-
3.24      Under the proposed project, the bulk of the investment is for:
(a) machinery and equipment to achieve precision, proper testing and
quality control required for maintenance of modern motive power and roll-
ing stock; (b) material-handling equipment and unit exchange components to
reduce frequent interruptions in work flow and to reduce damage to
material in transport, both having impact on output, quality and cost of
repairs; and (c) management information systems (HIS). For this, a com-
puter-based MIS, similar to the one developed at ICF, will be installed at
the six selected workshops by March 31, 1987. This was confirmed by
GOI/IR at negotiations.
3.25      The final objective of IR is to eventually develop an integrated
maintenance and repair network on a national basis. The proposed project
will cover workshop modernization for the 1984/85 - 1989/90 and is
estimated to cost Rs 3,298.8 million (US$305.5 million equivalent) with
a foreign component of Rs 1,591.9 (US$147.5 million equivalent). The
proposed project would finance 100% of the foreign requirement for the
major workshops and ICF, and would cover about 48% of the foreign exchange
requirements of the maintenance depot component.
3.26      In the twenty years or so since IR began dieselizing its locomo-
tive fleet and adopted improved steel coach and wagon stock designs, a
number of technological advances that have been made in materials and
components for railway equipment. IR has incorporated a number of these
advances in its fleet and no doubt will continue to do so on a
case-by-case basis. Many of the advances coupled with the operating
experience of other railways have produced opportunities to improve
utilization of equipment, safety and reliability, and reduce cost of
operations and maintenance. IR has found that it may be able to use some
of these maintenance concepts and has discussed with the Bank its need to
conduct a comprehensive review of its equipment specifications and main-
tenance standards and procedures in light of present-day circumstances.
Lhis review should provide a foundation upon which the operating and
maintenance practices could be revised to take full advantage of IR-s
present equipment fleet and to provide an outline for research needs of
the future. At negotiations, GOI/IR provided acceptable terms of
reference for a study and indicated that the study will commence by
July 1, 1984 and the final report would be available by October 31, 1985.
(c) Staff Training
3.27      Training under the proposed workshop modernization component
would be i.rovided for process engineering, cleaning processes, painting
process and management information system for workshops. Under the
proposed project, an amount totalling Rs 26.3 million (US$2.7 million
equivalent) has been provided for procurement of train simulators to
extend the driver training program which was started under the ongoing



-24-
Second Railway Modernization and Maintenance Project, Loan 2210-IN/Credit
1299-IN. In total, this project component would amount to Rs 39.0 million
(US$3.6 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of Rs 25.4
million (US$2.3 million equivalent). At negotiations, an outline of the
training program wasprovided (para 3.28).
3.28      Training for the proposed electrification component would be
provided in different areas of operations including, inter alia,
(a) re-training of steam/diesel locomotive drivers and helpers for elec-
tric traction; (b) design, installation and maintenance of OHE;
(c) installation and maintenance of power supply; (d) design, installation
and maintenance of signaLling and telecommunication; and (e) training of
supervisors for remote control centers. About 1,200 personnel would get
this training for about 2 to 8 weeks. In addition, in order to obtain
exposure to more advanced and specialized technologies, senior-level
officers would be trained abroad for inspection/study of electrified
railway systems in foreign countries. A total of 1,500 man months of
training would be provided under the proposed project; of these, an
estimated 200 man months would be overseas. This proposed training program
is estimated to cost about Rs 29.2 million (US$2.7 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange component of Rs 9.7 million (US$0.9 million equiv-
alent). At negotiations, GOI agreed that budget allocations will be
provided to IR to carry out the training programs (paras 3.27). An out-
line of the training programs was provided by IR at negotiations, and IR
indicated that a detailed training program will be furnished to the Bank
by July 31, 1984.
D. Cost Estimates
3.29      The proposed project items are included in IR-s investment plan
(to be approved by the Planning Commission) 1985/86 - 1989/90 which
amounts to about Rs 110 billion (US$10.0 billion equivalent). GOI
provides the foreign exchange needs of IR-s investment plan from the
following sources: GOI's own reserves; international financial institu-
tions such as the World Bank and bilateral loan arrangements. Principal
items included in the proposed project are detailed in Annex E and F and
constitute an integral part of IR-s investment plan. The project is
estimated to cost about Rs 13,099 million (US$1,213 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange component of some Rs 3,629 million (US$336 million
equivalent). However, local manufacturers of machinery and components to
be procured through ICB under the project could win up to US$20 million
equivalent, thus reducing the most likely foreign exchange component to
US$316 million equivalent.



-25-
3.30          The cost estimates are based  on January  1984  prices.   They are
based on ex-factory prices for similar items manufactured in India and on
recent prices of imported  equipment.  The provision  for contingencies
allows for (a) physical variation of 7.5% in material and equipment and
10% in labor; (b) annual price escalation in foreign costs of 7.5% in
1984/85; 7% in 1985/86; and 6% thereafter; and annual price escalation in
local costs of 7% in 1984/85 and 1985/86 and 6% thereafter. The foreign
exchange rate was assumed to be US$1 = Rs 10.80. During negotiations,
the cost estimates were discussed  and confirmed.   The cost estimates are
detailed in tables 8, 9 and 10, and summarized below:

E. Financing
3.31      The total foreign exchange component of the project amounts to
about US$336 million equivalent. The Bank will finance the foreign
exchange component of all items except the maintenance depots of which
only a portion is included in the proposed loan. Thus the proposed loan
of US$280.7 million equivalent represents about 28% of the project costs,
not including taxes and duties. During negotiations, GOI agreed to
finance the remaining US$932 million equivalent including US$55 million
equivalent in foreign exchange, and release funds in a timely manner and
in accordance with the implementation schedule.
F. Implementation
3.32      To execute the electrification program, IR has set up a Central
Organization for Railway Electrification (CORE) otherwise known as the
Railway Electrification Planning Coordination and Monitoring Group
(REPCMG) at Nagpur in central India (Chart 25838). Six field units have
also been created directly under the central organization and an
additional field unit under the Southern Railways. In addition IR
utilizes outside contractors for construction works and installation of
OHE.
3.33      The present strength of the organization is 227 officers and
1,574 staff of various categories and disciplines including 294 trainees.
A central training school has also been organized at Nagpur, which offers
an eight-week condensed course to familiarize participants with design and
installation of overhead equipment and power supply installations.
Experienced specialized skill personnel are drawn from elsewhere in the
railways to fill specific needs. The organization to carry out
electrification program is adequate and competently staffed. During
negotiations agreement was reached that trained personnel as ueeded will
be maintained to meet the needs of electrification.
3.34      Under the ongoing Credit 844-IN, IR established the Central
Organization for Modernization of Workshops (COFMOW), a specialist
organization wholly devoted to the task of managing the workshop
modernization program planned for the twelve-year period beginning in
1978. It is also assisting the implementation of the workshop
modernization component under the ongoing Loan 2210-IN/Credit 1299-IN.
COFMOW was required to plan and coordinate implementation of:
(a) replacement of overaged and obsolete machinery and plant;
(b) introduction of modern workshop technology and methods;
(c) improvement of workshop layouts to facilitate production and eliminate
needless cross movements; (d) rationalization of work functions; and
(e) provision of necessary personnel support by way of staff, supervisors
and officers. COFMOW has performed well in its role of rationalizing the
maintenance activity, acting as a procurement coordinator for the projects



-27-
and has provided leadership in some of the other areas originally
assigned. It was proposed that it continue in this vital functional
relationship for the workshop modernization component of the proposed
project and that it be strengthened especially in the areas of training,
preparation of specifications for machines and equipment and their
procurement, process engineering (facility layout, etc.) and monitoring
project implementation. During negotiations, GOI/IR confirmed this.
Also, IR agreed to maintain COFMOW with adequate staff for implementation
of the workshop modernization component of the project.
3.35      IR will be responsible for the implementation of the project as
part of its ongoing works and manufacturing program. It has the necessary
capability and competence to carry out the project. A detailed
implementation program showing the phasing of the eLectrification work and
trained manpower to complete this work and workshop modernization is shown
in Chart 25799. This schedule, as well as progress reporting
arrangements, including GOI preparation of a final report upon completion
of the project, were discussed and agreed to during negotiations.
G. Environment
3.36      The project has been designed with due regard to environmental
and worker safety aspects. State laws for environmental and pollution
control stipulates that all industrial enterprises must conform to
environmental standards specified in the legislation relevant to the
industry concerned. The proposed project meets these standards, and no
significant adverse environmental impact is expected from the project.

3.38      Items financed by the Bank will be procured by IR through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines,
except for contracts of US100,000 equivalent or less, where the
advantages of ICB would be clearly outweighed by the administrative burden
thereof. This is estimated to represent a small portion (less than US$10
million equivalent) of the project. Such contracts will be placed using
local competitive bidding procedures for procurement which are
satisfactory. Also, minor items of material and equipment associated with
contracts for installation/erection of signalling and telecommunication
may be procured in accordance with the usual business practice of the
Railways. This is estimated to amount to less than US$10 million
equivalent. These procurement contracts will be reviewed during
supervision.
3.39      Local manufacturers are expected to bid for items under the
project and a domestic preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is
less, would be applied in bid evaluation. During negotiations, GOI
clarified existing import procedures for procurement of goods which were
found to be satisfactory.
I. Disbursements
3.40      Subject to review and agreement with the Bank, savings in any
category of the proceeds will be available to cover increases in any other
category except proprietary items. Disbursements are expected to be
completed by March 31, 1990 but to allow time for possible late payments,
the closing date will be September 30, 1990. Disbursements under the
project will be made against:
(a) 100% of the cif cost of imported items;
(b) 100% of the ex-factory cost of items procured from domestic
suppliers; and
(c) 100% of the cost of training, and installation and inspection of
equipment requiring foreign expertise.
A schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 11. The estimated
disbursements are about one year ahead of disbursement profiles for Bank
Group loans/credits in India. This divergence is a result of taking into
account the experience of previous IR projects and the nature of goods
to be financed under the proposed credit. During negotiations the
disbursement schedule was discussed and agreed to with IR.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01      Indian Railways has a well-developed network which transports
most of the bulk commodities and the majority of long distance passengers
in the country. But a sustained growth in the economy and in the
population poses a heavy challenge to the ability of IR to cope with the
traffic demand, a task which has not always been successfully fulfilled.
For example, in 1978-79 more than three million tons of coal was moved on
the highways over a distance of 250 kms with an average lead of 585 km,
and likewise about three million tons of foodgrain and 1.'. million tons of
cement moved by road beyond 250 kms. 1978-79 was a low performance year
(see Table 2) for IR, but these anomalies still exist and cause an
increase in transport cost. Another example is the inability of IR to
provide sufficient long-distance passenger transport, a situation which
creates continuous criticism of IR by the public media. Therefore, one of
the most pressing matters for IR to solve in the immediate futt:re is the
increase in its capacity to adequately satisfy the ever-increasing traffic
volumes. Since the early sixties, IR has concentrated on improving
railway infrastructure and expanding the motive power and rolling stock
fleet. At the same time, IR has moved from steam to diesel and electric
traction (para 3.06). To increase its capacity, IR realized that it
cannot continue relying only on increasing the size of the physical assets
of the organization (network, motive power, rolling stock), and IR is now
concentrating its efforts on improving its operational efficiency through
a modernization program which, with the assistance of the Bank Group, was
launched in the late seventies (para 2.20).
4.02      The proposed project fits well within the present strategy of
IR, aiming to (a) increase track throughput by completing the
electrification of the main lines; and (b) increase availability and
reliability of rolling stock through a Workshop Modernization Program.
Further, the railway electrification component represents a logical follow
up of the research program, financed by the on-going Loan 2210/Credit
1299-IN of testing, under Indian operating conditions, up to 20 imported
prototype AC electric locomotives of up to five different types for
introduction of modern and efficient electric traction.
4.03      The railway electrification component will permit the completion
of the electrification of the main trunk routes on IR, the quadrilateral
formed by Delhi, Calcutta, Madras and Bombay and its diagonals. These
main trunk routes together with a few other important lines like
Mughalsarai-Lucknow-Amritsar, Delhi-Bhatinda, Delhi-Ambala and
Kazipet-Secunderabad, carry about 75% of the freight traffic and 55% of
the passenger traffic in the country. The total NTKNs moved on the



-31-
quadrilateral and diagonals as compared with the total NTKMs moved by the
whole IR has been as follows:
Quadrilateral                           Share of IR NTKM
and  Diagonals        IR Network       by Quadrilateral

1970-71           75.19    10.9       127.36    10.8             59.0
1976-77          104.21    29.0       156.76    29.4              66.4
1979-80           92.82   -11.4       155.99   - 0.8             59.5
1980-81          101.72*    8.9       158.44*    2.4             64.1
* Provisional
It is interesting to notice that with the exception of the period 1979-81,
the increment of traffic in the whole IR occurred mainly in the
quadrilateral and diagonals. Currently, 5,345 route kms on IR are
electrified but with the exception of Delhi-Calcutta, the sections are
less than 800 route km long (see Map 17454), which requires frequent
changes in motive power, and impedes the use of electric traction for long
distance traffic where the benefit is larger (para 3.10). Another problem
is that due to rather short electrified sections scattered all over the
country, the maintenance facilities are either not fully utilized, or
inadequate for electric traction. The completion of the electrification
of the main system (quadrilateral and diagonals) will permit run through
trains and reduce the difference of speeds between goods and passenger
trains, with the subsequent increase in throughputs.
4.04      The strategy of the proposed project is to increase IR capacity
through electrification, accelerated workshop modernization, together with
improvements in IR organization and improvements in Indian industrial
technology in selected key areas where current, locally manufactured
equipment is outmoded and inhibiting the modernization effort. This is
particularly evident in the electrical equipment industry. Moreover, the
provision of an OHE recording/testing car, OHE maintenance vehicles,
improvement of locomotive radio communication in the Ghat operation,
modernization of workshop equipment, and general technical advisory
services and training, will contribute ro technological improvements in
IR. Alternative ways of increasing railway capacity such as construction
of third track adjacent to existing double track lines, or construction of
a new double-track line, were discarded on the basis of high estimated
costs, operational difficulties and the lack of readily available land and
construction resources (high quality rails and sleepers).



-32-
4.05      The economic case for the proposed project rests, therefore, on
a balanced package of components with the overall main objective of
increasing the capacity of IR to efficiently cope with traffic demands.
With the project, IR will be able to uake better use of its assets and to
accelerate its improvement in performance in order to allow it to meet the
increasing demands of the Seventh and subsequent Five-Year Plans, while
avoiding a larger share of long haul goods being diverted to the more
costly road transport system.
4.06      All the major physical components of the project have been
evaluated individually: (a) the electrification of ten main line sections
(accounting for 66% of total project financial costs); and (b) the
modernization of six shops, ICF and maintenance depots (32%). No separate
economic analysis has been carried out for the acquisition of OHE
recording/testing car, OHE maintenance vehicles, locomotive radio
communication for Chat operation, and technical advisory service and
training, all of which amount to only 2% of total project costs.
However, these costs were included without quantifying their benefits, in
the calculation of the overall economic return of the project.
B. Electrification of Main Lines
(a) Traffic
4.07      The part of the quadrilateral (Delhi-Bombay-Madras-Calcutta) and
its diagonals to be electrified has been divided in ten homogenous
sections based on type of terrain, expected construction cost per
route-kl, existing geometric characteristics, current and future traffic
volume, traffic mix, etc. Table 12 shows the ten sections, their length
in RKM, traffic in GTKM for passenger and goods in 1976/77 and 1981/82,
and the resulting traffic density in GTKM/RICM per year. All sections are
at present double track except Section 7: Itarsi-Nagpur and Section 10:
Annuppur-Bilaspur. Doubling of Itarsi-Nagpur is now under construction,
and it is assumed it will be completed by 1986-87. 1/
(b)  Traffic Forecasts        ,
4.08      The expected development of railway freight and passenger
traffic in the sections to be electrified for 1986/87, 1990/91 and
2010/2011 is outlined in Table 13. The forecast of freight traffic is
based on the present traffic composition in each section by commodities,
and in the railway traffic growth estimates of the main commodity groups
1/ Table 13 was developed under the assumption that Itarsi-Nagpur will
be double track.



-33-
made in Annex C of the Staff Appraisal Report for the Railway
Modernization and Maintenance II Project, dated October 26, 1982 (Loan
2210-IN/Credit 1299-IN), which is included in this SAR for information
purposes. No significant changes have occurred in the economy of the
country in the last year to justify the preparation of a new forecaut.
For illustration purposes, the assumed commodity-wise forecast was the
so-called Scenario 2 (intermediate case) in that report, and resulted in
the following annual percentage growths:
1981/82        1985/86
until          until
Commodity                         1984/85         1990/91
Coal                                6.0             6.0
Foodgrain                           2.3             2.2
Iron and Steel                      3.6             2.4
Cement                              1.1             1.3
Fertilizers                         3.9             4.2
Petroleum Products                  2.6             1.5
Others                             -2.0            -2.0
For the period 1991192 until 2010/2011, section traffic forecast estimates
were made consistent with the forecasts for the decade of the eighties.
The resulting annual traffic growth rates by sections during the period
1986/90 result in estimates as high as 5% for Section 9:
Bina-Katni-Anuppur, with about 75Z of coal traffic, and as lcw as 2.1% for
Section 1: Jhansi-Itarsi, where about three-quarters of the traffic is
composed of foodgrains, cement and others. Given some fluctuations of
coal traffic in recent years (see Table 4) and with the purpose of using
them in sensitivity analysis, traffic growth rates by sections were also
calculated assuming 3% growth rate for coal instead of the 6% mentioned
previously.
4.09 The commodity-based railway traffic growths of Scenario 2 are
considered to be realistic, possibly somewhat on the conservative side.
These are slightly less than the forecast made in the same report using
another methodology based on macroeconomic considerations, and are
consistent with the revised IR traffic projections.l/
1/ Scenario 2, Commodity-based forecasts: total all traffic 190.8 billion
ton-km for 1984/85 and 231.8 billion ton-km for 1990/91, while the
Scenario 1 (conservative) based on macroeconomic considerations,
forecasts 192 and 239 billion ton-km, respectively, and IR forecasts
186.2 and 227.6 billion ton-km respectively.



-34-
4.10      Based on the inter-urban projections made in Annex C of the
above-mentioned SAR for Railways Modernization and Maintenance II Project,
the passenger-km annual traffic growth for 1986-1990 was assumed to be a
conservative 3.2% for all sections, and 2% thereafter.
(c) Economic Evaluation
4.11      All the sectlons to be electrified have high traffic density, 2/
and, therefore, all alternative motive power without the project is
diesel. Thus, the economic analysis should compare the total incremental
cost of electrifying the present liues (civil engineering, signaLling and
telecommuuication, and electrical engineering) with the incremental
benefits of electric traction as compared with diesel traction performing
the same function. These benefits include higher locomotive-km per day
per locomotive in use, a substitution ratio of electric vs. diesel locomo-
tives of less than one, lower locomotive maintenance costs, higher locomo-
tive availability and reliability, higher average speed, higher initial
cost but longer life, and energy savings.
4.12      The economic cost of electrifying each section has been obtained
by deducting from the financial cost all relevant taxes, duties and price
contingencies. Moreover, certain materials and labor component have been
shadow-priced. This results in economic costs for each section which are
about 80% of the corresponding financial costs. An economic life of 25
years has been assumed for the project, and no salvage value has been
considered either for the infrastructure or for the motive power.
4.13      Under these circumstances, the electrifLcation of the proposed
sections is well justified, with the following economic rate of returns
(ER) for each section in the base case:
Section                        ER X (Base case)
1.   Jhansi-Itarsi                         23.5

all double line sections will have a density of more than 20 million
GTKM per RKM per year by 1988-89, which is assumed to be the first
year of energization of project lines.

Table 14 for Jhansi-Itarsi shows an example of the economic evaluation
analysis made for each section. Similar Tables for the remaining sections
can be found in the Project File. The opportunity cost of capital in
India is estimated to be 12%, and all sections have higher ER, with the
exception of section 10: Anuppur-Bilaspur, where ER is only marginally
less by about 1%.
4.14      Given the small length of the Annupur-Bilaspur section (151 km),
its location in the proposed electrified network (Map 17454), and the fact
that electrification of other sections is well justified, the general
assumptions made in the economic analysis for this section need modifica-
tions. The values adopted in the general case for the without-project
situation (diesel) reflect average conditions in the country, and in the
case of this section, some of the values should be adjusted to reflect
inefficiencies of operating a small section with diesel traction whiLe
almost all adjacent sections are electrified. It is conservatively
assumed that this situation would result in a reduction of 10% in the
number of diesel locomotive-km per day, a reduction of 5% in the dieseL
locomotive availability and an increase of 5X in diesel locomotive main-
tenance cost. The resulting ER is an acceptable 14%. Therefore, it is
concluded that the electrification component is clearly justified.
4.15      Cost and input prices included in the base case reflect the
prevailing ones in India, shadow-priced to represent the real economic
value to the economy.   In any event, it was found that some of them
differ with respect to average international prices, and for that reason
another economic analysis was carried out for each section adjusting some
cost and prices to reflect international values. 11 Under these circum-
stances, the new economic rates of return resulted to be:

(d) Sensitivity analysis
4.16      Table 15 presents the economic rates of return for several
sensitivity cases analyzed for each of the ten sections to be electrified.
As a general comment, and with the sole exception of the number of km per
day run by electric locomotives on goods services (Run 1) which is
analyzed in the following paragraph, the ER is only moderately sensitive
with respect to the different cases. All sections remain above or very
close to the opportunity cost of capital of 12%.
4.17      The ERs of the sections are very sensitive to changes in the
assumed locomotive-km per day per locomotive in use for electric locomo-
tives on goods services. Chart 25798 shows the variation of ERs with
respect to values from 500 km/day (the value assumed for diesel traction)
up to 700 km/day. Chart 25798 shows that, as an average, an increase of
only 10 km/day for electric locomotives for goods, increases the ER by
about 1%, which is a clear indication of the importance of this variable
in the economic return of the project, and therefore it constitutes an
element which has to be very carefully monitored by IR to ensure the best
possible return. With the exception of 7, 8 and 10, Chart 25798 shows
that all sections have ER higher than 12% even under the assumption that
electric traction achieves no higher daily kilometrage than diesel. For
Section 7, the break-even point is at about 540 km/day (8% increase over
diesel) and for Sections 8 aud 10 at about 550 km/day (10% increase over
diesel), which should be easy to achieve based on the relative advantages
of electric traction (fuelLing, sanding, inspections, acceleration, adhe-
sion, etc.) over diesel.
4.18      The sensitivity of ER with respect to traffic growth rates for
goods by sections is analyzed in Run 3, Table 15, and the rates are more
conservative than the rates based on a 3% growth rate for coal (see
pdra 4.08). Several other sensitivity analysis were carried out to test
the effects of changes in the values of different variables on the
economic rate of return. Even under unfavorable assumptions (Table 15),
the ERs remained within the range of about 10-45%, which is acceptable.

C. Workshop Modernization
4.19    The main objective of the Workshop Master Plan (para 3.22) is to
develop an integrated maintenance and repair network on a national basis.
The plan envisages rationalization of existing POH activities in order to
derive the advantages of specialization and economies of scale, which are
expected co result in higher productivity and improved quality of work.
This component of the proposed project is a major step in this direction.
Jagadhri workshop would expand wagon POH capacity. At Ajmer, coaching POH
capacity would be substantially increased. Kharagpur workshop would be
modified to take up the periodic overhauls of electric locomotives. Parel
and Golden Rock workshops would be modified for the increased requirement
of diesel POH.  The proposed project also includes provision of machinery
and equipment for maintenance depots to arrest further deterioration in
their maintenance and manufacturing capability. The number of workshops
*.n the IR system would be reduced from 47 to 37 by the year 2C3O. Out of
the 37 remaining, 28 would deal with a single POH activity. The proposed
project would also address the crucial problem of augmenting the capacity
of coach production by modernizing the Integral Coach Factory (ICF).
4.20      The total economic cost of this element of the project would
amount to about Rs 3,055 million (Table 16), after deducting import duties
and price contingencies and assuming shadow prices for certain inputs such
as labor, steel and cement. A residual value of 50% for civil works and
10% for mechanical and electrical components have been assumed after an
economic life of 15 years. It has been estimated that the proposed
project will (a) reduce the idle time of locomotives and rolling stock
during POH and increase their reliability, which altogether will result in
savings in the number of locomotives, coaches and wagons needed to carry
the ever-increasing traffic and to replace existing fleet; (b) reduce the
cost of POR through a more efficient maintenance operation; (c) increase
the POH annual capacity thus preventing the accelerated deterioration of
part of the fleet (15% of coaches, 24% of wagons, 15% of locomotives)
which are currently overdue for POH; and (d) increase the annual
production of coaches avoiding the likely need to import them. Under
these circumstances, the proposed modernization of each sub-component is
well justified (Table 16) with economic rates of return between 18% and
50%. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis indicates that under different
situations (a cost increase of 20%, a benefit decrease of 20%, or a
two-year lag in benefits) all projects remain above or very close to the
opportunity cost of capital of 12%.
D. Overall Evaluation
4.21      The project~s overall economic return is 25.0%, including the
cost of components not separateLy evaluated. A sensitivity analysis
indicates that a decrease in benefits of 20% would reduce the overall rate
of return to 19.5%, while a 2U% increase in costs would reduce it to
20.5%; a combination of the two variations would yield a rate of return of
15.5%.



-38-
4.22      The main beneficiaries of the project are the power, industrial
and agricultural sectors, particularly the main public and private
industrial enterprises, and inter-city passengers. Through the power and
agricultural sectors, a large portion of small industries and rural
population will also benefit from the proposed investment.
E. Risks
4.23      All project components involve proven technology and therefore
technical risks connected with the project are small. Additionally, in
the past.IR has successfully implemented similar projects in a timely
manner, and has built up competent managerial and technical expertise.
Risks from inadequate project implementation are therefore negligible.
V. FINANCE AND EARNINGS
A. Introduction
5.01      GOI's financial policy towards IR is designed to allow it to
earn net revenues sufficient to cover all expenses including depreciation
and a dividend to GOI. Funds for capital expenditure,. which do no:
pertain to replacement of assets, are provided by GOI and are added to a
Capital-at-Charge account, which is a liability of IR in perpetuity and on
which IR is expected to pay a dividend at a rate recommended by a
Parliamentary Committee from time to time. The present rate of dividend
on current investments is about 6.5X per annum. The dividend, in reality,
is more like an interest payment as IR is expected to meet this obligation
whether or not it generates sufficient net revenues. IR finances capital
expenditure for asset replacement by a charge against revenues through the
Depreciation aeserve Fund (DRF). IR proposes rates and fares increases at
the beginning of a fiscal year based on its expected resources and
forecast of traffic to be carried by it in the ensuing year. The
assumption is that the rates and fares set at the traffic level forecasted
would result in revenues sufficient to meet the financial policy. As IR
is a departmental undertaking of GOI, the commercial freedom allowed IR is
constrained by Government policy.
5.02      Financial arrangements with the Government and audit procedures
are, with some improvements noted later, the same as when the first IR
Modernization Project was appraised in 1978. The accounting function is
efficient, well organized and well staffed with satisfactory budget
control and operating systems. A formal traffic costing function has been
established recently and IR is continually making improvements to this



-39-
important activity. In addition to a large and efficient internal audit,
an exhaustive statutory audit is conducted under the direction of the
Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C.&A.G), who reports to the
Parliament through the Public Accounts Committee. Audit arrangements are
thorough and satisfactory. Audit financial statements are finalized
within eight months of year end and presented to Parliament within ten
months. At the same time, IR-s revised estimaten for the current year and
budget estimates for the following year are presented to Parliament for
approval. IR has under previous credits consistently provided IDA with
interim and completed (audited) accounts. IR also provides reports of
project expenditure in a timely manner and to the satisfaction of IDA.
During negotiations GOI confirmed that, in accordance with sound
accounting and auditing principles and procedures approved by C.&A.G.,
it will ensure that IR maintains records and accounts to reflect their
resources, expenditures and operations related to the project and have
IR-s accounts for each fiscal year audited.
B. Recent Changes in Financial Policies
5.03      Some beneficial changes in financial practices have been made in
recent years and GOI is now considering measures which would give IR
greater commercial freedom and set performance targets. The most
important recent change relates to IRs obligation to pay a dividend to
GOI in years when its earnings are insufficient to generate a net surplus.
Prior to 1979 IR was required to take interest bearing loans from GOI to
pay dividend, but at present, amount of dividend unpaid is carried forward
as a deferred dividend liability without interest. This change is
reasonable and removes an unnecessary financial burden placed on IR. The
dividend liability as at March 31, 1983 amounts to Rs 4,163 million.
5.04      In 1977, the Government convened a high level independent
committee - The Rail Tariff Enquiry Committee (RTEC) to review lR's
freight rates, passenger fares and IRs operational efficiency. The
Committee issued its reports in June 1980, and as part of its overall
review, also covered areas of Government policy and practices, made
comparisons of IR-s operations with both Western Railways and those of the
USSR and China. The report is of an excellent standard and reflects a
good professional examination of IR-s operations. It contains 386
recommendations and suggestions.
5.05      Key recommendations of RTEC include:  (a) IR be allowed to earn
a 10% rate of return on investment and the excess over 6% due GOI as
dividend be used by IR for development purposes; (b) provision for repairs
and maintenance in the past has been inadequate and IR should be allowed
to catch up on arrears and more funds from now on should be provided for
this critical activity; (c) funds for the Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF)
have been under-provided in recent years and should be substantially
increased based on IR-s needs and an expert group be appointed to



-40-
recommend the appropriate methodology for calculation of depreciation;
(d) tariff increases, rather than being assessed on "cost plus" basis,
should be related to efficiency. A formula is suggested which uses
1976177, being the most efficient year of railways operations, as a
yard-stick. Tariff fares would be increased annually by indexing the
increase to the change in prices of the major inputs of IR-s costs,
including labor, fuel and steel; (e) tariff rates should be set to cover
the total costs attributable to that stream of traffic; cross
subsidization, from freight to passenger, should not be allowed; (f) cost
of social burdens such as lines built for strategic purposes, should be
eliminated and IR be fully compensated when a decision is made for IR to
provide a service which it would not normally do on commercial grounds;
(g) other recommended reforms in operational, personnel, costing and
marketing activities; and (h) IR's management structure and promotion
practices should be reviewed and changed to support a greater degree of
commercial freedom. The recommendations envisage financial reforms which
provide a framework within which IR would be able to operate more like a
commercial entity.
5.06      The most significant of the (RTEC) recommendations have been
implemented with profound implications on IRCs finances. Consecutively
for the four years 1980/81 - 1983/84, rates and fares have been adjusted
upwards by GOI/IR exceeding percentage targets recommended by RTEC. These
increases have meant total additional revenues to IR of Rs 1,500 million
with some 67% accruing from freight and 33% from passenger, respectively,
over the four-year period. In April 1983, IR introduced a revised
rationalized tariff structure which is based on the principle of
recovering the fully distributed cost of the commodity/class of travel.
Consequently, no commodity is carried below its avoidable cost, losses on
passenger operations are declining in percentage terms over previous
years= losses and in percentage terms to total revenue. Season tickets in
terms of single journey tickets have been adjusted to levels recommended
in the RTEC report. Details of tariff adjustments are on project file.
Appropriations to DRF have been significantly stepped up to a more
adequate level (see para 5.16) and more intensive use of costing
techniques are being made by IR. The thrust has been to enhance the
ability of IR to generate internally financial resources for capital and
maintenance requirements and to enable it to earn more than adequate rate
of return on its average net fixed assets. RTEC recommendations on
organizational changes have wider implications and GOI appointed a Railway
Reforms Committee (RRC) in May 1981 to examine them in depth and to
recommend appropriate action to be taken by the Government. This
Committee will also examine IR's depreciation policy and is expected to
issue its report in 1984. RTEC recommendations are complex and many are
under constant review and updating. Progress to-date on implementation of
the recommendations has been satisfactory and further action is being
taken (para 5.10).



-41-
C. Rates and Fares
5.07      In the past, a tariff policy has been followed which has tended
to subsidize large segments of freight (essential basic commodities) and
passenger traffic (second class ordinary). Traffic costing is an integral
part of tariff formulation and continual refinements to the traffic
costing techniques are being made. No direct subsidies are involved, but
GOI exempts IR from payment of dividend in respect of the capital invested
in strategic lines, uuremunerative brauch lines and on construction of
certain new lines. Subsidies on surburban traffic which does not cover
its avoidable cost continues by other services. At negotiations, it was
explained by GOI/IR that passenger fare increases granted in the recent
past years have been significantly more than those recommended by RTEC,
and further action will be taken to reduce losses on passenger traffic and
in particular, on suburban traffic.
D. Past Performance

>Credit figure.
5.09      IR has earned revenues which are greater than its total
operating expenses, which include depreciation. However, IR has not
always been able to meet its full dividend liability. IR had its best
results in FY78, generating a large surplus. The increase in revenues
subsequent to FY78 was mainly attributable to tariff increases. The total
working expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 74.0% in
FY78 to only 72.8% in FY83. Fuel as a percentage of total working
expenses increased from 19.0% in FY78 to 23.9% in FY83. While staff costs
came down from 55.2% in FY78 to 49.1% in FY83 (Table 19), substantial
increases in appropriation to DRF in FY83 were made over FY78; Rs 5,560
million, compared to Rs 1,400 million respectively (an increase of about
400%). Despite this increase, IR generated a surplus in FY83 covering
fully its dividend payment.
5.10      For the reasons stated above and because the traffic carried
fell short of the forecast, IR was not able to pay the full dividend in
YY80 and FY81 as required by GOI policy and in agreement with Credit
844-IN. For FY82 and FY83, IR has met the financial covenant requirements
of Credit 844-IN and Loan 2210-IN/Credit 1299-IN. The basic handicap in
IR-s financial arrangement is dependence on an annual decision by GOI
notably on the level of tariff (limitation of administrative prices) and
capital investments. GOI has recognized that IR should be financially
viable and generate sufficient financial resources to substantially meet



-43-
its development programs. Accordingly, in line with RTEC recommendations,
GOI has and continues to take action as pointed out previously. Further
action by GOI is contemplated when the findings of the Railway Reforms
Committee are issued (para 5.06).
5.11      Historically, GOI has kept tariffs at levels much below the
increases in the cost of IR's inputs or changes in general price levels
(Table 20). In addition, IR has to absorb losses on such services as
suburban and short distance travel, uuremunerative lines, etc. These are
termed as "social burden" costs by IR and during FY80 and FY81 were
estimated at Rs 2,400 million and Rs 4,200 million, respectively (about
10% and 16% of revenues, respectively). Had IR been compensated for these
costs, it would have generated a large profit to cover the dividend
payment for FY80 and FY81 and had a surplus about Rs 1,700 million and
Rs 2,200 million, respectively.
E. Future Prospects
5.12      Revenue and expenditure account forecasts of IR have been made
using the conservative traffic forecast of "Scenario II" (see paras 2.14
and 2.15). Budget estimate of IR for FY84 has been used as a base year
for developing forecast for FY86 to FY90. These are summarized below and
shown in detail in Table 21. Balance sheets are shown in Table 22.

-45-
5.13      Revenue and expenditure account estimates for the period FY86 to
FY90 have been projected using prices, rates, fares and expenses at April
1983 levels. Conservative assumptions on improvements in operating
efficiency resulting from the proposed and ongoing projects have been
included. The forecasts include provision for significant increases in
DRF and PF, but do not include any provision for increase in tariffs,
changes in the financial policies of GOI, or allowances for inflation. On
these assumptions and using "Scenario II" traffic level, the above table
indicates that tariffs would need to be raised from FY86 and onwards to
generate revenues high enough to meet full dividend payment--and meet the
covenant of the existing and proposed Bank Group projects. Also, IR was
unable to cover full dividend payment required under Credit 844-IN and
Loan 2210-IN/Credit 1299-IN for FY84 and is not expected to meet it in
FY85 by a small amount. This situation, however, is considered to be
temporary and has occurred because of economic recession in India and
worldwide. Consequently, expected traffic levels did not materialize,
resulting in IR not meeting the revenue covenant. GOI is committed to the
financial viability of IR and during negotiations, it was agreed that GOI
will maintain passenger fares and freight rates and take all other actions
as may be necessary or appropriate, so as to provide to the Railways net
revenue sufficient to enable the Railways to meet out of inter-
nally-generated resources all operating expenses (including depreciation)
and dividend payments on Capital-at-Charge.
5.14      By FY90 revenues are projected to increase by about 27% over
FY85 as a result of tariff increases granted April 1, 1983 and traffic
increases. Total working expenses are expected to increase by about 22%
because of the high proportion of variable costs. Total operating expen-
ses on the other hand are expected to register a much higher increase
(about 28%) mainly because of increased allocations to depreciation (DRF).
The likely levels of annual tariff revenue increases needed to pay full
dividend with traffic at Scenario II levels for the period FY86 to FY90
have been estimated as follows:
'Y86   FY87   FY88   FY89   FY90
In real terms       2%     2%      2%     2%      27.
5.15      The DRF in IR is in effect a renewal and replacement fund and
not a depreciation provision in the normal accounting sense.  In the past,
contribution of funds to DRF has proved to be insufficient to take care of
need-based replacements as it has been determined on an annual basis,
influenced by availability of financial resources and physical constraints
in the form of productive capacity in the country (e.g., how many wagons
can be manufactured) and the complexities in ascertaining the exact timing



-46-
of replacements. This has led to a situation where IR is burdened with a
high percentage of overaged and obsolete assets which are a restraint on
capacity and produce high costs. Increased allocation would permit more
rapid replacement of old and obsolete assets, which would in turn improve
operational efficiency (increase revenue) and would result in reduction of
maintenance costs, which now constitute about 40Z of working expenses.
Recognizing this and the need to catch up on arrears and in a sharp
departure from the previous practice, IR has appropriated a sum of Rs
8,500 million to the DRF during FY84. It is expected that this trend will
not only be continued but may be improved upon as IR has given high
priority to "rehabilitation" of its assets. If the trend is maintained,
IR should be making a substantial contribution to the DRF to cater to the
large requirement for rehabilitation of its assets. Since the Seventh
Five-Year Plan is in formulating stages, it was agreed during negotiations
that appropriation to DRF for FY85 to FY89 will be at least equal to that
of FY84 (Rs 8,500 million).
5.16      A sensitivity analysis using the alternative traffic forecasts
Scenario I and III and at current tariff Levels indicates that IR would be
able to cover all of its operating expenses, but would not be able to
fully meet its dividend obLigation in years FY86 to FY90 (para 5.14).

the Capital-at-Charge and temporary loans. This would be in sharp
contrast to previous years when GOI financed 60% or more of development
funds required by IR. Forecast financial statements have been prepared on
the basis of IR-s preliminary estimates of planned investment for the
period FY86 to FY90.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached with GOI on the
following principal matters:
(a)  IR will be provided budget allocations sufficient to carry out
an agreed training program (paras 3.27 and 3.28);
(b)  IR will ensure that at all times the electrification
implementation unit and COFMOW will be adequately staffed for
the implementation of the respective project components (paras
3.33 and 3.35);
(c)  GOI will maintain passenger fares and freight rates and shall
take all other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate, so
as to provide to the Railways net revenue sufficient to enable
the Railways to meet out of internally-generated resources all
operating expenses and dividend on Capltal-at-Charge
(para 5.13); and
(d)  GOI will ensure that appropriation to DRF for FY85 to FY89 would
at least be equal to that of FY84 (para 5.15).
6.02      It is recommended that condition of effectiveness for the
proposed loan should be the selection of consultants who will be
collaborating with GOI/IR in implementing the OIS (para 2.28).
6.03      Based on the agreements reached on the foregoing, the proposed
project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$280.7 million
equivalent.

Notes on IR-s Motive Power and Rolling Stock
Traction Policy
1.        IR-s traction policy has been under continuous review in the
last two decades. The two most important studies on traction policy were
a "Study of Electrification and Dieselization on Indian Railways" in 1963
(known as the Sahai Committee Report), and the National Council of Applied
Economic Research Study of 1970. These studies set the 1970s policy for a
moderate pace of electrification of railway lines in the country coupled
with an effort for rapid replacement of steam traction by diesel and
electric. Various other studies on traction have been recently carried
out by GOI/IR, these are listed in Annex A and included in the Project
File.
Diesel Electric Locomotives
2.        The standard main line diesel electric locomotive manufactured
by IR is WDM2, which is a L6-cylinder, 6-axle BG mixed traffic locomotive
rated at 2600 grossI2400 net hp. 1/ WDNIZ manufacture began in India in
1964 iu collaboration with ALCO, United States, and the design is about
32 years old. WDM2 has an adequate operating and maintenance performance
and is the prime mover of IR-s rapidly growing freight traffic. However,
IR will benefit substantially from introducing into the present and future
WDM2 fleet technology developed since the present designs were acquired.
Also the continued increase in IR's need for imported diesel fuel and
rising costs have made it even more important for the railways to improve
the efficiency of its motive power in general and diesel locomotives in
particular. There is significant potential for improved fuel efficiency
of the existing fleet of DLW-built diesel engines. In addition, IR
requires a medium range horsepower main line diesel electric locomotive
for work train, branch line operation and other light duties in order to
eliminate steam traction completely from trunk routes.
1/ There are two other versions of this locomotive built for main line NG
service and heavy duty BG shunting: YDM4 and WDM6.



-52-
Annex B
Page 2 of 3
Electric Locomotives
3.        The present AC electric locomotive manufactured in India,
designated the WAM4, was derived by IR-s own Research, Design and
Standards Organization (RDSO) from an Alsthom design of the 50 Hz Group
and is approximately 27 years old. The only major change made to the
design was the replacement of the original mono-motor bogie by axle-hung
motors and the three-axle bogie of the WDM2 diesel electric locomotive
manufactured by IR. When the WAM4 locomotive was first introduced, there
were numerous performance problems. Although problems of the traction
motors have been gradually eliminated, the electrical controls and
transformer are still unable to provide adequate power for the motors.
Obsolescence of WAM4 design and features has resulted in lower
availability and higher operating and maintenance costs.
4.        A geographically specific problem of electric traction occurs at
the major industrial center and port of Bombay which are connected to the
rest of the IR network by two 1,500 V DC electrified lines. These two
lines are Bombay-Igatpuri on the northeast section and Bombay-Pune on the
southeast section. The northeast approach to Bombay includes a
heavy-graded 14 km section, known in India as the ghat section, with a
gradient of 1 in 33 (compensated) and a 67 km hilly section with a
gradient of I in 37.5 (compensated). The southeast approach has a 28 km
ghat section with a gradient of 1 in 37 (compensated). The present
classes of locomotives manufactured by IR and used on the ghat sections
have proved unsatisfactory for the specific requirements of banking
duties, causing frequent wheel slips, stalls and partings of trains. In
addition, due to inadequate capability of the existing locomotives, the
train load limits on the graded DC sections are lower than load limits on
adjacent AC electrified sections. Thus, the train loads have to be
reduced prior to entering the DC ghat sections. As a result, operating
costs and line-capacity utilization are adversely affected, indicating a
need for special duty DC electric banking locomotives or partial
conversion to AC traction for these sections.
Wagons
5.        During 1950-s practically all freight was being carried in
general purpose wagons - the covered, open high sided and open low sided
wagons. To be able to cope with the pattern of traffic, the proportion of
the special type of stock has been increasing over the years. Now a
number of new bogie wagons, with emphasis on higher payload and
specialized facilities for loading and unloading, have been put into
service and the number of such wagons is increasing.
6.        The present high capacity open-wagon design used by IR is an
eight-wheeler wagon (box) with a plate-fabricated bogie, an over-buffers



-53-
Annex B
Page 3 of 3
length of 13.73 meters and a net capacity of 56 tons. With the existing
loop length on IR, this wagon design limits the maximum gross tonnage of
the freight trains to about 3,500 tons and a net of 2,400 tons on the
Broad Gauge. Tests have shown that with a cast bogie, presently
manufactured in India in limited numbers, and equipped with cartridge-type
tapered roller bearings, the capacity of the open top wagon can be
increased to 58 net tons with an over-buffers length of 10.71 meters.
This new higher-capacity design has been labeled by IR, Box N wagon and is
in the process of being introduced on IR. The introduction of type N
wagon in IR would increase the gross train loads to about 4,500 tons with
3,200 net tons within the existing loop length. In addition, since such
wagons will be put into dedicated unit train operation for major users,
they will be equipped with air brakes. This will enable an increase in
the allowable speed of Box N wagons to 100 km/h without increasing the
braking distance, as compared to IR-s present vacuum brake fleet, creating
a potential for increased line capacity and service improvements to the
users.
7.        In conclusion, since the acquisition of designs and start up of
manufacture of locomotives in India, considerable improvements and
innovations have taken place elsewhere in diesel and electric traction
technology which have resulted in reduced manufacturing, operational and
maintenance costs and improved operating performance. These improvements
have yet to be incorporated into locomotives manufactured by IR. At the
same time, major design changes in rolling stock area are urgently needed
to tap a very large potential source for improving asset utilization and
reduced transport costs. Alas, these potentials might go unexploited
because of the painstakingly slow and uncoordinated technical
decision-making process in IR and GOI's policies which discouraged
introduction of new technologies which will increase the country-s
dependence on imports of parts and components.

Railway Traffic Forecasts
I. Macroeconomic Considerations
1.01      The growth of the country's economy during the Fourth-Year Plan
(1968/69-1973/74) was slower than predicted.  Instead of the targetted
5.5%, GDP grew at a real rate of about 3.4% per annum. The end of the
Plan period was marked by a number of adverse events, internal (the
1972/73 drought) as well as external (the Bangladesh conflict and the
steep rise in world grain and petroleum prices of 1973). After a period
of difficult adjustment, however, the GDP (at factor cost) grew at an
annual average rate of 5.3% between 1975/76 and 1978/79. This performance
was slightly below the Fifth Year Plan's target of 5.5% p.a., 1/ but it
compares very favorably with a long-term trend of growth rate of GDP at
3.7% p.a. from 1950/51 to 1978/79.
1.02      1979/80 was a year of serious economic decline, underscored by
a severe drought which produced a fall of about 16% in agricultural
production, and by a deterioration of industrial production, which
registered a decline of 1.4% after four years with an average rate of
growth of about 7%. The decline in industrial production was largely due
to shortfalls in the production of major inputs such as coal, steel and
cement, as well as constraints in the provision of infrastructure, notably
power and transportation. GDP declined by about 5%. As a consequence of
these developmerts, the remarkable price stability that characterized the
Indian et aomy after 1975 gave way to a sudden rise in the level of prices
after 1979/80.
1.03      During 1980/81, the economy started to recover.  Weather was
normal, which allowed a recovery in agricultural production, which rose by
more than 15%. Close attention to the performance of infrastr ':...ural
services and the availability of basic goods improved their supp?.y
beginning in the middle of the year, resulting in a growth in industrial
production by 4%; GDP rose by 7.5%.
1/ The Fifth Plan was originally envisaged to cover the period
1974/75-1979/80, but it was cut short by the defeat of the Congress
party during the elections of 1978.



-57-
Annex D
Page 2 of 14
1.04      During 1981/82, the economy largely completed the recovery
phase, resulting in a year of soLid growth on top of the rebound of
1980/81. Even though the 1981 monsoon withdrew early and foodgrain
production was only 2X-3% higher than in 1980/81, production of other
crops was better. The total agricultural output grew by about 4%.
Industrial output continued to recover from the supply problems which
earlier had constrained the economy and grew by over 8%. GDP grew by
around 5.5%. Inflation is cLearly decelerating as wholesale prices rose
by about 10% on average annual basis, compared to 17% in 1979/80, and 18Z
in 1980/81.
1.05      In the 1980-s, the country's economy is shifting from a
situation of resource surplus which characterized the last half of the
1970-s, to one of resource scarcity. The economy is facing basic
infrastructural and supply constraints whose relaxation requires
substantial domestic investments and an unprecedented mobilization of
foreign resources. In the current Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980-85), GOI
gives high priority to expansion of irrigation and rural development and
to investments in the energy sector. The share of investment in the
transport sector dropped from 14% of the total in the Fifth Plan to 12.7%
in the Sixth. The financing of this ambitious Plan relies heavily on
raising the domestic savings rate from its already high level and in
reducing a rapidly rising import bill while boosting the traditionally
weak export sector.  To attain these targets, India must avoid imports
that can be produced economically at home, must accelerate exports,
mobilize and then utilize aid at a faster rate than hitherto and borrow
more on non-concessional terms.
1.06      The final size of the public sector outlay under the Plan has
been fixed at Rs 975 billion (US$90.3 billion equivalent) at 1979/80
prices but this figure could be raised duriug the mid-term Plan review).
This is, in real terms, 80% higher than the outlay in the Five-Year Plan.
The mobilization of the large volume of domestic and foreign resources
required to finance this plan will no doubt take some time to materialize.
The Plan advocates an average annual growth rate in GDP of 5.3% between
1980/81 and 1984/85. The Bank Group-s Economic Report 1/ projects a real
growth rate of 6% in 1981/82, followed by a 5% per year for the period
1982/83 to 1984/85.

II. Traffic Forecasts
(a) Freight
2.01      Railways and road transport account for about 96% of India"s
freight traffic. Traffic carried by these modes increased from 50 to 269
billion ton-km8 between 1950/51 and 1979/80, or by 5.4 times during this
period. The change in the ahare of each of the two main transport modes
in the total and the comparison of their growth with that of GDP at factor
cost (at 1970/71 prices) is shown below:

2.02      As has long been established, there is a close correlation
between growth of ton-km and GDP for most countries. In the case of
Intia, the ratio of ton-km to GDP shows considerable stability over time,
par.icularly after 1965/66. This indicator of the link between economic
development and the transport sector has been used as a criterion to
establish a boundary to expected future growth in railway traffic. This
criterion is used in this analysis as one of the guidelines in
establishing expected rail traffic.
2.03      Given the uncertainty which traffic forecasts entail, and
particularly bearing in mind the state of transition of the country-s

Page 4 of 14
economy, three scenarios have been tested to obtain estimates for the
eighties. The first one assumes an economic rate of growth of 3.7% p.a.
in line with the historical trend. The second scenario assumes an annual
rate of growth of GDP of 4.5%, as expected in WB-s Economic Report (see
para 1.06 above), but extended to cover the period 1980/81 to 1990/91.
The third alternative contemplates an annual growth of GDP in accordance
with the Sixth Plan (5.2% p.a.), also used as an average for the entire
decade. Basic assumptions used to establish an upper boundary in traffic
volumes are that: (i) the share of rail traffic in the transport sector
would be around 60%, prevalent value for the last few years (energy
conservation policy and latest improvements in operations support the
assumption of no further decline of railway share); and (ii) the ratio of
ton-km to GDP (at 1970/71 prices) would remain at 0.53, the average for
the period 1965/66-1981182. Given these assumptions, the forecast of
total overland and railway traffic would vary as follows:

/a  BTKms = Billion ton-kms.  In this Annex the analysis has been focused on this
parameter as the relevant unit of traffic rather than originating tons, or
equivalent four-wheeler wagons or other similar units used by IR.
/b Provisional value given by IR for 1981/82.
2.04      Since 1965/66 until 1977/78, the railway share of traffic has
been almost invariably around 67%. After that, (see Section H of Chapter
II) IR has had several problems that severely affected its production with
a consequent drop in its traffic share at the level of about 60%, but in
the last two years the recovery has been significant. The NTPC report
forecasted a possible share of railways in the order of 70%, but this
figure seems to be optimistic. The assumed 617. seems to be realistic,
possibly on the conservative side.
2.05      A more accurate forecast, of course, entails a detailed
examination of growth estimates for the main commodity groups moved by the



-60-
Annex D
Page 5 of 14
railways. As indicated by Table 4, in 1981/82 seven groups of commodities
made up 80.4% of revenue tonnage and 75.0% of revenue ton-kms.  These
commodities are coal, steel inputs and products, foodgrains, POL, iron ore
for export, cement and fertilizers. A detailed forecast per commodity
group follows.
(i) Coal
2.06       Coal constitutes the main domestic source of commercial energy
in India. The country's potential for hydroelectriLcity is estimated to be
100,000 MW of which 70,000 MW is economically exploitable. Only about
L1,000 MW is currently developed. Production of coal kept pace with
planned targets and was well ahead of demand between 1973/74 and 1975/76.
However, output increases could not be sustained after 1976/77 and coal
production stagnated around 100 million tons for the next three years,
falling behind the reduced demand for these years. During 1979/80 coal
production increased by 2% to 104 million tons and in 1980/81 the total
production was 114 million, a significant 10% annual growth. In 1981/82
the production is estimated to be about 124 million.
2.07       WB-s Economic Report finds GOI coal demand estimates generally
sound, although the assumed production targets, especially for steel and
cement, appear optimistic. GOI's estimates indicate an average annual
growth of demand of 10.1% for the period 1980/81-1985/86 and of 7.9% for
the whole period 1980/81-1989/90. On the supply side, GOI-s coal
production targets assume a 12.5% avera&, annual growth during the
1980/81-1984/85 period (from 112.71 to 179.19 million tons) and 9.7%
between 1984/85-1989/90 (up to 260.45 million tons). These production
targets are also deemed to be ambitious, particularly for the
1980/81-1984/85 period. IDAs Economic Report forecasts that for the coal
sector as a whole, output in 1984/85 should be in the region of 160-165
million tons 1/ which represents an annual growth of 8.8X as compared with
1980/81 production. Accordingly, it has been conservatively assumed that
coal availability would yearly grow by about 4.1%, 6.0% and 8.8% until
1984/85 and 7.5% thereafter during the period 1981/82 to 1990/91, and that
the railway share would remain fairly constant, taking into consideration
IR plans to increase the number of high capacity wagons (historicaL growth
from 1970/71 to 1979/80).
2.08       Average haul distances are expected to increase during the Sixth
Plan period due to the location of some new mines which are expected to
come into operation in the next few years, and the location and tonnage of
additional users, particularly the new cement and power plants in western
1/ See para. 5.90 of WB-s Economic Report.

Page 6 of 14
India, several of which are expected to be operating by 1984/85. However,
towards the end of the decade, the new high-power thermal stations are
expected to be in operation. Since they will be located closer to the
coal fields than previous ones, the average lead for coal will decrease.
Future traffic has been estimated to range between 49.4 and 56.4 billion
ton-kms in 1984/85 and between 62.9 and 87.0 billion ton-kms by the year
1990/91 (see Table 5).
(ii) Steel Plant Traffic
2.09      From 1970/71 to 1979/80 the average increase in output of both
ingot and saleable steel was over 3% per annum. However, the variations
in production throughout the decade were erratic with a very low increase
between 1970/71 and 1974/75 (1.17 for ingot and 2.1% for saleable steel)
followed by an upsurge in 1974/75-1976/77 of 16.0% and 19.27. annual rates
of growth for ingot and saleable steel, respectively, which gave way to a
decline of 5.1% p.a. for ingot and 13.5% p.a. for saleable steeL between
1977/78 and 1979/80. Production tonnages of pig iron, ingot and saleable
steel stood at 1.1 million, 8.0 million and 6.0 million, respectively,
during 1979/80. Current indications are that overall output for 1980/81
remained at about the 1979/80 level but a significant annual growth of
about 14% is expected for 1981/82. Consumption of finished steel during
the seventies grew faster than production, at a rate of about 5.5% p.a.,
the deficit being compensated by curtailing exports (India has been a net
exporter on and off for a number of years) and stepping up imports.
2.10      Total ingot steel capacity in integrated plants (the public
sector accounts for about 82% of large plant capacity in India) is
expected to be raised from 11.4 million tons in 1979/80 to 14.6 million
tons in 1984/85 and 22.6 million tons in 1989/90. The growth during the
Sixth Plan period would be from expansion, modernization and
rehabilitation of existing plants, while growth in the second half of the
decade would stem mostly from the addition of two new plants of 3.5
million tons and 3.0 million tonLs at Vishakapatnam and Paradip,
respectively. WB's Economic Report (paras 3.39-3.40), however, considers
these production targets difficult to achieve in view of the constraints
of power shortages and decline in the quality of coking coal in India,
combined with a number of technical difficulties relating to the quality
of raw materials and the choice of production processes, all of which
affect productivity. As a result, it is likely that net imports of steel
will be required through the end of the Eighties.
2.11      The transport requirements for steel plants comprise raw
materials and finished products. Coal used for steel production process
has already been analyzed in paras. 2.06-2.08 of this Annex. Iron ore for
steel production is included in the present analysis, while iron ore for
export is discussed in para 2.18 below. The average haul for raw



-62-
Annex D
Page 7 of 14
materials has remained fairly constant, while that for finished products
has Increased gradually 1.n the last two decades. Until the new plants
begin operations towards the end of the elghties, however, no major
varLations are expected in average haul. The transportation requlrement
of the import/export trade of fLnished steel has also been taken into
account; assuming, however, that a major pnrtion of the imported steel
would be destined for the urban centers and industrial areas around the
main ports (Bombay, Calcutta and Madras), which would be transported by
road.  Further, it has been assumed that modal shares for steel plants
would remain fairly atable. Based on these assumptions, the traffic
estimates for 1984/85 range between 16.5 and 17.5 billion ton-kms, and for
1990/91 between 18.5 and 20.5 blllion ton-kms, respectively.
(iiI) Foodgrains
2.12      Agriculture is the mainstay of India'a economy, employing over
two-thirds of the labor force. Foodgrains, in turn, dominate the
country's agriculture. The supply/demand balance of foodgrains in recent
years suggests a reduced and possibly eliminated need to import large
quantities of foodgrains, and if present trends continue, India could
become a significant foodgrain exporter. These developments have already
had a profound effect on the country's transport sector, mainly by
lengthening the average haul distances.
2.13      Production of foodgrains between 1967/68, a year of high yields,
and 1977/78, an unusually good year, grew at 2.37% per year. A longer
term trend (1960/61-1978/79) indicates an annual growth of 2.74%. The
Sixth Plan targets imply a substantial acceleration of the growth rate to
about 3.8% per annum. Assuming that the export/import element in the
foodgraiu global picture continues shrinking gradually, average haul
distances are expected to continue growlng faster than total tonnages due
to a combination of long hauls from the production centers in the North to
all deficit areas including the South, and to a larger proportion of short
to medium loads being captured by road transport. If, as it is also
assumed here, the policy of self-sufficiency for the various regions
continues to meet with success, a reversing trend would occur towards the
second half of the decade--average travel distances would tend to decrease
due to self-sufficLency at regional and national levels, while export of
foodgrains in significant volumes of diversification of agricultural
production, or both, may take place. As a consequence, total traffic
volumes are expected to stagnate. Accordingly, assuming a growth in
foodgrain production ranging from 2.5% to 3.0% p.a., traffic projections
(assuming a decrease in railway share of about 0.5 percentage points per
year) lead to estimated traffic volumes varying from 29.8 to 30.2 billion
ton-kms in 1984/85 and from 33.5 to 35.1 billion ton-kms in 1990/91.

(iv) Petroleum Products (POL)
2.14      Demand for petroleum products rose quite rapidly in India (8.9%
p.a.) between 1950 and 1973, the time of the oil price hike. A
substantial increase in the real domestic price of POL after 1973 has
moderated the growth in demand to an average annual rate of 5.1%, between
1973/74 and 1979/80. In 1980/81, consumption was constrained by the labor
petroleum in Assam, which resulted in a loss of production of about 3.5
milLion tons of crude. During 1981/82 demand grew by about 7%.
Estimating future demand, however, is uncertain because, as individuals
and firms adjust their habits of POL consumption, historical relationships
no longer apply. On the other hand, it is difficult to sharply reduce
demand in the near future because most PGL products are used as
intermediate products. World Bank estimates a growth of about 7.6% p.a.
between 1979180 and 1984/85.
2.15      The transport picture is also going to be affected by the
structure and regional pattern of production and supply and by the
availability of alternative transport modes. India is largely unexplored
regarding hydrocarbons. The exploration activity undertaken during the
Seventies, however, paid off in the discovery of one giant oil and gas
offshore field (Bombay High) and several smaller commercial fields, both
offshore and onshore. The number of good prospective areas exceeds the
number that the state-owned organizations can reasonably explore during
the next five years; therefore, the Government has recently decided to
open selective prospective areas to foreign exploration firms under
production-sharing contracts. These arrangements will considerably
accelerate exploration of hydrocarbons, although exploitation of any
commercial reserves is not likely to happen until the second half of the
eighties at the earliest.
2.16      Crude production in 1981/82 was about 16.4 million tons which
represents a little less than one-half of Indian POL demand. India-s
refining capacity, on the other hand, was of 31.8 million tons of
throughput capacity (mttc) in 1980. This is enough to process about 29
million tons of crude into 27 million tons of petroleum at 90% capacity
utilization and 93% outturn of products from crude. There is a new
refinery under construction at Mathura, which should being operating in
1981, adding 6 mttc. Moreover, the Government plans to meet the growing
demand both by expanding existing refineries and by building new ones.
The new refineries would be located at Mangalore (6 mttc) and Karnal (3
mttc). Altogether, India is expected to have 13 mttc more than at present
by 1984/85.
2.17      Concerning transport facilities, in addition to road transport
and existing pipelines, a new pipeline is expected to be commissioned in
the near future, from Bombay High to Mathura, and more pipelines are



-64-
Annex D
Page 9 of 14
planned to be built during the sixties. The share of POL by rail will
thus be reduced, and fairly moderate increases in transport volumes are
estimated, except in the third alternative, where, in addition to an
annual rate of growth of demand of about 7.6% p.a., a smaller reduction in
the share of the railways is assumed. Traffic forecasts range between
11.5 and 12.6 billion ton-kms in 1984/85 and between 12.4 and 19.4 billion
ton-kms by 1990/91.
(v) Iron Ore for Export
2.18      Despite occasional surges in export volumes in a few years in
response to world market conditions, iron ore has presented a stable
pattern of traffic with relatively minor fluctuations from one year to the
next. After experiencing a world-wide slump in demand of iron ore, the
market is beginning to recover.  On the supply side, a switch of
production has been completed from lumps to fines to better suit the world
market. Accordingly, a moderate traffic increase has been estimated,
ranging from 7.5 to 7.6 billion ton-kms in 1984/85 and from 7.7 to 7.9
billion ton-kms in 1990/91.
(vi) Cement
2.19      During the past 20 years, India has suffered an almost chronic
shortage of cement. As a result, cement is rationed administratively.
The annual rate of growth of installed capacity averaged about 8.9% during
1950/51-1971/72 and declined to about 2.1% between 1971/72-1978179 due to
restrictive Government pricing and licensing policies. Production growth,
meanwhile, averaged about 3.7% per year as a result of increases in.
capac-ity utilization between 1971/72 and 1977/78. Thenceforth, capacity
utilization declined, however, from 88% in 1977/78 to less than 75% in
1979/80 and 1980/81. The most critical constraints on the operation of
cement plants were coal and power shortages. In 1981/82 the total
production was 21.5 million tons an increase of 15% over the previous
year.
2.20      India is planning a major expansion of its cement industry from
32.7 million tons of installed capacity in 1981/82 to about 42.5 million
tons in 1984/85. About 80% of the additional capacity will be in new
production units and the remaining 20% will result from expansion of
existing plants. If the investment targets are met, the planned expansion
would roughly meet the projected demand for cement in the next four years,
although shortages are likely to continue for some time.
2.21      These shortages, combined with the necessity to supplement the
domestic production through imports, the concentration of consumption in
the country-s northern region, and an increasingly rapid erosion of
traffic in the shorter distances, are expected to continue aiding to the



-65-
Annex D
Page 10 of 14
average haul of cement by the railways. Of the three alternatives tested,
the first two (with growth/rates of 3.0% p.a. and 4.0% p.a.) straddle the
average growth in production of cement during the 1971/72-1977178 period.
The third alternative assumes a jump in production of 7% p.a. between
1980/81-1984/85, followed by 5.5% p.a. through the end of the decade.
Assuming a decrease in railway share of tonnages of about 3% per year, the
total traffic moved by the railways is expected to range from 8.8 billion
ton-kms to 9.9 billion ton-kms in 1984/85 and from 10.5 to 13.7 billion
ton-kms in 1990/91.
(vii) Fertilizer
2.22      The consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers in India increased at
an average annual rate of 22% in the decade 1962-72. In the next three
years, consumption declined. However, as a result of improved
agricultural conditions and a reduction in the price of nitrogen,
consumption picked up again, resulting in a growth of about 15% p.a.
between 1975 and 1980. Phosphatic and potassic fertilizers followed a
consumption pattern similar to nitrogenous fertilizers, but did not begin
to recover until 1976/77. By 1981/82, India-s total fertilizer
consumption was 5.9 million nutrient tons, of which 67% was nitrogen, 22Z
phopshates and 11% potash.
2.23    1 ndia produces nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers.  Installed
capacity has grown from 0.15 million nutrient tons per year in 1952 to
about 6.8 mill ion in 1981/82. The utilization of available capacity has
been relatively low, however. Although it showed substantial improvements
between 1974175 and 1978/79, it has declined sharply in 1979/80 and
1980/81, largely as the result of shortages of power, fuel oil and
naphtha, coupled with equipment and operating problems, particularly in
several of the older public sector plants. In 1981/82 the utilization
improved but the level is still low about 60% of installed capacity. In
1981/82, India produced 3.1 million tons of nitrogenous fertilizers and
0.9 million tons of phosphatic fertilizers.
2.24      The high rates of growth in consumption of fertilizers of recent
years are not sustainable in the long run. Consumption in 1980/81
increased at a more moderate rate of about 6% as a result of price
increases. The installed capacity is expected to increase from 6.9
million tons in 1981/82 to 8.5 million tons in 1984/85. Additionally, the
Government is placing considerable emphasis on measures to increase
capacity utilization of existing plants.  Even after taking into
consideration the large projects underway at Thal and Hazira and those
firmly planned, fertilizer consumption is expected to exceed domestic
output significantly.  To estimate future transport demand, fertilizer
consumption has been estimated to grow at annual rates of 8.5%, 10.1% and



-66-
Annex D
Page 11 of 14
12.5% in line with the analysis provided in connection with the Hazira
Fertilizer Project. 1/
2.25      Bearing in mind the location of existing and projected plants,
and assuming that the railways' share would continue decreasing by about
3% annually as the main inter-regional flows are concentrated along the
principal railway corridors, while road transport handles intra-regional
distribution flows, in line with the modal-point transport strategy being
developed by GOI/IR, 2/ railway traffic volumes are projected to reach
between 10.7 and 11.37billion ton-kms in 1984/85 and from 12.5 to 16.0
billion ton-kms by 1990/91.
(viii) Other Commodities
2.26      In line with a historical pattern of concentration of railway
traffic in the main seven commodities discussed above, the remaining
traffic is estimated to continue decreasing in tonnage.  As road transport
continues capturing the shorter distance traffic in these other
commodities, however, the average haul will increase, leading to a
stagnation or even a small decrease in ton-kms from 41.1 billion in
1980/81 to a range between 38.0 and 38.3 billion in 1984/85 and their
growth between 39.6 and 43.4 billion by 1990/91.

Main Report, Volume IV. Statement (Appendix) 6.1.
2.28      As shown above, while the population of Bombay, Calcutta and
Madras grew by 3.5% annually between 1951/52 and 1977/78, the total
suburban traffic moved by the railways in the three cities increased by
6.1% per year in terms of number of passengers and by 7.0% annually in
terms of passenger-kms. When analyzed decade by decade, the traffic in
passengers and passenger-kmas grew by 5.8% p.a. and by 6.2% p.a. iu the
fifties, by 6.0% p.a and 6.9% p.a. in the Sixties and by 3.1% p.a. and
8.0% p.a. between 197U171 and 1977/78. In 1979/80 the traffic decreased
by 10% (passengers) and 11% (passenger-kms) in the face of fare increases,
which took place in July 1980. The fare increases included a raise of 5X
on passenger traffic up to 100 kms and of 15% on quarterly and monthly
season tickets. Preliminary estimates for 1980/81 indicate a recovery of
traffic growth of about 5% in number of passengers and of 4.8% in
passenger-kms (see Table 3 for total traffic statistics after 1977/78).
2.29      As a result of the spread of urban centers, average lead for
the three cities has increased from 17.3 kms in 1960/61 to 17.8 kms in
1970171 and then to 20.4 kms in 1977/78. A careful study of the various
parameters having a bearing on suburban passenger traffic (urban
population, service sectors, land use pattern, per capita income and
prices for railway services) was carried out by the Rail Traffic Enquiry
Committee and they concluded--based principally on urban population
growth--with a projected rate of growth of about 5.8% annually between
1977/78 and 1999/2000, which would increase to around 6.7% annually if the
population increase in the three cities continues growing at the average
rate of the Seventies. Assuming a gradual increase in average lead from
20.4 kms in 1977/78 to 25.1 kms in 1999/2000, the study concludes that the
growth in traffic demand in terms of pass-kms would range from 6.8%
annually to 7.9% annually throughout this period.

2.30      A closer look at the price elasticity of suburban passenger
travel, based on the 1980 experience, suggests that the high growth in
demand could be uampened, by implementing a gradual increase in fares.
Alternatively, it would be necessary to limit the available capacity on
the main suburban corridors, to avoid excessively large investments.
Assuming either of the two solutions, growth in suburban passenger traffic
has been estimated at about 4.5% per year in terms of passengers or 5.1%
per year in terms of passenger-kms, during the period 1980/81-1990/91.
This would generate a total number of around 2,380 million passengers in
1984/85 and 3,100 million passengers in 1990/91 and of 49.5 billion
pass-kms in 1984/85 and 66.8 billion pass-kms in 1990/91.
(ii) Inter-urban
2.31      Inter-urban passenger traffic has grown at an average of about
2.0% per year (in terms of number of passengers) and at 3.3% per year (in
passenger-kms) during the last three decades. The rate, however, has
increased gradually, decade after decade. Thus, in the Fifties total
number of passengers and passenger-kms increased by 0.5% p.a. and 1.0%
p.a., respectively; in the sixties they went up by 2.8% p.a. and 3.7%
p.a.; and in the seventies by 2.5% p.a. and 5.3% p.a., respectively.
Hence, only the growth in the total number of passengers decreased
somewhat from the sixties (2.8% p.a.) to che Seventies (2.5% p.a.). This
increasing trend reflects mainly the 'ncrease in the country's population
throughout the period (the popvulation roughly doubled from about 360
million to some 644 million in these 30 years), the increased economic
activity of the various regions and of the country in general (growth in
GNP) and the ratio of increases in income per capita to increases in
passenger fares. Of all these variables, the Rail Tariff Enquiry
Committee (RTEC) found the best correlation in the case of population and
the service sector.
2.32      Using the population projections for India presented in Table
A.9 of previous WB Economic Report, which assume a net reproduction rate
of one in the year 2000, and using the growth rate relationships
established by the RTEC (Appendix 6.7 to Volume IV), the following
estimates of population and inter-urban traffic levels are obtained:

*    Provisional figures.
2.33      The figures in the preceding table represent an annual rate of
growth which ranges from 2.6% to 5.9% for total number of passengers and
from 4.2% to 8.9% for passenger kilometers between 1980/81 and 1984/85.
For the entire decade (1980/81-1990/91) these annual rates would vary from
2.0% to 4.4% for passengers and from 3.1% to 6.6% for passenger
kilometers.
III. Summary and Conclusions
3.01      Different studies carried out in India in recent years have
arrived at various railway traffic forecasts. As shown in Table B-1,
concerning freight, the 1984/85 World Bank estimates are lower than
previous ones, although not significantly lower than IR's own estimates.
The railway traffic forecast based on macroeconomic considerations (paras.
2.01 to 2.04) is somewhat higher, but as indicated before, the results of
applying that methodology are not so accurate. In any case they represent
a small increase in the order of 1-3%.
3.02      Comparing with the upper boundaries suggested by expected GDP
growth (see table in para. 2.03 of this Annex C), the Bazk-s estimates
vary within reasonable limits. The resulting annual rates of growth in
terms of ton-kus range from 2.3 for the low, to 3.1 for the medium and to
4.4 for the high alternative, between 1981/82 and 1984/85. Between
1981/82 and 1990/91, the corresponding annual rates of growth are 2.2%,
3.3% and 4.4%.

INDIA
RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION AND WORKSHOP MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Description of Main Line Sections to be Electrified
and Other Components
ke) Main Line Sections to be Electrified
(i) Jhansi-Itarsi
1.        This section (381 RKM) lies on the main north-south trunk route
connecting Delhi with the Metropolitan cities of Bombay and Madras. This
is almost a double line section except for small patches of single track
over some major rivers. There are 50 railway stations, including two
important stations, i.e., Bina aud Bhopal.
2.        The section being on the north-south main trunk route, caters to
very heavy passenger and freight traffic. The main commodities moving
over this section comprise food grains from north to south and towards
Bombay in the up direction and in the Oown direction fertilizers and coal
from Central India coal fields for thermal power plants in the north,
i.e., Bhatinda, Panipat, Faridabad, etc. There is a separate stream of
coal traffic from Pench Valley fields from Itarsi to Bhopal enroute to
stations on the Western Railway. Some major deveLopments like expansion
of thermal power plants at Bhatinda, Faridabad, as well as setting up of
giant fertilizer plant based on Bombay High and numerous cement plants
around Manickgarh on S.C. Railway, will contribute to increases in the
volume of freight traffic. The traffic density on the section is 29.0
million GTKM/RKM/Annum at present and estimated to increase to 35.8
GTKH/RKM/Annum by 1990/91.
(ii) Itarsi-Bhusaval
3.        This section (301 RKM) lies on the Delhi/Lucknow-Bombay and
Howrah/Allahad-Bombay trunk routes and is a double line section. There
are 37 stations on this section, including an important junction station.
4.        The section carries very heavy passenger and goods traffic.
There is also a preponderance in coal movement from Pench Valley to the
stations reached via Itarsi, Bhusaval and for power stations and other
coal-based industries in Western Railway and Bombay. A sizable
north-south bound traffic, which normally seeks movement over



-71-
Annex E
Page 2 of 8
Itar3i-Amla-Nagpur section, moves over this section due to difficulties in
the capacity on that section. Main traffic in the up direction comprises
of coal and general goods, while in down direction the traf_ic stream
includes POL, fertilizers, etc. The increase in the projected level of
traffic includes coal for power houses and coal-based industries for
destinations reached via Jalgaon and south of Jalgaon from C.I.C.
fields/Singrauli and Pench valley coalfields. The increase in the tran-
sport of other general goods, food grains, etc. in the up direction and
that of POL, fertilizers traffic in down direction are anticipated. The
present day traffic is 28.3 million GTKMIRKMIAnnum and projected
anticipated traffic by 1990/91 is 31.6 GTKH/RKM/Annum.
(iii) Bhusaval-Nagpur
5.        This section (393 RKM) lies on Bombay-Howrah trunk route.  This
is a double line section and there are 35 stations on this section.
6.        This section, being on the main trunk route, carries very heavy
passengers as well as goods traffic. A number of important commercial
centers are located on this section. A big power house is located at
Puras and coal for this power house is mostly moved from Mahesol coal
fields over this section. This section passes through a region rich in
cotton and coal. North-south traffic also transverses over a part of this
section between Wardha and Nagpur. Due to passage difficulties over
north-south route, i.e., Itarsi-Amla-Nagpur, a few of the north-south
traffic is diverted via Itarsi/Bhusaval-Wardha which accounts for two to
three loads per day. The traffic density on the section is at present
20.2 GTKM/RKM/Annum and estimated to 23.9 GTKM/RKM/Annum by 1990/91.
(iv) Wardha-Balharshah
(v)  Balharshah-Vijayawada
7.        These two contiguous sections (133 RKM, 454 RKM) are part of the
main north-south trunk route connecting Delhi with Madras. Most of the
sections are double-lined, except for a short stretch of a single line
portion north of Bellampalli, where doubling is in progress. There are 14
stations in Wardha-Balharshah and 53 stations in Balharshah-Vijayawada.
8.        The traffic over these sections consists of through traffic of
industrial as well as agricultural products from both northern and
southern sides. These sections traverse through the coal belt of Andhra
Pradesh which is also enriched with other minerals like dolomite, lime-
stone, etc. Coal from Singareni collieries, Bellampalli, Mandamari and
others, moves through these sections for feeding thermal power stations in
the southern states, i.e., Tamiluadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and
southern part of Maharastra. Likewise, there is a heavy movement of
cement traffic over these sections. With the emphasis of the super ther-
mal stations being located at Ramagundam, as well as Kothagudam



-72-
Annex E
Page 3 of 8
in Andhra Pradesh, the production of coal in Singareni collieries is
expected to be increased considerably. The present traffic densities on
these sections are 19.5 million GTKM/RKM/Annum for Wardha-Balharshah and
30.1 million GTKM/RKM/Aunum for Balharshah-Vijayawada. By 1990/91, they
are expected to increase to 28.4 million GTKM/RKM/Annum for
Wardha-Balharshah and 44.0 million GTKM/RKM/Annum for
Balharshah-Vijayawada.
(vi) Bhopal-Nagda
9.        This section (239 RKM) is mostly of a single line aud connects
two important trunk routes, i.e., Delhi-Madras and Delhi-Bombay. There
are 28 stations on this section.
10.       This section carries heavy freight traffic.  The coal loads from
coal belts of Central India feeding thermal power plants and other
industries on the Western India move over this section. A good deal of
steel and iron, as well as fertilizer traffic, moves over this section.
The traffic density on the section is 19.7 million GTKM/RKM/Annum at
present and estimated to increase to 26.2 million GTKM/RKM/Annum by
1990/91.
(vii) Itarsi-Nagpur
11.       This section (298 RKM) at present is predominantly of a single
line and doubling of the section is being progressively under way. There
are 35 stations on this section. Since this line traverses over ghat
section with heavy gradients and lies on the main north-south trunk route
from Delhi to Madras, it certainly requires elimination of the
iufrastructural weaknesses, e.g., steam traction, stretches of single line
and locomotives with medium power. The electrification of the section
will also provide a short distance chord line to the route
Itarsi-Bhusaval-Nagpur, which is presently being utilized for a large part
of goods traffic in view of the constraints on this route.
12.       Besides through traffic, this section also caters to a
considerable originating traffic in coal, charcoal, forest products, etc.
Coal traffic, to the exteut of two to three loads daily, are worked to
Koradi power house and Bhilai Steel Plant via Godhani and Nagpur,
respectively. This section, being the principal north-south traffic
route, there is a heavy demand for introduction of passenger services. Of
late, a number of fast and super-fast passenger services have been
introduced. With the opening of new lines in Nandani fields in Pench
Valley area, substantial increase in freight movement over this section is
also anticipated. Additional cement traffic from new plants proposed near
Manikgarh requires to be moved over this section. The traffic density on
the section is 14.4 million GTKM/RKM/Annum at present and is estimated to
increase to 22.0 million GTKM/RKM/Annum by 1990/91.

Page 4 of 8
(viii) Nagpur-Durg
13.       This section (265 RKM) is part of the important trunk route
connecting Calcutta with Bombay. This is a double line section having 33
stations.
14.       This section, being on the trunk route, serves mainly through
passenger traffic between East and West. The originating goods traffic
are mostly bamboos, forest products, manganese, foodgrains, finished
products of steel plants and textile goods. Wlth the setting up of a
super thermal plant, a fertilizer plant (under construction) and a new
coal mine being opened out, movement of freight traffic over this section
is anticipated to increase substantially. The traffic density on the
section is at present 16.8 million GTKM/RKM/Annum and estimated to
increase to 22.6 million GTKM/RKM/Annum by 1990/91.
(ix) Bina-Katni-Anuppur
(x) Anuppur-Bilaspur
15.       Bina-Anuppur (429 RKM) is a double line section, whereas
Anuppur-Bilaspur (151 RKM) is mostly a single line section, except for a
short length of double track portion in-between. In these sections are 59
stations.
16.       Bina-Anuppur section connects the rich coal belts of C.I.C.
fields/Singrauli located in Eastern region to the industrialized areas in
the Western part of the country around Ahmedabad. There is a heavy coal
movement over this section. A sizable stream of steel traffic also seeks
movement via New Katni from steel plants located in Eastern section to
destinations on Western and Northern Railways. There have been proposals
to set up several new cement plants and to expand a steel plant alongside
the section.  With these developments, goods traffic on this section is
likely to increase considerably. The present traffic densities on these
sections are 26.2 million GTKM/RKM/Annum for Bina-Katni-Anuppur and 9.1
million GTKM/RKM/Annum for Anuppur-Bilaspur. By 1990/91, they are
expected to increase to 40.2 million GTKM/RKM/Annum for Bina-Katni-Anuppur
and 11.9 million GTKM/RKM/Annum for Anuppur-Bilaspur.
(b) OHE Recording and Testing Car
17.       At present there is no overhead equipment recording/testing scar
with IR. With an increase in traffic on the electrified route, it is
becoming more and more difficult to give long power blocks for maintenance
and overhauling of OHE. However, various parameters like height, stagger,
wear of the contact wire, condition of OHE at the crossovers are manually
checked in a time-consuming manner. Current collection is observed by



-74-
Annex E
Page 5 of 8
noticing the sparks at night. These methods naturally suffer from errors
in measurement and individual judgement resultlng in a low standard of
maintenance.
18.       In view of the above, it is considered essential to have an OHE
recording/testing car to measure and record the various parameters of OHE
and pantograph under dynamic conditions ln monitoring current collection
for laying down a rational maintenance and overhaul schedule.
19.       Such a car could also be used for the research purpose.  The
behaviour of the different types of OHE against different types of
pantographs at different speeds could be evaluated both qualitatively and
quantitavely under dynamic conditions. The speed potential of the
existing OHE has to be ascertained and if necessary, improvement in the
design of the OHE and/or the pantograph should be done.
20.       The OHE recording/testing car should be designed to be hauled
by a locomotive or a regular train, and to cater for future needs, it
should be capabLe of operation at speeds up to 160 km/h. The car should
be provided with an observation dome, closed circuit television and visual
display units to study the behavior of OHE/pantograph. It should be
provided with various measuring devices and appropriate dLgital computer
equipment for on-board preparation of defect and alignment repots. The
provision of Ludigenous development of such a car for this purpose was
once approved by the Railway Board in 1979. However, since domestic
development of such a car would be remote, it is now proposed to import a
complete OHE recording/testing car wlth all the necessary
measuring/monitoring equipment.
(c) OHE Maintenance Vehicles
21.       IR now owns a large number of indigenously-manufactured OHE
inspectlon/maintenance tower wagons which are used for carrying out
inspection and breakdown attention of OHE on the electrified tracks. The
tower wagon is a 4-wheeler rail vehicle, self-propelled by a diesel engine
having a horsepower of 83 and an axle load of 6.8 t. The total carrying
capacity for the tower wagon is 3.1 t and the maximum speed is 45 kmph.
However, due to the obsolete design and the inadequate horsepower of the
engine with the consequent low speed, these tower wagons presently used
have a lot of disadvantages, including: (a) it takes an unduly long time
to reach the site of an accident in case of OHE breakdown and the section
controllers find difficulty in permitting path to these vehicles; (b) it
is impossible to couple to the tower wagon an additional vehicle carrying
spare components of ORE; (c) availability is very low owing to, among
other problems, weak transmission system leading to frequent failure of
gear boxes and other parts; and (d) it is not suitable to operate the
tower wagons on the heavy gradient sections, since the brake power is
insufficient and the vacuum brakes equipped are not fail safe.



-75-
Annex E
Page 6 of 8
22.       It is, therefore, suggested to develop high speed OHE
maintenance vehicles to overcome the above defects. The following three
types of modern OHE maintenance vehicles are proposed:
a) Road-rail vehicles for attending minor breakdowns:
In order not to block the line for a long period, these vehicles
should be capable of travelling to the scene of a fault by
road at the speed of 80-100 Km/h and mounting on the rails for
repairing the fault using a lift "bucket" or platform.
b) 4-wheeler self-propelled tower wagons for attending normal scheduled
inspections and maintenance:
These cars should be capable of running at 75-80 Km/h and
carrying load up to 5 t.
c) Bogie-type 8-wheeler self-propelled tower wagons for attending
medium/major breakdowns and heavy maintenance work:
Since the heavy maintenance/repair of OHE is done during common
power/traffic blocks, it is extremely important to complete the work
expeditiously to minimize traffic repercussions. Therefore, these
wagons should be capable of carrying at 100 Km/h approximately
20 t of heavy repairing materials and large manpower in order to
increase productivity to maximum possible level by using a number of
gangs simultaneously.
23.       It is proposed that each OHE depot, spaced at every 50/60 kms,
be provided with one road-rail vehicle and a 4-wheeler tower wagon or a
8-wheeler tower wagon for scheduled maintenace and heavy repairs. With
the increased pace of energization as much as 1,000 route km annually,
it is expected that about 40 maintenance vehicles will be required per
year.
24.       The first ten vehicles comprising five road-rail vehicles, three
4-wheelers and two 8-wheelers are to be imported completely in assembled
conditions so that they are available in time to keep pace with the
proposed energization program. Next ten vehicles (five road-rail
vehicles, three 4-wheelers, two 8-wheelers) are proposed to be imported in
completely knocked-down condition. The assembly and testing will be done
in India. By this time, it is expected that most of the components will
be indigenousLy developed and only a few components will need to be
imported. The import contents will come progressively down.

(iii) Improvement of the North-East Ghats Operation
25.       The main line DC electrified routes, Bombay-Kalyau-Igatpuri and
Bombay-Kalyan-Pune sections run over steep Ghat sections having ruling
gradients up to 1 in 33 on the Ncrth-East section and 1 in 37 on the
South-East section. Both sections are serious bottlenecks in train
operations.
26.       Freight trains on these sections are worked by WCG-2 locomotives
which are also used for banking service. There are severe problems both
in the ascending and descendiug directions and WCG-2 locomotLves have not
proved satisfactory for banking operations on these Chats due to the
following deficiencies in their operational capabilitLes: (a) For
ascending load, there is a tendency to slip due to unreliable adhesion
causLng excessive stalling and parting of load; (b) As the regenerative
braking is not effective at speeds less than 28 Km/h, regeneratLon is not
available at the maximum permissible descending speed of 19 Km/h on the
North-East Ghat section. Thus, the locomotives depend on rheostatic
dynamic braking causing tremendous heat; and (c) There are several
design/manufacturing deficiencies in the equipment.
27.       The severe gradients on the section impose serious load
limitations on the Ghat sections.  The permissible load of goods trains in
the ascending direction is 1,250 tons with a single banker And 1,600 toni
with double bankers. These loads have to be further reduced during
monsoons. In view of the likely traffic growth in the future and the
existing capacity constraints, it was proposed, in April 1979 by the
multi-disciplinary Directors" level committee appointed by the Railway
Board, to urgently import from abroad improved type of DC banking
locomotives adopting latest technology in this field. However, for
several different reasons, this proposition has never been realized until
today and there are no prospects of getting heavy duty DC bankers in the
near future.
28.       In order to increase the line capacity, the third railway line
on North-East Ghats between Kasara and Igatpuri has been completed and
commissioned Lately. In the past, before and when work on the third Ghat
line was to be commenced in 1977, three different committees had gone into
questions of changing over DC traction to AC traction on the North-East
Ghat section. While distinct advantages were seen in converting the
North-East Ghat line into AC traction, the decisions were always to
continue DC traction over the Ghats mainly due to the following argument:
(a) Bulk of the DC locomotives and EHU fleeta would require premature
replacement;



-77-
Annex E
Page 8 of 8
(b)  Najor modifications to the OHE and subs.ations at heavy costs would
be involved;
(c)  Conversion to AC of the OHE in built-up areas would be extremely
difficult;
(d) A number of tunnels in the Ghat section would call for modification;
(e) Kasara yard, as an actual point of DC/AC change-over, was ruled out
as space-bound;
(f) A suitable design of AC/DC locomotive was noc available for working
on the Ghats; and
(g)  All the signalling and telecommunication works would have to suit
the AC traction.
29.       However, the situation changed considerably since then and the
TRANSMARK team, which visited India in 1979, recommended conversion of
North-East Ghats into 25iV AC with suitable change-over facilities at
Kasara. The Bank mission, together with consultants looking into the
adoption of high horsepower AC locomotives for hauling 4,500 ton trains on
IR (para 2.23), also visited the North-East Ghat section in February 1981,
with a view to determining the utility of the AC locomotives as bankers
for the Ghats instead of heavy duty DC bankers. The Bank mission conveyed
the view at that time that it would be advantageous even at that stage to
go in for conversion of the Ghats into AC rather than importing heavy duty
DC banking locomotives to improve throughput.
30.       With the completion of the third track between Kasara and
Igatpuri, the time is appropriate to commence a new study based on a
cost-benefit anilysis for conversion of this electrified line from the old
1500 volt DC to a modern AC system for a major and long term operational
improvement. The study should cover: (a) the method of carrying out the
conversion (i.e., changing insulators to 25 kV types but retaining the
existing contact wire and catenary); and (b) must include some alternative
solutions to operations of the ENU passenger commuter trains up to or over
the converted section. If, as a result of the study, conversion of the
system from DC to AC is found viable, it would be desirable to carry it
out at this stage, i,e., before the third track reaches its saturation
point ln :'!e 1990s.
31.       An immediate priority is the introduction of communications
between the leading locomotives and the banking locomotives to provide for
voice communications between the drivers at the front and the rear of the
train to improve line operations and reduce delays. The communications
system would include special purpose 25 watt locomotive radios, a "leakv"
coaxiaL cable transmission system for radio reception on the tunnels and
the radio transmitter/receiver base stations ct Kasara, Igatpuri and the
intermediate signal cabins.

RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION AND WORKSHOP MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Details of the Six Workshops and ICF and Maintenance Depots
Selected for Modernization
1.        Parel Workshop. Parel Workshop which is over 100 years old, is
the only locomotive workshop on the Central Railway system. The workshop
was initially pLanned for POH of steam locomotives. While the shop layout
and equipment provided were suited to the maintenance of steam
locomotives, the workshop has, in the course of time, undergone drastic
changes consequent to diversification of POH activities. Due to
progressive repLacement of steam traction by Diesel and Electric traction,
the need for setting up maintenance facilities for diesel and electric
locos was felt and Parel shops had to gradually cater to the maintenance
demands of these new locomotives. Presently, the workshops have a
strength of 6,300 personnel and is required to undertake POH of steam,
diesel and electric locomotives. Capacity demands for diesel locos
-ontinue to grow and have to be met by Parel shops. IR-s rationalization
plan provides for expansion of diesel POH capacity in Parel shops to 12
locos per month by 1990 at tue same time tapering off the capacity for
steam locos from 8 to 5 in the same period with the ultimate am of
eliminating steam loco POH from this shop completely by the turn of this
century.
2.        Liluah Workshop.  Liluah Workshop was originally set up in 1863
near Howrah Station for overhaul of coaches and wagons. The shop was
shifted to its present location at Liluah, about 5 km from Howrah in 1900.
The facilities provided in the shop were designed to cater to conventional
technology relevant to wooden-bodied coaches and 4-wheeled plain bearing
wagons.
;.        Employing about 11,000 men, Liluah is amongst the largest C&E
workshops of Indian Railways. Apart from coping with growth in work oad
over the years, the shop has been, in recent years, called upon to tace
radical changes in product mix with the advent of steel-bodied coaches
and roller-bearing and CBC-fitted freight cars. Workshop infrastructure
has remained more or less unchanged since its inception. The shop is,
however, called upcz to tackle more sophisticated rolling stock in larger
volume. The infrastructure is outmodpd and bulk of machinery and plant is
cveraged and obsolete. There is urgent need to revamp and modernize this
workshop.

4.        Since the shop is located on the outskirts of the metropolis of
Calcutta, which is a major industrial center of the country, it will
continue to play an important role in the maintenance of coaches and
wagons. Situated in a congested area, the shop does not lend itself to
physical expansion and, therefore, any modernization plan has to basically
aim at optimising inputs within the existing physical confines.
5.        A detailed project study has been conducted to identify the
limitations of the shop, the inputs required to eliminate them and to
adapt the shop to the changed product mix and the present technological
needs. The major thrust of this modernization program is to equip Liluah
shops with means to tackle present day coaches and wagons and to achieve
reduced down time and reduced unit POH cost, at the same time achieving
improved quality of product for higher service reliability. Towards this
end, the facilities envisaged pertain to replacement of overaged machinery
by modern high precision, high productivity machines, rationalization of
work place layouts and processes, improvement in material handling,
technological inputs to improve quality of product, provision of
rotational spares to reduce down times, provision of better roads and shop
flooring for smoother flow of materials etc.
6.        Jagadhri Workshop.  Jagadhri Workshop was set up thirty years
ago in 1952. Necessity for this workshop was felt after the partition of
the country in 1947 when East Punjab Railway, a portion of the erstwhile
North Western Railway was left with no workshop maintenance facility for
broad gauge rolling stock. Jagadhri Shop, employing 4,500 men is located
near Khanalampura, a major marshalling yard and is ideally suited for
periodical overhaul of goods stock. This workshop is now a part of the
Northern Railway System of Indian RaiLways.
7.        The workshop was originally planned to undertake periodical
overhaul of coaches and wagons for a monthly out-turn of 75 coaching units
and 225 wagon units. From time to time, the capacity has been i._rc^sed
with marginal inputs to cater to the growing maintenance needs. In 1963,
the capacity was increased to 200 coaching units 220 units per month in
1980. Keeping in view the increased needs, it is already programmed to
increase the coaching capacity to 300 units per month by 1984/85.
8.        In the interest of rationalization of workload between two major
carriage and wagon workshops on the Northern Railway System, namely,
Ja,adhri and Alambagh, it is proposed to increase the wagon POH capacity
of Jagadhri Shc- from the existing 1,200 to 1,500 units per month and to
eliminate wagon POt! from Alambagh altogether thereby converting Alambagh
into a single activity shop. Simultaneously, there is need to reduce
coaching POH repair cycle time and update repair technology to imprive
t.e quality of repairs which will result in increased reliability and
availability of stock.

9.        Golden Rock Workshop. This workshop was set up in L926 as a
central unit for repairs to both BG and MG steam locomotives, coaches and
wagcns on the South Indian Railway system. As a result of rationalization
of workload, following integration of Indian Railways, the BG POH activity
was shifted to Perabur and the workshop continued to POH only MG
locowotives and C&W stock. Subsequently, in 1961, wagon POH was shifted
to Mysore Workshop.
10.       With progressive dieselization on the Southern Railway System,
diesel POH activity was introduced in Golden Rock Workshop in 1969 with
only marginal investments due to resource constraints. The basic
structure and equipment remained the same which was engineered for steam
loco POH. Infrastructure for diesel loco POH was, therefore, not optimal.
Over the passage of time, diesel POH activity gradually increased calling
for augmentation of supporting facilities. Consequently, traction motor
rewinding facility was set up in 1976, coil manufacturing unit was started
in 1979 and reclamation of cylinder liners by hard chrome plating in 1977.
11.       While there has been diversification of various activities from
time to time, matching infrastructural support has not been provided. For
the pattern of activities required to be handled, the shop layouts are
sub-optimal. To make things worse, 70% of the machinery and equipment is
overaged having frequent breakdowns resulting in low productivity and poor
work quality. Material handling facilities are also insufficient. POH
arisings of diesel locomotives are rapidly increasing and this workshop
will be required to POH 12 diesel locomotives every month as against the
existing capacity of 6. This workshop also undertakes corrosion repairs
to coaches with an annual capacity of 360 units. Due to heavy incidence
of corrosion on coaches, this capacity needs to be augmented to 600.
Besides, there is need to streamline the coaching POH activity to reduce
the POH cycle time and to improve the quality of repairs. Need to expand
the capacity and the imperative of improvement in the quality of repairs,
makes it necessary to modernized this workshop.
12.       Kharagpur Workshop.  It was establised in the year 1898.  It is
the largest integrated maintenance set up on the Indian Railways employing
15,600 personnel. It was planned for maintenance of steam locomotives,
timber-bodied passengers coaches and 4-wheeler freight wagons. On account
of change in the mode of traction and the type of the rolling stock, this
workshop was modified from time to time to take on the additional workload
of diesel electric locomotives, electric locomotive bogies, rewinding of
traction generators and traction motors and periodic overhauls/corrosion
repair of all steel integral design pssenger coaches. The development of
these diverse activities on a patch work basis at different times over the
last two decades has seriously affected the productivity of the workshop.
13.       Kharagpur Workshop was selected for modernization in Phase I
of the modernization program wiLn the objective of reducing POH cycle time



-81-
Annex F
Page 4 of 6
for diesel locomotives and wagons. The project proposal for Phase II is
to develop capacity for overhaul of electric locomotives to the rune of
40 locomotives per year which, for want of capacity have to be sent all
the way to Bhusaval on Central Railway. In addition, the shop will cater
for special repairs to 8 electric locomotives annually. It is expected
that 3 days would be saved in overall repair cycle for each loco.
Investments are proposed in machinery and plant, material handling
equipment, unit exhcnage spares, layout changes and for rehabilitation
of inhouse power plant. Simultaneously, the locomotive shops at Kharagpur
will be totally evacuated of steam locomotive workload.
14.       Ajmer Workshop.  The Ajmer Workshop complex was set up over a
century ago, in 1876 by the erstwhile Rajputana Mewar Railways. The
complex comprises two workshops, namely, Loco Workshop and Carriage and
Wagon Workshop with attached stores depot and a standby power house. Both
workshops deal with meter gauge stock. Since the integration of the
railways in 1952, this complex forms part of the Western Railway System of
Indian Railways and now employs 5,200 men.
15.       The Carriage and Wagon Workshop does not have adequate capacity
to handle the present PtH needs of coaching stock. Besides, over the
years, there have been radical changes in the design of the rolling stock
required to be handled by this shop. Instead of 7 ft. wide coaches for
which the facilities were originally created, the shop is now required to
handle 9 ft. wide coaches, thereby leaving very little space for movement
and for efficiently carrying out repairs in the existing bays. Therefore,
the existing carriage shop layout is not conducive to proper maintenance
of coaching stock. Majority of machinery, plant and equipment are also
overaged and obsolete, and are not compatible with present day needs.
16.       According to the future projections of traffic, POH arisings of
coaching stock will increase substantially. It is therefore necessary to
step up the coaching POH activity in Ajmer Workshop from existing 210
units in terms of four wheelers per month to 360. Changes in the existing
structures are also resuired to handle the present day coaches with
simultaneous increase in berthing facilities for the additional load
required to be handled. Streamlining of POH activity in various sub-shops
is equally necessary to eliminate criss-cross movemeuts and idle time at
various stages. It has, therefore, become necessary to modernize the
existing carriage and wagon workshop at Ajmer.
17.       Although the two workshops, namely, Carriage and Wagon and Loco
Shops are independent entities in respect of POH repairs, in the sphere of
manufacturing activity, which supplements the PO repair activity they
are interdependent. For example, Grey Iron and Nou-Ferrous Foundry
situated in Loco works caters to the need of both the shops. Similarly,
the Wheel shop of loco shop supplements the requirements of the Carriage



-82-
Annex F
Page 5 of 6
and Wagon Works. Keeping this interdependence in view, the modernization
of C&W workshops has to esseutially include modernization of certain
elements like Foundry, Machine Shop, Spring Repair Shop and Forge Shop
situated in Loco works.
18.       Integral Coach Factory (ICF) was established in late 1955 to
manufacture all-steel light-weight passenger coaches. It was set up in
Madras in collaboration with Swiss Car & Elevator Manufacturing
Corporation of Switzerland for design technology. The coaches were
produced as unfinished shells at a rate of 350 per year and were shipped
to zonal railway workshops for outfitting of interiors. In 1962, a
Furnishing Division was added. By 1973/74, production reached 750 uuits
and 775 in 1982/83.
19.       The factory meets the varied requirements of the Indian
Railways. Besides the conventional coaches for BG and MG, special stock
like BG AC composite, AC 2-tier sleepers, EMUs, track recording cars,
double-deckers, dining cars, pantry cars, cushioned 3-tier sleepers, etc.,
are also manufactured. In addition, ICF has executed orders for coaches
from other countries in a limited way.
20.       The Railway Reforms Committee, in their Report on Production
and Maintenance of Rolling Stock (December 1982), has made specific
reference to "the present crisis in passenger movement convoluted in a
vicious circle whose identifiable starting point is shortage of
passenger-carrying capacity, accentuated by poor ways and means position".
On an assessment of the estimates of stock requirements, the Committee
underlined the need for creation of additional capacity of a magnitude
which would be at least equivalent to the present available annual
capacity of 1,500 coaches per annum. In the view of the Committee, the
situation called for a 'quantum jump-.
21.       In the context of the need for enlarged production capacity
underlined by successive committees, a proposal for: (a) stepping up the
outturn of ICF from the existing level of 750 coaches per year to 850 has
been submitted by ICF and approved by the Board, and is under
implementation; and (b) modernization of ICF workshops and stepping up
its capacity up to 1,000 coaches per year has been submitted by ICF in
the preliminary Works Program for 1984.
22.       Maintenance Depots perform day-to-day inspection and servicing
(renew brake bLocks, add engine lube oil, add water, refuel, etc.) and do
necessary running repairs. These depots also perform weekly, monthly, and
annnal inspections and maintenance. Maintenance depots play a major role
in the availbility, performance and operational safety of the railways.
This is due to the fact that aside from periodical overhaul (complete
stripping down of equipment, replacing and/or remanufacturing parts and



-83-
Annex F
Page 6 of 6
components, and reassembling), all other maintenance works are undertaken
in such facilities. Therefore, it is imperative that particular attention
be given to these facilities. Consequently, a selective process was
established, along the lines of that for major workshops, for supporting
units needing immediate attention. As a result, 37 major facilities were
selected for modernization.  The bulk of the investment is for machinery.
However, the emphasis will be on: (i) machinery and equipment to achieve
precision, proper testing and quality control required for maintenance of
modern motive power and rolling stock, which has been lacking, resulting
in unsatisfactory quality of work performed, abnormally high frequency of
breakdowns in operation and lower-than-normal life of parts and
components; and (ii) material-handling equipment to reduce frequent
interruptions in work flow and reduce damage to material in transport,
both having a major impact on output, quality and cost of repairs.

IR - Notes to Balance Sheet, March 31, 1983
1. Fixed Assets
The value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet is based on
their original costs. Additional cost of like-for-like replacements over
their cost (the inflationary element) is charged against DRF, and has not
been included in the figures in the balance sheet. Improvement element
at the time of replacement has been included in the Fixed Asset Account
in the balance sheet.
2. Depreciation Reserve Fund
This balance in the fund repreuents cumulative contributions
including interest earned to date less:
(a) value of assets withdrawn from services, and
(b) full cost of replacement.
3. Inventories
These are financed from Capital-at-Charge.
4. Investment financed from Railway Sources
These are the published figures representing amounts the Railways
provided from their own sources over the years towards the capital
investment program.
Development Fund
Development Fund is created out of IR's net revenue surpluses
after meeting dividend liability to GOI. In the last few years, IR
revenues have not been sufficient to clear dividend liabilities in full
and temporary loans were drawn to meet the expenditure chargeable to
Development Fund. As of March 31, 1983, IR has an outstanding loan of
Rs 2,242 million under the Development Fund. Because of the acceptance
by the Government of the recommendations of the Committee on IR's
Finances, there is no outstanding loan under the Revenue Reserve Fund,
but there is undischarged dividend liability of Rs 3,793 million which
has not been taken into account in the balance sheet. The year-to-year
position of the outstanding loan under the Development Fund is as under:

RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION AND WORKSHOP MODERNIZATION PROJECT
IR and Revenue and Expenditure Forecasts - Assumptions
1984/85 to 1989/90
1.        The FY84 figures represent IR-s budget estimates.  Subsequent
years FY85 to FY90 are Bank Group estimates based on the higher freight
razes as proposed in the Railway Budget for FY85, presented to Parliament
on February 24, 1984, and on traffic Levels forecasted (by the Bank Group)
in para 2.38 -Scenario II-. Correspondingly, it is assumed that small
improvements in operational efficiency as a result of the proposed project
would be achieved and is reflected in the total working expenses. Further
breakdown and assumptions used in forecasting revenues and expenditures
are discussed in subsequent paragraphs.
2.        The estimates, therefore, take account of the three major
influences which have occurred since the appraisal of the First
Modernization Project in 1978 that is over the past five years:
(a) the revision of tariffs which resulted in increases In both
freight rates and passenger fares during the period 1979/82, and
the increase allowed from April 1, 1983;
(b) increased costs of fuel and coal, repairs and maintenance, and
consumable stores; and
(c) the wage awards and dearness allowances sanctioned by GOI, the
latest being effective from April 1982, and the
productivity-linked bonus allowed to the railway staff for the
year 1979/80 onwards.
3.        Revenue forecasts for 1984/85 onward reflect the increase in
traffic anticipated during the period (para 2.35, Scenario II), but do
not take into account any further adjustment in tariff and fare levels,
though further upward adjustments are expected to take place in view of
the recommendations of the Rail Tariff Enquiry Committee.
4.        The total working expenses are based on the detailed analysis
of the current costs, related to freight and passenger traffic forecasts.
The ratios between the three main elements of the costs are as under:



-110-
Table 21
Page 3 of 3
.Personnel               -   49.1%
Fuel                    -   23.9%
Other Costs and Stores -   26.9%
5.        Provision for Appropriation to Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF)
for the year 1984 is based on the provision made by IR in its Budget
Escimate, and provision for subsequent years are those anticipated to be
made by IR in the light of its need for rehabilitation and are mission
estimates. After 1984/85 appropriation to DRF has been increased at a
rate of 8% per annum for subsequent years. Thus the mission estimates
take into account inflation and provide slight increase in appropriation
to DRF.
6.        Appropriation for the Pension Fund are based on estimated
expenditure on this account.
7.        Total revenues are projected to increase by about 27% during
the period 1984/85 to 1989/90, increasing from Rs 54,750 million to
Rs 69,305 million, respectively. Total working expenses are expected to
increase from Rs 40,110 million in 1984/85 to Rs 48,874 million in
1989/90, which in percentage terms is about 22%. This points to the high
level of variable costs and the need to further adjust the freight rates
and passenger fares. Total operating expenses are anticipated to increase
from Rs 50,820 million in 1984/85 to Rs 65,124 million in 1989/90
registering an increase of about 28%. The higher rate of increase in
expenditure is due to the steep step up in appropriation for depreciation.
8.        For the year 1982/83, average receipt per ton km of freight was
anticipated to be paise 17.7 and average receipt per passenger km was
paise 5.11.
9.        The revenue and expenditure forecast is based on IR-s assessment
of likely investment plan for the period 1985/86 to 1989/90.
