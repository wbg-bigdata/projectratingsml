Preface
1.       This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixth Power
Project, which was partially financed by Loan 1713-CR (US$34.0 million).
The Borrower was the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), which
reloaned US$5.6 million of the proceeds of the loan to the distribution
companies Companiia Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL) and Empresa de Servicios
PNblicos de Heredia (ESPH). The PCR was prepared by the Energy Division of
the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office based on information in the
Bank files, a final project report prepared by the Borrower, and
discussions with ataff of the Bank and the Borrower.
2.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the pro'ect was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower for its comments. The
comments received are reproduced as Attachment 1 to the Report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
STXTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1713-CR)
Highlights
1.       The Loan 1713-CR (US$34.0 million equivalent)l  helped to finance
training, consultant services for studies and transmission, subtransmission
and distribution facilities. The Project was successful in meeting its
objectives of: a) providing facilities to meet the system demand; b)
increasing the electrification ratio for urban population to almost 100%
and the one for rural population to about 73% and c) incorporating isolated
areas into the National Interconnected System (NIS).
2.     ' All the project components were executed except the conversion
(from 69 to 138kV) of the Rio Macho-San Isidso line and about 20% of the
ICE's distribution componient (para 3.1.6). There was also a reduction in
the scope of Borica Study (para 3.2.1). The savings allowed to add to the
Project:  the CaFnas-Penias transmission line; the substation of Arenal,
Alajuelita, Canas y Garita and works to upgrade the San Isidro-Rio Claro
transmission line from 138 to 230 kV, which would be one of the sections
for the interconnection with Panama.  Including all changes, the final
project cost was about US$62.4 million or 11% of cost overrun (para 3.4.1)
3.       The Project was completed by the end of 1986, approximately four
years later than the target completion date. The main cause of delay was
the resc!ieduling of works that took place as a result of slower demand due
to the slowdown in the country economic activity.
4.       The financial performance of ICE and CNFL (the main beneficiary)
during the period was adequate, because despite of having been affected by
high inflation and devaluation, their key financial ratios were adequate as
a result of substantial increase in tatiff and the rescheduling of ICE's
debt service with commercial banks that took place during the period of
Project execution.
1! approximately US$0.4 million of the loan was cancelled.



COSTA RICA
INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
I - BACKGROUND
1.1      Bank Lending to the Power Sector
1.1.1    Since 1961, the Bank has provided six loans to the electric power
sector of Costa Rica, amounting to US$114.8 million equivalent (Annex 1).
The beneficiary of these loans has been the power section of ICE.1 The
last two loans included financing for sub-transmission and distribution
works of ICE's subsidiary, Compaiiia Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL), as
well as to two municipe' entities: Empresa de Servicios Pablicos de Heredia
(ESPH) and Junta Administrativa de Servicios Electricos Municipales de
Alajuela (TASEMA).
1.1.2    The Bank's first three power loans to ICE helped to finance the
construction of the first and second stages of the Rio Macho and Cachi
power stations. Mainly because of unforseeable adverse geological
conditions, substantial time and cost overruns affected the construction of
the civil works of these power stations. The fourth loan helped to finance
the installation of the San Antonio gas turbines (2x18.9 MW), which were
required because of the construction delays associated with the second-
stage extensions of the Cachi and Rio Macho hydro power stations.  The
fifth loar± helped to finance the construction of the first stage of the
Arenal hydro plant, installation of gas turbines at Moin, expansion of Rio
Macho and Cachi hydro plants and construction of various rransmission lines
and substations. The sixth loan (1979), which is the subject of this
report, helped to finance the Sixth Power Project, which was completed in
December 1986. All works completed under Bank loans are operating
satisfactorily.
1.2      Organization of the Electiic Power Sector
1.2.1    The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines (MIEM) is responsible
for o-erall energy policy and co-ordination of the sector. The Servicio
Nacional de Electricidad (SNE) regulates tariffs, grants concessions, and
sets technical standards. Power sector legislation confers a pre-emptive
right, to the Government for the generation, transmission, and distribution
of electricity, but also empowers it to authorize private and/or municipal
entities to engage in these operations. The Government exercises these
rights through ICE, an autonomous agency; CNFI, a large distribution
utility; two municipal companies; and four co-operatives.   ICE, CNFL, and
the other distribution entities together form the National Interconnected
System (NIS). Since the early 1970's, there has been a successful
consolidation of numerous small producers into fewer and larger entities.
Pursuant to this policy, which the Bank has supported, ICE acquired JASEMA
in 1979.
1/ ICE also provides telephone services.



-2-
1.2.2    The NIS generates, transmits, and distributes virtually all of the
publicly available electricity consumed in Costa Rica. The power section of
ICE and of its subsidiary, CNFL, dominate the NIS. In 1985, ICEICN?L
accounted for 97% of electricity generation of the NIS and served 85% of
its customers. ICE is responsible for electric sector planning and for
the sector expansiorn plans.  These plans are approved by the MIEFi and by
the Ministerio de Planificacion Nacional y de Politica Economica
(MIDEPIANY). JCE's Board is appointed by the Government, four members
represent the political party in power and the remaining three members are
chosen from the inain opposition political party.
II - PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1      Qrigin and Preparation of the Sixth Power ProSject.
2.1.1    During a supervision mission of the Fifth Power Project in March
1978, Bank staff reviewed ICE's transmission and distribution expansion
rp-n  for the period 1979-82.  ICE requested Bank financing to assist in
PA - t construction in July, 1978. The Project was prepared by ICE's
Pl-.  ng Department and found satisfactory and ready for appraisal by Bank
sta%
2.1.2    Ap?raisal took place at the end of October 1978; the mission found
that ICE's construction program for 1979-82 was well balanced. The program
included the following works:
(i) The completion of the first stage (157MW) of the Arenal
hydroelectric development and associated transmission and
distribution facilities;
(li) the 174 MW Corobici hydroplant;
(iii) the transmission and distribution items of the Proposed
Sixth Power Project;
(iv) other transmission (including the interconnection with
Nicaragua), subtransmission and distribution facilities
to be financed by Central American Bank for Economic
Integration and ICE; and
(v)  isolated generating plants and distribution items included
in the natio-nal rural electrification program, to be
financed by Interamerican Development Bank and ICE.
2,1.3    The mission and ICE agreed on the following description of the
Sixth Power Project:
A) ICE
(i)   transmission lines (2 kms of 220 kV, 125 kmis of 138 kV,
68 kn to be converted from 69 to 138 kV) and
substations (100 MVA for 220/138 kV, 20 MVA for 220/34.5
kV9 and 95 MVA for 138/34.5 kV)



-3-
(ii) Subtransmission and distribution facilities comprising
171 kms of new 34.5 kv lines, 343 kms of lines to be
converted to 34.5 kV and a transformation capacity of 30MVA
for 31.5/0.22 kV;
(iii) expansion of the dispatch center;
(iv) studies and associated consulting services to:
a)  bring the Boruca project to the level of design, and
define the place of this project in the sequence of
future generating facilities of the country,
b) assess the feasibility of developing small
hydroelectric or wind power stations, and
c) assist ICE in the planning of ite transmission
system, the standardization of the sector's transmission
and distribution facilities, the optimization of the
insulation levels, the coordination of protections,
and the installation of a transformer maintenance
workshop;
(v)    train staff in structural engineering, hydrology,
maintenance and installation of transmission and
distribution system, and
(vi)   acquire equipment for protection, measurement, maintenance
and protection of transmission facilities.
B) CNFL
Subtransmission and distribution facilities comprising 48 kms of
new 34.5 kV lines, 293 kms of lines to be converted to 34.5 kV
and a transformation capacity of 94.6 MVA for 34.5/0.22 kV.
C) ESPH
Subtransmission and distribution facilities comprising 8 kms of
new 34.5 kV lines, 50 kms of lines to be converted to 34.5 kV
and a transformation capacity of 4.5 MVA for 34.5/0.22 kV.
D) JASEMA
All but the high tension part of the 30 MVA 138/34.5 kV Alajuela
substation (to be connected with ICE's La Garita and La Caja
substations).
2.1.4    The appraisal mission estimated the cost of the Project at US$
56.2 million (including 4.2 million of interest during construction), with
foreign and local costs estimated at US$36.7 and US$19.5 million,
respectively. The Project financing plan called for ICE to finance the
local cost and US$1.4 million of interest during construction; IDB would



4
finance US$1.3 million of the foreign cost of the Boruca studies. The
balance would be covered by the US$34.0 million Bank loan. An amount
equivalent to US$6.8 million of the Bank loan would be onlent, on the same
terms and conditions as the principal loan, to CNFL, JASEMA and ESPH for
their portion of the Project.
2.2      Negotiations, Board Approval and Effectiveness
2.2.1    No major problems delayed negotiations, which took place on April
19-23, 1979. At negotiations, it was agreed to change for Board
presentation a proposed condition of effectiveness, which required ICE and
CNFL to apply for tariff increases.
2.2.2    On May 31, 1979 the Executive Directors of the Bank approved a
loan of US$34 million. The loan had a term of 15 years, including 3 years
of grace. The interest rate was 7.9% and the commitment fee was 3/4 %. The
loan was signed on June 25, 1979.
2.2.3    The loan became effective on September 16, 1980, about 12 months
later than originally envisaged. The primary reason for the delay was that
the National Assembly acted slowly to ratify the loan because there was
disagreement on the constitutionality of some standard sections of the Loan
Agreement. This was solved after a long period of discussions and
consultations between the National Assembly, the Government, ICE and the
Bank. This delay contributed to the four-year time overrun in the
implementation of the Project, as ICE was not able to sign some contracts
already awarded.
III PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1      Timetable and Changes in the Prolect
3.1.1.   Implementation of the Project ended in December 1986, four years
later than the original completion date. Annex 3.1 shows the detailed
works components and a compa:ison between the actual and forecast
completion dates.
3.1.2.   One cause of delay was the rescheduling of works that took place
as a result of slower demand due to the economic recession that Costa Rica
faced after the project was launched in 1979. Annex 3.2 presents a
comparison between the appraisal and actual electricity sales for 1979-83
of the National Interconnected System (NIS) that shows that annual sales
were generally lower than the appraisal estimate.2   Problems with
preparation of tender documents (para. 3.1.3), late delivery of equipment
and materials and scarcity of counterpart funds, contributed also to the
Project delay.
3.1.3    At the start of the Project implementation there were some
problems with the consistency of bidding documents, award recommendations
2/ In 1982 and 1983 the NIS'; sales were 3% and 7% lower than the
appraisal estimate.



and the use of escalation formulas that caused some delay. Following
effectiveness of the loan agreement (September 1980), the Bank promptly
sent a procurement engineer (February 1981) to advise ICE's staff. This
helped to speed up the process of procurement.
3.1.4.   All the project components were executed, except the conversion of
the Rio Macho-San Isidro line from 69 to 138kV3 and about 20% of ICE's
distribution facilities (para. 3.1.6). There was also a reduction in the
scope of the Boruca study (para. 3.2.1). The resulting savings allowed the
following additions to the Project: the Caias-Penas transmission line;
substation expansions at Arenal, Alajuelita, Canas and Garita; and works to
upgrade the San Isidro - Rio Claro transmission line, tc support the
interconnection with Panama, from 138 to 230 kV. This line was energized
in 1986, and has increased the reliability of the system. The execution of
the Project was satisfactory.
3.1.5    The Loan Agreement provided that ICE would on-lend US$6.8 million
to CNFL, ESPH and JASEMA (para. 2.1.4), but the actual amount on-lent was
US$5.6 million. This reduction reflected the fact that ICE carried out the
works originally assigned to JASEMA, which ICE absorbed in 1979. ICE also
carried out the low voltage expansion assigned to ESPH in the new Heredia
substation due to financial difficulties of ESPH; ESPH executed the other
distribution works assigned to it. CNFL executed the components of the
Project under its responsibility, but with a time overrun of about three
years.
3.1.6     The distribution component was the part of the Project with the
most time overrun (up to about four years).   This overrun partly reflects
the slower demand growth and technical problems associated with the
improvement of the system in urban areas which required a program of
Laterruptions of service. ICE's plan for executing this part of the Project
seems to have been optimistic. The Bank's supervision reports paid little
attention to this component of the project and the missions failed to
visit some of the beneficiaries (CNFL, ESPH), which r,ight have helped to
achieve a better understanding of the problems and design corrective
meastres. This did not affect the quality of service or the distribution
loss reduction target, mainly because the demand did not grow as expected.
Losses decreased from 10.3% in 1979 to 9.5% in 1985 (Annex 3.3).
3.2      Studies
3.2.1.   With the help of consultants, ICE undertook the following studies:
evaluation of non-conventional sources of energy, prospect for mini-
hydroelectric plants, system planning, and feasibility of the Boruca
hydroelectric project. The Bank considered that these studies were adequate
for achieving the objectives foreseen at the time of appraisal. The study
of non-conventional sources of energy found that there are prospects for
the utilization of solar energy for water heating and for the installation
of small wind-driven turbines for generation of electricity and recommended
3/ ICE, with Bank agreement decided to leave this line for distribution
and build a new 230kV Rio Macho- San Isidro line, which would be part
of the interconnection line with Panama. This work was financed by IDB.



-6-
to develop pilot plants to test the feasibility of these sources.
Concerning the study of mini-hydroelectric plants, the consultant made a
pre-feasibility study of two sites, Puerto Jimenez and Providencia, and
found that, due to cost and reliability of the service, it was more
economical to continue serving the towns close to these projects from the
main grid. The study on system planning reviewed the scheme for reactive
current compensation in the 230 kV lines, analyzed ways to solve some
technical problems of the interconnection line with Nicaragua due to the
line length and problems of interference of the high voltage lines with the
communicating equipment of the international airport. The feasibility
study of the Boruca hydroelectric plant was completed but the final design
was deleted because the installation of a large aluminum processing plant,
which had been expected to be the plant's main customer, did not
materialize. The new generation development plan shows that the plant will
not be required until the year 2000.
3.2.2    The Loan Agreement required ICE to review the tariff study based
on marginal cost principles (prepared by a consultant under Loan 1126-CR),
which recommended further analysis of consumer behavior and load
characteristics. Based on this review, ICE would furnish to the Bank for
comments a proposal for revising the tariff structure by June 30, 1981.
This report was submitted to the Bank in August 1984. The conclusions of
the study were that the rates to small consumers were in general
substantially lower and those to larger consumers were higher than those
calculated using marginal costs criteria. The study concluded, however,
that it would be difficult to implement properly structured tariffs because
of the difficult social and economic situation of the country. As ICE had
been increasing its tariffs steadily and the Bank staff knew of the social
reaction that these measures had produced, and also because ICE's finances
had improved as a result of the renegotiation of its debt, the Bank did not
pursue this point further and left it for discussion under the Seventh
Power Project that was under discussion at that time.
3.3.     Training
3.3.1    The Bank was satisfied with the twelve courses completed by ICE's
professional and technical staff, which were conducted mostly by
professionals of the University of Mexico. The courses covered the main
following subjects: construction and maintenance of transmission and
distribution lines, operation and electrical installation of plants and
substations, electromechanical maintenance and e±ectronics and control,
hydrology, organization and planning in a construction company and project
administration. ICE also acquired educational equipment to be used in its
permanent training centers.
3.4      Project Costs
3.4.1    Annexes 3.4 shows actual and forecast costs. Including all
changes, the final Project cost was about US$62.4 million (in current
prices) -is compared with the appraisal forecast of US$56.2 million, or 11%
of cost overrun. A more meaningful comparison is between the project
components that were planned and executed, which gives an actual cost of
US$54.5 million, or a cost underrun of 2.5%. From this standpoint the
project was also successful.



-7-
3.4.2    Annexes 3.6 and 3.7 compare actual and forecast data disbursements
and allocation of loan proceeds by categories.
3.5      Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.5.1    ICE's staff carried out the project enginieering design,
construction and supervision, except the construction of San Isidro-Rio
Claro line that was done by a foreign contractor. ICE hired consultants to
undertake the studies on non-conventional sources of energy, mini-
hydroelectric plants, system planning and feasibility of the Boruca
hydroelectric project. ICE and the Bank considered that the works of the
contractor and the consultants were satisfactory.
3.6      Bank - ICE Cooperation
3.6.1    Collaboration between the Bank and ICE staff during the
implementation of the Project was close. ICE's performance was professional
and satisfactory. However, the Bank staff, in their supervision missions,
did not visit the other beneficiaries, which might have helped in the
project implementation and in the institution building objective of the
Project.
3.7      Major Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
3.7.1    Annex 3.8 sets forth major covenants of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements for the Sixth Power Project . The compliance of ICE and the
Government was satisfactory during most of the years of Project execution,
except in regard to the rate of return of ICE for 1981 and of CNFL for
1982. The Bank agreed to the lower rate of return in view of the
significant tariff increases that took place (para. 5.1.4). ICE also failed
to submit the annual Audit Financial statements of CNFL and to obtain
Bank's Agreement for appointing CNFL's auditor. The Bank did not press
CNFL to fulfill its commitment regarding the furnishing of the audit
reports and the appointment of auditors acceptable to the Bank.
IV - PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1      Need to supply transmission facilities
4.1.1    The main objective of the investment program, of which the Project
formed a part, was to provide the NIS with the generation, transmission and
distributing facilities to supply the electricity needs of the industrial
and commercial sectors and to increase the coverage of electricity from 75%
in 1978 to 90% in 2000; reduce oil consumption for power generation, and
improve the reliability of the system by interconnecting the grid with
Nicaragua and Panama.
4.1.2    The project was successful in meeting its objectives by: a)
allowing an adequate supply of electricity to the industrial and commercial
sectors; b) incorporating isolated areas into the NIS, which implied saving
in imported fuel and c) increasing the electrification ratio to about 100%



-8-
in urban areas and to about 73% in rural areas. It is also important to
point out that the interconnection with Nicaragua, that operates since July
19824 and the interconnection with Panama, that operates since March
19864, have helped to improve the reliability of the systems. In the
period 1982-85 Costa Rica sold 761 GWh to Nicaragua and 316 GWh to
Honduras. Sales to both countries for the years 1982 to 1985 represented
6%, 19%, 17% and 2% of total ICE's electricity sales, respectively. The
low level of interchange between Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Honduras in
1985, is due to the fact that Costa Rica does not have spare capacity. A
new generation project, Ventanas Garita, would be commissioned in September
1987. The interchange of electricity between Costa Rica and Panama has been
made on emergency basis. In 1986 the net sales of Costa Rica were 73 GWh.
4.2      Rate of return on investment
4.2.1    The appraisal included an estimated rate of return of 10.6%,
including in the costs stream, the investments in Corobici and in the Sixth
Power Project and the operating costs of ICE and CNFL. On the benefits
side, a share of the incremental NIS's sales were attributed to the
Project, and valued at the average retail tariff. Both costs and benefits
were calculated at 1978 prices. Following the same methodology, but with
actual data for the period 1979-86, the rate of return has been estimated
to be about 10%, which is close to the appraisal estimate but slightly
below the opportunity cost of capital in Costa Rica (Annex 4.1). This
finding is consistent with the assessment that electricity rates are
somewhat below long marginal costs, but also reflects the lower rate of
market growth that took place (6% actual between 1979-80 against 8%
expected at appraisal).
V - FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      Comparison of Actual and Forecast Data
5.1.1    Annexes 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 compare the actual and appraisal forecast
income statements, sources and applications of funds, balance sheets and
performance indicators for ICE for the period 1979-1985. ICE's financial
performance during the period was adequate, but not without difficulties.
The main problem was caused by the slowdown in economic activity after
1979, due in great part to the Central American political crisis, which
disrupted the Central American Common Market to which the industrial
exports of Costa Rica had been oriented. Likewise, at the end of the
1970's the terms of trade deteriorated, as coffee prices dropped and oil
prices rose, producing deficits in the Balance of Payments, which were
largely funded through external borrowing, especially from commercial
banks. By 1980 the colon had become seriously overvalued. Although the
Government finally allowed the colon to float by the end of 1980, the
situation reached crisis proportions during 1981, as GDP declined by 2.3%,
4/ Nicaragua is also interconnected with Honduras and therefore four
countries (Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama) benefit from
this interconnection



9
there were serious balance of payments problems, and inflation climbed to
37%. Faced with rapidly increasing debt service obligations and depletion
of reserves, Costa Rica suspended debt service to all but multilateral
creditors. During 1982, the country's economic crisis worsened, with GDP
falling by 7.3% and inflation climbing to about 90%. Due to this situation
the Government in mide 1982 introduced important adjustment measures,
resumed partial debt service payments to commercial banks in the same year,
entered in a stand-by agreement with the IMF in December 1982 and in a
rescheduling agreement with commercial banks in 1983. As a result, some
improvement in the economic activity took place. GDP grew at 3.4% in 1983,
7.5% in 1984 and 1% in 1985. In 1985 the Government continued its economic
stabilization and recovery efforts, which were supported by another stand-
by agreement with the IMF and a Structural Adjustment Loan from the Bank.
_.1.2    ICE's finances were affected by inflation, the high pace of
devaluation and decrease in industrial sales; however, despite these
unfavorable factors, the key financial ratios were maintained at acceptable
levels (Annex 3.3). The rate of return was in line with the covenanted
level of 9% for all the years of the period, except 1982. The self-
financing ratio was generally lower than the forecast at appraisal, with
negative values in 1981 and 1982. The debt-equity ratio improved from 60:40
in 1979 to 49:51 in 1985; however, the debt service coverage ratio was
lower than covenanted due to the short amortization period of commercial
loans that ICE obtained and to devaluation. The rescheduling of the Costa
Rica's foreign debt in 1983 improved the debt service coverage ratio for
the subsequent years of the Project.5
5.1.3.   Other factors that affected ICE' finances, but to a lesser extent,
were the increase in the number of employees and the high level of accounts
receivable. The number of permanent employees grew at an average rate of
8% p.a. between 1979 and 1985, reaching 4398 in 1985. The Bank expressed
its concern to ICE on this respect and in the dialogue with the Bank
missions in 1982, ICE agreed to implement corrective measures, such as a
hiring freeze, reduction through attrition and replacement .f vacancies
through "in house" selection. However, even though some efforts were made,
the trend was not altered fundamentally. The Bank on its part, did not
pursue this point further. Regarding accounts receivable, the collection
period increase to a maximum of 145 days in 1983; though the situation has
improved in recent years, accounts receivable are still high, representing
97 days in 1985 compared to the normal level of about 60 days. The main
reason for this high level of accounts receivable is the poor payment
record of Government entities and of CNFL.
5.1.4    Electricity rates increased at an annual average rate of about
40%, from 0.30 colones in 1979 to 2.19 colones in 1985. In 1978 prices
tariff grew at about 6% p.a., which was higher than the increase in
operating costs. ICE plans to continue increasing gradually its rates for
residential consumption to approximate to the economic cost of electricity.
5/  This rescheduling agreement allowed ICE to postpone principal payments
of about US$67 million (in arrears as of December 1983) to the period
mid 1987 to December 1994 and also to pay overdue interest of about
US$62 million with the proceeds of a loan provided to Costa Rica by
foreign banks.

5.1.5    Annexes 5.4 and 5.5 show the actual income statements and balance
sheets for CNFL for the period 1979-85. CNFL's financial performance
during the period was adequate, but like ICE it was affected by high
inflation, high devaluation and slowdown in demand growth. Financial
indicators presented in Annex 3.3 show that the rate of return was
generally above the 5% minimum covenanted for all years, except for 1982.
The debt-equity ratio improved from. 36:64 in 1979 to 22:78 in 1985, in part
reflecting asset revaluation. Despite this, the company had some
difficulties in funding the local costs of its itnvestment program and in
paying ICE for electricity purchases.
VI - ORGANIZATION PERFORMANCE
6.1      Performance of ICE
6.1.1    Except for overstaffing, ICE continues to be well organized and
managed, as reflected in the favorable Market Penetration and Efficiency
Indicators (Annex 3.3). It is also worth mentioning that in spite of Costa
Rica's severe economic difficulties, ICE has been able to maintain an
adequate financial situation (para.5.1.2). The Government played an
important role by supporting ICE's proposals for tariff increases,
abstaining from political interference and allowing ICE to benefit from the
rescheduling of Costa Rica's foreign debt. However, ICE did not perform
satisfactorily regarding the target of number of employees (para. 5.1.3).
6.2      PCeformance of the Bank Staff
6.2.1    Bank staff performed well during the preparation and
implementation of the Project, except regarding the supervision of the
distribution components of CNFL and ESPH. Bank staff were flexible in
assessing compliance with covenants when economic conditions deteriorated,
allowing for a constructive dialogue and cooperative efforts to identify
suitable solutions.
VII - LESSON TO BE LEARNED.
7.1      The Project was well exec-ited, in spite of delays and difficult
economic conditions of Costa Rica. The problems were overcome to a great
extent due to the skill and dedication of ICE staff which confirm the
importance of institution building as a tool of development. By the same
token, however, the Bank's failure to follow closely the progress of the
components of smaller beneficiaries and to provide them with direct
assistance and advice may be regarded as inadequate. Supervision missions
of projects with several beneficiaries should ensure that all beneficiaries
receive close attention.
7.2      The flexibility displayed by Bank staff when Costa Rica's economic
conditions deteriorated and IC. was faced with non compliance with its
financiiel covenants, should be commended as it resulted in a constructive
dialogue through which the ultimate objective of sound financial
performance was soon achieved.

for the Sixth Po.`roec
l.      Performance of ICE, as well as the other power entities

noted:
(i)    Sections 3.01 and 4.01  required ICE to carry out the
