I. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Costa Rica has no known coal reserves.  Minor oil deposits have
been discovered near Turrialba and south of Puerto Limon; however, at this
stage, they do not seem to be commercially exploitable. Offshore oil
exploration, which the Government (in association with a French firm) started
a few years ago, has not led to the identification of any further deposits.
1.02      Surface investigations carried out during the early 1970's have
revealed the existence of geothermal resources in Guanacaste province in the
northwestern part of the country. Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad
(ICE), the borrower of the proposed loan, assisted by consultants, carried out
further studies in the same region. These were financed by the Inter American
Development Bank (IDB) and confirmed the high probability that the identified
sources may be large enough to sustain operation of economically-viable thermal
power plants of significant size. ICE is presently planning to commission a
40 MW geothermal unit in mid-1986. Further investigations, including the
drilling of wells, are presently under way; IDB is also providing financing
for this prospecting work.
1.03      Hydro power is by far Costa Rica's most abundant energy resource.
ICE has identified 75 sites, many of them economically quite promising, for
hydroelectric plants with a total potential of 9,000 MW and a possible annual
output of 37,000 GWh. The Government is giving highest priority to the devel-
opment of this potential (para. 1.06), especially after the dramatic increase
of petroleum prices in 1973-1975. Though hydro power is the fastest-developing
source of energy in Costa Rica, only 305 MW had been harnessed through the
end of 1978. However, by 1980, after complete commissioning of the Arenal
plant, this capacity will increase to 462 MW and in 1982, after commissioning
of Corobici, to 636 MW.
Sources of Energy
1.04      In 1960 and 1976, total primary energy consumption in Costa Rica
had the following origin:
Total in Petroleum                                       Wood,
Equivalent               Oil and         Hydro    Bagasse
(thousands of t)          Derivatives       Power       etc.
1960               560                      34%            22%         44%
1976             1,600                      50%            36%         14%
This table shows that, while petroleum consumption has grown rapidly as the
economy modernizes, the growth in consumption of hydro power has been even
greater. The modernization process has also resulted in a modest decrease
in the use of wood, bagasse, etc. from about 246,000 to 240,000 t of petro-
leum equivalent per annum.

The Role of the Power Sector in the Economy
1.05      Power sector investment in the period 1976-78 represented about 25%
of total public fixed investment in Costa Rica. This relatively large share
reflects the importance of hydroelectricity in energy supply and the priority
Government gives to reliable electricity service:
(i)  to the general public in both urban and rural areas, where
a relatively high percentage of the population has connec-
tions to the public electricity supply system (para 1.09);
and
(ii)  to the industrial sector, whose share of GDP (about 25% in
1975) is growing and which provides employment for an increas-
ing part (in 1975, about 20%) of the work force.
Sector Organization
1.06      ICE and its 92%-owned subsidiary, Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz
(CNFL), are by far the largest entities of the sector. Although ICE is less
involved in the day-to-day operating decisions of CNFL than might be expected
for a majority shareholder, it does review major CNFL policy decisions and
planning is now more coordinated than in the past. Together they generate
95% and distribute 83% of the electric energy for public consumption. The
sector further includes municipal utilities in Alajuela, Heredia and Cartago
(all three near San Jose), and four rural electrification cooperatives
(Guanacaste, San Carlos, de los Santos, and Alfaro Ruiz). Until recently,
there were numerous additional independent entities serving isolated centers.
However, ICE succeeded in absorbing most of them and eventually expects to
integrate some of the remaining few, with the exception of the above-mentioned
municipal utilities and rural cooperatives. In the past, the Bank encouraged
the Government and ICE to consolidate the sector. ICE has succeeded in
obtaining a large measure of control over the planning of the various other
companies of the sector. However, the Government has consistently resisted
the take-over by ICE of the three municipal entities in Alajuela, Heredia and
Cartago because of local political opposition to such a step. Nevertheless,
ICE's influence on these utilities has, during the past three years, helped to
improve standardization of the sector's procedures, design and equipment. It
is expected that the inclusion in the proposed project of subtransmission
and distribution facilities for CNFL (to whom part of the Bank's fifth power
loan was on-lent), Empresa de Servicios Publicos de Heredia (ESPH) and Junta
Administrativa de Servicios Electricos Municipales de Alajuela (JASEMA) will
further strengthen ICE's influence in the sector (para. 3.12).
Sector Regulation
1.07      Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (SNE), Costa Rica's regulatory
authority, not only has jurisdiction over the power sector, but also over ICE's
telecommunications operations and over all entities which supply public water
and sewerage service. On the basis of its 1941 enabling legislation, SNE is



-3-
also permitted to construct and operate public service electricity supply
systems. However, SNE has never availed itself of the latter authority and has
confined its activities to regulation.
1.08      Government appoints the five members of SNE's board of whom one is
the Director and Manager and two are Deputy-Directors and Department Heads.
Although the agency is autonomous, it normally consults Government before
approving increases in tariffs. Until 1974, relations between SNE and the
entities of the power sector, in particular ICE, were strained because SNE
delayed decisions on proposals for tariff adjustments for unwarranted periods,
in some instances more than a year. In the past four years, however, SNE's
attitude and efficiency have significantly improved; in particular, applica-
tions for tariff adjustments have been dealt with in about three months, which
is reasonable. As under previous loans, SNE provided assurances that it will
continue to deal expeditiously with ICE and CNFL tariff applications.
Access to Service and Electricity Consumption
1.09      About 75% of Costa Rica's population (87% of the urban and 41% of
the rural population) was connected to electricity in 1978.  This is about
the same overall percentage as in Mexico. It can be estimated that fewer
than 5% of the households with access to public electricity supply (by virtue
of living within 100 m of existing distribution lines) do not enjoy the
benefit of a connection. However, as noted in para. 1.24, considerable
further efforts will be required to increase access to service in rural
areas.
1.10      Per capita electricity consumption in Costa Rica (about 690 kWh per
annum) is among the highest in the Central American region. In relation to
other countries with similar per capita GNP, electricity consumption is
normal. 1/ As the table below demonstrates, use of electricity is heavily
residential. This is in contrast to the predominance of industrial consumption
in other Central American countries; it is mainly due to Costa Rica's compara-
tively high per capita GDP and relatively egalitarian income distribution.
The share of industrial consumption is expected to increase in line with
progressive industrialization.

Existing Facilities
1.11      By the end of 1978, generating capacity installed in Costa Rica was
about 506 MW; the table below gives a breakdown:

Total Sector               506        305     99         22       80
All but about 4 MW of the capacity installed for public supply is integrated
in the National Interconnected System (SNI). Most of the 42 MW of captive
plant is associated with agro-industry in remote parts of the country; some
of it is connected to isolated public supply systems. Annex 1.1 shows a
breakdown of public consumption.
1.12      In 1978 electric energy generation in the sector was estimated to be
as follows:
------------Generation in GWh---------

About 4 GWh generated in captive plants was distributed for public consump-
tion.
1.13      1,475 GWh of the 1,708 GWh gross generation for public consumption
in 1977 was effectively sold to ultimate consumers, which implies that total
generation, transmission and distribution losses and unaccounted-for consump-
tion were a reasonable 13.6% of gross generation. The proposed project, which
foresees the re-building of obsolete distribution systems, should allow this
loss figure to be reduced. Annex 1.2 gives a breakdown of gross generation
and losses.

History of Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.14      The Bank has provided major financial assistance for power sector
development through five loans totalling US$80.8 million (see table below)
which helped finance most of the sector's hydroelectric generating capacity in
operation before 1978, much of its thermal capacity and a significant part of
the transmission and distribution facilities. ICE was the Borrower for all
the loans.

The Bank also lent US$67.6 to ICE for telecommunications projects. Annex 1.3
gives the breakdown of these loans.
1.15      ICE's overall performance has been good, in spite of specific
problems discussed below. All but the last of the above projects are now
completed, some of them only after long delays and with large cost overruns.

tunnel (18 months delay, 88% cost overrun) and the Cachi reservoir (11 months
delay, 91% cost overrun) were mostly due to unexpectedly unfavorable geological
conditions. These conditions might have been detected beforehand, if at all,
only by carrying out prohibitively expensive underground investigations. Never-
theless, this experience together with other less dramatic ones induced ICE to
hire consultants increasingly at an early stage of design. Despite these pre-
cautions, ICE experienced serious difficulties during the initial tests of its
most recent major hydroelectric project, the 157 MW Arenal plant, which is
being financed by IDB. The tests revealed that in a 1,000 m long section of
the pressure tunnel, the rock--a volcanic tuff--was not strong enough, thus
endangering the stability of the structure. ICE has already made arrangements
to strengthen the affected tunnel section with a steel lining backfilled with
concrete and grouted material at an estimated cost of about US$17 million.
These works will delay commissioning of Arenal by about 9 months. ICE will
have to increase considerably its thermal generation, leading to substantially
increased fuel imports. During the 1979 dry season (February to April) the
thermal energy produced in the system failed to cover demand fully, forcing
the sector to ration electricity.
1.16      The principal components of the project financed by Loan 800-CR were
completed on time; a small cost overrun is attributable to the increased
scope of the project. ICE encountered serious difficulties with the electronic
controls and with the power transformers in the initial operation of the gas
turbines which are the principal project component. These now appear to have
been resolved.
1.17      The items included in the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1126-CR) have
suffered delays of between 12 and 29 months. These delays are attributable in
part to ICE's slowness in initiating procurement, but they are largely the
result of factors outside ICE's control. The latter include late delivery
of equipment for the extensions of the Rio Macho and Cachi plants and an
extended dispute with an unsuccessful bidder for the load dispatch center
included in the project, which has recently been resolved in ICE's favor.
These delays were analyzed during the appraisal of the proposed project, which
is similar in concept to the transmission and distribution portions of the
Fifth Power Project. The project implementation schedule for the Sixth Power
Project accordingly reflects the lessons learned under the Fifth Project.
Government Objectives for the Sector
1.18      In framing its economic and social policy, the government has set
the following objectives for the power sector:
(i)  Assuring a reliable and sufficient electricity supply
to the industrial and commercial sectors and increasing
provision of electricity from 75% of all dwellings in
1978 to 85% by 1990 and 90% by the year 2000;
(ii) Attracting industries requiring large amounts of electric
power, by developing the country's hydro potential;



(iii)  Reducing oil consumption in the power sector by substi-
tuting hydro and geothermal energy for electric energy
generated in conventional thermal plants and extending as
far as economically feasible the SNI to eliminate diesel
generators presently feeding isolated systems;
(iv)  Interconnecting Costa Rica's power system with Nicaragua
(para. 5.12) and possibly with Panama.
1.19      In urban areas nearly all households are already connected and
system extensions are essentially limited to the supply to new dwellings.
Consequently, the main effort required to achieve objective (i) above refers
to the installation of the additional required generating (para. 4.02) and
transmission capacity (para. 4.07) and to rural electrification (para 1.24).
1.20      ICE's 1979-1982 program includes the studies required for providing
the basis to achieve goal (ii). The first such study will concern the Boruca
hydro power plant.
Boruca Hydroelectric Development
1.21      A bauxite deposit near San Isidro del General on the Pacific slope
of the central mountain range and a large hydro potential at the Boruca site
(located less than 100 km from the above deposit on the Rio Grande de Terraba)
were identified over a decade ago. The existence of these two resources
in relative proximity suggested the possibility of constructing an alumina/
aluminum complex fed with power from a large plant at Boruca. A first series
of investigations carried out during the period 1970-1976 by Alcoa (USA) as
the potential investor and the consultants Norconsult (Norway) on behalf of
Costa Rica's National Aluminum Commission (CNA) ultimately led to the conclu-
sion that, at this stage, the quality and quantity of the bauxite did not
justify its extraction and refining. As a consequence Alcoa lost interest
in the venture. In the recent past, however, CNA succeeded in interesting
Martin-Marietta (USA) in a project for an aluminum smelter only, which would
use energy from Boruca. Since the raw material for the smelter (alumina)
would be imported from the U.S. Virgin Islands, it would be located near
Puerto Limon on the Atlantic coast.
1.22      The preliminary design for the Boruca hydro development foresees an
installed capacity of 760 MW producing about 5,000 GWh/year. The plant would
include a 260 m high rock-fill dam impounding up to 15 billion m3 of water, a
spillway with a capacity of 14,000 m3/s and an underground power house with
four units of 190 MW each. A 500 kV transmission line would be built over
Costa Rica's central mountain range. Commissioning would take place by 1987
at the earliest. In accordance with the latest investigations, the smelter
would be dimensioned for an output of 180,000 t per year. This would allow
ICE to use 45% (about 2,200 GWh/year) of the energy produced at Boruca for
supply to the public.
1.23      On behalf of Government, ICE selected a group of Canadian consulting
firms (Acres, SNC and Tecsult) to carry out, by early 1980, the studies and
the design work necessary to define the costs of the Boruca development with



- 8 -
sufficient accuracy to form a solid basis for contract negotiations between
Government and Martin-Marietta. These studies are included in the proposed
Sixth Power Project (para 4.07). CNA, on its side, has contracted Norconsult
to bring the smelter project to a similar level of accuracy. Furthermore, the
Government Planning Office (OFIPLAN) is carrying out studies of the economic
justification of the entire power-aluminum development. OFIPLAN is planning
to hire consultants who, in conjunction with the office's own specialists,
would carry out the economic analysis on the basis of the results of the
engineering studies, as these become available. If the Government and Martin-
Marietta do not reach an agreement, ICE is considering the study of a reduced
Boruca development which would generate entirely for supply to the public.
This plant would then be an alternative to those ICE plans to study in any
event (para. 4.02).
Rural Electrification
1.24      In the 1960s and early 1970s rural electrification was limited; it
consisted mainly of creating rural electrification cooperatives in selected
areas. USAID, IDB, Government and ICE provided the financing of these develop-
ments. In 1974 and 1975 ICE, encouraged by Government and the Bank, prepared a
national rural electrification plan which allowed a more systematic approach.
IDB, through its Fund for Special Operations, helped finance the first tranche
of the plan, which is to be completed in 1980. It is also planning to partici-
pate in the financing of the second tranche (para. 5.14) representing another
step towards attaining the goal of about 82% of rural population being con-
nected to the public electricity supply system by the year 2000. This objec-
tive must be reached to achieve the 90% overall electrification set by the
Government.
Tariffs
1.25      Each entity in the public electric service sector determines its
own tariff structure and levels which are then submitted to SNE for approval.
SNE is autonomous, but it normally consults with Government before deciding.
Existing tariffs reflect the traditional cost-of-service approach. As agreed
with the Bank in connection with Loan 1126-CR, ICE commissioned a study by
Chas. T. Main, Inc. (USA) of the tariff structures in the sector. Subject to
the carrying out of additional investigations on consumer behavior (requiring
special recording metering devices), the study recommended changes to the
present tariff structure, with the objective of making the tariff reflect
better the marginal cost of service to the different classes of customers.
ICE approved the study in 1978 and will import the special metering devices
which the study recommended be purchased. The additional studies are expected
to be completed by mid-1981. ICE has noted that many of the customers shown
by the study to be charged, under the present tariff, less than the marginal
cost to serve them, namely rural and small residential urban customers, are
precisely those whom the Government wishes to subsidize as a matter of policy.
ICE has a program for carrying out further investigations on consumer behavior,
revising the Chas. T. Main report and making of the decisions on appropriate
changes in the tariff structure. The agreed program forms part of the project
implementation schedule. ICE will gather data for a full year following the



- 9 -
arrival of the recording metering devices. ICE agreed to furnish the Bank for
comment by June 30, 1981, proposals on the changes to be made in the ICE/CNFL
tariff structure.
1.26      ICE and CNFL, taken together, sell 83% of public service
electricity (and serve 76% of Costa Rica's power consumers). Their present
tariffs, in effect since December 1976 and January 1977 respectively, are
shown in Annexes 1.4 and 1.5. They are among the lowest in Central America,
in part because the tariff proper excludes fuel charges, as the cost of fuel
consumed is accounted for separately and passed on to the consumer through a
surcharge, adjusted semi-annually, which presently amounts to 32% of the base
tariff. The start-up of Arenal will substantially eliminate the need for
thermal generation in the SNI, provided average hydrological conditions
prevail in 1980. ICE therefore plans to propose to SNE the reduction of the
fuel surcharge to zero from January 1, 1980. Simultaneously, ICE and CNFL
would apply for substantial increases in their base tariffs, as explained in
para 5.17.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.27      The Government's and ICE's plans to assign high priority to the
development of hydro power plants could place a heavy financial burden on the
country's economy. Should the financial requirements to carry out the expan-
sion plans for the sector increase substantially above those now projected,
higher tariff increases than envisaged might become necessary or a slowing
down in the attainment of the objectives for the sector. Over the long term,
financial requirements might be reduced through greater reliance on inter-
connection of the national power systems of Central America. The Economic
Commission for Latin America (ECLA) has commissioned a study on the subject,
which is to be completed in November 1979.
1.28      As the distributing entities must reach out further and further to
connect each new village, the investment per new rural customer becomes pro-
gressively higher, and may approach unacceptable levels. This might lead
to some scaling down of the targets for rural electrification. Some of the
villages presently served by isolated diesel plants are located near small
streams or in areas where strong winds customarily blow. Under the proposed
project, ICE will study alternative forms of small-scale hydro or aeolian
generation which might prove more attractive for supplying isolated localities
than diesel generation, interconnection with SNI, or alternative forms of
electricity generation, such as photovoltaic cells.
II. THE BORROWER
Legal Structure
2.01      The borrower would be the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad
(ICE), a government-owned autonomous institution established in 1949 to plan
and carry out a national electrification program. A 1963 law empowered it
to provide telecommunications service within the country and subsequent laws



- 10 -
have authorized its participation in providing international telecommunications
services. ICE is required to carry out its operations independently of the
government, except that:
-    ICE's Chairman and Members of the Board are appointed by Government;
-    tariff changes must be approved by SNE which normally consults the
Government (Ministry of Public Works and Transport) before approving
increases;
-    bond issues must be approved by the Central Bank.
ICE is exempt from all taxes except that it must specifically request exemp-
tion from customs duties on each importation of dutiable goods, (which exempticn
is normally granted without delay). ICE pays a fee (based on its installed
generating capacity) to cover part of the cost of operation of SNE and also
pays a fee for verification by SNE of the accuracy of its meters.
2.02      The Board of Directors consists of seven members, appointed for
eight year terms on a staggered basis with the exception of the Chairman,
whose four-year mandate coincides with the term of office of the President
of the Republic. The Board appoints ICE's general manager, three deputy-
managers, treasurer and internal auditor and confirms appointments by the
general manager to other senior positions. The internal auditor reports
directly to the Board. In the past the Bank observed that the Board was
either taking or confirming decisions which ought to have been within the
scope of authority of management. For the past several years, this has not
been a problem and is unlikely to recur.
Organization, Management and Staff
2.03      The organization charts for the Power and Administration and Finance
sections are attached as Annexes 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. The organization
appears adequate for ICE's present needs. The only substantial recent change
in ICE's organization was the separation, in June 1977, of the Administration
and Finance Section into three Divisions ("Direcciones"), Administration,
Finance and Personnel, which appears to have resulted in some improvements in
service.
2.04      On December 31, 1978, ICE's total staff numbered 7,677 of which
4,006 were assigned to power operations and construction (including 2,165 non-
permanent employees). The ratio of permanent power employees (including a
proportional share of Administration and Finance Section staff) was estimated
to be 1.55 staff members per GWh generated, compared to the forecast of appro-
ximately 1.41 contained in the performance indicators for the Fifth Power
Project. The increase, which resulted from a much faster than expected growth
in Administration and Finance Section employees, is attributed by ICE to the
need to meet expanded responsibilities under the Section's new organization.
The project performance indicators (Annex 5.6) call for a decline of the ratio
to 1.32 staff members per GWh generated by 1983. ICE noted the need to give
special attention to controlling the growth of its staff in order not to exceed
the staffing levels underlying the indicators. ICE's technical staff is capable
of carrying out its power operations satisfactorily.



- 11 -
Organization
2.05      The Bank has expressed the view that ICE's telecommunications
operations are sufficiently large to justify creation of a separate tele-
communications authority. However, provided a clear functional distinction
between power and telecommunications activities continues to be maintained
within ICE, it has accepted the Government's preference for a single entity.
ICE agreed to repeat the covenant included in Loan 1126-CR requiring separate
operation of the Power and Telecommunications Sections, the maintenance of
adequate separate records and the preparation of separate financial statements
for each.
Training
2.06      Training covers all aspects of ICE's activities and courses are
offered, at all levels, to both new staff and personnel with more seniority.
The program aims to complement other technical courses offered in Costa Rica
by the Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje and by the Instituto Tecnologico.
In addition to in-house training, professional employees participate in a
cooperative project with the Universities of Mexico and Costa Rica for
specialization in heavy construction and construction administration. ICE
also offers scholarships for professional study abroad. The programs are
followed up by an evaluation of their efficacy.
2.07      The program for the next four years provides for training of almost
800 power section employees, in such skills as:
-    construction and maintenance of transmission and distribution
lines;
-    plant and substation operation;
-    electrical installation of plants and substations;
-    electromechanical maintenance; and
-    electronics and control.
In addition, courses in administration will be offered to employees of both
the power and administration/finance sections. This program is considered
adequate. A small part of the loan would be used for the purchase of equipment
for the training program and payments to specialized instructors.
Accounting Systems and Auditors
2.08      ICE keeps its accounts in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The accounting system provides a satisfactory basis
for preparing annual financial statements. However, the monthly financial
statements are of limited usefulness, because many allocations, e.g. the
attribution to each operating section of costs, are made only at year-end.
This shortcoming will only be overcome when computerization of the manage-
ment information system has been achieved, which is expected by 1980. ICE
has already improved the allocation of expenditures between construction and
operational activities as a result of studies carried out under prior Bank
loans.



- 12 -
2.09      ICE's 1976-1977 financial statements have been audited by Venegas,
Alvarez y Co., a Costa Rican firm which represents Binder, Seidman & Co. (USA)
Their work is generally satisfactory, however, the form in which they report
is quite different from that in which ICE prepares its financial statements
internally. During project supervision, the Bank should continue to encourage
ICE and the external auditors to diminish their differences in the form of
presentation. ICE agreed to provide audited financial statements (for both
itself and CNFL) to the Bank within four months after year-end.
Billing and Collections
2.10      Billings and collections are satisfactory.  Customers' meters are
read each month and the readings sent to San Jose for billing by ICE's computer
center. In addition to the bills, reports on sales, revenue and accounts
receivable are produced by the computer center. ICE's primary customers
(distributors and large industries) have 10 days from bill presentation to pay
and are charged interest on overdue accounts. Distribution customers pay
their bills at decentralized ICE offices or at local businesses designated as
agents for receiving payment of ICE accounts. Customers are required to make
a deposit which may be appropriated by ICE in the event of non-payment of the
electricity bill. As a result, the power section's bad debt expense in 1978
was a relatively modest e 313,800. The average collection period improved
from 91 days in 1976 to 74 days in 1978.
Insurance
2.11      Utility plant, materials and supplies are insured against the
risks of fire and (in some cases) earthquakes, lightning, hurricanes,
floods, explosions and other risks. The insured values represented only
approximately 20% of year-end 1978 book values of electric plant because
dams, plant sites and certain other fixed assets are either not susceptible
to risk of fire or are distributed over such a wide geographic area that the
risk of any substantial loss due to fire is judged to be remote. ICE takes
the usual precautions to reduce risk of fire loss to its plants. ICE is
also insured for motor vehicle liability, workmen's compensation, goods-in-
transit, cash in transit, boiler explosion, public liability and employee
fidelity. All policies are with the Instituto Nacional de Seguros. No
large claims have been filed to date nor uninsured losses incurred. Manage-
ment reviews periodically the adequacy of insurance coverage.
Management Systems
2.12      ICE's management systems are considered to be generally satis-
factory. Studies are presently being undertaken by ICE, assisted by Urwick
International Ltd. (UK), of management information requirements and the
systems to provide the required information.

III. THE MARKET AND THE MEANS TO SUPPLY IT
Historical Market
3.01      During the period 1972-1977 sales to ultimate consumers in the
public power sector (Annex 1.1) have grown at an average rate of 7.1% per
year with a high of 9.0% in 1973 and a low of 4.8% in 1974, when inflation
soared and when the first electricity tariff increase in five years (over
70%) was effected.  During the same period, ICE's sales increased by an
average of 9.7% per year.  ICE's growth rate is higher than that of the
public power sector as a whole due to:  (i) absorption by ICE of other com-
panies, and (ii) Government policy that only ICE build new public generation
capacity. Annex 3.1 shows a break-down of the sales as well as the generation
and the losses in ICE's system; the latter are much lower than for the sector
because 73% of ICE's sales are at high voltage. Except for relatively small
losses on ICE's limited distribution systems, distribution losses occur
outside ICE's grid.
Revenue Forecast
3.02      ICE bases its sales and load forecasts on the detailed study
which it carried out in 1975-1976 and which covers the period 1976-1990.  In
1978 it revised the projections of this study to take into account (i) the
small discrepancies between estimated and actual figures for 1976 and 1977
and (ii) the modified (slightly lower) projection of economic growth for the
next five years.
3.03      For the residential and "general" (i.e. essentially commercial)
consumption, ICE analyzed in detail the trends for the past ten years in the
various parts of the country. It then extrapolated these trends on the
basis of the expected population growth and the planned peetration of the
market.
3.04      In forecasting the future demand of industrial consumers, ICE sets
apart large industries. For the existing ones and for those planned for
commissioning in the short term, it estimates the future needs on the basis
of consultations with the individual enterprises; the needs of large indus-
tries expected to be installed in the more distant future and not identifi-
able at this stage are taken into accounat, assuming a pattern of growth
similar to that set by the existing and identified future large industries.
For the remaining smaller industries, ICE extrapolates past trends.
3.05      In order to check the aggregate results obtained using the above
procedures, ICE prepares projections reflecting the foreseen development of
macroeconomic indicators related to energy consumption. Specifically, ICE
has shown that a linear relation between total sales to ultimate consumers,
GDP, and the economically active population, excluding that dedicated to
agriculture, fits the data base quite well. The projections obtained by
introducing the expected development of GDP, population and population struc-
ture into this linear equation show good concordance with the projections
obtained through the procedure described in paras. 3.03 and 3.04.



- 14 -
3.06      ICE's projections were reviewed with the consultants (Montreal
Engineering Co., Ltd. - Canada), who had prepared substantially higher
demand estimates in the frainework of the ECLA study of interconnections
in Central America (para. 1.27). This resulted in further minor adjust-
ments, leading to the forecast sales to ultimate consumers viven in Annex
3.2 for the period 1978-1983. The forecast average increase of sales to
ultimate consumers in Costa Rica is 7.7% per annuTI, ihich is considered
reasonable. For ICE, the corresponding growth rate in total sales would be
about 9.5%, which is higher than the growth of sector sales for the reasons
given in para. 3.01, and also because, in 1983, TCE is assumed to sell
149 GWh to Nicaragua. The economic feasibility of an interconnection between
Costa Rica and Nicaragua has been established and the necessary agreements
between ICE and the Nicaraguan utility, ENALUF, have been negotiated. Finan-
cing has also been secured by both utilities for the required transmission
facilities, to be provided by the Baylk (through Loan 1340-NI) and CABEI, and
procurement is expected to be initiated shortly. As noted in para 5.12, a
deferral of sales to Nicaragua, as a result of the difficulties currently
being experienced by that country, would have marginal effects on ICE.  If
these sales are not considered, ICE's 1978-83 sales growth would decline from
9.5% to 8.3% p.a. However, since the sales to Nicaragua are assumed to be
secondary energy, i.e., using water which would otherwise be spilled, the
sales reduction would have a negligible effect on ICE's investment program.
Capacity Requirements
3.07      ICE uses the above projections essentially for estimating revenues.
However, because installation of plant (in particular for generation) cannot
be adjusted at short notice, to follow the conservative estimate of demand
corresponding to the revenue estimates would imply an unacceptable risk of
lowering service standards or even suffering shortages of supply. For the
definition of the installation program for generation, transmission and
distribution facilities, ICE therefore assumes annual increases of power and
energy demands which are about 0.5 percentage points higher than those
adopted for sales.
3.08      The above procedure and the resulting projections are reasonable.
This opinion is supported, among others, by the fact that ICE's sales
estimates based on its 1975 study have proven quite accurate. Thus, for the
SNI, estimated and actual growth of energy generated compare as follows:
Rates of increase in %

* Estimated from 8 month's results.



- 15 -
Generation
3.09      By 1978, ICE was covering the bulk of generation requirements
through its 415 MW of installed capacity (248 MW hydro, 77 MW diesel, 10 MW
steam and 80 MW of gas turbines) which represent 83% of total capacity
installed in the country. Early in 1980, the first stage of the Arenal
hydro plant (157 MW), partly IDB financed, will start operating and will
allow the utilization of thermal plants (in 1977 about 10% of total genera-
tion) to be reduced even further. IDB is also helping finance the next
large expansion of ICE's generating capacity, the 174 MW Corobici hydro
plant downstream from Arenal, which is planned for commissioning in 1982.
Annexes 3.3 and 3.4 show the energy and capacity balance for the SNI.
Transmission
3.10      ICE's transmission facilities are the backbone of the Costa Rican
interconnected system. They include 1,040 km of transmission lines broken
down as follows:
Voltage:        220 kV       138 kV       34.5 kV and less
Length:         330 km      385 km        325 km
The transmission system's transformation capacity amounted to about 1,720 MVA.
ICE's first development phase, consisting mostly of local interconnections, was
carried out mainly at 34.5 kV from its establishment in 1949 to 1957. In the
second phase, when interconnections became interregional, 138 kV was the
transmission voltage chosen. Only in 1980, when Arenal will start operating,
will the 220 kV era actually start, because the 330 km of 220 kV line
mentioned in the table are presently operated at 138 kV.
3.11      In the course of the past ten years, ICE was successful in progres-
sively standardizing, to a large extent, transmission design and equipment,
without foregoing the advantages of procurement through international
competitive bidding. ICE, assisted by consultants, has worked out design
criteria, which ensure a reasonable balance between safety, reliability, and
cost (paras. 6.01-6.03).
Distribution
3.12      Costa Rica's electricity distribution systems still show quite a
wide range of characteristics, reflecting the fact that, for a long time,
they developed quite independently. The main systems are:

It was only in the recent past that ICE started standardizing its own
distribution systems and exerted the influence necessary to move the sector
as a whole towards a reasonable measure of coordinated distribution planning
and equipment standardization. It was particularly successful with the
three companies which will also be beneficiaries of the proposed Bank loan,
i.e., CNFL, ESPH and JASEMA.
1/   National standards will be established for 13.2 and 34.5 kV in urban
areas and 34.5 kV in rural areas.

IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      In order to fulfill its obligation of meeting the increasing capa-
city and energy demand (paras. 3.02 to 3.07), ICE plans to implement a power
investment program for 1979-1982. This program appears well balanced and its
major element, Corobici, was the subject of an appraisal by IDB. The program
includes the following works:
a)   the completion of the first stage (157 MW) of the Arenal
hydroelectric development (IDB-financed) and of associated
transmission and distribution facilities (Loan 1126-CR);
b)   the 174 MW Corobici hydroplant (IDB-financed) downstream
from Arenal;
c)   the transmission and distribution items of the Proposed Sixth
Power Project, largely associated with Corobici;
d)   other transmission (including the interconnection with
Nicaragua) subtransmission and distribution facilities
to be financed by CABEI and ICE; and
e)   isolated generating plants and distribution items included
in the national rural electrification program (para. 1.24)
to be financed by IDB and ICE.
4.02      During the period 1979-1982, ICE will also have to define the
generation facilities to be constructed after completion of Corobici. At
the present stage, the most promising hydroelectric projects appear to be
Angostura (175 MW) and Palomo (40 MW), both on the Reventazon River and
Ventanas-Garita (80 MW) or possibly the Guayabo (250 MW)/Siquirres (600 MW)
complex on the Reventazon and Pacuare Rivers. However, the choice of the
plant sequence and the timing of the individual development may also be
affected by (i) the results of the ongoing geothermal investigation in
Guanacaste (para. 1.02), (ii) the Government's success in attracting industries
requiring a substantial electric energy input (para. 1.18), and (iii) the
decisions Government and its prospective industrial partners make on the
aluminum smelter project near Puerto Limon and the associated Boruca hydro
plant (paras. 1.21 - 1.23). ICE plans to carry out, with the assistance of
consultants, a program of studies of hydroelectric projects, in addition to
Boruca. Upon the completion of this program, ICE would have available bid-
level designs for the three or four most promising projects for its further
expansion. ICE agreed to inform the Bank at least once a year about the
progress and the results of the studies and to submit to the Bank not later
than June 30, 1981, a least cost program through 1990 for generation and major
transmission facilities, which would be based on the above studies. The
Government agreed to ensure that power sector expansion is carried out in a
coordinated manner in order to prevent waste, duplication and within the limits
of the financial and managerial capacity of the entities in the power sector.

Program Costs
4.03      The cost of requirements for ICE's 1979-1982 investment program is
estimated as follows:
Local  Foreign  Total       Local  Foreign  Total
---(millions of ¢)---       --(millions of US$)--
Generation                    785      628   1,413       91.3      73.0   164.3
Transmission and
Distribution                 296     302      598       34.4     35.1    69.5

General Property              225       -      225       26.2         -    26.2
Overheads charged to
Construction                  83       -       83        9.6         -     9.6
Total                  1,636   1,302   2,938        190.2    151.4   341.6
Annex 4.1 gives a year-by-year breakdown of these costs.  It also shows an
estimate for the 1983 investment.
4.04      The above costs, which are based on late 1978 price levels,
are reasonable. ICE estimated the cost for all the items for the first
three years individually, using unit prices obtained from bids for similar
equipment and works in the recent past. In addition to the adjustments
required to take into account inflation between the date of the respective
biddings and late 1978, ICE included the effect of changes in the parities
of the currencies in which the offers were made. Design and administration
costs included in project costs are based on ICE's experience. For the
year 1982, ICE estimated individually the items already identified, whilst
the remaining investment had to be forecast globally. The costs include
physical contingencies of the order of 10% and price contingencies calculated
on the basis of likely future inflation, assumed to be 8% per year for the
foreign exchange component and 10% per year for the local part of the cost,
which appear reasonable. The above costs do not include taxes or duties
(para. 2.01).
4.05      Whereas the program includes the engineering studies for the
Boruca development, it excludes its construction, which might start as early
as 1982, because the development was expected to be treated as an enclave



- 19 -
project, separate from ICE's normal expansion. If a substantial proportion
of Boruca's output is used for supply to the public (para. 1.22), the project
would have to be added to the program.
4.06      As noted in para. 4.02, the investment program after 1981 is
subject to considerable uncertainty, and actual requirements might rise
above the amounts shown in Annex 4.1. The provisions of the proposed agree-
ments regarding consultation on hydroelectric project studies, preparation
of a least cost investment program and coordination by the Government, should
ensure that investment decisions are based on sound analysis.
The Project
4.07      The proposed project consists of investments to be undertaken by ICE
(included in the program discussed above) as well as high-priority subtransmis-
sion and distribution additions by three distributing entities. It includes
the following works:
a.   ICE
(i) transmission lines (2 km of 220 kV, 125 km of 138 kV, 68 km
to be converted from 69 to 138 kV) and substations (100 MVA
for 220/138 kV, 20 MVA for 220/34.5 kV, and 95 MVA for 138/
34.5 kV) for the strengthening of the SNI in view of the
commissioning in 1982 of the Corobici hydroelectric plant
and in particular for the re-inforcement of the 138 kV ring
feeding the San Jose metropolitan area.
(ii) subtransmission and distribution facilities comprising 171 km
of new 34.5 kV lines, 343 km of lines to be converted to 34.5
kV and a transformation capacity of 30.9 MVA for 34.5/0.22 kV;
(iii) expansion of the dispatching center, whose first stage the
Bank is helping finance through Loan 1126-CR;
(iv) studies and associated consulting services for:
A.  bringing the Boruca project to the level of design required
to provide a reliable base for the negotiations between the
Government and Martin-Marietta on the aluminum smelter
project, and define the place of this development in the
sequence of generating facilities needed to meet future
demand for public electricity supply;
B.  assessing the feasibility of developing small hydroelectric
or aeolian power stations to serve isolated systems where
it would not be economical to extend the SNI (para. 1.28);
and
C.  assisting ICE in the further planning of its tranmission
system, the standardization of the sector's transmission
and distribution facilities, the optimization of the
insulation levels, the coordination of protections, and
the installation of a transformer maintenance workshop;



- 20 -
(v) training (instructors and equipment) in structural engineering
hydrology, maintenance and installation of transmission and
distribution systems; and
(vi) equipment for protection, measurement, maintenance and
installation of transmission facilities.
b.   CNFL
Subtransmission and distribution facilities comprising 48 km of
new 34.5 kV lines, 293 km of lines to be converted to 34.5 kV and
a transformation capacity of 94.6 MVA for 34.5/0.22 kV.
c.   ESPH
Subtransmission and distribution facilities comprising 8 km of
new 34.5 kV lines, 50 km of lines to be converted to 34.5 kV
and a transformation capacity of 4.5 MVA for 34.5/0.22 kV; and
d.   JASEMA
All but the high tension part of the 30 MVA 138/34.5 kV Alajuela
substation (to be connected with ICE's La Garita and La Caja
substations).
The facilities to be financed essentially are required to transmit and distri-
bute the additional energy to be generated at the Corobici plant. They repre-
sent ICE's 1979-1982 investment in transmission and distribution except for:
(i)  The remaining items of the Bank's Fifth Power Project;
(ii) The last phase of the CABEI-financed transmission project
associated with the Arenal plant;
(iii) Rural electrification, largely financed by IDB; and
(iv) The interconnection with Nicaragua (also CABEI-financed).
The items of the proposed project which will be installed in the systems of
CNFL, ESPH and JASEMA are either the low voltage parts of substations of which
the high voltage side is ICE's responsibility or subtransmission and distribu-
tion installations of the same specifications as those used by ICE and which
therefore can be procured more economically together with the corresponding
items for ICE. Annex 4.3 gives a more detailed list of the project transmis-
sion and distribution items.
Project Cost Estimate
4.08      The estimated financial requirements for the project are summarized
below; the breakdown showing the expected annual expenditures appears in Annex
4.2 and the basis for the estimates (which exclude taxes and duties) in para.
4.04.

4.09      ICE would finance the local cost of the project and US$1.4 million
of financial charges on the proposed loan.  IDB has agreed to finance up to
US$1.3 million of the foreign cost of the Boruca studies. The balance of the
project's foreign financial requirements would be covered by the proposed
US$34.0 million Bank loan. US$7.4 million equivalent would be onlent, subject
to the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, to other distributing entities
(CNFL, JASEMA and ESPH) for their portions of the project.
Engineering
4.10      ICE's own staff will carry out the engineering associated with the
execution of the physical part of the project. This is acceptable, as the
latter does not include major civil works and ICE has substantial experience
with the installation of transmission and distribution facilities of the
type the project includes.

Project Execution
4.11      The physical part of the project will be carried out by ICE's own
construction and erection crews, assisted, where required, by the equipment
suppliers' specialists. Distribution items for the other distributing
entities will be installed by personnel of these utilities with assistance
from ICE, which will supervise the entire project execution. Annex 4.3
includes the proposed project implementation schedule, which would be used
to monitor progress during project execution. The completion date for the
project is December 31, 1982.
Consultants Services, Training
4.12      The consultants for the Boruca studies (a consortium consisting of
Acres, SNC and Tecsult of Canada) were selected in consultation with the Bank
and IDB. The estimated cost of the studies is based on the contract (signed
in early 1979), which is satisfactory. The studies of alternative energy
sources for supplying isolated locations would be carried out largely by ICE.
The proposed loan would finance 10 staff-months of consulting services (at
an estimated base cost of US$5,000 per staff-month, excluding travel and
subsistence) to assist ICE in:
(i) the detailed evaluation of the various alternative resources in
Costa Rica,
(ii)  the preparation of a training program for ICE personnel in the
evaluation and technology of the utilization of these alternative
sources, and
(iii) pre-feasibility and feasibility studies of pilot plants.
4.13      The project also includes provision of 40 staff-months of consultant
services (at an estimated base cost of US$6,000 per staff-month, excluding
travel and subsistence). These would cover assistance in:
Ci) improvement of ICE's computer programs for determining least cost
solutions for generating facilities and associated transmission;
(ii)  standardization of equipment;
(iii) coordination of insulation levels;
(iv)  coordination of protection; and
(v) transformer maintenance.
4.14      For the training courses ICE plans to hire on a short term basis
specialized instructors from Mexico, Venezuela, Spain, the US and possibly
other countries; these specialists would either come from universities or
industry. The total foreign exchange cost for these instructors is estimated
at about US$75,000.



- 23 -
Procurement
4.15      Except for the items set forth in para. 4.17, ICE would let all
contracts for Bank-financed works, plant and equipment on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement.
4.16      Up to US$2.8 million equivalent of goods to be financed from
the Bank loan, principally conductors for the transmission lines and con-
struction materials, might be procured from manufacturers in the Central
American Common Market, including Costa Rica. As in past operations, such
manufacturers would receive a preference of 15% of the CIF landed price
or 50% of the import duties payable by non-exempt importers, whichever is the
lower, in line with the Central American Agreement on Fiscal Incentives.
4.17      The extension of the dispatching center will require negotiated
purchase of about US$500,000 of equipment (1.5% of the loan amount) from the
suppliers of the equipment for the first stage of the center (financed by Loan
1126-CR), selected after ICB. For uniformity of equipment and procedures it
would be highly desirable that a further US$600,000 of hard-and software be
bought from the same suppliers. It is therefore proposed to accept negotiated
procurement for up to US$1.1 million of load dispatch equipment and software,
provided the prices offered compare reasonably with those obtained under ICB.
Disbursement
4.18      Disbursements from the loan account would be made as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and
materials and their installation; 100% of ex-factory cost
for locally manufactured goods;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for consultants and training
services; and
(c) interest and other charges accrued on the loan up to
August 31, 1982.
Disbursements would be made against standard documentation.

4.19      Under the assumption that the loan would become effective January 1,
1980, loan disbursements are estimated as follows:

June         30          1.2               34.0
4.20      The proposed closing date of the loan is June 30, 1983, six months
after the estimated completion of the project, to allow for the payment of
retentions.
Environment
4.21      ICE and the distributing companies which benefit from the Bank
project intend to route their lines, which will be overhead, and locate
their substations so as to minimize their visual impact, in a manner
consistent with economic and financial considerations.
Project Risks
4.22      The_construction schedule assumed for the project is reasonable
and takes into account normal engineering, administrative, construction and
erection procedures but it does not include provisions for delays caused by
unusual circumstances. The only item involving a higher risk of delay than
the main items of the project is the second stage of the dispatching center,
because the first stage is more than a year late (para. 1.17). The Bank, in
its supervision work, should therefore pay special attention to the timely
implementation of the dispatching center.

V. FINANCE
Introduction
5.01      In 1973-74 ICE's power section was in severe financial difficulty,
mainly as a result of the cost overruns and delays incurred in connection
with the construction program of the previous years. Since ICE was earning a
rate of return in excess of the minimum of 9% on historically valued assets
agreed under previous Bank loans, it chose to rely largely on short-and
medium-term commercial bank loans to finance its increased requirements. The
trend was reversed starting in 1974, when substantial tariff increases were
introduced. However, ICE was also required to react to the 1974-75 world
petroleum price increases by undertaking an accelerated investment program in
hydroelectric plant (fortunately financed with long-term loanp on appropriate
terms and conditions from international development institutions). During
this period Costa Rica suffered sharply higher inflation, affecting virtually
all ICE's costs, but ICE's power section was able to maintain a satisfactory
financial performance. The resources thus generated have to a large extent
been used to cover debt service and ICE has continued to rely on borrowings
to cover a substantial proportion of its investment program. This problem is
expected to persist in 1979 as a result of the problem encountered at Arenal
(para 1.15), but the proportion of ICE's investment program financed inter-
nally is expected to increase to satisfactory levels thereafter. The financial
performance of ICE's telecommunications section has improved steadily from its
1974 and 1975 unsatisfactory levels. The financial performance of both of
ICE's operating sections is expected to be satisfactory during the project
period, assuming that the required tariff increases are effected.
Power Section Financial Results
5.02      In February 1974, following more than five years without one, a
tariff increase (averaging 41%) was granted, followed by another (averaging
18%) in September and by mini-increases (averaging 1% each) in each of the
last three months of 1974. In 1975, tariffs were raised just once, in January.
In 1976, mini-increases were effected every month. 1/ The above increases
were needed to cover administrative costs and depreciation and to achieve an
improvement in financial performance. Although there were no tariff adjust-
ments in 1977 or 1978, actual results were better than forecast under Loan
1126-CR. Besides the tariff increases proper, the fuel surcharge, through
which ICE recovers its fuel costs, was adjusted upwards each January and
July, in line with fuel cost increases. The tariff actions led to a

of some of the blocks (sold at a given unit price) was also modified.

substantial increase in resources generated internally. However, the increase
in construction expenditures was also large, in particular because ICE (adapt-
ing to the increased price of petroleum) advanced construction of the Arenal
hydroelectric project. 1/ As a result, the 1975-77 contribution to investment
from internally generated resources (net of debt service), while improving
from the negative values of the 1973-74 period, in which financing by third
parties exceeded investment, was a relatively low 18%. The balance of the
necessary financing was obtained through borrowing.
5.03      The improvement in the financial situation of ICE's power section
from 1973-74 to 1975-77 can be measured by the following indicators, which
compare actual performance with the forecasts made in connection with loans
800-CR and 1126-CR (Fourth and Fifth Power Projects).
1/   Before 1973, it had been expected that thermal plants, which are less
capital intensive, would account for a large share of ICE's future
generation expansion.

The improvement in cash generation resulting from the tariff actions in
1974-76 contributed to the improvement in the debt service coverage and in the
contribution to investment. ICE also benefited from more favorable conditions
on financial markets, leading to the lowering of the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR), which determines the cost of many of ICE's borrowings, and the
obtaining of financing with longer terms and grace-periods. Moreover, ICE was
able to obtain lower "spreads" over LIBOR. A final contributor to ICE's
improved financial situation was the provision of substantial financing on
terms more appropriate to the long-term nature of its investments by the
Bank, IDB and the Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV).

the revaluations corresponding to the years 1976 and 1977 were only

into account those revaluations.

Financial Structure
5.04      At December 31, 1978 the financial structure of ICE's power
section was as follows:
Millions
of Colones            %
Equity
Contributed Capital                     179                 4
Retained earnings                       894                21
Plant revaluation reserve               590                13
1,663                38
Liabilities
Long-term debt (excl. short-
term portion)                       2,296                 53
Current and other liabilities           375                 9
2,671                62
Total                            4,334                100
5.05      ICE attributes its contributed capital and debt to either its power
or telecommunications section, depending upon the nature of the plant purchased
with the proceeds of each contribution or loan. Since 1976, debt expressed in
foreign currencies has been reflected on ICE's balance sheets at the end-of-
period exchange rates, and ICE agreed to continue to value, and cause CNFL to
value, in colones, at the end of each year, debts payable in other currencies,
on the basis of the rates of exchange at the time such valuation is made, and
register, and cause CNFL to register, the result of such valuation on its
books. At December 31, 1978, ICE's power section's largest creditor was the
Bank (with ¢ 711.5 million, 29%) followed by the IDB (with ¢ 562.6 million,
23%), Eurodollar lenders (with ¢ 539.3 million, 22%), numerous Costa Rican
bondholders (with ¢ 317.7 million, 13%) and the FIV (with ¢ 137.1 million,
6%). The Eurodollar loans bear interst at floating rates related to LIBOR,
making ICE vulnerable to increases in short-term lending rates.
5.06      ICE, unlike other Latin American state-owned utilities, which
usually rely upon contributions to equity by government to supplement their
internal cash generation, has systematically tapped the local long-term bond
market with considerable success. Until 1974, ICE's 10- and 20-year bonds
paid 8% p.a. to local private investors, but market conditions forced the
interest rate up to 12% p.a. in 1974. At December 31, 1978 the total of bonds
outstanding was ¢ 377 million (including 0 59 million for the telecommunica-
tions section). ICE has developed an effective approach to marketing these



- 29 -
bonds and has been willing to enter into repurchase agreements to satisfy the
liquidity preferences of certain investors and compete with other borrowers
which issue instruments redeemable on demand. This aspect of ICE's bonds,
gave rise to concern in the past, as it was felt that ICE might experience
liquidity problems if a large proportion of outstanding repurchase agreements
were to be exercised. Under previous Bank loans, it was therefore agreed that
ICE would limit the portion of bonds subject to repurchase agreements to 30%
of the aggregate amount of ICE/CNFL bonds outstanding. ICE has complied with
this provision, which would be repeated under the proposed loan.
CNFL Performance
5.07      As detailed in Annex 5.10, CNFL's financial performance has been
satisfactory. Under the terms of its concession agreement, CNFL's tariffs are
determined based on cash needs for construction, after meeting debt service
and dividend requirements. The revenue requirement covenant in previous
Bank loans relies on these provisions, which have been complied with. The
resulting rates of return on CNFL's average revalued net fixed assets in
operation have averaged 9.3% in the period 1976-78.
Power Section Financing Plan
5.08      During the four year project period 1979-1982, ICE's power
section's financial objectives should continue to be:
(a) to contribute to the cost of the program internally-generated
resources (after servicing its debt) in a reasonable proportion,
relative to the part financed by third parties;
(b) to maintain the ratio of debt to equity at approximately the
present level;
(c) to improve, if possible, the debt profile by lengthening the
average outstanding term of debt; and
(d) to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations when due.
5.09      The following summary financial plan, details of which are shown in
the funds statement forecast (Annex 5.3) assumes that tariffs will ensure an
annual rate of return of 9% on average net revalued plant-in-service.

5.10      The summary financial plan shows that:
(i)  Internally generated resources and customer contributions will
contribute about 27% of the cost of the construction program plus
additions to working capital, which contribution, although low, is
considered acceptable:
(ii) 73% of funds required will be obtained by borrowings, described
below.
Generation Projects
5.11      IDB is expected to complete disbursement of its loan for the Arenal
hydroelectric project in 1979. ICE would use part of a US$70 million Eurodollar
loan it has obtained from a syndicate led by Libra Bank to finance the cost
overrun on the project. Disbursement of the US$60 million IDB loan (for a
term of 25 years with interest at 7-1/2% p.a.) to help finance the construction
of the Corobici power plant should commence in the same year. US$1.3 million
of the proceeds of the latter loan will be used to prepare designs for the
future Boruca hydroelectric project (paras. 1.21-1.23). By the end of 1979,
IDB is expected to replace the Bank as the power section's biggest creditor,
as a result of the greater volume of funds and the better terms IDB has been
able to provide in recent years. The Costa Rican government has loaned ICE
US$16 million from funds made available by the Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela
(FIV). The Government has declared its intention to make available to ICE an
additional US$4 million in each of the years 1979 and 1980, making a total of
US$24 million from FIV.
Interconnection with Nicaragua
5.12      The transmission line interconnecting Costa Rica with Nicaragua
(para. 3.06) will be partially financed by CABEI Loan 140. Costa Rica has
completed the formalities necessary to make the loan effective and ICE expects
to initiate procurement shortly. If for any reason the interconnection
should not be completed by 1983, the resulting reduction in ICE's 1983
revenue would be approximately 2%.
Bank Projects
5.13      The undisbursed balance (approximately US$10 million) of Loan
1126-CR will be disbursed in 1979 and 1980. The terms assumed for the
proposed Bank sixth power loan are a maturity of fifteen years, including
three years of grace, and the current Bank interest rate of 7.9% p.a.
¢64 million (US$7.4 million) would be relent to CNFL, ESPH and JASEMA,
on the same terms, under relending agreements satisfactory to the Bank.
Such agreements should be received prior to any disbursements for the
relevant portions of the project. The loan would include partial financing
of interest and other charges during construction, which is justified in light
of ICE's tight financial situation during the project's construction period.



- 32 -
Rural Electrification
5.14      IDB expressed its intent to ICE in early 1979 to finance the second
stage of its Rural Electrification Program (to be carried out from 1981 to
1983) using US$27 million provided on concessionary terms through its Fund for
Special Operations.
Other Borrowings
5.15      To meet the balance of the 1979-82 financial requirements, addi-
tional financing of 0718 million (US$83 million) will be necessary. The most
likely sources are local sales of ICE bonds and loans from commercial banks
Bond issues of 0100 million per year are included in the financing plan but,
since 060 million of bonds will be amortized during that four-year period,
the average annual net bond issue will be 085 million (US$10 million). ICE
issued 060 million of bonds in each of 1976 and 1977 and ¢100,million in
1978 so that it appears reasonable to assume that there would be a market for
ICE bonds of the order of magnitude contained in the forecast. During 1978,
ICE drew-down all but US$2 million of a US$22.5 million 8-year loan (3 years
grace) from a group of commercial banks, bearing interest at 1-1/2 percentage
points over LIBOR. The balance will be drawn-down in 1979, along with US$50
million of the proceeds of the Libra Bank loan, described in para. 5.11.
5.16      0215 million (US$25 million) of the commercial bank or other finan-
cing required by the end of 1982 (Annex 5.8) is as yet unidentified as to
source. This would probably be obtained from commercial banks and interna-
tional lending institutions for ICE's future needs. ICE should experience no
major difficulty in arranging the commercial bank loans it requires in 1981
(US$10 million) on acceptable terms and conditions in view of its forecast
financial performance.
Future Financial Performance
5.17      The problems encountered at Arenal (para 1.15) will cause an inter-
ruption in the improving trend of sector finances during 1979. While ICE
should be able to achieve its covenanted 9% return on revalued net fixed
assets in operation, its debt service coverage ratio is expected to drop to
1.0 and the contribution of consumers to the financing of investments would
be only 10%. CNFL is expected to be even more seriously affected by the
rationing imposed in response to the delay in the commissioning of Arenal,
to the extent that it is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of its conces-
sion agreement and the existing and proposed agreements with the Bank. During
negotiations, ICE informed the Bank that it intended to apply to SNE in the
near future for a tariff increase sufficient to allow it to comply with the
covenanted rate of return in 1980-81. CNFL would also apply for a tariff
increase sufficient to allow it to meet the requirements of its concession in
1980-81. However, ICE does not wish to introduce any tariff increases prior
to the planned reduction of the fuel surcharge in January 1980 (para 1.26).
The average base tariff increase expected to be required by ICE at that time
is approximately 52% (leading to a net increase in charges to consumers of
approximately 15%). It was agreed that these tariff applications should have



- 33 -
been made prior to signature of the proposed loan. The loan would not be
declared effective until CNFL's tariff increase is approved. The financing
plan is based on the assumption that ICE's tariffs will continue to be adjusted
as necessary to maintain a 9% rate of return on annually revalued assets.
Government and ICE agreed that ICE's tariffs will be set on this basis, and
that CNFL's tariffs will continue to be set on the basis of its concession
agreement. In order to provide the basis for measuring the return, ICE agreed
to revalue, and cause CNFL to revalue its assets, annually, and to register,
and cause CNFL to register, the result of such revaluation on its books.
Based on the assumptions of satisfactory revaluations and tariff actions, the
operating results and financial positions of ICE's power section and CNFL are
expected to be satisfactory, as detailed in Annexes 5.1 to 5.5 and 5.10,
respectively. CNFL's rate of return is expected to average 8.9% over 1979-82,
which will permit a contribution from internally generated funds and customer
contributions to the cost of CNFL's construction program and required increases
in working capital of 43%. Debt service coverage would range from 1.3 in 1981
to 1.6 in 1982 for ICE. For CNFL the respective figures would be 1.4 and 1.7.
Future Financial Position of ICE Power Section and CNFL
5.18      The result of all the above, as shown by the balance sheet forecast,
will be a change in the debt/equity ratio from 59/41 in 1977 to 50/50 at the
end of 1982. In order to help achieve objectives (b) and (c) of para. 5.08,
ICE agreed to repeat the debt service tests included in existing loan agree-
ments, whereby ICE and CNFL will not incur long-term debt without the Bank's
approval, unless the most recent 12-month internal cash generation of ICE's
power section and CNFL, are at least 1.5 times their respective maximum debt
service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year. Although the debt service
requirements during the forecast period are manageable, both ICE and CNFL will
likely require Bank approval to incur any additional long-term debt.
5.19      ICE's current ratio, which stood at 1.1:1.0 at the end of 1978, is
forecast to improve throughout the forecast period, reaching a satisfactory
level of 1.3:1.0 by the end of 1982.
ICE Telecommunications Section Finances
5.20      As shown in Annex 5.11, the financial performance of ICE's tele-
communications section has been strong, with rates of return of 16.2% and
17.6% in 1976 and 1977, respectively. This strong performance has enabled
it to provide most of the local-cost financing for its expansion program,
relying on the Bank and suppliers for foreign financing.
5.21      The five-year (1978-1982) telecommunications construction pro-
gram's financing plan foresees 58% of funds required (including those
required for increases in working capital) being generated internally (after
debt servicing), a substantial improvement over the 28% of the actual cost
of the 1974-1977 program generated internally.

VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solution, Transmission Facilities
6.01      For planning the development of the SNI during the late 1970s
and the 1980s, ICE has adopted the following reliability requirements, which
are reasonable:
(a)  in stable operation, the outage of one element of the
138/220 kV transmission system or of one generator, or of
two lines not operating in parallel, should not lead to a
power outage (except in entirely radial subsystems), a
reduction of the frequency that would trigger frequency
control relays, or a voltage variation of more than 5% of
the nominal voltage.
(b)  in transient operation; single-phase line failures of up to
0.2 seconds with successful reclosing within 0.5 seconds
should not perturb system synchronism.
6.02      Before starting implementation of the Arenal hydro plant and again
before work began on Corobici, ICE, assisted by consultants, analyzed alter-
natives for developing the SNI. As a basis for the design of the transmission
system, it used the above reliability requirements together with standard
safety criteria. It also took into account basic concepts of standardization
of equipment and procedures. The system presently under construction resulted
as the least present cost solution. Therefore, its general layout and charac-
teristics define the main features of the additions, in particular the trans-
mission items included in the proposed Bank project.
6.03      ICE organized the transmission facilities in groups of functionally
related items. For each group it identified alternative solutions within
the framework of the general concept of the SNI and adopted the least cost
solution for discount rates between 8% and 12%, i.e. a range which includes
the opportunity cost of capital (estimated at 11%). Annex 6.1 shows the
composition of the groups, the alternatives compared, their present worth, and
the solution selected. ICE demonstrated, in particular, that the present cost
of converting the southern part of the transmission ring around the San Jose
metropolitan area to 220 kV would be higher than the implementation of the
original plan (a 138 kV ring) and, therefore, included the 138 kV ring in the
project.
Least Cost Solution, Distribution
6.04    The bulk of the distribution items of the project are for CNFL.
Recently, Montreal Engineering Company (Canada) reviewed CNFL's development
plan for the distribution system. Two alternatives were considered:
(i) extension of primary distribution at 13.2 kV, i.e. the
present voltage; and



- 35 -
(ii) substitution of 34.5 kV as the primary voltage by dis-
continuing extensions at 13.2 kV and gradual conversion
of the existing 13.2 kV system to 34.5 kV.
The second clearly leads to the least present cost solution. Therefore,
CNFL is planning to develop its system in accordance with alternative
(ii) and the distribution items for CNFL included in the proposed Bank
project conform to this alternative.
6.05      The project items for ICE's own distribution are for various grids
related only over the transmission facilities of the SNI. For each grid the
alternatives with primary distribution at 34.5 kV and 13.2 kV were analyzed
and the least cost alternative adopted. ICE considered only these two alter-
native voltages, even in the cases where the present primary distribution is
at 4.16 kV, because these latter networks are all obsolete and in a bad state.
Since they will have to be rebuilt in any event, it is reasonable to do so at
34.5 kV or 13.2 kV, whichever is more economical.
6.06      An analysis similar to that carried out for CNFL showed that for
ESPH (Heredia) a partial conversion to primary distribution at 34.5 kV
is the least-cost solution. The proposed Bank project includes equipment
for the implementation of this solution. Annex 6.1, Paras. 5 - 7 give
details on the identification of the least-cost solution for the distribu-
tion items of the project.

6.07      The return on investment is calculated for the sector investment
program which includes the Corobici project and the related transmission
and distribution items and therefore the Bank project. The return was deter-
mined as the discount rate equalizing the present values of the streams of
costs and benefits; the forecast incremental revenues from electricity sales
attributable to the program slice at the tariffs expected to prevail in 1983
(expressed in 1978 prices) were used as a proxy for the latter. Under these
assumptions the equalizing discount rate is 11%, which is equal to the
estimated opportunity cost of capital in Costa Rica. This return probably
understates the real economic rate of return of the program, as revenues from
sales of electricity may not fully measure some of the benefits to society
such as the social benefits of residential and public uses, or the indirect
benefits to industry and commerce whose production and employment depend on a
reliable electricity supply. ICE, based on an analysis of consumer behavior,
made in conjunction with an independent firm, in two towns which are represen-
tative of the areas of the country outside the San Jose metropolitan area,
estimated the tariff consumers would be willing to pay to be at least twice
the present rate.
6.09      Sensitivity analyses were carried out to show the impact on the
rate of return of the likely range of the principal adverse circumstances which
may affect it. These relate to the rate of growth of consumption, the
revenue per kWh, and the cost of the program.



- 36 -
-    A decrease of the growth rate of total consumption by 0.5
percentage points leads to a reduction of the return by about
0.6 percentage points;
-    A decrease of 10% in revenues leads to a reduction of the
return by about 1.2 percentage points;
-    An evenly distributed increase of 20% in the cost of the
investment program in real terms leads to a reduction
of the return by about 1.6 percentage points.
The analysis shows that the return would be affected to a greater extent by
the likely change in the capital cost than by other factors; therefore particu-
lar attention should be given to maintaining costs within the estimates.
6.10      From the above, it may be concluded that the prices paid by consumers
are barely sufficient, on average, to cover marginal cost. This conclusion is
consistant with the findings of the Chas. T. Main tariff study (para. 1.25).
The additional studies which ICE proposes to carry out should enable it to
propose solutions to this problem during the execution of the proposed project.
VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with Government, SNE and/or
ICE, as applicable, on the following principal points:
(a)  revenue requirements of ICE's power section and CNFL and expedi-
tious SNE consideration of ICE and CNFL tariff applications
(paras. 1.08 and 5.17);
(b)  on communication of proposals on the changes to be made to the
ICE/CNFL tariff structure, by June 30, 1981 (para. 1.25);
(c)  continued separate operation of and accounting for ICE's power
and telecommunications sections (para. 2.05);
(d)  that ICE will present to the Bank by December 31, 1980 a least
cost expansion program through 1990 for generation and major
transmission facilities; and that Government will ensure that
power sector expansion will be carried out in a coordinated manner
and within the limits of the sector's capacity (para. 4.02);
(e)  restriction of ICE/CNFL bonds outstanding under repurchase agree-
ments and limitation of new debt (paras. 5.06 and 5.18);
(f)  that ICE will enter into satisfactory relending agreements with
CNFL, ESPH and JASEMA before any disbursements for the parts of
the project for which they are responsible (para. 5.13); and



- 37 -
(g) revaluation of ICE's power and telecommunications foreign debt and
assets annually, recording of such revaluation in its books of
account, and causing CNFL to do the same (paras. 5.04 and 5.17).
7.02      Prior to signing of the Agreements for the proposed loan, ICE and
CNFL would have applied to SNE for tariff increases (para. 5.17).
7.03      With the above assurances, the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$34 million. The loan would be repaid over a
period of 15 years, including 3 years of grace.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
Notes to the Financial Statements and Projections
Income Statement (Annex 5.2)
The average price per MWh - retail, shown on the income statement does
not include the fuel surcharge (which averaged ¢67.50/MWh in 1976, ¢62.50/MWh in
1977 and 085/MWh in 1978). The fuel surcharge continued at 085/MWh during the
first half of 1979 but is expected to be reduced to zero when Arenal enters service.
However, if there is a substantial balance in the fuel surcharge fund at December
31, 1979, ICE proposes to finance it by medium-term bank loans and recover it
(together with interest) through a continuation of the fuel surcharge even after
the consumption of fuel has virtually ceased, following the start-up of Arenal. This
matter is still under discussion between the Bank and ICE.
As service is extended to new communities, the number of customers served
increases and so does the volume of sales (both retail and bulk). These increases
make it necessary to increase the number of permanent employees but the growth
in employees is lower than that of sales. The payroll component of operating
expenses has been projected based on the forecasts for the size of the work force
(Annex 5.6) and assuming annual payroll adjustments approximately equal to the
forecast annual rate of increase in the cost-of-living (8%).
Fuel costs are excluded from the forecast income statement as they are
fully recovered (outside the tariff per se) through the fuel surcharge.
Insurance premiums are forecast to increase in approximately the same
proportion as insurable property increases.
Regulatory expense is the charge, based on installed generating capacity,
assessed to cover the operating expenses of SNE. It increases in the years when
new generating plants are forecast to enter service.
Depreciation was forecast taking into account the scheduled dates for
entry into service of new fixed assets as well as the average service life of the
different classes of assets. The gradual decrease in depreciation expressed as
a percentage of average gross utility plant in service indicates that a pro-
portionally higher percentage of the plant forecast to enter service is of a
class with relatively longer service lives than was represented in the mix
throughout 1978.
The interest paid or accrued was calculated:
- for existing loans at existing rates of interest;
- for the proposed Bank Loan at the rate of 7.9% p.a. with the
commitment fee at 3/4% p.a. on the undisbursed balance, in accordance
with the disbursement schedule (para. 4.19)
- for the bond issues, syndicated Eurodollar loans and commercial bank
or other financing of future projects and studies at the rate of 12%
p.a., assuming interest accrued from the dates when issued or drawn

down, respectively. Bonds are assumed to be repaid through
periodic drawings over 20 years with no grace and commercial
bank or other financing over 8-10 years with 3 years of
grace; and
- for the second rural electrification loan from IDB's Fund For
Special Operations for 35 years including 8 years grace with
interest at 2% p.a. during the disbursement period and at % po.a.
thereafter and with a commitment fee of 1/2% p.a. on the undisbursed
balance.
In March 1979 ICE signed a loan agreement with a syndicate of banks
to borrow US$70,000,000 to be repaid through 10 semi-annual installments of
US$4,000,000 each, commencing in 1984 and a US$30,000,000 payment in 1989, with
interest at 1, 1-1/8 and 1-1/4 percentage points over LIBOR for the first three,
the fourth to seventh and the eighth to tenth years, respectively.
Interest is charged to construction prior to entry into service of the
plant on the basis of the actual interest and other charges corresponding to each
loan.
Non-operating income consists of dividends and interest from CNFL,
interest on the part of the proposed Bank loan on-lent to distributing companies
and income on short-term investments.
Sources and Applications of Funds (Annex 5.3)
"Other sources of funds" includes non-operating income and the repayment
(commencing in 1980 and 1983, respectively) by the distributing companies of the
part of the proceeds of the fifth and sixth Bank power loans on-lent by ICE, the
repayment of other loans to distributing companies and customers' guarantee deposits.
"Increase in other valuation reserves" includes, inter alia, the depreciation
provision (see table on last page of this Annex 5.5) on those fixed assets whose
corresponding depreciation is not charged to depreciation expense as shown on
the income statement.
"Debt service" (detailed on Annex 5.9) excludes the repayment in 1979
of the ¢4O million loan made in 1978 by the telecommunications section to the
power section, treated as a current liability on the 1978 year-end balance
sheet.
Balance Sheet (Annex 5.4)
The changes in the major asset and liability accounts are shown on
the last page of this Annex 5.5. The part of the proposed Bank loan on-lent to
the distribution companies is included in "Investmentst". "Other assets" includes
restricted funds from the employees' savings plan, deferred charges and certain
deposits.  "Accounts receivable" are forecast to represent 20% of annual revenue
at the end of each year from 1980-1983. "Materials in stock and in transit"
are forecast to be 35% of construction expenditures forecast for the following
year. The increase in "Contributed capital" results from customer contributions,
as the capital contributed by Government is assumed to remain constant. "Other
liabilities" includes the deposits by employees to the savings plan and accumulated
severance payments. "Accounts payable and other current liabilities'? include
accrued interest payable (estimated to be 31% of annual interest payments),
other accounts payable (estimated at 14% of annual construction expenditures)
and employees' accrued vacation pay (estimated to increase 20% in nominal terms
each year). Cash balances at year-end are assumed to be approximately 8% of
annual revenue.

Sixth Power Project
CNFL Financial Statements and Forecasts
1.        This annex includes the following financial statements and forecasts
for CNFL for 1979-83:
a.   Financial Indicators      - page 4
b.   Income Statements         - page 5
c.   Forcast Funds Statements - page 6
Earnings Record and Financial Position
2.        CNFL received a tariff adjustment effective in the last quarter of
1974 to pass on the increased cost of electricity purchased from ICE but not
high enough to offset the impact of inflation of CNFL's other expenses. To
remedy this unsatisfactory situation, another tariff increase was granted in
January 1975, followed by mini-increases in February, March, April and June
of 1975, and in every month of 1976. The latest increase was in January 1977.
Revenue was sufficient to produce a return of over 10% in both 1976 and 1977
on its rate base (the average net revalued plant-in-service, plus an allowance
for working capital).
CNFL Rate Determination
3.        The financial arrangements for the acquisition of CNFL by ICE pro-
vided that CNFL's revenues be sufficient to:
-    cover operating costs and debt service;
-    make payments to ICE enabling ICE to service the debt incurred
to acquire CNFL; and
-    make the required investment in CNFL's distribution system.
CNFL has obtained suppliers' credits and loans from CABEI and ICE (the latter
being part of the proceeds of Bank Loan 1126-CR) for the foreign cost of its
investment program, financing the local portion through local bond issues and
internal funds generation. As a condition of signing the proposed loan agree-
ment, application should have been made to SNE for tariff increases to be
effective January 1, 1980 as necessary to obtain the revenue required in 1980
and 1981 as summarized above. Moreover, the Bank has informed the Government
that it will not make the loan effective until the tariff increase for CNFL is
approved, in view of the forecast insufficiency of 1979 revenues (para. 5 of
this annex).

ANNEX 5.10
Page 2 of 6
Revaluation and Financial Forecasts
4.        CNFL's rate base is revalued annually.  Unlike ICE, CNFL submits its
proposed revaluation to SNE for approval. The so-called 1977 and 1978 revalua-
tions which are really the revaluations of plant-in-service at the year-ends
1976 and 1977, respectively) were approved and included in CNFL's 1978 balance
sheet. It is assumed in the financial projections included in this annex that
CNFL's rates will be set to enable it to pay, together with customer contribu-
tions and deposits, for 43% of its investment program, including additions to
working capital. Based on the above, CNFL's average tariffs for the period
1979-83 would be some 7% higher than ICE's average retail tariffs (which is
consistent with the relationship in 1976-78).
5.        With the tariff increases included in the financial projections,
CNFL's financial performance during the forecast period should, with the
exception of 1979, be satisfactory. Its annual rate of return should be not
lower than 8% in any year except 1979. Coverage by internal cash generation
of its total service payments (including dividends required to allow ICE to
service acquisition debt) is an unsatisfactory 0.78 in 1979 but improves to
a range of 1.37 to 1.68 in subsequent years. The unsatisfactory performance
in 1979 is the result of severe rationing from February 19 to April 27, 1979
because of the problems with the Arenal tunnel (para. 1.15). Revenue fell
short of normal expectations by V82 million, offset by a ¢65 million reduc-
tion in the cost of purchased power. Nevertheless the net impact eliminated
expected 1979 net income. This is a non-recurring situation. The shortfall
will be financed by a US$7 million commercial bank loan, out of the proceeds
of which US$3 million will be used to prepay a US$3 million loan and US$4
million will be required for the construction program. The new loan, for
10 years including 3 years grace, will bear interest at 7/8 of a percentage
point over LIBOR in the first 3 years and I percentage point over LIBOR there-
after.
Construction Program and Financing Plan
6.        CNFL's construction program is basically a continuing series of
investments in relatively small distribution jobs. Investments would peak in
1980 as a result of the conversion of distribution networks to 34.5 kV. With
this exception, they are expected to increase moderately in real terms.
7.        During the period 1979-82, CNFL would pay for 43% of its construc-
tion program and working capital additions with net internal generation of
funds plus contributions. This contribution-to-expansion ratio is at about
the mid-point of the range normally expected for distribution companies. The
combined ICE/CNFL contribution ratio is 28%, which is within the acceptable
range for full-spectrum electric utilities. The financing plan is summarized
below and detailed on page 6 of this annex.

Telecommunications Section Financial Statements
and Forecasts
1.        This annex  includes the following financial statements and forecasts
for ICE's telecommunications section for 1976-1982:
a.  financial ratios - page 3
b.  income statements - page 4
c.  forecast funds statements - page 5
Earnings record and financial position
2.        The telecommunications section's rate of return on net revalued assets
improved from unsatisfactory levels of 7.7% and 9.6% in 1974 and 1975, respectively,
to highly satisfactory rates of 16.2% and 17.7% in 1976 and 1977, respectively.
The unsatisfactory earnings in 1974 and 1975 made it necessary to fill the gap in
internal funds generation with additional borrowings.
Tariff increases
3.        A 30% tariff increase in January 1975 (followed by a 40% reduction in
the duration of the basic impulse in August 1975) and an additional average 50%
increase in March 1976 were necessary to compensate for inflation, offset the
unsatisfactory returns in 1974 and 1975 and ensure a return of at least the 12%
annual rate on a fully revalued rate base stipulated in Loan Agreement 1006-CR.
As the return on investment on the attached financial forecasts is shown to dip
slightly below the required 12% in the latest 2 years, a moderate telecommunica-
tions tariff increase may be required in 1981 and/or 1982.
Accounts receivable
4.        Although accounts receivable from ICE's private telecommunications
customers are collected reasonably promptly (on average, within 3 weeks), accounts
receivable from the Government are seriously in arrears. However, as the Government
made a payment on account in February 1979 and made a commitment to pay the over-
due balance not later than the beginning of 1980, Loan 1532-CR became effective
on March 8, 1979.
Construction program and financing plan
5.        ICE's five-year (1978-1982) telecommunications program, the financing
plan for which is shown below, consists of:
a.  completion of ongoing projects (US$34.0 million);
b.  the project (US$94.2 million) to be partly financed by Bank
Loan 1532-CR (US$10.6 million);
c.  advance expenditures (US$27.9 million) for further expansion
from 1982 onwards; and
d.  interest during construction (US$6.8 million).

6.       As summarized in Para. 5 above and detailed on page 5 of this annex, net
funds generated internally would cover 58% of ICE's five-year telecommunications
investments, a substantial improvement over the 28% of the actual cost of the
1974-1977 program generated internally.
7.       As demonstrated in the attached forecast of key financial ratios, the
debt service coverage ratio of ICE's telecommunications section shows steady
improvement throughout the forecast period.
8.       In 1978, the telecommunications section loaned the power section of ICE
approximately 040 million, to be repaid in 1979 without interest.

Sixth Power Project
Justification of the Main transmission and distribution facilities
1.   Connection of the Alajuela and Heredia Systems
1.01      The works concerned are the 138 kV connection of the systems of
Jasema (Alajuela) and ESPH (Heredia) to the La Caja and the Colima substations,
respectively, including the extension of these substations.
1.02      Three possible solutions were considered, the present worth of the
corresponding investment and operating expenses as well as the cost of losses
is:
Present values in millions of f
at discount rate of
Solution                          8%                   12%
(a)  double circuit 138 kV line          55.6                 50.3
(b)  single circuit 138 kV line          68.6                 62.8
(c)  double circuit 34.5 kV line         74.7                 50.0
This table shows that for the range 8 to 12%, in which the opportunity cost
of capital can be assumed to lie,solution (a) is generally more economical
than solution (b) and (c). Only near 12% are (a) and (c) about equivalent.
Considerations of flexibility marginally favor (a); therefore ICE chose this
solution.
2.   Connection of the Liberia System
2.01      This subproject consists of the substitution of a direct connection
of the Liberia system to the 220 kV Canas-Penas Blancas line (interconnection
with Nicaragua) and a substation near Liberia for the existing 34.5 kV con-
nection with the present system at Canas.
2.02      The solutions considered and the present worth of the investment,
operating expenses and losses were the following:
Present value in millions of ¢ at discount rates of
Voltage                    8%                        12%
(a)       34.5 kV                29.5                       28.2
(b)      138   kV                28.3                       28.3
(c)      230   kV                18.9                       15.0
The table shows that solution (c) is clearly the most economical. ICE there-
fore adopted it.

3.   Connection of the San Isidro del General System
3.01      Presently this system is fed from Rio Macho over a 68 km, 69 kV
line operated at 34.5 kV. In connection with the planned extension of the
line to Rio Claro, the design of the supply to San Isidro del General had to
be revised.
3.02      Two possible solutions were studied and the present worth of the
investment, operating expenses and losses determined as follows:
Present value in millions of ¢ at discount rates of
Solution                      8%                        12%
(a)        69 kV                     16.5                      15.7
(b)       138 kV                     14.2                      13.9
Solution (b), which calls for the conversion of the existing line to 138 kV
and for the corresponding extensions of the Rio Macho and San Isidro del
General substations, is clearly more economical than solution (a). ICE,
therefore plans to carry out (b).
4.   Development of the southern region
4.01      This concerns the development of the presently isolated systems of
Palmar Norte, Ciudad Cortes, Ciudad Neily, Rio Claro, Golfito, and Sabalito.
The two alternatives examined were:
(a) to interconnect these small systems and to connect the resulting
larger system with the SNI over an extension of the 138 kV Rio
Macho-San Isidro del General transmission line (see 3. above); or
(b) to expand the isolated systems on the basis of diesel generating
plants.
4.02      The two alternatives compare as follows:
Present value in millions of ¢ at discount rates of
Alternatives                    8%                         12%
(a)                      72.1                        64.3
(b)                     173.3                       112.2
Alternative (a), i.e. the interconnection with the SNI, is not only the more
economical but also the more reliable. ICE has analyzed a further alternative
which would consist of supplying the area from Panama. However, the costs which
the Panamanian utility IRHE would have to charge over the foreseeable future
(US$0.07/kWh) would still leave the connection to the SNI the least cost solution.
The line would also play a key role during the construction of Boruca.
5.   CNFL's Distribution System
5.01      In 1973, Electroconsult (Italy) carried out a study showing that the
most economical and reliable solution for the supply of the San Jose metropolitan
area was the 138 kV ring presently in the final phase of installation. The study



- 79 -
ANNEX 6.1
Page 3 of 4
also called for a primary distribution system at 34.5 kV to be fed from the ring.
In 1977, Montreal Engineering Company (Canada) updated and revised CNFL's
development plan for the next 20 years.  It analyzed the technical and economical
characteristics of the two obvious alternatives, which consist of:
(a) expanding the present 13.2 kV primary distribution system, or
(b) stopping growth of the existing 13.2 kV system, constructing the
extensions of the system at 34.5 kV and gradually converting the
13.2 kV facilities to 34.5 kV.
5.02      The two alternatives are technically about equivalent.  Economically
they compare as follows:
Alternatives          Present value in millions of ' at a discount rate of 8%
(i)                             (ii)
(a)                          196                              236
(b)                         178                               213
Columns (i) and (ii) correspond to a valuation of the losses of ¢0.20 per kWh
and ¢0.36 per kWh respectively. Since all annual costs (investment, operation
expenses and losses) are lower for alternative (b) than for alternative (a), the
present value of (b) will be lower than that of (a) for all discount rates.
Therefore, CNFL chose alternative (b).
6.   ICE's Distribution System
6.01      The alternatives for the extension of ICE's various distribution
systems compare as follows:

The analysis of the above systems shows that from the economic point of view
a primary distribution voltage at 34.5 kV is in all cases at least as
advantageous as one at 13.2 kV. Therefore ICE adopted 34.5 kV as the new
primary voltage for these systems.
7.        ESPH (Heredia) Distribution System
7.01      This distribution system was analyzed in the same way as ICE's
(see 6.). The conclusion is also that a 34.5 kV primary distribution voltage
is more economical than 13.2 kV. The present values at a 12% discount rate
compare as follows:
13.2 kV                 0 ¢7.3 million
34.5 kV                 0 ¢6.7 million

Notes on the Calculation of Return on Investment (numbering refers
to lines on page 1).
1. The investment program results from the cost estimate summarized in Annex 4.1
by deducting the cost of items associated largely with Arenal and the inter-
connection with Nicaragua and adding distribution investments by CNFL and
other companies. Interest during construction, the price contingencies and
taxes (which are negligible) are not included.
2. Excluding sales to Nicaragua.
4. The percentages of the annual sales increments attributable to the program
take into account that the various components of the program start operating
at different times, the first transmission and distribution items in 1980,
therefore, producing a limited amount of revenues already in 1981.
5. The maximum energy sold attributable to the program is based on the production
of the Corobici plant in an average hydrological year. (Annual production is
about 820 GWh to which sales of about 720 GWh correspond, after deduction of
losses).
6. Average retail price in 1983, expressed in 1978 colones, is estimated at
9 43/kWh.
7. Operating costs as shown in forecast income statement, excluding depreciation
and purchased power.
9. Incremental ICE and CNFL costs assignable to the program are calculated using
the percentages applied for the estimate of the incremental sales attributable
to the program in 1981-82 and are assumed to remain constant after 1983, the
first full year of operation of Corobici.  Incremental operating costs for
other utilities are estimated on the basis of CNFL's operating cost and the
proportion of sales growth attributable to those utilities.
