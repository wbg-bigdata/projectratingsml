INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE EGYPTIAN RAILWAYS ORGANIZATION WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT FOR
A SECOND RAILWAYS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Egyptian Railways Organization with the guarantee of the Arab
Republic of Egypt for the equivalent of US$37.0 million to assist in finan-
cing the costs of a Second Railways project and a national transport survey.
The loan would have a term of 25 years including four years grace, with in-
terest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An Economic report, "The Egyptian Economy in 1974:    Its Position
and Prospects", dated September 25, 1974 has been distributed to the Executive
Directors. A country data sheet is attached as Annex 1.
Background
3.        The background to, and recent developments in, Egypt's economy have
been elaborated in the economic report. The following paragraphs contain a
summary of the prospects for the future and the position with respect to ex-
ternal assistance and creditworthiness.
Prospects for 1974/75
4.        Prospects for peace have improved, offering the possibility that
resources can be gradually transferred from military to civilian uses and
that Egypt could be entering a new economic era. The "October Paper",
presented by President Sadat to the people and the Parliament, and approved
in a national referendum, provides a new statement of general principles to
guide Egyptian development; it envisages consolidation of state-owned enter-
prises, liberalization of the private sector, incentives to private foreign
investment and expanded economic cooperation with Arab countries. Egypt has
recently initiated a number of significant steps in furtherance of these
principles which would lead to a significant restructuring of the economy.
Meanwhile, new external relationships have evolved between Egypt, its oil-
producing Arab and other neighbors, Western countries, and Japan, resulting
in increased official and private capital inflows. These developments are
mutually interdependent and self-reinforcing. Thus, the increased availabil-
ity of capital will permit greater liberalization of the economy, which, in
turn, should improve the investment climate.



- 2 -
5.        Recently, the Government launched an Interim Development Program for
the period July 1974 - December 1975, the purpose of which is to initiate a
meaningful development strategy consistent with available resources and, to
commence restructuring the economy for peace and development. This Program
will be followed by a development plan for 1976-80, work on which was begun
in November, 1974. A sum of LE 520 million ($1,331 million equivalent) was
budgeted for public sector investment expenditures in 1974. This is about
20 percent above the 1973 budget level of LE 430 million (actual public
expenditure was LE 380 million). Due to price increases, the budget was in-
creased to BmE 700 million in 1974 through supplementary allocation in the
course of the year. In 1975 the Government foresees a further 40 percent
increase (LE 300 million) over the actual 1974 allocation, based on greater
availabilities of foreign project aid, including expenditures on the Suez-
Mediterranean pipeline and Suez Canal. It excludes, however, investments in
joint ventures which are estimated to reach about BE 50 million annually begin-
ning in 1975. The share of private investment, which, in recent years, has
averaged about 10 percent of total investments, is expected to increase to
over 20 percent by 1980.
6.        In large part, Egypt's investment programs for 1974 and 1975 are
limited to completing or continuing carry-over projects. They emphasize
fertilizers, cement, tourism (private sector) and petroleum and pipeline
development -- all high priority projects aimed at increasing production or
saving or generating foreign exchange earnings. In agriculture the priority
given to development of existing land rather than land reclamation, and to
poultry rather than to livestock also seems appropriate to the country's
needs. Programs to renovate or improve the infrastructure (e.g. railways,
telecommunications) are clearly urgent because it had been run-down during
years of under-investment. Thus, Egypt's investment programs for the years
1974 and 1975 appear to be in accordance with economic priorities.
7.        The resumption of full-capacity growth and the beginning of recon-
struction is expected to increase import requirements substantially in the
short-run, resulting in sizeable deficits in external trade and services (over
$1 billion each in 1974 and 1975). Although part of these deficits can be ex-
pected to be financed through grants from other Arab countries, large amounts
of additional assistance will be required on concessionary terms.
External Assistance
8.        Egypt obtained substantial amounts of external aid until the mid-
1960's. Thereafter, new commitments of Western assistance practically ceased.
The gross inflow of medium- and long-term capital fell by nearly 50 percent
imnediately after the 1967 war. Although aid levels gradually rose again,
net inflows averaged only $9 million annually in medium- and long-term capital
over the five-year period FY 1968-1972; amortization payments exceeded dis-
bursements by $5 million in 1973. As indicated in the economic report, the
total capital inflow required to cover the current account deficits for 1974
and 1975 is projected at $1,450 million. Assuming net disbursements of $990
million on loans committed as of mid-1974, private capital inflows of $120
million, IMF financing of $48 million and a reduction of $600 million in the



- 3 -
use of short-term foreign financing the financing gap for the two-year period
is projected at $900 million. Also given the high absorptive capacity of the
economy, and the low level of investments over the past decade, the need for
external aid commitments in the succeeding years is expected to remain at a
high level.
9.        Substantial Arab aid was received in 1973 and is continuing.    A
$300 million grant from Saudi Arabia was reported in August 1974, while Abu
Dhabi and Qatar pledged $33 million and $10 million respectively. Large
aid offers have also been made by Kuwait. Commitments of non-Arab foreign
aid have also been considerable. Five countries have either firmly committed
new loans to be used over periods varying from two to five years (Iran $850
million, United States $250 million, Germany $225 million, Denmark $9 million)
or have announced their intention to do so (Japan $100 million). In addition,
the Government has concluded two Euro-dollar loans totalling $180 million and
is currently negotiating a third ($100 million). Also, in August 1974 the
IMF extended a credit (first tranche) of $48 million. A large share of new
loans is for unidentified projects and will be disbursed only gradually over
the next few years. Most recently Saudi Arabia extended further project
assistance amounting to $161 million to finance the foreign exchange require-
ments of projects selected by the Bank Group for financing.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
10.       Egypt's medium- and long-term debt outstanding and disbursed at end
1973 stood at about $2.14 billion. In addition, the country owed close to
$500 million in short-term financial credits, and about $580 million in bila-
teral clearing balances. The USSR was Egypt's principal creditor, followed
in importance by the United States, Kuwait, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Germany.
IBRD/IDA debt comprised less than 1 percent of the total. Of the reported
outstanding medium- and long-term debt at end 1973, about 37 percent was due
to be repaid within two years, 46 percent within three years, and 53 percent
within four years. Service payments on these debts were estimated to reach
$530 million in 1974, equivalent to about 30 percent of the country's gross
foreign exchange earnings.
11.       The expected large current deficits in 1974 and 1975 together with
heavy debt service payments, call for very substantial amounts of foreign
capital in the short-run. As the existing pipeline of projects suitable for
foreign financing is still not very full, much of this assistance will have
to be made available in the form of program aid. The commitments already
made by foreign donors will meet a portion of these short-term requirements,
and enable increased utilization of capacity in the economy.
12.       In the medium- and longer-run, the outlook for Egypt's balance of
payments is much more promising. Foreign exchange earnings are expected to
grow from a level of some $1.7 billion in 1974 to about $4.7 billion in 1980,
because of the reopening of the Suez Canal, operation of the Sumed pipeline,
rapidly rising exports of petroleum and petroleum products, a doubling of



- 4 -
manufactured exports, increased workers' remittances, and the development of
tourism. Imports of goods and services, can be expected to grow very rapidly
over the next 3 to 4 years, but after that they will rise at a slower pace.
As a result, the deficit on external trade and services is projected to narrow
progressively in the latter part of the decade, significantly reducing the
required net inflow of foreign capital. Following the rapid increase in
export earnings, and the slower growth and consolidation of external debt,
the debt service ratio could fall to some 15 percent by 1980.
13.       To attain these objectives it is necessary that Egypt not only
mobilize substantial amounts of capital, preferably on concessionary terms
from abroad, but also pursue appropriate debt management, fiscal and aid-
utilization policies. In addition, domestic savings will have to be increased
through restraint in public and private consumption. The Government's deter-
mination to continue the liberalization of the economy should facilitate this
process. In particular, steps will have to be taken to: rationalize the
price system (including the relation to world market prices), stimulate the
latent potential of Egypt's private sector, encourage foreign investment, and
improve the management of overall Government economic operations, including
the reduction of bureaucratic bottlenecks and decentralization of decisions
to the enterprise level. The Government has already taken a number of meas-
ures in this direction during the last year. Discussions are being conducted
with the IMF towards achieving specific targets with respect to debt manage-
ment. Furthermore, active discussions are under way between the Bank Group
and Egypt on economic policies. In the course of these discussions, the Gov-
ernment has indicated that it expects to initiate effective additional meas-
ures on many of the matters referred to above, and to seek assistance, where
necessary, from the Bank Group in formulating such measures. Such assistance
has already been initiated in the field of debt management, and an agricultural
sector review mission visited Egypt in January 1975. The next economic mis-
sion, scheduled for the Spring of 1975 will review the measures taken by the
Government.
14.       Assuming that (i) these policy initiatives are implemented, and (ii)
the substantial aid offers committed or received can be absorbed rapidly,
Egypt should, while facing a short-term liquidity problem, experience little
difficulty in meeting its external payments obligations in the medium and long-
term. While carrying a heavy short-term debt burden (1974/76), Egypt can be
considered creditworthy for some Bank lending in view of its promising medium-
and long-term prospects.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN EGYPT
15.       The proposed loan would be the Bank Group's fifteenth lending ope-
ration in Egypt. It would bring Bank and IDA commitments to $385.6 million.
Annex II contains a Summary of Bank Loans and IDA Credits as of January 31,
1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



-5-
16.       In view of Egypt's substantially increased need for external
assistance to help finance an expanded development program, its size and
absorptive capacity, and the several economic policy measures taken and con-
templated by the Government to restore creditworthiness, it is proposed to
increase significantly the scope of Bank Group lending from this fiscal year
onwards, with available IDA funds being supplemented by Bank loans. Should
the proposed project be approved, it will bring Bank/IDA commitments to
Egypt for this fiscal year to $197.0 million. Bank Group lending is directed
at assisting the Government's efforts to increase utilization of existing
productive capacity; at projects for rehabilitation of infrastructure --
which is necessary to facilitate growth in the economic sectors; and at
projects that will increase foreign exchange earnings or substitute for
imports. The choice of projects within a given sector is influenced by
the scope for providing assistance in establishing priorities within the
sector, and for effecting long-term institutional and policy reforms in the
sector concerned.
17.       In the context of the expanding economic activity and the proposed
1976-80 development plan, the Government has requested Bank Group advice on
policy matters. It is therefore expected that technical assistance, both
project and non-project, will also increase significantly, and will constitute
an essential ingredient of Bank Group participation in Egypt's economic
development. It might also be noted that the Government attaches particular
importance to the catalytic role of the Bank Group financing and is actively
exploring the interest of other donors in complementary financing of projects.
In fact, all the projects financed by the Bank Group in this fiscal year in
Egypt have involved co-financing with other donors.
18.       Bank Group disbursements would represent a small portion, less than
10 percent, of Egypt's overall capital inflow requirements (see para. 8).
The Bank Group's share of the total external debt outstanding and disbursed
was less than 1 percent at end 1973. For the future, the Bank/IDA share of
total external debt outstanding and disbursed is estimated to reach about 10
percent in 1978; the Bank's share in 1978 would be about 7 percent of exter-
nal debt outstanding and disbursed. It is estimated that in 1978, debt serv-
ice payments due to the Bank Group, including that on Bank loans, will re-
present about 1 percent of service payments due on all of Egypt's external
debt.
19.       So far, in FY75, the Executive Directors have approved a Credit and
a loan for the Agricultural and Industrial Imports Project, a loan for the
Suez Canal Rehabilitation Project and a loan for the Tourah Cement Expansion
Project. Besides the proposed project, a telecommunications improvement proj-
ect and a second DFC project with the Bank of Alexandria have also been ap-
praised. One of these projects is expected to be ready for consideration by
the end of FY75 and the other in early FY76. Other projects under prepara-
tion for FY76, include textile rehabilitation, production and export market-
ing of fruits and vegetables, and the Port of Alexandria improvement.

PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND THE EGYPTIAN RAILWAYS
Background
20.       Economic activity in Egypt is concentrated along the Y-shaped Nile
Valley and Nile Delta. In the past, the area adjoining the Suez Canal was
also active. The population of about 36 million is concentrated in the nar-
row land mass formed by the Nile Delta and Valley which accounts for less than
4 percent of the total area of just over 1 million km2. As a result, the
transport demand is dominant in the Alexandria-Cairo-Aswan corridor extending
over about 1,000 km. The linear configuration of economic activity and the
flat topography have supported the development of the railways as the dominant
inland transport mode, supported by inland waterways. Short distance hauls
are carried by road. Other modes such as air and coastal slhipping have
potential, but could not be fully developed in the past because of hostilities.
21.       The domestic transport system presently comprises:    3,559 km of
railways, 26,400 km of roads, 3,310 km of inland waterways, and four major
airports; since 1967, Alexandria has been the only port handling all import
and export traffic. An oil pipeline (connecting Suez with the Mlediterranean)
is due for completion in 1976. The Suez Canal, while not a part of the do-
mestic transport system, attracts considerable economic activity when open;
located at the eastern edge of the Nile Delta, it was well connected to the
rail and road systems. Some of the rail and road links which existed on both
sides of the Canal prior to 1967 have been damaged and are no longer usable.
22.       The level of total demand for inland transport has remained fairly
static since 1967, reflecting the uncertainty in the economy and diversion of
resources to defense which would otherwise have contributed to growth. The
modal distribution of inland freight traffic in ton/km, has also remained
fairly constant at about 50 percent for railways, 25 percent for roads, 20
percent for inland waterways, and 5 percent for pipelines. However, given
the plans to intensify development activities in the country as a whole and
to develop new poles of economic activity, the Government forecasts a recovery
of the demand by 1980 to the level anticipated for that year prior to the
hostilities in 1967.
Transport Coordination and Planning
23.       For the very same reasons, the Government is also anxious to develop
a master plan for the sector covering all transport modes including ports and
coastal shipping, and the related policy measures. Due to uncertainties
regarding the level of funds available for investments, little or no economic
planning of investments or operations was carried out in the past. Although
cost minimization and the desire for a balance between costs and revenues on
revenue-earning modes have been an implied objective for the transport sys-
tem, no specific policy has been formulated to achieve this objective. So



- 7 -
far, coordination of transport investments has been undertaken by the Ministry
of Planning. The examination of policy and investment alternatives has been
largely taken over by the Transport Planning Authority located in the Ministry
of Transport and Communications whose responsibilities cover road, rail and
inland river transport, but not domestic air or coastal shipping transport.
24.       The Government is presently preparing a five-year Development Plan
for the period 1976-80 in which it expects to formulate concrete policies and
a long-term strategy for transport development. It also wishes that a com-
prehensive survey of the transport sector be undertaken as soon as possible
in the context of the overall planning exercise for the economy. Terms of
reference for the survey, prepared in consultation with the Bank, have been
agreed upon by the Government. A short list of consultants has also been
agreed upon and proposals are now being invited. The survey, expected to
begin September 1975 and to be completed by August 31, 1977, will cover all
transport modes serving domestic and international demand. (Section 3.01,
draft Guarantee Agreement). The Government had, in the first instance, re-
quested UNDP financing of about $2 million for the foreign exchange costs of
the survey. However, since the UNDP allocation to Egypt is fully committed,
and we have been informed that additional UNDP financing will not be forth-
coming, the Government requested Bank financing for the survey. As such a
survey would provide the first comprehensive information base on the sector
as a whole and thus contribute to rational planning of sector investments
in the medium- and long-term, the proposed loan includes an amount of $2 mil-
lion for this purpose. The recommendations of the survey will cover policy
actions and investments necessary for a rational development of transportation,
and will be extremely useful for Egypt's 1976-80 Development Plan.
Railway Facilities
25.       In 1966-67 the Egyptian Railways Organization (ER) operated a total
of 3,559 km of standard gauge lines, of which 2,608 km were single track and
951 km double track. Of this, since 1966, 13 km of double track and 382 km
of single track have been destroyed and 182 km of double track and 42 km of
single track damaged, almost all in the area adjoining the Suez Canal. Most
of the remaining track is in unsatisfactory condition and in need of renewal.
26.       Most of the locomotives and railcars are relatively new; but about
one-third of the passenger coaches and freight cars are no longer operational
because of their age. About 65 percent of the freight cars have a capacity of
less than 20 tons, which is a serious drawback for efficient operations and
freight handling. Maintenance, particularly of diesel locomotives, suffers
from lack of spare parts. Passenger coaches and railcars are reasonably main-
tained, but wagon maintenance requires improvement in workshop facilities.



Management, Staff and Training
27.       The Chairman of ER's Board of Directors is appointed by the Minister
of Transport and Communications. The Board controls ER's operations and fi-
nancial policies and decides on all matters referred to it by the Chairman.
However, general policy, borrowings, staff regulations, and rates and fares
are subject to the approval of Egypt's President. Most other management
decisions and regular operational matters are the responsibility of ER's
Chairman, who also acts as the general manager of ER. He is assisted by two
Vice-Chairmen, who act as deputy general managers, one responsible for
engineering and technical matters and the other for operations and traffic.
Overall, the organizational set-up is satisfactory.
28.       ER currently employs about 73,000 persons, 51,000 or 70 percent of
whom are manual workers. This number has remained stable for many years,
with a slight decrease in the last two years. Staff costs form about 67 per-
cent of operating expenses, which is high. Targets for staff productivity
to be achieved by 1977 were confirmed during negotiations. (Section 4.08
and Schedule 6, draft Loan Agreement).
29.       ER's management, recognizing the need for adequately trained person-
nel for the efficient operation and maintenance of equipment, decided to
establish a Central Residential Training Center, with UNDP/ILO assistance.
Phase I of this training project covered the years 1966-1973. However, due
to the curtailment by the Government of requisite funds, the project started
in 196S and buildings and facilities are available only for about 540, instead
of the planned 1,000 trainees. Since it was not possible to achieve the
objectives of Phase I, a provisional decision was made by UNDP not to follow-
up with the Phase II project after Phase I was completed in late 1974. During
appraisal, this matter was raised with UNDP, the Government and ER, and it
was agreed that every effort should be made to go ahead with Phase II of this
training project. The Government and ER have agreed to take all necessary
measures, for this purpose including completion of buildings and related
facilities, and recruitment of full-time instructors for the Center. (Section
4.08 and Schedule 6, draft Loan Agreement; Section 3.08, draft Guarantee
Agreement). Based on firm assurances given by ER's Chairman to UNDP that
these measures would be implemented, UNDP has agreed to extend the contract
of its experts and to continue with the Phase II proposal.
Traffic
30.       Railway freight in Egypt reached a record 3.6 billion metric ton-km
in 1963/64, the years of the peak requirements for the construction of the
Aswan High Dam. The subsequent decline was aggravated by the prolonged per-
iod of emergency and, in 1973, only about 2.5 billion ton-km were carried.
Mineral freight is now expected to rise rapidly from 0.3 billion ton-km in
1973 to 1.4 billion in 1976 and to be constant thereafter. Freight other
than minerals is forecast by ER to return to the 1970/72 level of demand by
the end of 1975 and thereafter to grow at a modest 2 percent per annum to
about 3.2 billion ton-km by 1979.   Total forecast freight traffic for 1979



- 9 -
is thus 4.6 billion ton-km, as against 3.5 billion in 1974. The recent and
expected performance of the economy as a whole supports the expectation of a
full recovery. The growth rate for 1975 and thereafter, is low when compared
with the expected real growth in GDP of about 6 percent per annum. While a
developed waterway system may eventually serve the remaining freight demand
that could be expected to be generated by such growth, it is doubtful that it
could do so in the immediate future. The preliminary results of the first
phase of the comprehensive Transport Survey, which are expected to be available
in mid-1976, will provide a better basis for investment planning in the future.
31.       Passenger traffic is much more important than freight.    It currently
accounts for over three-quarters of total traffic and nearly two-thirds of
all movement revenues. In contrast to the freight traffic, it has shown a
steady growth of 5.6 percent per annum in passengers and 4.3 percent per an-
num in passenger-kilometers (pass-km) since 1966. Data from 1959/60 show
even higher increases to date of 7.8 percent and 6.3 percent per annum, res-
pectively. By 1979, pass-km should have doubled since 1963/64 (the peak year
for freight - see para. 29). The forecast growth from 1973 to 1979 is an
extrapolation of trends in the past decade; it is about twice that expected
for freight and consistent with the expected real growth in GDP. This fore-
cast is reasonable, given the railways' economic and institutional efficiency
for handling such a growth in passenger traffic, when compared with the alter-
native of upgrading inter-city highways and expanding long distance bus traf-
fic.
32.       While ER is among the more profitable railway systems existing to-
day, improvements in its physical facilities and improved efficiency of opera-
tions will both be needed to cope with the future increase in traffic. Bet-
ween 1968/69 and 1972/73, there has been little improvement in the utiliza-
tion of serviceable diesel locomotives and rolling stock. The average net
freight-train load decreased by some 20 percent in these years, and the turn-
around time of wagons increased from seven to ten days; freight car produc-
tivity has been correspondingly reduced from 200,000 metric ton-km to 156,000
metric ton-km. Assurances were obtained from ER that apart from the physical
implementation of its Investment Program, measures will also be taken to
achieve specific targets to improve operations. (Section 4.07 and Schedule 6,
draft Loan Agreement).
ER's Investment Program and the First Railways Project
33.       To rehabilitate the railways system, cope with the increased traf-
fic and improve the efficiency of its operations, ER prepared a Five Year
Investment Program (1971/72-1975/76)1/ estimated to cost BE 137 million ($319
million equivalent) 2/. Phase I of this Program (1971/72-1972/73) constituted

January 1, 1973, it ends on December 31.

- 10 -
the First Railways Project, for which an IDA Credit (Cr. 284-UAR) of $30 mil-
lion was signed in February 1972. Phase I was estimated to cost iE 58 million
($134 million equivalent) including contingencies, with a foreign exchange
component of $66 million. The foreign exchange required over and above what
IDA provided, was covered essentially from existing frame agreements with East
European countries. The First Railways Project focused primarily on track
renewal, provision of essential rolling stock, spare parts to utilize existing
equipment, and installation of telecommunications and signalling equipment.
Since the foreign exchange provided by IDA became available to Egypt only
later in 1972 after the credit was declared effective, ER's Five Year Invest-
ment Program, in effect, commenced in 1972/73 and the period which the Program
and its Phase I covered, has been correspondingly adjusted by one year.
34.       The Closing Date for the First Railways Project was in two parts:
(i) December 31, 1973 for all items other than telecommunications and signal-
ling equipment; (ii) September 30, 1976, for the signalling and telecommunica-
tions equipment. The first Closing Date has been postponed twice, and is now
December 31, 1975, for the following reasons: while the implementation of the
ongoing project has been generally satisfactory, it has however been delayed
due to difficulties in locating sources of supply for some main items such as
rails and fittings, and in the acquisition of land for a proposed new mar-
shalling yard. Due to difficulty in procuring rails, and their higher costs,
there was a shortfall in track renewal of about 10 percent in the first three
years of the Program. The catching-up of the shortfall in track renewal is
now proposed for inclusion in Phase II of the Program, which constitutes the
proposed Second Railways Project. However, greater difficulty was caused by
lack of sufficient external financing, following increases in costs of imported
goods which significantly exceeded contingencies provided under the IDA Credit.
As a result, some revisions had to be made in the items to be procured. For
instance, the centralized traffic control (CTC) equipment planned for the
Sohag-Nag Hammadi section could not be procured, because funds provided for
telecommunications and signalling were more than fully utilized for the pro-
curement of other components of that package, and no monies were therefore
available under the credit for the installation of the CTC. Installation of
this CTC has now been deferred until after 1977, because a detailed study
showed that line capacity could be improved sufficiently until then, by other
technical measures. As of January 31, 1975, about $23 million of the Credit
has already been disbursed, and the Credit almost fully committed.
ER's Revised Investment Program
35.       In view of the above developments and following discussions during
appraisal, ER's Five-Year Investment Program has now been revised and extended
to 6-1/2 years to include the year 1977 (Schedule 5, draft Loan Agreement).
The Revised Investment Program is now estimated to cost LE 177 million ($443
million equivalent) 1/, with a foreign exchange component of $220 million.
1/   At the current rate of LE 1 to $2.50.



This figure includes a revised total cost of $147 million equivalent for the
First Railways Project, instead of the original appraisal estimate of $134
million.
36.       The main changes included in the Revised Investment Program are
the deferral of the installation of electrical signalling and block control
equipment on some sections until after 1977, i.e. after completion of the
Revised Program; improvements to existing marshalling yards in substitution
for a new major yard at Qualyub, addition of locomotives, and expansion of the
track renewal program. These changes are reflected in Phase II of this Pro-
gram, which extends over the period 1975-77 and constitutes the proposed
Second Railways Project (Schedules 2 and 5, draft Loan Agreement).
37.       The Government and ER have agreed that no substantial changes will
be made in ER's Revised Investment Program, except after agreement with the
Bank. A change will be deemed substantial if it involves an addition or
deletion to a group of works as defined in the project description which
would result in a change in the estimated cost for that group by more than
20% or LE 3 million, whichever is less (Section 4.05, draft Loan Agreement;
Section 3.07, draft Guarantee Agreement).
38.       Several detailed operational and financial targets which ER should
aim at achieving during the period of the proposed project, are set out in the
form of an Action Plan which has been discussed and agreed upon with ER.
This Action Plan covers improvements in maintenance, productivity of equipment
and staff, efficiency of operations and financial matters. (Sections 4.04,
4.07 and 4.08, and Schedule 6, draft Loan Agreement; Section 3.08, draft
Guarantee Agreement).
39.       Neither the original nor the Revised Investment Program included any
investments for renewal of railway services in the Suez Canal Zone or on the
eastern bank of the Suez Canal. However, with the advent of peace, the Gov-
ernment is considering not only the repair of some of the damaged sections of
the track in the Canal Zone, but also realignments and new lines on both sides
of the Canal. These plans are still very tentative and the Government has
provisionally estimated their costs to be of the order of LE 225 million. The
Government intends to provide separate funds for these works, as part of the
major reconstruction effort in the Canal Zone. These plans are expected to
be reviewed in the light of the proposed Transport Survey.
ER's Financial Performance Under the Ongoing Project
40.       ER's budgeting and accounting systems are sound and its financial
performance so far, has been adequate. The 1973 debt/equity ratio was low at
9:91, following the conversion of about BE 84 million of long-term debt to
the Government into equity, as required under the ongoing project. Revalua-
tion of fixed assets, initiated under the ongoing project, has progressed to
the stage of making the prerequisite inventory of items and restating his-
torical costs and depreciation. ER's accounts are audited by the Government
Central Organization for Accounting and Auditing. Delays in completing



- 12 -
audits have been reduced and ER has agreed that audit reports will be fur-
nished to the Bank within six months of the end of each financial year (Sec-
tion 5.02, draft Loan Agreement).
41.       However, some aspects of financial control need improvement, par-
ticularly the long-standing question of the mutual settlement of outstanding
dues owed to ER and which ER, in turn, owes to other Government agencies and
departments. As of June 30, 1971, ER was owed some LE 10 million net by such
agencies and departments. Although the Government and ER had agreed under
the ongoing Project to settle thiese outstanding dues in 1972, because of
limited budgetary allocations to all Government departments, settlement was
not effected. Nevertheless, ER implemented the First Railways Project satis-
factorily, using internally generated cash for local currency expenditures,
and also achieved the rate of return specified under the ongoing project. In
the meantime, however, the amounts owed to ER have increased and probably now
exceed IE 75 million, and those owed by ER to other Government agencies to
LE 50 million. The GovermnenLt has confirmed that an allocation of LE 7.6
million has been made in the recently approved 1975 national budget, to sup-
plement ER's resources available for capital expenditures. It has also
agreed to make an additional payment to ER of LE 15 million in 1975 towards
settlement of outstanding debts.   Otut of this amount ER will settle some LE
10 million of dues owed by it, and retain about LE 5 million net in 1975
as the additional internally generated cash required to finance the proposed
project (see para. 46). Similar arrangements will be nade by the Government
in 1976 and 1977, to clear all outstanding liabilities (Section 5.06, draft
Loan Agreement; Section 3.05, draft Guarantee Agreement). It is proposed
that an arrangement by the Government and ER satisfactory to the Bank, for
the payments required in 1975 on account of such outstanding accounts, should
be a condition of making the proposed loan effective. (Section 7.01(b), draft
Loan Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
42.       During discussions with Egyptian authorities on implementation of
the First Railway Project, the Government and ER requested assistance from
the Bank Group in the preparation of the second phase of ER's Five-Year
Investment Program and in helping to finance it. ER prepared the Project,
and a Bank Group mission assisted in completing the preparation work in
January 1974. The proposed loan is based on the findings of a Bank Group
appraisal mission which visited Egypt in June 1974. Negotiations were held
in Washington from January 20 to 24, 1975 4ith a delegation which included
Mr. Aly Zaki, Vice Chairman, ER and Dr. Rafik Sowelem, First Undersecretary,
Agency for Arab and Internationial Economic Cooperation.



- 13 -
43.       The proposed project consists of two parts:   (i) a comprehensive
survey of the transport sector in Egypt, and (ii) the further rehabilitation,
modernization and increase in capacity of the Egyptian railway system envis-
aged in the Revised Program for the years 1971/72-1977, (mentioned in para.
35 above). The railway portion of the proposed project covers all expenditures
planned for Phase II (1975-77) of this Revised Program, with the exception
of the costs for some electrical signalling equipment already included in the
First Railways Project. The works to be financed under the project consist
essentially of continuing improvement of signalling and telecommunications
installations, as well as of track relaying on sections of ER's network,
acquisition of motive power, rolling stock and road vehicles, the moderniza-
tion of marshalling yards, workshops and other fixed installations, the re-
organization of stores and increase of stocks of essential stores, and of
consultancy services and staff training. The items proposed for Bank financing
under this project include track materials, and track laying equipment, work-
shop equipment, signalling and telecommunication equipment and consultancy
services. A detailed description of the project, together with cost esti-
mates, is given in the Loan/Project Summary in Annex III.
Project Costs and Proposed Loan
44.       Based on early 1974 prices and the latest estimates for price con-
tingencies, the total cost of the railway portion of the proposed project
is estimated to be about $296 million, with a foreign exchange cost of about
$148 million (including $6 million for imported components of locally manufac-
tured wagons and coaches). Inclusive of the Transport Survey, the total
cost of the entire project will be about $299 million, with a foreign ex-
change component of $150 million. None of these figures include interest
and other charges during construction, on the borrowings from other external
sources. Out of the proposed Bank loan of $37.0 million, $30.5 million will
be utilized to meet a part of the foreign exchange cost of the railway portion
of the proposed project, $2 million to cover the estimated foreign exchange
cost of the Transport Survey, and $4.5 million to meet interest and other
charges during construction.
Financing Plan
45.       According to the Government the entire foreign exchange requirements
of the proposed project, excluding interest and other charges during construc-
tion, have been covered. Of the foreign exchange cost of $150 million (in-
cluding the Transport Survey), the Government has confirmed that $21.5 million
will be available under frame agreements already signed with East European
countries; $38.0 million to be obtained from Western bilateral sources com-
prising $14 million from agreements already signed with France and the Federal
Republic of Germany and about $20.5 million being currently negotiated with
sources in USA, Canada and UK; at least $54.5 million, (and up to $65 million)
will be contributed by Saudi Arabia; about $3.5 million is to be provided by
the Government for small items unlikely to be suitable for either multilateral



- 14 -
or bilateral financing; with $32.5 million ($37.0 million including interest
and other charges during construction) to be provided by the Bank, the for-
eign exchange financing needed is assured. Completion of satisfactory fi-
nancing arrangements in an amount equivalent to $114 million to meet the
foreign exchange costs of the project will be a condition of making the pro-
posed Bank loan effective (Section 7.01 (a), draft Loan Agreement).
46.       The local cost of about $1 million for the Transport Survey compo-
nent will be financed by the Government. For the railway component, of the
local costs amounting to some $148 million, the Government will provide some
$20 million and ER, the remaining $128 million. ER's contribution assumes
the settlement of debts owed to ER by other Government departments and agen-
cies. As mentioned in para. 41, besides the budget allocation of LE 7.6
million already made in 1975, the Government has agreed to make the necessary
payments in 1975, and the two subsequent years, towards the settlement of
amounts owing to ER of which ER, in turn, will apply in each year a portion
of these monies to pay off its debts to other Government agencies. This
arrangement would leave ER with a sufficient surplus of local currency, be-
sides working capital requirements, to implement the project.
Project Execution
47.       ER will implement the railway portion of the project which is
scheduled to commence in January 1975 and to be completed by the end of 1977.
Consultancy services will be provided under the proposed project for the
development of signalling and telecommunication systems, introduction of
costing, and improvement of maintenance, stores and accounting procedures.
48.       The Borrower, ER, will make available to the Guarantor, a sum of
$2 million from the proposed loan to cover the foreign exchange cost of the
Transport Survey on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan to ER,
(Section 3.05, Draft Loan Agreement; Section 3.03, draft Guarantee Agreement).
The Transport Survey will be implemented by the Transport Planning Authority
in the Ministry of Transport and Communications with the assistance of con-
sultants, who shall be satisfactory to the Bank, on terms and conditions also
satisfactory to the Bank. The Government will take the necessary steps to
ensure that there is effective coordination between this Ministry and the
other Ministries concerned with transportation matters. (Section 3.01 (a),
Draft Guarantee Agreement).
Procurement
49.       Procurement of all goods financed under the loan would be through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines,
with domestic suppliers being given a preferential margin, of the prevailing
import duties or 15 percent, whichever is lower.



- 15 -
Disbursement
50.       The proposed loan will be disbursed against the c.i.f. cost of im-
ported equipment and the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured items, and
the foreign exchange costs of consultancy services.
Financial Projections
51.       ER's financial position continues to be satisfactory, as indicated
earlier in this report. In all important respects except freight revenue,
the previous appraisal forecasts have been exceeded. Also, ER's rate of
return on net fixed assets in operation has been some 5 percent p.a., thus
exceeding the level of 4.5 percent per annum agreed under the first project.
Assuming adoption of proposed tariff increases in July 1975 and January 1977,
both averaging about 7.5 percent, ER's revenues are forecast to rise from
LE 50.7 (US$127 million) in 1973 to bE 73.2 million (US$183 million) by the
time the project is completed in 1977. The net operating revenue would be
LE 14.6 million approximately, yielding a net surplus of nearly LE 11.1 mil-
lion (US$28 million). In order to assure that ER has sufficient funds ER has
agreed to take the necessary measures to achieve a rate of return of 6.0 per-
cent on net fixed assets in operation beginning in 1977, an increase over
the target achieved under the ongoing project (Section 5.04, draft Loan
Agreement; Sections 3.10 and 3.11, draft Guarantee Agreement.) Indeed, the
Government and ER have already initiated steps to increase freight tariffs
on certain selected commodities to be carried by ER.
52.       Specific approval of the President of Egypt is required to amend
the railway tariffs, although ER can quote special rates with the approval
of its Board (see para 26). Freight rates, which are not based on up-to-date
costs, have remained unchanged since 1957, when surcharges of 50 percent to
120 percent were added to the 1930 tariffs. Rates provide for reductions of
50 percent for distances over 250 km and 75 percent over 500 km. Passenger
fares were increased in 1967 by about 20 percent; this caused only a slight
and temporary dip in the upward traffic trend. The introduction of a costing
system is essential, to enable future tariff changes to be more nearly related
to cost. Such a system was to be introduced by March 31, 1973, under the
ongoing Project. Unsettled condition in Egypt, however, initially delayed
the appointment of consultants; their work was thereafter disrupted by the
October 1973 hostilities. Nevertheless, the system has since been designed
and provision is made under the proposed project for consultants to assist in
its implementation. Although reliable cost information is unlikely to become
available until the system is fully implemented by around mid-1977, it is
expected that some tariff changes may be necessary before that date. The
Government and ER have agreed that tariff changes will be made as required,
if necessary, in compliance with the rate covenant. (see para 50; Section
5.04, draft Loan Agreement; Section 3.10, draft Guarantee Agreement).



- 16 -
53.       ER's cash flow estimates for the project period appear satisfactory.
ER has agreed that it will not incur any debt if current cash resources would
not cover the maximum resultant debt service for any succeeding year by at
least 1.5 times (Section 5.05, draft Loan Agreement). The cash flow projec-
tion indicates that in 1978 and 1979, ER should be able to continue financing
the local currency costs of its normal program of investments from its own
resources, once the main rehabilitation program is completed.
54.       The debt/equity ratio at the end of the project period, it would
remain satisfactory at 26:74. Total working capital is at present almost 100
percent of annual cash operating expenses, due partly to obsolete items in
the stores; steps to reduce ER's high level of working capital to a reasonable
target have been discussed and agreed upon (Schedule 6, draft Loan Agreement.)
55.       In view of the unsettled conditions that prevailed in the country
until last year, ER has not yet attempted to identify any potentially un-
profitable lines or services. The new costing system mentioned above, in
conjunction with the Transport Survey, should however provide data to deterr
mine which lines or services should be closed. The Government and ER have
agreed that closures will be made, unless for social or other reasons it is
desirable to retain the line or service, in which case the authority requiring
its retention should pay a contribution sufficient to cover the excess of
variable costs (both short-run and long-run) over revenue (Section 3.09, draft
Guarantee Agreement; Schedule 6, draft Loan Agreement). This will help in
the future, since for costing and tariff purposes, ER has agreed to assess
depreciation on the basis of replacement costs (Section 5.07, and Schedule
6, draft Loan Agreement). Other matters such as obsolete items in the stores
are also being studied by committees set up by ER with Government participa-
tion, and their reports are nearing completion. The proposed loan provides
for consultancy assistance should these forthcoming reports not prove con-
clusive.
Economic Benefits and Justification
56.       Given the pivotal role of ER in Egypt's transport system, the project
is of great importance for the future development of that country's econ-
omy. Since other transport modes could not meet, at reasonable cost, the
traffic demands in the immediate future, it is the Government's policy to
maintain the railways as the primary mode of inland transportation. The pro-
posed project will permit the increased utilization of existing facilities
through replacement of overaged equipment, renewal and rehabilitation of track,
and procurement of spares for existing rolling stock. ER will thus be able
to provide adequate service for traffic demand which is forecast to increase
both in the passenger and freight categories. Without the project, traffic
is projected to decrease by as much as 4 percent annually during the project
implementation period and to remain constant thereafter; this could lead to
a transportation bottleneck seriously hampering Egypt's further economic
development.



- 17 -
57.       Based on a comparison of ER's estimated operating costs and net
operating revenues with and without the project (net of price contingencies
and taxes), the rate of economic return is conservatively estimated at about
12 percent over the average 25-year life of the project items. Due to the
scarcity of detailed information on costs and traffic, the economic returns
on individual items in the project could not be calculated. The introduction
of a cost accounting system to be implemented with the assistance of Con-
sultants provided in the proposed project, as well as the detailed traffic
information to be gained from the comprehensive Transport Survey are designed
to overcome these deficiencies.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       Th6 draft Loan Agreement between ER and the Bank, the draft Guaran-
tee Agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Bank, the Recommenda-
tion provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and
the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately. Completion of satisfactory
arrangements for (i) financing the remaining foreign exchange cost of the
project, and (ii) commencement, in 1975, of the settlement and partial pay-
ment of debts owed to ER by other Government agencies would be additional
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
59.       Features of the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special
interest are described in paragraphs 24, 28, 29, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41,
45, 48, 51, 52, 53, 54 and 55 of this Report.
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
Recommendations
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

4/  Accurate constant price growth rate are not available due to insufficient information concerning trade
deflators. Moreover, the export growth rate for this period is biased by the drop in Suez revenues

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 181-UAR - Nile Delta Drainage Project; US$26 million Credit of April
17, 1970; Closing Date; December 31, 1976.
In 1973 a revised implementation program was prepared, extending
this project until 1978, and the government agreed to take a number of actions
recommended by IDA to improve project performance and provide effective man-
agement. In February 1973, the National Drainage Development Authority (NDDA)
and the Egyptian General Authority for Drainage (EGAD) were merged in the
Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP) established by Presi-
dential Decree. A new Chairman and Vice Chairman for the Nile Delta and Upper
Egypt Drainage Projects were appointed and the staff reorganized and strengthened
by the appointment of additional qualified personnel. A panel of experts was
nominated to undertake project evaluation, and action is being taken to replace
the consultants who advise and assist the Authority on the implementation of
both the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt projects. The new Authority is actively
working on the arrangements for the maintenance of equipment and the storage
of spare parts and has drafted the terms and conditions under which project
equipment will be transferred to local contractors for construction of drain-
age works and for the manufacture of drainage tiles. During last year, super-
vision missions expressed concern that sufficient local currency funds has not
been budgeted to keep project implementation up to the pace agreed in the
revised schedule; this matter was discussed with the Government in May and
again in September 1974, and a small supplementary allocation was made to
permit continued implementation for the rest of 1974. Sufficient local cur-
rency has been allocated in the approved 1975 national budget to enable im-
plementation cf the target areas for drainage, and action on procurement,
which was also delayed last year, has begun.
Cr. No. 284-UAR - Egyptian Railway Project; US$30 million Credit of February
9, 1972; Closing Date: (i) December 31, 1975, for track materials, loco-
motives and spare parts; and (ii) September 30, 1976, for signalling and
telecommunications equipment and installation.
The project is being implemented satisfactorily. Most of the pro-
curement contracts have been awarded, and the bulk of the credit has been
committed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. S-13-UAR - Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Engineering Project;
US$175,000 Credit of November 17, 1972; Closing Date: November 30, 1973.
This Credit was approved on November 7, 1972, and was declared
effective on June 15, 1973. It has been fully disbursed and subsequently
refinanced under Cr. 423 below.
Cr. No. 393-UAR - Upper Egypt Drainage Project; US$36 million Credit of June
8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Progress in implementing the project has been slow. During last
year supervision missions reported insufficient budgeting of local currency
funds for the current fiscal year. The matter was taken up with the Govern-
ment, in May and again in September 1974 and a small supplementary allocation
was made to enable project implementation to continue. The schedule for work
in 1975 is satisfactory and sufficient local currency funds are available.
Implementation of the bilharzia control program however is not expected to
commence until mid-1975, somewhat later than planned.
Cr. No. 412-UAR - Bank of Alexandria Project; US$15 million Credit of June 29,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
This Credit became effective on November 29, 1973. Since then, BOA
has approved several subprojects. As of January 1975, about $13.0 million of
the credit had been committed. The balance is expected to be committed shortly.
Cr. No. 423-UAR - Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Project; US$18.5 million
Credit of July 30, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
This Credit became effective on February 15, 1974. A program for
retraining of displaced workers, prepared by Egypt has been reviewed by IDA
and implementation will commence shortly. Prices of bids received in May 1974
for major equipment packages were much higher than expected, and the total
estimated foreign exchange cost is presently estimated to be about $41.5 mil-
lion. In November, 1974, Saudi Arabia agreed to provide $23 million to fi-
nance the cost overrun thus enabling implementation of the project as apprais-
ed. Awards for most of the major contracts are now being made.
Cr. No. 437-UAR - Population Project; US$5.0 million Credit of November 6,
1973;'Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
This Credit was declared effective on March 25, 1974. The architects
have been appointed, and work is underway on other elements of the project.
Cr. No. S-15-UAR - Talkha Urea Fertilizer Engineering Project; US$400,000
Credit of November 20, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1975.
This Credit was declared effective on April 24, 1974. Meanwhile, a
consulting firm, appointed as the technical advisors, did some of the work
covered by this credit and was paid by Egypt. The credit was refinanced under
Cr. 484 below.

Cr. No. 484-UAR - Talkha II Fertilizer Project; US$20 million Credit of June
24, 1974; Closing Date: April 1, 1979.
This Credit was approved by the Executive Directors on June 18,
1974, and signed on June 24, 1974. Parliamentary ratification was completed
in early December 1974, and the credit was declared effective on January 22,
1975. The general contractor has been appointed and work on implementation
has commenced.
Cr. No. 524-EGT and Ln. No. 1062-EGT - Agricultural and Industrial Imports
Project; US$35 million Credit and US$35 million Loan of December 20, 1974;
Cosing Date: June 21, 1976 (Credit) and December 21, 1976 (Loan).
This Credit and Loan were approved on December 2, 1974 and signed
on December 20, 1974. Steps to declare them effective are underway; mean-
while, action on procurement is progressing.
Ln. No. 1064-EGT - Suez Canal Rehabilitation Project; US$50 million Loan of
December 20, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
This Loan was approved on December 2, 1974 and signed on December
20, 1974. Steps to declare the loan effective are underway. Meanwhile pro-
gress on project implementation is continuing, with funds made available by
other donors.
Ln No. 1085-EGT - Tourah Cement Expansion Project; US$40 million Loan of
February 10, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
This loan was approved on January 28, 1975 and signed on February
10, 1975. Bids were opened according to schedule on February 1, 1975. Con-
sultants have been appointed to assist in bid evaluation, which is now in
progress.
