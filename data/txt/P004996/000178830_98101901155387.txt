APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Egyptian Rail-
ways Organization (ER) have asked the Bank to help finance Phase II of ER's
Investment Program. Financing of Phase I is already being assisted by IDA
Credit 284-UAR for US$30 million (February 1972). The proposed loan together
with parallel financing from bilateral sources would enable the Program to be
completed by the end of 1977 and would finance a national Transport Survey.
ii.       The loan would be the fourth Bank Group operation for transport in
Egypt. 'Fhe First Suez Canal Project (Loan 243-Egypt, December 1959, for
US$56.5 million) was completed satisfactorily and a loan of US$50 million
for a Project for Rehabilitation of the Suez Canal was approved in December
1974. The First Railway Project has made satisfactory progress in view of the
difficult conditions prevailing.
iii.      The rail network is mainly a trunk system and forms the dominant
inland transport mode for the densely populated Nile Delta and country-long
Nile Valley. Rehabilitation of the existing railway system and provision of
additional capacity to meet expected demand is essential pending results of
the national Transport Survey.
iv.       The State-owned ER, which would implement the Project, is adequately
organized and managed but many of its physical assets are run down because of
insufficient allocation of foreign exchange funds over a long period. ER's
extensive training facilities already in existence need to be better utilized
and net increases in staff strictly controlled as employees return from
military service.
v.        Freight traffic, which declined following diversion of resources
from industrial expansion to the military effort, is expected to recover at
least to previous peak levels; passenger traffic is expected to maintain its
steady growth and to continue to provide about 60% of revenue. Costs have
been effectively contained and ER has consistently recorded substantial sur-
pluses and achieved the 4.5% rate of return agreed under Credit 284-UAR.
vi.       The Investment Program originally planned for the five years ending
June 30, 1976 has been revised and extended to December 31, 1977 1/. It in-
cludes relaying of 250 km of track per annum; improved signalling; replacements
1/   Until 1973 ER's financial year ended on June 30 each year.  From January
1, 1973 it ends on December 31 each year.

of and additions to motive power and rolling stock; and improvements in
marshalling, workshops, stores, training and other facilities. As a result
of changes in prices and exchange rates and the extension of the program to
December 31, 1977 its cost has been revised from bE 137 million (US$319 mil-
lion) to bE 177 million (US$443 million).
vii.      Phase I of the Program, forming the first Railway Project, covered
planned expenditures on electrical signalling installations in the five years
from July 1, 1971 to June 30, 1976 and on all other works in the two years
from July 1, 1971 to June 30, 1973. Due to delays in execution and the change
in the financial year that part of Phase I covering other works has been ex-
tended to December 31, 1974. Phase I (including electrical signalling through
1976 as originally planned) is now expected to cost ME 59 million (US$147 mil-
lion) and Credit 284-UAR for US$30 million will have provided 41% of the for-
eign currency requirement of US$72 million.
viii.     Phase II of the Program, forming the proposed Second Railway Project,
will cover all planned expenditure for the three years from January 1, 1975 to
December 31, 1977 with the exception of expenditure on electrical signalling
installations still to be completed as part of Phase I. The Second Project is
estimated to cost 1,E 118.5 million (US$296 million) and the proposed loan of
US$37 million would comprise US$30.5 million (or about 21%) of the foreign
currency requirements of US$148 million for the project, US$2 million for the
Transport Survey and US$4.5 million for interest and other charges on the Bank
loan during the Project period. Goods to be financed by the proposed Bank
Loan would be procured following fully advertized international competitive
bidding (ICB), and employment of consultants would be in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines.
ix.       Of the remaining US$117.5 million foreign currency for the Second
Project about US$38 million is being obtained from existing bilateral aid and
suppliers' credits from western countries and US$21 million from existing
frame agreements with Eastern European countries. About US$3.5 million will
be made available by the Egyptian Government for minor items not suitable for
external finance 1/ and the remainder, about US$55 million has been promised
by Saudi-Arabia as part of the aid package for this and other Bank Group
financed projects.
x.        Local currency requirements for the Second Project of about BE 59
million will be met principally from ER's forecast net internal resources of
about bE 31 million for the project period 1975-77. The Government has also
agreed to implement a scheme for payment of net amounts owing to ER for
services provided in past years which will Provide a further LE 20 million.
The remaining BE 8 million is to be provided by allocation in the national
budget of vwhich BE 7 million has already been allocated for 1975.
1/   Including some insurance and freight charges not covered by external
finance.



- iii -
xi.       The financing plans for both the foreign and local currency com-
ponents are satisfactory. The investments in the project are conservatively
estimated to give an economic rate of return of about 12%. The Egyptian
Railways are adopting, and the Government supporting, an Action Plan designed
to achieve the improved performances which would result from the investments,
including a financial return of 6% on net fixed asset values.
xii.      With the assurances obtained and fulfillment of certain conditions
for loan effectiveness as indicated in paras 7.01 and 7.02, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$37 million to ER for a 25-year term including
four years of grace.






APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Egyptian
Railways Organization (ER) have asked the Bank to help finance the Second
Phase of ER's Investment Program. This Program, which covers the period from
July 1, 1971, to December 31, 1977 1/, has the broad objectives of rehabilita-
ting and modernizing ER's facilities. The Government has also asked the Bank
for aassistance with a national Transport Survey.
1.02      This would be the second Bank Group operation for the benefit of
ER and the fourth for transport in Egypt. The first phase of ER's Invest-
ment Program is being assisted by an IDA credit of US$30 million (Credit
284-UAR - February 1972) and, despite the emergency conditions prevailing,
has made satisfactory progress. Two loans have been made for the Suez Canal:
the first, for US$56.5 million (243 Egypt - December 1959), was for widening
and deepening the canal and its approaches, construction of additional facili-
ties and purchase of equipment, and was completed satisfactorily; the second,
for US$50 million, for rehabilitating the Canal and related facilities, to
enable operations to be resumed at a level of at least the scale and effi-
ciency prior to closure in 1967, was approved in December 1974.
1.03      US$30.5 million of the proposed loan of US$37 million would help
finance the final three calendar years, 1975-77, of ER's Investment Program
and would be disbursed against expenditures on selected investments. It would
represent about 10% of the project cost of BE 118 million (US$296 million)
and 21% of the foreign currency requirement of US$148 million. US$2 million
would provide the foreign currency requirement for the Transport Survey and
US$4.5 million would meet payments to be made for interest and other charges
on the proposed loan during the Project period.
1.04      This report was based on information provided by the Egyptian Gov-
ernment and ER and on the findings of an appraisal mission in June 1974 com-
posed of Messrs. R.W. MacDonald (Financial Analyst), A. Stone (Engineer/
Economist) and J. Brechot (Engineer, Consultant).
1/   The Program is related to financial years which, until 1973, ended on
June 30 each year, but from January 1, 1973 ended on December 31 eacn
year.



II. BACKGROUND
A. The Transport System
2.01      In Egypt, the concentration of economic activity along the Nile
Valley and in the Nile Delta has resulted in a simple transport network.
However, this network, through lack of maintenance and development, is now
barely adequate for existing demand.
2.02      The domestic transport system comprises:  3,559 route km of railway,
26,400 km of roads, 3,310 km of inland waterways, four major airports, three
major ports, and an oil pipeline due for completion in 1976. The Suez Canal,
while not a part of the domestic transport system, attracts considerable eco-
nomic activity when open; located at the eastern edge of the Nile Delta, it
is well connected to the rail and road systems. The transport network is
concentrated in the Nile Delta and Valley, the latter stretching about 900
km south from Cairo to Aswan. The Nile Valley narrows and becomes somewhat
rugged towards Aswan. However, the topography of the country is, in general,
characterized by flat, sandy desert plains.
2.03      Egypt's population of about 36 million is growing at an annual rate
of 2.2%; it is concentrated in the fertile Nile Delta and Valley which accounts
for less than 4% of the total area of just over 1 million km2. The localized
density of over 1,000 persons per km2 is the highest in the world. About 43%
of the population lives in urban areas, of which almost half resides in Cairo.
The estimated CNP per capita in 1973 wUS$261 (market prices) and is growing
at about 2% per annum in real terms. The transport demand arising from this
economic geography is dominated by the Cairo-Alexandria import/export freight
traffic, followed by the Aswan-Cairo-Alexandria corridor.
2.04      The linear configuration of economic activity, the flat topography,
and the high value of fertile land, have all supported development of the
railways as the dominant inland transport mode. This has been reinforced by
the Government's desire and ability in a planned economy to direct long dis-
tance traffic to the railways (and to a lesser extent inland waterways) and
short distance traffic to the roads.
2.05      Development of the transport sector has been constrained along with
other sectors by limited foreign exchange. This has resulted in the deferral
of both maintenance of, and new invesLmeat in, facilities and vehicles. The
impact of the latter has been most severe on rolling stock, locomotives, and
heavy trucks.
2.06      The level of total demand for inland transport has remained fairly
static since 1967, reflecting the uncertainty in the economy and the diversion
to military requirements of resources which would otherwise be contributing to
growth. The Government forecasts a recovery of the demand by 1980 to the level
anticipated for that year prior to the hostilities in 1967. The modal distribu--
tion of inland freight traffic in ton/km has also remained fairly constant at
about 50% to railways, 25% to roads, 20% to inland waterways, and 5% to pipelines.



B. Transport Coordination and Planning
2.07      Four ministries share responsibility for the transport system, as
shown in Annex 1, and coordination between them is formally achieved through
Cabinet meetings. Financial coordination of transport investments is under-
taken by the Ministry of Planning and all investment funds are allocated
by the Ministry of Finance, following planning approval. Little or no eco-
nomic planning of investments or operations has been carried out in the past,
either within the transport ministries or by the Ministry of Planning. The
General Commnittee for Inland Transportation attempted investment planning,
traffic allocation, and rate setting for all publicly owned transport up
until 1973, when the Committee became defunct. The Committee's decisions
were based partly on political considerations and partly on unit costs of
each mode which, while unsubstantiated by sufficient local evidence, were
ranked in the same order as suggested by evidence from other countries.
There is little or no explicit formulation of policy, although cost mini-
imization as an objective for the transport system is implied, as is the
desire for a balance between costs and revenues on revenue-earning modes.
For highways and inland waterways there are no general user charges. In
the past, some funds for road maintenance came direct from a tax on bus
fares, but this system is no longer used. Similarly, an airport tax exists
but it is unclear if this is related directly to costs. The examination of
policy and investment alternatives has been largely taken over by the
Transport Planning Authority located in the Ministry of Transport and Corm-
munications but its responsibilities cover only road, rail and inland water-
way transport.
2.08      The Government is aware of the importance and potential benefitA
of sound transport policies and investment planning. However, for such
analyses, the statistical base in terms of traffic flow data and unit costs
is inadequate. In these circumstances, investment plans have in the pastL
reflected budget allocations on the basis of first priority for maintenance
of existing systems, second for reconstruction of war-damaged facilities a td
third for new works. The Government is aware of the limitations of suchi aa
approach and a comprehensive Transport Survey, for which finance has been
included in the proposed Railway loan, is to be undertaken as soon as pos-
sible.  Terms of Reference have been drafted (Annex 2) and accepted by the
Government and the Bank. The Survey will cover all transport modes serving
domestic and international demand and will review the construction and
storage industries to the extent that they influence transport costs. The
Suez Canal and its ports will be excluded from the Survey except insofar as
they can contribute to the service of the country's transport demand. During
negotiations, agreement was obtained from Government that it would commence
the Survey no later than September 1, 1975. The Survey is expected to takse
eight months for Phase I and fifteen months for Phase II and the Government
agreed to complete it by August 31, 1977 and, on completion of each phase,
to review, jointly with the Bank, the recommendations of the consultants and
any action required to implement such recommendations.

III. EGYPTIAN RAILWAYS
A. Organization, Management and Staff
Organization
3.01      ER was operated as a Government department until 1956, when it
became a semi-autonomous entity, now within the responsibilities of the
Minister of Transport and Communications. The Chairman of the Board, ap-
pointed by the Minister of Transport, acts as general manager and two Vice-
Chairmen act as deputy general managers, one of them being responsible for
engineering and technical matters and the other for operations and traffic.
The Board controls ER's operating and financial policies and decides on all
matters referred to it by the Minister of Transport and Communications and
the Chairman. General policy, borrowings, staff regulations, and rates and
fares, are, however, subject to the approval of the President of the Republic.
Management
3.02      The seven managers who report to the Chairman and the Vice-Chair-
men are those responsible for: (i) mechanical and electrical equipment and
installations; (ii) way and works; (iii) planning and follow-up; (iv) admin-
istration; (v) finances; (vi) operations and traffic; and (vii) operations
in the central region around Cairo. There are 29 divisions which report to
the managers and four other regions which report to the Vice-Chairman in
charge of operations and traffic. ER's Management is capable and operates
ER efficiently.
Staff
3.03      At the beginning of 1974 ER had 73,080 employees, of whom 51,200 or
70% were manual workers (permanent way, transportation and traffic). Total
number of staff has remained stable for many years, with a slight decrease
during the last two years. (See Annex 3 for staff categories and numbers from
1968/69 to 1973). Traffic units 1/ per employee (see Annex 4) have improved
from 113,000 in 1968/69 to 148,000 in 1973 but are still lower than compara-
ble railways. Staff costs are about 67% of working expenses, which is also
on the high side. Many former ER employees are expected to return from the
army over the next few years, and management will give particular attention
to keeping net increases to a minimum. Assuming total staff does not increase
above 75,000 by 1977 for the traffic increase forecast, productivity would
rise to about 190,000 traffic units per employee and staff costs would fall
to about 63% of working expenses. These staff and productivity targets are
included in the Action Plan (Annex 5) and were confirmed during negotiations.

- 5 -
3.04      ER's management, fully aware of the need for adequately trained
personnel for efficient operation and maintenance of equipment, decided to
establish, with the technical and financial assistance of UNDP and ILO, a
Central Residential Training Centre in Wardan, 47 km from Cairo. Phase I
of this training project covered the years 1966-1973 but implementation was
delayed due to the political and military situation which forced the Govern-
ment to curtail the funds required. Training at Wardan started in October
1968 on a limited scale. Residential buildings and equipment were incom-
plete and it has also been difficult to obtain full-time trainees and in-
structors detached completely from their normal duties. Residential facil-
ities are now available for 540 trainees, still considerably less than the
planned 1,000. It has, therefore, not been possible to achieve the objec-
tives of Phase I, and when Phase II of the UNDP project was due to commence,
a provisional decision was made to discontinue such assistance in view of
the poor performance of the Centre.
3.05      During appraisal, the matter was discussed with UNDP, ER and the
Government and it was agreed that every effort should be made to continue
the project, which is of prime importance for ER's efficient operation and
the success of the proposed Second Railway Project. The Government and ER
have since agreed to take the following measures:
(a)  completion of accommodation and boarding facilities for
resident trainees, instructors and administrative staff;
(b)  creation in Wardan of a special training administration
with all secretarial and clerical facilities;
(c)  transfer, and, if necessary, recruitment, of full-time
instructors resident in Wardan;
(d)  provision of full-time and resident counterparts to UN
staff; and
(e)  provision of an adequate number of trainees, which should
not be less than 75% of the capacity of the Centre.
Based on firm assurances given to UNDP by ER's Chairman to implement the
above measures, UNDP has decided to continue its support. Assurances were
obtained from the Government and ER during negotiations that they will take
steps to support the training program through the above-stated measures and
by fostering close cooperation between 2R's operational departments and the
training administration (Action Plan, Annex 5).

B. Railway Property
Track and Structures
3.06      Details of the network and structures are given in Annex 6.  ER op-
erated in 1966-67 a total of 3,559 standard gauge route km, 2,608 km being
single track and 951 km double track. The 25 km suburban double line in
Cairo from Bab El Luk to Helwan is electrified. Since 1966, 13 km of double
track and 382 km of single track have been destroyed and 182 km of double
track and 42 km of single track damaged by military action. In addition to
the repair of some less damaged sections, Government is considering exten-
sive plans for realignments and new lines in the Suez Canal Zone, for new
lines in the Sinai, and for realignment and upgrading of the Western Desert
line. The Government intends to provide separate funds for these works as
part of the major reconstruction effort. They are provisionally estimated
at LE 225 million and are described in Annex 6. These works have not reached
a sufficiently advanced planning stage to be included in the present Program.
They should be reviewed in the light of the proposed Transport Study (para.
2.08).
3.07      A substantial portion of ER's track is in unsatisfactory condition
and track renewal of 250 km per year (200 km with new and 50 km with used
rails) was included as a priority item in ER's original 1971/72 - 1975/76
Investment Program, to reduce the arrears in track renewal which in 1971
were about 1,500 km. However, due to difficulty in procuring rails, there
was a shortfall of about 10% in the first three years. A full 250 km per
annum is scheduled for the Second Project, which should reduce the arrears
in track renewal to about 800 km by the end of 1977.
3.08      The original Investment Program included improvement to signalling
installations on five densely trafficked sections. Credit 284-UAR is finan-
cing electric signalling, interlocking and automatic block system (ABS) on
two sections near Cairo. 1/ A contract for centralized traffic control (CTC)
on a section in Upper Egypt 2/ could not be awarded because funds were not
available to meet increased costs, but further study by ER has shown that
capacity of this section could be improved sufficiently by using a tokenless
block system and improved train formations. Further consideration of instal-
lation of CTC has consequently been deferred until after 1977. ABS on two
other sections has been deferred for similar reasons. The revised program,
however, retains provisions for improvement of mechanical signalling, for
introduction of tokenless block systems as necessary, and for automatic tele-
phone systems serving ER's principal rail network.

Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.09      Table 2 to Annex 6 details ER's motive power and rolling stock.
While most locomotives and railcars are relatively new, 40% of passenger
coaches and freight cars are over 30 years old and generally in poor condi-
tion. About 65% of freight cars have a capacity of less than 20 tons, a
serious drawback to efficient operations, and most of the freight cars now
being procured by ER are of the bogie type with capacities up to 40 tons.
The Investment Program includes necessary replacements and additions to
capacity.
Maintenance
3.10      Maintenance, particularly of diesel locomotives, suffers from lack
of spare parts, for which provision is made under the proposed Project. Pas-
senger coaches and railcars are reasonably maintained but wagon maintenance
requires improvement. The Investment Program includes reequipment, moderniza-
tion and expansion of key workshops and sheds, and provision is made under the
Second Project for consultancy assistance to ensure maximum utilization of
these improved facilities. During negotiations, agreement was reached with ER
on the targets in the Action Plan (Annex 5), for availability for operations
of serviceable motive power and rolling stock.
C. Operations
3.11      Annex 7 summarizes operating statistics from 1968/69 to 1973.
Utilization of serviceable diesel locomotives and rolling stock has shown
little or no improvement . Main line diesel engine km per diesel engine-day
available and freight car km per day in service, increased only slightly.
The average net freight train load declined by 20% and could be substantially
improved. Turnaround time of wagons deteriorated from 7 days to 10 days and
freight car productivity declined from about 200,000 net ton-km to 156,000 net
ton-km, mainly due to poor locomotive control and car utilization resulting
from inadequate telecommunications; both should improve with the execution of
the Project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from ER that
measures would be taken to achieve the specific operating targets detailed in
the Action Plan (Annex 5).
D. Traffic
General
3.12      The forecasting of traffic demand for all modes of transport includ-
ing rail is difficult, given the lack of reliable data in a form suitable for
the requisite analysis. This problem is to be dealt with by the proposed
Transport Study (para. 2.08) and the preliminary results of the Study, ex-
pected to be available early in 1976, will provide a better basis for future



- 8 -
investment planning. ER's traffic forecasts for the three year project pe-
riod 1975-77 broadly follow the recovery and growth of the economy as fore-
cast by the Bank's recent economic report (The Egyptian Economy in 1974: Its
Position and Prospects - Report No. 491a-EGT). The forecast of traffic during
the project period is dominated by the impact of recovery of the economy.
Barring any unforeseen events, this recovery of the economy seems assured.
The forecast for freight traffic is magnified by the inclusion of iron ore
traffic. When the iron ore traffic is excluded, the growth rate on the re-
maining freight traffic is conservative. Given the likelihood of recovery
of the economy, the conservatism of the freight traffic forecast and the
lack of another suitable mode to serve the traffic demand, ER's forecasts
have been accepted for the Second Railway Project.
Freight Traffic
3.13      Railway freight in Egypt has fluctuated significantly since 1960.
It increased by about 65% in the four years to 1963/64, when (including the
peak Aswan High Dam construction requirements) ER carried 14.4 million m ton
(3.6 billion net m ton-km). The subsequent decline was aggravated by the
prolonged period of emergency and in 1973 only about 9.0 million m ton (2.5
billion m ton-km) were carried. Details by commodities for 1966/67 and the
period from July 1, 1971, to December 31, 1973, are shown in Annex 4
(Table 1).
3.14      The forecast growth of mine products freight reflects increased
movements of iron ore from Bahariya to the steel plant at Helwan, increasing
from 0.3 billion net m ton-km by about 67% per annum from 1973 to 1976 and
constant at about 1.4 billion net m ton-km thereafter. Freight other than
mine products is forecast by ER to return to the 1970/72 level of demand
(about 2.8 billion net m ton-km) by the end of 1974 and thereafter to grow
at a modest 2% per annum to about 3.2 billion net m ton-km by 1979 (Annex 4,
Table 2). Although preliminary figures for 1974 suggest that recovery to the
1970/72 level may not be completed until the end of 1975, the recent and
expected performance of the economy as a whole supports the contention of a
full recovery. The growth rate for freight other than mine products for 1975
and after appears low when compared with the expected real growth in GDP of
about 6% per annum even after allowing for the major increases in mining
activity. A developed waterways system may eventually serve the possible
remaining freight demand that could be expected to be generated by such
economic growth but it is doubtful that it could do so in the immediate
future. ER's forecasts should be reviewed when the preliminary results of
the Transport Study become available.
Passenger Traffic
3.15      Passenger traffic is much more significant than freight and cur-
rently accounts for over three-quarters of total traffic and nearly two-
thirds of all movement revenues. Contrary to the freight experience, it
has shown a steady growth of 5.6% per annum in passenger and 4.3% per annum
in pass-km since 1966. (Annex 4, Table 1). Data going back to 1959/60 show
even higher increases to date of 7.8% and 6.3% per annum, respectively.



-9-
3.16      ER's forecast to 1979 (Annex 4, Table 2) shows increases of 3.2%
per annum for passengers and 4.7% for pass-km with a 10% increase in average
journey length. By 1979, pass-km would have doubled since 1963/64 (the peak
year for freight - see para. 3.13). The growth from 1973 to 1979 is an ex-
trapolation of trends in the past decade and is about twice that expected
for freight and consistent with the expected real growth in GDP. This fore-
cast is reasonable, given the railway's economic and institutional efficiency
for handling such a growth in passenger traffic, when compared with the al-
ternative of upgrading inter-city highways and expanding long distance bus
traffic. The Government's ability in a planned economy to direct passenger
traffic towards the railways reinforces the validity of the forecast. In
summary, ER's forecasts of passenger traffic are acceptable but, as with
the forecasts of freight traffic, they should be reviewed when the prelim-
inary results of the Transport Study become available.
E. Tariffs
3.17      Presidential sanction is required to amend the general tariffs
although, with Board approval, ER can quote special rates. Freight rates
are not cost-based; they have remained unchanged since 1957, when surcharges
of 50% to 120% were added to the 1930 tariffs which were generally related
to "what the traffic would bear". A very liberal tapering of rates applies,
with reductions of 50% for distances over 250 km and 75% over 500 km. An
increase in passenger fares of about 20% in 1967 caused only a slight and
temporary dip in the upward traffic trend.
3.18      The introduction of a costing system is essential to enable future
tariff changes to be more nearly related to cost, and was required by the
previous project (Credit 284-UAR) to be introduced by March 31, 1973. Un-
settled conditions, however, delayed the appointment of consultants, and
work was further disrupted by the October 1973 hostilities. The system
has now been designed and provision is made in the proposed loan for con-
sultants to assist in its implementation. Although reliable cost information
is unlikely to be available from the full system until mid-1977 it is expected
that tariff changes will be necessary before that date in order to meet the
financial targets mentioned in para. 5.03. Assurances were obtained from
ER and the Government at negotiations that these changes will be made as
required, if necessary on an "across-the-board" basis, although interim
results from the cost system should enable changes in 1977 to be made more
selectively.   Some selective increases are awaiting approval to be applied,
in 1975, to certain commodity rates (including sugar and cotton) for which
previous rates were clearly too low, even on the basis of the limited informa-
tion so far available.
F. Unprofitable Lines and Services
3.19      With the unsettled conditions long prevailing, no attempt has been
made to identify any potentially unprofitable lines or services. The new cost



- 10 -
system (para. 3.18) will indicate those lines which may be unprofitable and,
in conjunction with the National Transport Survey (para. 2.08), should provide
data to determine any such lines and services which should be closed. The
Government agreed at negotiations that closures would be made within one year
of such determination unless for social or other reasons it is desirable to
retain the line or service, in which case the authority requiring its reten-
tion would pay a contribution sufficient to cover the excess of variable
costs (both short-run and long-run) over revenue.
C. Budget, Accounts and Audit
3.20      ER's budget - in two sections for operations and capital investment -
forms a separate unit attached to the general Government Budget. Pending in-
troduction of the costing system the budget is the principal instrument of
control over expenditure by departments and by nature of expense, classified
according to the National Code.
3.21      ER's budgeting and accounting systems are structurally sound but
deficiencies persist in application, notably in the valuation of assets and
liabilities for control and balance sheet purposes. No progress has been
made with the mutual settlement of debts existing between ER and various Gov-
ernment departments and agencies as required by Section 4.01 of the previous
Development Credit Agreement; instead, the situation has steadily worsened
since 1968, to ER's net detriment of about bE 30 million of which at least
LE 20 million should be recoverable (Annex 8).  At negotiations a detailed
scheme for recovery of these debts was discussed and the Government has since
confirmed that it will implement the scheme commencing in 1975. A condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan will be that ER and the Government
shall have made an arrangement satisfactory to the Bank for the payments
required to be made for outstanding debts during the fiscal year 1975. The
Government has already introduced a system of payment by monthly instalments
to meet the estimated future usage of railway services by Government depart-
ments and agencies. In addition, but not involving cash, there are several
other substantial and long-outstanding assets and liabilities awaiting resolu-
tion of disputes between ER and the Government. All these matters and others
such as obsolete stores are being studied by committees set up by ER with
Government participationi, and repots are nearing completion.  The proposed
loan provides for consultancy assistance for improvements in accounting and
stores procedures which will assist in the resolution of the remaining
problems.
3.22      ER's accounts are audited by the Government Central Organization
for Accounting and Auditing. The previous delays of over one year in com-
pleting audits have been appreciably reduced and the Government confirmed at
negotiations that audit reports will be furnished to the Bank within six
nonths of the end of each financial year.

IV. THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. Investment Program
Original Program
4.01      ER's five-year Investment Program, 1971/72-1975/76, to rehabilitate
and increase capacity to meet expected traffic demands, was estimated to cost
BE 137 million (US$319 million equivalent). This Program served as a basis
for the First Railway Project, which was identified as "Phase I" of the
Program. Phase I then consisted of the complete installation in the five
years, 1971/72-1975/76, of ABS on two sections and of CTC on a third section,
and all other investments planned to be made in the first two years 1971/72
and 1972/73. "Phase II" was expected to cover all other investments to be
made during the last three years, 1973/74-1975/76, of the Program. The First
Railway Project was estimated to cost bE 58 million (USS134 million equi-
valent) including contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of US$66
million, and an IDA credit (284-UAR) of US$30 million (Appraisal Report, PTR-
69a, November 1971) was granted to finance the foreign exchange costs of
selected equipment, materials and services. The execution of the First Proj-
ect was delayed for a number of reasons, including lack of funds following
increases in costs of imported goods exceeding contingencies, difficulty in
locating sources of supply for some main items such as rails and fittings, and
difficulties in acquisition of land for a proposed new marshalling yard.
Revised Program
4.02      The Investment Program has now been revised and extended to include
1977. The revised 6-1/2 year Program takes into account the physical and
cost changes experienced, updated traffic forecasts and operational require-
ments, and ER's capacity to execute the Program. It is now estimated to cost
BE 177 million (US$443 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange compo-
nent of US$220 million equivalent, of which the First Project (expenditure on
ABS through 1976 and on other items through 1974) will account for LE 59 mil-
lion (US$147 million equivalent).  Details are given in Annex 9 and summarized

ments to existing marshalling yards in substitution for a new major yard at
Qualyub near Cairo, the addition of 30 1,000 hp locomotives to haul railcars
from which obsolete engines are having to be removed, and an increase in track
renewal from 1,250 km to 1,675 km over the longer period. Agreement was reached
with the Government and ER during negotiations that no substantial changes will
be made in the revised Investment Program except by agreement with the Bank.
A change would be regarded as substantial if an addition or deletion to a
group of works in the Program changed the estimated cost (excluding contin-
gencies) for that group by more than 20% or BE 3 million, whichever is less.

B. Project Description
4.03      The project for which the loan would be made is estimated to cost
1E 119.6 million (US$299 million) and comprises the Second Railway Project to
be carried out by ER and the national Transport Survey to be undertaken by
the Government with the assistance of consultants. The Second Railway Proj-
ect would cover all expenditures under the revised Investment Program during
the three years 1975 to 1977 with the exception of expenditures on ABS on two
sections 1/ in 1975 and 1976 which were included in and will be financed
under the First Project. It would broadly correspond to expenditures under
Phase II of that Program and comprise the following principal work:
(a) completion (after December 31, 1976) of ABS on two sections; 1/
(b) continuation of modifications to mechanical signalling in-
stallations and of introduction of tokenless block system
on some sections; completion of installation of automatic
telephone system;
(c) relaying of about 600 km of track with new materials and
150 km of track with used materials; track laying and main-
tenance equipment; and miscellaneous civil engineering works;
(d) acquisition of about: 30 diesel locomotives of about 2,200 hp,
30 diesel locomotives of about 1,000 hp, 25 diesel shunting
locomotives of 600 hp, 5 breakdown cranes, 820 locally manu-
factured freight cars, 180 locally manufactured passenger
coaches and 175 imported coaches; improvements to train lighting
and installation of air brakes;
(e) continuation of modernization of existing marshalling yards and
of remodelling of station facilities and yards;
(f) completion of modernization of workshops and sheds;
(g) miscellaneous; including acquisition of road vehicles; com-
pletion of reorganization of stores facilities and further
augmentation of stocks of essential stores including spare
parts for existing locomotives; and
(h) consultancy services for the development of signalling and
telecommunications systems, for the introduction of costing
and for the improvement of maintenance, accounting, stores
and other procedures of ER; the improvement of training
facilities including the training center at Wardan and the
training abroad of key personnel.

C. Project Cost Estimates
4.04       Annex 10 shows the detailed estimates for the railways portion of
the Project, and the 1975-77 expenditures are summarized below. In addition
the national Transport Survey is expected to cost about fE 1.2 million (US$3
million) of which about US$2 million would be foreign exchange.

The cost estimates are based on early 1974 prices with price contingencies
calculated according to the Bank's guidelines dated December 27, 1974 and,
in the case of principal items, verified as adequate by reference to the most
recent quotations. Price contingenicies average 30% for the Second Project
and comprise:
(a) local cost increases of 10% per annum (average 27%); and
(b) foreign cost increases of 14% in 1974, 12% in 1975, 10% in
1976, and 8% in 1977 (average 33%).
Physical contingencies are not required due to the nature of the project and
following redefinition of quantities after experience with the First Project.

D. Project Financing
4.05      Financing of the Second Railway Project is to be obtained by for-
eign borrowings (49%), Egyptian Government allocations (8%), ER's net internal
resources during the project period (26%) and ER's net recovery of long-
outstanding debts (17%) (para 3.21). In addition to US$30.5 million from the
proposed Bank loan of US$37 million, the Egyptian Government has received
offers of assistance totalling US$34.5 million from Western Countries, US$21.5
million from Eastern European Countries and up to US$65 million from Saudi-
Arabia. The total of US$151.5 million exceeds the estimated foreign exchange
requirement of US$148 million, but some bilateral finance does not, at pre-
sent, cover shipping and insurance charges for which the Egyptian Government
would otherwise have to make foreign exchange available. The Government is
examining the possibility of using more Saudi-Arabian finance in preference
to other offers on less comprehensive terms. At negotiations it was agreed
that, as a condition of effectiveness, ER or the Government will have obtain-
ed finance equivalent to US$114 million which added to US$30.5 million from
the proposed Bank loan will provide US$144.5 million leaving the Government
to make available only US$3.5 million for shipping and insurance charges as
and when required. Of the proposed Government allocation of BE 9.6 million,
the 1975 National Budget includes some BE 7.6 million leaving BE 2 million to
be provided in the budgets for 1976 and 1977. The financing of the Railway
Project can be summarized as follows:

4.06      US$30.5 million of the proposed Bank loan of US$37 million would
finance selected items in the Second Railway Project, as follows:
Item                                            LE Million           US$ Million
Signalling and Telecommunications                  0.04                  0.1

/a   Contingencies of 30% for Bank financed items are less than the 33%
for total foreign costs (para. 4.04) due to expected delivery dates
being earlier than average.
The proposed Bank loan would finance about 10% of the estimated expenditure
and 20% of the foreign exchange requirement for the railway project in the
three years, 1975 to 1977. In addition, due to the tight cash situation of
ER and to the Government's need for foreign exchange, the interest and other
charges on the Bank loan during the Project period, estimated at US$4.5
million, have been included in the proposed loan.
4.07      Offers of finance received from other sources, to be used in parallel
with the proposed Bank loan, are intended to be allocated for procurement of
the project items as shown below:

The Saudi-Arabian Government has undertaken to provide up to US$65 million
equivalent and during negotiations with that Government the Egyptian Govern-
ment intends to discuss taking up the balance of the Saudi-Arabian offer in
possible substitution for some of the other bilateral finance for which
arrangements have not yet been finally concluded. ER and the Government will
also request other lenders to include shipping and insurance charges where
appropriate. By these two means ER and the Government expect to be able to
satisfy the condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan and secure
other finance for US$114 million (para 4.05).

E. Project Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
4.08      ER is competent to execute the railway portion of the Project,
which is scheduled for completion by the end of 1977. Control of the execu-
tion of the principal sections of the project and management action to secure
maximum benefits from it are included in the Action Plan (Annex 5). The
Ministry of Transport and Communications will be the coordinating authority
for the Transport Survey (para 2.08).
4.09      Procurement of all goods financed under the proposed Bank loan
would be through internationally advertized competitive bidding, in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. Although for most of the items selected for
procurement (para 4.06) local bids are unlikely, provision has been made for
domestic firms to participate in the bidding and to be accorded a preference
of 15% or the customs duty, whichever is lower. Consultants for technical,
accounting and other assistance would be employed in accordance with "Uses of
Consultants by the World Bank and its Borrowers". Procurement of items to
be financed by sources other than the Bank (para 4.07) would be as required
by the lending agencies.
4.10      Some difficulties were experienced in procurement of goods under
Credit 284-UAR, mainly stemming from unexpectedly sharp increases in equipment
costs and lengthy procurement procedures. Provision for contingencies in the
proposed loan is considered adequate to cover cost increases (para. 4.04).
Regarding procurement procedures, the difficulties have been brought to the at-
tention of ER management and during negotiations ER and Government agreed to
examine ways and means to accelerate procedures.
4.11      The proposed loan would be disbursed against the direct cost of
imports (or the ex-factory cost of locally-procured items), foreign exchange
costs of consultancy services and payments for interest and other charges on
the proposed Bank loan during the Project period. Estimated disbursements
are shown in Annex 11.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      The generally satisfactory situation disclosed at appraisal of the
First Project, Credit 284-UAR, has been confirmed and the previous appraisal
forecasts (Report PTR-69a, November 1971) have been exceeded in all important
respects except freight revenue (para. 3.12). (Details are shown in Annex 12.)

financial results for the period 1974 through 1979, further details of which
will be found in Annex 13:

/a   Excluding amounts payable since 1973 to Government as a 2% return
on equity under the terms of CR 284-UAR; currently about BE 2.4 million
is payable annually out of net surplus.
Revenue forecasts assume that freight traffic will not fully recover until the
end of 1976, and are based on 1974 tariffs and proposed increases in July 1975,
January 1977 and July 1978, each averaging about 7.5%. Maintenance costs
(particularly spares) are sharply increased to allow for some under-expenditure
irn recent years, although increased costs should to some extent be offset by
more efficient utilization of maintenance facilities (para. 3.10). Working
expenses are adjusted for domestic inflation at rates consistent with those
used for capital expenditure. After allowing for traffic changes and infla-
tion, the forecasts for 1974 to 1976 are broadly comparable in total to those
in the November 1971 appraisal (which did not extend beyond June 30, 1976).



- 20 -
5.03      For the Project period, 1975 to 1977, operations should be able to
generate the internal funds required for financing the Second Railway Project.
At negotiations a rate of return of 6% on net fixed assets 1/ and an
operating ratio of 80, forecast as attainable by 1977, were agreed with ER
as targets for both that and subsequent years. The criteria used in preparing
the financial forecasts are detailed in Annex 14.
C. Cash Flow
5.04      The cash flow estimates are satisfactory for the Project period
1975 to 1977 provided that the Government continues to take suitable action
to apply the necessary tariff increases (para. 3.18) and to enable ER to
recover the BE 20 million of deferred items (para. 3.21) during the project
period. The cash flow projection (Annex 15) also shows that in 1978 and 1979,
ER should be able to continue financing the local currency costs of its nor-
mal program of investments from its own resources once the main rehabilitation
program is completed. To ensure that terms for future borrowings bear
reasonable relationship to ER's cash resources, assurances were obtained
from ER during negotiations that the Bank's agreement would be sought before
incurring any debt if current cash resources are less than 1.5 times 2/ the
maximum resultant debt service for any succeeding year.
D. Balance Sheets
5.05      The 1973 debt/equity ratio was low at 9/91 following conversion of
long-term debt to Government into equity as required by Section 4.03 of the
Development Credit Agreement, 284-UAR. The amount converted was LE 84.5 mil-
lion; without this conversion the debt/equity ratio would have been 47/53.
The debt/equity ratio at the end of the Program and Project periods is es-
timated to be 26/74, which is satisfactory. Details of the forecast balance
sheets for 1974 through 1979 are given in Annex 16.
5.06      Assessment of ER's optimum working capital is difficult pending the
determination and settlement of the many deferred assets and liabilities
(para. 3.21). Operating cash is at present too low, at only about 2% of annual
cash operating expenses, and the cash flow projects an increase to about 6% by
1977. On the other hand, inventories at 60% and other working capital at 38%
of cash operating expenses are excessive. Action to deal with obsolete
1/   Corresponding target in the Project Agreement for Credit 284-UAR was 4.5%.
2/   corresponding limitation in the Project Agreement, Credit 284-UAR, was
1.2.



- 21 -
inventories is being taken (para. 3.21) and, during negotiations, ER agreed,
as part of its Action Plan (Annex 5) to reduce total working capital from
the present level of almost 100% of cash operating expenses and to improve
its liquidity position.
VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic
6.01      ER's traffic forecasts have been accepted for the evaluation of the
Project. In summary, the forecasts of growth in passenger traffic follow the
GDP forecasts of about 6% per annum, but for freight (excluding mine products)
the forecasts are only about half the GDP rate. The latter appears low but,
overall, both the freight and passenger forecasts are acceptable. The Bank
will have the opportunity to review these forecasts when the interim results
of the comprehensive Transport Study become available in late 1975. For a
full discussion of the forecasts, see Chapter III (D).
B. Economic Justification
6.02      ER is Egypt's primary mode for inland transport.  The proposed
Project covers ER's investment for the years 1975 through 1977. During this
period, no other mode offers the potential to serve, at reasonable cost, the
traffic demand forecast for inland transport. Increased utilization of exist-
ing facilities will be possible primarily through replacement of overaged
equipment (both locomotives and rolling stock), renewal and rehabilitation of
track, and procurement of spares for the existing fleet of locomotives and
rolling stock.
6.03      In estimating the economic return, benefits were measured as the
difference between operating costs (before depreciation) and revenue (i.e.
net operating revenue) which would be experienced with the Project against the
situation without the Project. Calculating benefits on this basis rather than
by comparison of costs between railways and other modes assumes that the rail-
ways are the most economically efficient mode for the traffic assigned to them.
Such an assumption is supported by the fact that the other existing transport
facilities will not offer reasonable alternatives to the railways for the
period under consideration. The estimate of operating costs with the Project,
2% per annum below traffic unit costs for 1974, was based on increases in
efficiency set out in the Plan of Action (see Annex 5). The estimate of
operating costs without the Project was taken as constant at the 1974 level,
coupled in this case with an assumed decrease in traffic of about 4% per annum
for the three years of the investment plan and constant thereafter, which in-
fers a similar increase in unit cost. The operating revenues with and without
the Project were estimated by taking the 1974 unit revenue estimates, thereby



- 22 -
furnishing estimates in constant value terms. The revenue estimate with the
Project was based on the forecast traffic in Annex 4, and the estimate without
the Project assumed a decrease in traffic from the 1974 level at 4% per annum
over the investment period and constant thereafter as for expenditures.
6.04      The difference between the net operating revenues with and without
the Project gives a very conservative estimate of benefits and an economic
return on the investment of about 12% over the average 25-year life of the
items included in the 3-year project period. The estimated cost of the
Project used in the calculation of the economic return was net of price con-
tingencies and taxes. The sensitivity of the economic return was not cal-
culated, given the satisfactory return of 12% on the very conservatively es-
timated benefits. Due to the scarcity of detailed information on costs and
traffic the economic return on individual items in the Project cannot be cal-
culated. The deficiencies in cost accounting data have been the subject of
a consultant study financed under the first Credit and the framework of a cost
accounting system has been designed and is to be implemented with some con-
sultancy assistance (para. 3.18). Similarly, the development of detailed
traffic information is one of the objectives of the comprehensive Transport
Study, also proposed as part of the Project (para. 2.08).
C. Summary
6.05      The Egyptian economy is expected to expand rapidly over the Project
period and into the future. It has been, and remains, Government strategy to
maintain the position of the railways as the primary mode for inland transport,
and the Project fits well into this strategy. In the recent past, the severe
shortage of foreign exchange has resulted in the deferral of much maintenance
and renewal of both track and equipment, leading to inadequacies in service.
The proposed Project will reduce the extent of this deferral and enable ER
to provide adequate service for the forecast traffic. Using very conserva-
tive assumptions as to the minimum economic benefits, the Project gives an
economic return of about 12%. Additional benefits will accrue to the Egyptian
economy through the increased net revenue of the railways, and savings (not
quantified in the economic return) to railway users through improved service
and, in real terms, lower tariffs. In these circumstances, the Project is
clearly justified.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following principal
points:



- 23 -
(a)  with Government
(i)  timing and responsibility for a national Transport Survey
to be carried out with the assistance of consultants
under previously agreed terms of reference (para. 2.08);
(ii) schemes for settlement of mutual debts, long outstanding
between ER and Government departments and agencies, and
for prompt settlement of current debts (para. 3.21); and
(iii) external finance, to be used in parallel with the proposed
Bank loan, totalling US$114 million equivalent (paras. 4.05
and 4.07).
(b)  with ER
(i)  improvements in staff training and in maintenance and
operating performance designed to achieve agreed targets
and to obtain maximum benefit from the Rehabilitation
Program (paras. 3.03 to 3.05, 3.10 and 3.11)
(ii) financial targets including a return of 6% on net fixed
assets by 1977 and thereafter and a debt limitation ratio
of 1.5 (paras. 5.03 and 5.04); and
(iii) an Action Plan incorporating appropriate action and con-
sultancy assistance to achieve the foregoing items (i)
and (ii) (paras. 3.03 et seq. and 4.03).
7.02      Conditions of loan effectiveness are that:
(a)  the Government or ER shall have obtained additional parallel
financing in an amount equivalent to US$114 million to meet
the foreign exchange cost of the Project (para. 4.05); and
(b)  ER and the Government shall have made an arrangement satis-
factory to the Bank for the payments required to be made during
the fiscal year 1975, under the scheme for settlement of long-
outstanding debts between ER and Government departments and
agencies (para. 3.21).
7.03      The Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$37
million to the Egyptian Railways Organization with the guarantee of the Arab
Republic of Egypt for a term of 25 years, corresponding to the average life
of the assets, including four years of grace corresponding to the disburse-
ment period.

APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Transport Survey
Terms of Reference
A. Introduction
1.        The Arab Republic of Egypt, in response to the developmental ini-
tiatives of its Government, is expected to achieve rapid economic growth in
the foreseeable future. This growth will produce substantial increases in
both internal and external commodity flows. These increased flows will place
a heavy demand on the transport system. The Government wishes to meet this
demand in the most efficient manner possible and, as a consequence, desires
that the following Transport Survey be undertaken.
B. Objectives
2.        The overall objective of the Transport Survey is to assist the Gov-
ernment in defining transport policies which are economically optimal with
respect to Egypt's development goals. The Survey will make recommendations
regarding the formulation of appropriate organizations and methods for in-
vestment planning, operations, and maintenance of the transport system required
to implement the policies. The recommendations will take into account all
modes of transport, including existing modes and possible future modes. Of
high priority within the overall objective is the training of counterpart
personnel to operate the recommended planning system once the consultants'
services are complete.
3.        The Survey shall be undertaken in two separate phases under separate
contracts and terms of reference. Phase I is expected to be completed within
8 months and Phase II within a further 15 months. Phase I will lay the ground-
work for Phase II; and will provide the Government and transport organizations
with an opportunity to review the findings and preliminary recommendations,
including the terms of reference for the detailed analyses to be carried out
under Phase II.
4.        Phase I will consist of:
(a) a comprehensive inventory, for all transport modes, of:
(i) all legal, institutional, technical, economic, financial,
personnel and training arrangements;
(ii) all assets, including levels of employment; and
(iii) all operational data including traffic levels, costs
and revenues;

C. Scope of Consultancy Services
General
6.        The scope of the present consultancy services comprises only Phase I
of the Transport Survey as outlined in para 4. The Phase I consultants shall,
however, bear in mind the interdependence and sequential nature of the two
phases and shall, therefore, anticipate and collect where possible during
Phase I all data required for the execution of Phase II.
7.        Selection of consultants for Phase I will neither bar nor ensure
consideration of the Phase I consultants for Phase II.
8.        The Transport Survey shall cover the entire country and all aspects
that impinge upon the provision of transport service. These aspects shall
include, but not be limited to, all modes (railways, highways, road transport,
ports, inland waterways, shipping, airports and airways, civil aviation and
pipelines), the storage industry, and the construction industry. The Survey
shall focus primarily on intercity transport and will not include studies of
urban transport except to the extent that intercity transport may be affected
at the interface between the two transport systems. The Suez Canal and its
ports will be excluded from the Survey except to the extent that they can con-
tribute to the service of the country's transport demand (see paragraph 22).
9.        The consultants shall perform, according to internationally accepted
standards, all technical and administrative studies, economic analyses, finan-
cial analyses, field investigations and related work herein described, or any
other work necessary to attain the Phase I objectives given in Section B. In
the conduct of this work the consultants shall cooperate fully with the Minis-
try of Transport and Communications, other Government agencies and other trans-
port organizations designated by the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and other Government agencies
will provide the data and services outlined in Section D below; however, the
consultants shall be solely responsible for the analyses and interpretation
of all data received and for the findings, conclusions and recommendations
contained in their reports.
10.       The Government Counterpart Organization to the consultants is to be
the Transport Planning Authority in the Ministry of Transport and Communica-
tions. The personnel of the Authority, augmented by appropriate staff from
other Government agencies providing transport service, will work as full-time
counterparts on the Survey.



ANNEX 2

Sectoral Studies
II.       The consultants shall apply the studies of para. 4 firstly to the
institutional framework (ministries, departments, units, committees etc.,) for
all modes and aspects of transport service.
12.       To this end, the consultants will complete a comprehensive review
of all the legal obligations, powers and responsibilities of all organizations
(within and outside Government) which contribute to the supply of transport
service. Each organization shall be adequately defined to show its responsi-
bilities, interrelationships with other organizations, and the level and
competence of staff.
13.       The consultants shall study the present means of attaining technical
coordination in the transport sector. These studies shall include assessment
of such aspects as structural loading, dimensional and safety standards for
vehicles, cargoes and ways. The consultants shall study the economic advan-
tages of introducing new cargo-handling technology (e.g. containers). The
consultants shall also investigate the means of assessing and controlling the
ecological impact of the sector as a whole.
14.       The consultants shall study the present procedures for investment
planning. The study shall include an assessment of: methods of establishing
economic priorities for investments in all modes; and methods of forecasting
commodity flows; and assigning traffic to each mode. The methodology for
establishing cost data for each mode, and the resultant unit costs will also
be assessed. The general availability of data for both present and future
planning will also be assessed and the data summarized.
15.       The consultants shall assess and summarize the organization of
financial control of the sector. The studies shall cover budgetary methods,
clearly recording the sources of investment, operating and maintenance funds,
showing subsidies, if any. The studies shall include pricing policies and
will differentiate where possible between cost-based user charges and other
charges such as taxes and customs duties. Also the method of determining
levels of revenue transfer from operating agencies to the Central Finance
Ministry (or other) will be studied and summarized.
16.       The consultants shall review and analyze any available transport
studies and also review all pertinent studies on other sectors and fully
assess the implications for transport of the current Development Plan. In
this regard, and throughout the Survey the consultants will bear in mind the
linear configuration of economic activity in the country and assess the im-
pact of the development of transverse links in the transport network on
economic development.
17.       Based on the inventories and studies completed above, the consultants
shall identify areas where more data are needed to plan and operate an effi-
cient transport system. The consultants will establish a data bank and col-
lection methods and shall collect, if possible, the additional data required



ANNEX 2
Page 5
for completing Phase II of the Transport Survey. In establishing these infor-
mation systems, the consultants shall ensure that data for each mode (espe-
cially economic cost data) are prepared on a uniform basis.
18.       With the knowledge of development plans and existing commodity flows,
the consultants shall prepare a preliminary forecast of all commodity flows
(freight and passengers), both internal and external, together with the pre-
liminary assignment of the flows to each mode. Such forecasts should be in
sufficient detail in terms of quantity and type of commodity to permit the
satisfactory completion of Phase I and to serve as an appropriate preliminary
to Phase II. In the forecasts, the consultants shall explicitly define ele-
ments of the flows which can be attributed to normal growth and to the growth
which is in direct response to planned Government Development Investments.
19.       The consultants shall complete a preliminary analysis of problems
defined in the assessment of those organizations required to coordinate inter-
modal and multimodal aspects of the transport system (including the storage
industry and relevant parts of the construction industry). From these ana-
lyses, the consultants shall submit recommended solutions to these problems,
including suggestions for further studies to be performed in Phase II.
Subsectoral Studies
(i) Railways
20.       The consultants shall apply the studies of para. 4 to the services
of the Egyptian Railways and any other railways which may exist in the country.
In particular, the consultants shall evaluate and make recommendations as to
detailed studies necessary in Phase II regarding any procedures which may
interfere with the efficient, economic operation of the railways. The con-
sultants shall pay attention to the "Branch Line" services of the railway
with respect to their economic and commercial viability. Similarly, the
consultants shall review and make recommendations upon any special services
provided to various groups in the country, such as other Government departments.
The terms of reference for recommended detailed studies of the railways shall
be prepared for Phase II. In preparing forecasts of railway traffic, the
consultants shall analyze the relative economies of transport on competing
modes, notably inland waterways and highways.
(ii) Ports
21.       The studies listed in para. 4 shall be undertaken with respect
to all ports services. Particular attention shall be paid to the organization
and integration of services at different ports focussing on the degree of
autonomy of operations at each port.
22.       The consultants shall analyze the prospective development plans
for the main port at Alexandria. Similarly, the consultants shall analyze
the role and possible greater integration of the Suez Canal ports into the



ANNEX 2
Page 6
port system serving rhe Egyptian import/export traffic. The consultants
shall also assess the desirability of new Red Sea ports to efficiently serve
the potentially great demands of new economic developments in Upper Egypt,
notably in the Aswan Region. The consultants shall pay particular attention
to the coordination of port service with other modes, notably the inland
waterway linking the port at Alexandria with the Nile River system of waterways.
(iii) Higways
23.       The consultants shall undertake studies as outlined in para. 4 in
regard to the construction, operation, and maintenance of highways outside
urban areas. The consultants shall pay particular attention to an assessment
of geometric and structural standards of road construction and the complemen-
tary vehicle standerds governing size and axle loads. The specification of
materials shall be assessed for their economic suitability, notably in the
case of bituminous surfacing material. The consultants shall review the
maintenance program and make recommendations in regard to detailed studies of
improvements that may be required in Phase II.  The consultants, in forecast-
ing highway use, shall evaluate the advantages of highways relative to other
modes and also assess the impact of the establishment of a local vehicle con-
struction industry on the modal split of traffic. The consultants shall also
assess and make recommendation in regard to the adequacy or need for studies
of feeder road development programs in Phase II.
(iv) Inland Waterways
24.       The consultants shall apply the studies of para 4 to the provision
of inland waterways and the operation of traffic using these facilities.
The consultants shall pay particular attention to the assessmlent of the eco-
nomic advantages that this mode offers relative to other modes, especially
in the case of the transport of bulk non-perishable cormmodities. The commer-
cial nature or otherwise of the marketing of these services will be assessed
and recommendationis made for improvements that may be required especially
in the technology employed,  The consultants shall thoroughly examine the
problem of defining the optimal dimensional and performance relationships
between barges and waterways.  The consultants, in assessing plans for future
developrnent of the inland waterway system, shall keep in mind the potential
dual nature of fresh water canals for agricultural and transportation benef-.ts.
(v)  Airports and Airways
25.       The consultants s3hall apply the studies listed in para 4 to the
provision of airport and airways service. The consultants shall pay parti-
cular attention to the adequacy of current airport designi standards, naviga-
tion aides, and traff:tc control procedures.  The consultants shall also as-
sess the adequacy and potential for develops,ent of domestic service, given
the remoteness of some centers and the likely expansion of tourist traffic.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
(vi) Pipelines
26.       The consultants shall apply the studies listed in para 4 to the
provision and use of pipeline service. The consultants are not expected
to investigate the pipeline system orientated to export or transshipment of
crude oil and petroleum products. The consultants shall pay particular
attention to the analyses of economic advantages of expanding the domestic
distribution system.
(vii) Road Transport
27.       The consultants shall apply the studies listed in para 4 to the
organizations providing road transport service (freight and passengers) and
integrate these studies with those on highways. The consultants shall pay
particular attention to the economic efficiency of the service, the charges
for road use, and the need for technical innovation, notably in regard to
bulk freight. The methods of organization and assignment or otherwise of
traffic between companies and between road transport and other modes shall be
assessed and recommendations made regarding possible improvements. The con-
sultants shall also assess the adequacy of vehicle supply and maintenance
and, as noted in (iii) above, the impact that an expanded vehicle construc-
tion industry would have on this service.
(viii) Shipping
28.       The consultants shall apply the studies listed in para 4 to the
shipping services, both international and domestic coastal, including dome-
stic and foreign fleets. The consultants shall also assess the domestic
shipbuilding and repair industry. Recommendations shall be made in regard
to the economic desirability of expansion of the domestic fleet.
(ix) Civil Aviation
29.       The consultants shall apply the studies listed in para 4 to the
irternational and domestic civil aviation service. These studies shall be
integrated with and cover the particular concerns of (v) above in regard to
the role of aviation in the tourist industry and service to remote centers
of the country.
(x) Storage Industry
30.       The consultants shall apply the studies in para 4 to the provision
of storage facilities where these are directly related to the transport of
commodities. The studies shall focus on bulk commodity storage of both perish-
able and non-perishable goods and the cost thereof as they interrelate to the
direct cost of transport.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
(xi) Construction Industry
31.       The consultants shall apply the studies in para 4 to that part of
the construction industry engaged in the construction of transport facilities
(excluding vehicles except as specifically mentioned above).. The consultants
shall pay particular attention to the economic efficiency of the industry,
the technology employed, the standards of construction and the capacity of
thLe industry to liandle the forecast construction program. The relative eco-
nomies of foreign and domestic capability shall be explored. In assessing
the capacity situation, the consultants shall be expected to evaluate on a
broad (as opposed to detailed) basis the total construction program forecast
in the country in all sectors.
Reports and Time Schedule
32.       The consultants shall commence field work within 30 calendar days
of the effective date of their contract. They shall submit the following
reports in ten copies in Arabic and ten in English to the Government and
ten copies in English to the Bank, within the time periods stated below:
(a) an Inception Report outlining the proposed work approach and
methodology within two months of the starting date (defined
as the date field work commenced);

date and a statistical annex showing personnel employed,
equipment ordered and delivered and subcontracts entered
into for periods four and six months from the starting date;
and
(c) an Interim Report for Phase I summarizing all work performed,
and the findings and recommendations of the consultants, and
including the detailed terms of reference recommended for Phase
II, within eight months of the starting date. This report
shall be submitted in the form of 15 copies in Arabic and 15
in English to the Government and 15 in English to the Bank.
D.   Government Assistance to the Survey
33.       The Government is to provide the consultants with:
(a) a list of all relevant laws, decrees, plans, studies, and
budgets; and copies, as may be required;
(b) inventories of transport facilities;
(c) traffic information;
(d) cost and revenue information;
(e) maps and aerial photographs; and



ANNEX 2
Page 9
(f) any other such data as may be reasonably be requested by
the consultants for the purpose of the Survey including any
transport study, feasibility study of any transport project
or analysis or study of projects proposed for the Investment
Plan up to 1978.
34.       The Government is to advise on future developments and also make
available historical information to the consultants on:
(a) population and employment;
(b) Gross National Product;
(c) the opportunity cost of capital;
(d) agricultural, mineral and industrial production;
(e) imports and exports;
(f) price indices; and
(g) foreign exchange rates.
The Government is also to furnish the consultants with all available inform-
ation on the organization, operation and accounting systems of the relevant
Government agencies.
35.       The Government counterpart organization to the consultants is to
be the Transport Planning Authority in the Ministry of Transport and Communi-
cations. In connection with work by the consultants that requires coopera-
tion of other Government agencies, the Government is to provide liaison and
ensure that the consultants have access to all information and are able to
inspect all transport facilities required for the completion of the Survey.
The Government shall assign counterparts as necessary to ensure that the
planning process developed in Phases I and II shall continue after the com-
pletion of consultancy services.
36.       All facilities and support staff required for the Survey will be
procured and hired directly by the consultants. The Government has provided
a cash contribution of LE _ for this purpose. This contribution is reflected
in the local currency ceiling specified in Section _ of this contract.
En   Survey Cost Estimates (not to form part of Terms of Reference)
37.       Estimates of man-months for both phases have been made and are
attached as Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 presents details of salary costs in the
field, home office salary costs, other foreign costs and local costs, while
Table 2 summarizes these costs and adds price contingencies of 15% for for-
eign costs and 10% for local costs. The estimated total foreign exchange
cost is US$1.84 million equivalent and the estimated local cost is US$620,000
equivalent, giving a grand total cost of US$2.46 million for the Survey. Given
the preliminary nature of the estimates of the cost of Phase II of the Sur-
vey, the estimated total cost, including contingencies, should be taken as
US$3.0 million equivalent including foreign exchange of US$2.0 million.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Status and Condition of Railway Property
A. The Network
1.        The ER system consists of a dense network of main and branch lines
in the Nile Delta and only one 896 km main line from Cairo to Aswan with a
few short branches (see maps). In 1966-67, ER operated a total of 3,559
standard gauge route km, of which 2,608 km are single track and 951 km double
track. The 25 km suburban double line in Cairo from Bab El Luq to Helwan is
electrified with 1,500 volts DC. During 1967-1973, 13 km of double route and
382 km of single route were completely destroyed, and 182 km of double route
and 42 km of single route were partially destroyed. A new 350 km single track
line from Helwan to the Bahariya Oasis in the Western Desert has been con-
structed and began operation in January 1974; construction of this new line,
which is serving an iron ore deposit, was financed by the Iron and Steel Or-
ganization and is not yet included in ER's assets.
2.        Government is considering extensive plans for reconstruction of
existing lines in the Suez Canal Zone and new lines in that zone and else-
where; it is the intention of the Government to provide funds for all such
works, but Government should consult the Bank should they wish to embark on
any of these major plans prior to the results of the Transport Study becom-
ing available. The following table gives the details of the proposed line
works and the estimated total cost:

Estimated Cost
(BE '000)
A.   Suez Canal Zone
1.   Repair to damaged sections of existing lines             2,750
2.   Construction of new railway line between Port
Said and El Mansoura to connect Port Said
with the existing network                             15,000
3.   Construction of railway line connecting Cairo
to Suez                                               10,000
4.   Transfer of marshalling yard, freight station
and workshops from existing site in Suez to
the outskirts                                          5,000
5.   Construction of new railway lines joining Embaba
Etai El Baroud line with Cairo Alexandria line
and Cairo Alexandria line with Cairo Suez line         7,500
6.   Extension of Zagazig - Abu Kebeir Shalhia railway
line to Qantara                                        3,000
7.   Construction of a new railway line between Ismalia
and Port Said through the procured land on the
eastern side of Manzala Lake                          12,000
B.  Western Desert Zone
8.   Improvement of the alignment and renewal of
Alexandria-Marsa Matrooh - El Saloum railway line   50,000
C.   Sinai Zone
9.   Construction of new railway lines in the other zones 120,000
225,250
Since funds for all the above works will be provided in full by the Government,
they have been excluded from the proposed Project.
3.        On ER's network, there are 1,171 manned level crossings, 327 unmanned,
and 85 with electric signals; the number of sidings or spurs for industries and
other customers is 928.



ANNEX 6

4.        Maximum permissible axle load for lines on which heavy engines are
allowed to run is 22 tons, occasionally 23.5 tons. Some cars with maximum
axle load of 25 tons are allowed to run on these lines with a speed limita-
tion. Maximum permissible axle load for lines on which light engines only
are allowed to run is 18.5 tons.
B. Track
5.        Essential characteristics of track are given in Table 1.  A substan-
tial part of ER's track is in unsatisfactory condition. On January 1, 1974,
the length of track which had reached its age limit was 1,270 km, while most
branch lines and sidings are overaged or in bad condition. ER has worked out,
in the frame of Phase II of the Investment Program, a track renewal program
at the rate of 250 km annually, out of which 200 km are to be renewed with
new materials (rails, sleepers, fittings, etc.), and 50 km with used service-
aale rails on new sleepers. This would reduce the length of overaged track
as follows:
Length of Track      Length of Track    Length of Track
Having Reached       Approaching Its      Renewed or to
Its Age Limit          Age Limit           Be Renewed
Date                     (km)                  (km)                (km)
June 1972                1,481
December 1972            1,412                    56                 125
December 1973            1,270                   108                 250
December 1974            1,145                   125                 250
December 1975            1,052                   157                 250
December 1976              922                   120                 250
December 1977              827                   155                 250
6.        Acquisition of modern mechanized track relaying equipment, as pro-
vided for in the Project, will permit 100 km annual track renewal, at present
done manually, to be better performed mechanically. While renewing track,
ER will improve alignment so as to be able to increase train speeds; track
condition will also be improved with the adoption of long welded rails laid
on concrete sleepers.

The above statistics for 1972 show that the actual daily average output is
very low.  ER has made a study of the working conditions and general layout
of the yards. This study, based on traffic forecasts, revealed the necessity
of giving priority to improving the marshalling yards at Bulak El Dakrur,
Gabbari and Cairo, and of carrying out a comprehensive development plan for
the establishment of a suitable network of yards.
8.        The original development program included the construction of a
new automatic marshalling yard for the Cairo area with a daily capacity of
4,200 cars with an estimated cost of BE 25 million; however, due to difficul-
ties in finding a suitable place in the congested Cairo area and in buying
necessary land, and also the high cost of construction, ER decided to post-
pone construction of the proposed new Cairo Yard and to carry out a detailed
study taking into account the results obtained in improving the existing mar-
shalling yards. The cost of improving the layout and equipment of the mar-
shalling yards at Bulak El Dakrur, Gabbari and Cairo was estimated at BE
1 million, out of which SE 135,000 is in Phase I of the Investment Program
and iE 865,000 in Phase II. A substantial improvement in ER's operating
efficiency can be expected once the modernization of the most important
existing yards is completed. Consultancy assistance should be considered
for obtaining maximum benefits from the existing and planned improvements
and determining what further construction and/or modernization may be
necessary.

D. Signalling and Telecommunications
9.        The majority of lines in the ER system are equipped with mechanical
signalling and interlocking, electric block instruments on double track lines,
and token block on single track lines. Most of these installations are obsolete
and ER included in the original Investment Program 1971/72-1975/76 the modern-
ization of signalling installations on heavy density traffic sections, as de-
tailed below:
(a) automatic telephone systems (dispatcher lines) for traffic cen-
ters and for the entire ER system;
(b) modification of mechanical signalling installations and intro-
duction of tokenless block;
(c) electric signalling, interlocking and automatic block, Cairo/
Kobri El Leimoun/El Marg-Gabal El Asfer;
(d) electric signalling, interlocking and automatic block Cairo-
Giza and Aussim;
(e) electric signalling, interlocking and automatic block Qualyub-
Benha and Alexandria-Sidi Gaber; and
(f) CTC, electric interlocking and automatic block, Sohag-Nag
Hammadi.
Provision in Credit 284-UAR was only sufficient to cover the cost of installa-
tion of modern signalling on the Cairo/Kobri El Leimoun/El Marg-Gabal El Asfer
section, and on Cairo Giza and Aussim section; these installations are sched-
uled to be completed in October 1976 and December 1975, respectively.
10.       The revised Investment Program includes in its Phase II the con-
tinuation of work on improvement of automatic telephone systems, modifica-
tion of mechanical signalling installations and introduction of tokenless
block. Installation of CTC on the Sohag-Nag Hammadi section has been post-
poned following a detailed study which demonstrates that line capacity will
be sufficient to meet forecast traffic at least to 1977 by increasing the ton-
nage of freight trains and the number of coaches in passenger trains, while
operating the line by tokenless system. Electric signalling, interlocking
and automatic block on the Alexandria/Sidi-Gaber and Qualyub/Benha sections
have also been deferred from Phase II. This is made possible through such
technical measures as: (a) increasing freight train tonnage, (b) increasing
nunmber of coaches in passenger trains, (c) establishing extra blocks, and
(d) constructing additional loops. Consultancy assistance should be considered
for determining future signalling improvements to cope with the expected den-
sity of traffic.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
11,       A main deficiency in ER's telecommunication system is the lack of
railway-owned telephone lines between junctions and major traffic centers.
Therefore, installation of an automatic telephone network over the whole
system has been included in the Investment Program; work has started under
Phase I and will be completed in 1976.
E. Motive Power and Rolling Stock
12.       With the exception of about 40 steam locomotives (due to be phased
out by 1977) and the electrified suburban Helwan line, the ER system is fully
dieselized. Diesel maintenance is generally satisfactory, although periodic-
ally impeded by lack of spare parts due to insufficient allocation of foreign
exchange. Of the 431 diesel main line locomotives, 419 were either built by
General Motors or equipped with General Motors engines, which alleviated
maintenance and spare parts supply.
13.       Long-distance railcars are well maintained.  However diesel and
electric railcars for short distance and commuter traffic and rail buses
are run down because of continuous overcrowding of these underpowered cars
and lack of spare parts; the same may be said of the old wooden body coaches.
14.       A summary of the ER fleet by age groups is given in Table 2.  The
main deficiencies of the freight car stock are:
(a) a high percentage of cars having a capacity of less then
15 tons;
(b) a substantial percentage of cars over 40 years old;
(c)  a large percentage of cars without continuous brake
(vacuum and/or air); and
(d) chain coupling and obsolete bumpers.
However, it is now ER's policy to procure only freight cars of 40 tons capac-
ity or more and equipped with bogies. Most cars ordered for bulk transport
have automatic coupling and air brakes.
15.       The requirements of diesel locomotives, freight cars and passenger
coaches have been re-estimated in the light of the traffic forecast and taking
into account operational needs. Differences between the planned procurement
of motive power and rolling stock under the original 1971/72-1975/76 Invest-
ment Program and the revised Program are shown below:

16.       Calculation 1/ has shown that three additional main line locomotives
are necessary mainly to cope with the anticipated passenger traffic increase.
Out of the 48 main line locomotives, 18 were included in Phase I and were
delivered in October 1973. The 30 remaining locomotives are included in
Phase II. The diesel engines equipping 120 diesel rail buses are overaged
and would need replacement which, however, is impossible as the type of the
existing engines is no longer available. On the other hand, the frame,
bogies, interior equipment, etc., may have another 10 to 15 years of life.
ER considers that a satisfactory solution would be to dismantle the overaged
engines, convert the rail buses to coaches at a low local cost and haul trains
of 4 ex-diesel rail buses with one 1,000 hp diesel locomotive. The price of
one such locomotive is about that of four diesel engines, if available, and
costs of operation and maintenance would be substantially cheaper. Thirty
locomotives of 1,000 hp will thus be required to operate the 120 diesel rail
buses and have been included in Phase II. ER has included in the revised
Investment Program diesel shunting locomotives with 600 IIP instead of 400
HP as initially proposed. The increase in power, while following the gen-
eral trend for shunting engines, is further justified by ER's intention to
1/   Details in Project File.



NAREX 6
Page 8
use these 600 hp locomotives to haul short-distance local trains in addition
to their usual shunting work, thus preventing loss of time to main line diesel
locomotives.
17.       In terms of 4-wheelers, the number of freight cars of various types
included in the original Investment Program was 2,340 units. Calculation 1/
shows that to meet the traffic forecast up to 1977, 3,380 units would in fact
be required; deducting 536 units delivered under Phase I, leaves a balance of
2,844 or 1,420 bogie freight cars. ER reconsidered their proposed program of
scrapping and came to the conclusion that the number of cars to be scrapped
could well be decreased by the equivalent of 600 bogie cars, reducing the
requirements to 820 bogie freight cars which have been included in Phase II.
18.       The revised Investment Program shows a total requirement of passen-
ger coaches of 665 coaches against 730 in the original Program. Deducting
from this number 310 coaches delivered under Phase I leaves a balance of
about 360 coaches; this figure was confirmed by calculation 1/ and included
under Phase II in the revised Investment Program.
F. Repair and Maintenance Facilities
19.       There are seven main workshops in the ER system, as follows:
(a)  Cairo-Bulaq, for major repairs and overhaul of diesel main-
line locomotives and diesel railcar engines; the shop is well
run and efficient; however, facilities were not adequate and
modernization was included in Phase I of the Investment Pro-
gram and is now completed.
(b) Cairo-Bulag, for major repairs and overhaul of passenger
coaches, including bodywork for diesel railcars; this shop
is being reconstructed under Phase I of the Plan and is
40% completed.
(c)  Gabal El Zeitoun (Alexandria), for overhaul and repair of
regular freight cars; this shop, which was constructed about
1900, has now been completely rebuilt at the same site under
Phase I of the Investment Program.
(d) Abu Zabaal, for production of all sorts of spare parts and
overhaul and repair of diesel shunting locomotives and spe-
cial freight cars; the shop was constructed as a steam loco-
motive shop and converted after dieselization into a produc-
tion shop; it includes a foundry, forge and machine shop which
are able to produce even such parts as cylinder liners for
1/   Details in Project File.



ANNEX 6
Page 9
diesel engines to save foreign exchange for imports; the shop
is well run and efficient.
(e) Tura, for overhaul and repair of the 25 electric railcar sets
of the Helwan line; the shop is well equipped and efficient;
it has recently been remodelled and expanded to handle the 25
additional sets for the Helwan line.
(f) El Farz (Cairo), for maintenance and running repairs of all
diesel main line locomotives and diesel railcars in long dis-
tance traffic; the shop has modern facilities and is efficient;
the running repair section has been expanded to handle the
increasing number of locomotives.
(g) Tanta (in the Delta), for maintenance and light repairs of
diesel railcars.
20.       There are several regional shops for maintenance and running repairs
of diesel shunting locomotives, railcars in short distance traffic and passen-
ger and freight cars. ER also operates an electric shop at El Farz for main-
tenance and repair of signalling and telecommunication equipment and appliances.
In addition, ER has two yards at Minya and Tanta for assembly of rail and con-
crete sleeper panels, and one concrete sleeper plant.
21.       Consultancy assistance should be considered for obtaining maximum
benefits from existing and planned improvements in maintenance facilities and
determining what further rationalization and modernization of or additions to
such tacilities iay be necessary.

Internal Resources and Settlement of Mutual Debts
1.        LRE's accounts were reconstructed as at June 30, 1963"., as part of the
appraisal for the First Railway Project.  Accounts tnen currently receivable
anc: payable and various long-standinLc items were segregated. Later, when
Credit 284-UAR was signed in February 1972, the intention was to settle all
new accounts promptly and to clear the long-standing iterds within six months.
However, the situation as reflected in ER's accounts has steadily deteriorated
as shown:
----June 30 -----    -------December 31------
19i63        1972    1972      1973        1974

but, since 1963, increasingly

The greater part of these accounts are receivable frorm or payable to Government
departmenits, agencies and public undertakings.  l1ith prompt settlement, a maxi-
muru of BE 5 million net ER funds should be involved so that ER's resources are
'tied up" unnecessarily to the extent of at least bL 13.5 million, which should
be cleared as soon as possible. In addition to the above accounts, there are
a nurmber of itemis in dispute between ER and the Government which should be
settled, any cash benefit to ER being dependent upon the decision on each item.

2.        It is recognized that this problem, is not confined to ER and that
thie Ministry of Finance has sought information to enable a general settlement
of mutual debts to be made, presumably requiring budgetary provisions. ER
will, however, require substantial internal resources to finance the local
currencv element of the proposed Second Railway Project, and the following
net inflow should be obtained front any settlement:
1975           -          LE  5 million
1976            -         EL 10 r,illion
1977    -   up to    -   bE  5 million
3.        If the settlement involves a net inflow to ER exceeding LE 20 mil-
lion, the excess could be settled in 1978 and subsequent years by installments
not exceeding BE 5 million.  An essential condition to any settlement should
be a requirement that all future accounts slhould be settled within two months
of incurrence of the debt.

APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Main Assumptions Used in Financial Evaluation
Traffic
1.        Freight and passenger traffic forecasts prepared by ER and summa-
rized in Annex 4 (Sheet 2).
Operating Revenue
2.        Based on traffic forecasts (except for freight traffic which for
1974 and 1975 is discounted by 10% and for 1976 by 4%) evaluated at existing
tariffs plus increases of 7.5% (average) effective July 1, 1975 and again on
January 1, 1977, and on July 1, 1978. The incidence of the increases on
freight, passenger and other traffic would depend on availability of cost
information but the following have been included for calculation purposes:
July 1, 1975 January 1, 1977 July 1, 1978
 __________________% -------------------
Freight                   10                8              7.5
Passenger                  5                7.5            7.5
Other                     10               10              7.5
Revenue so calculated for 1977 has been reduced by bE 1 million (BE 0.5 mil-
lion each for freight and passenger traffic).
3.        The tariff increases in the forecasts are to meet forecast increased
costs (para. 4), and correspondingly higher tariff increases would be neces-
sary if cost contingencies exceed expectations.
Operating Expenditure
4.        ER's forecasts are accepted for 1974.  For subsequent years ER's
forecasts of working expenses are increased by the following percentages to
provide for expected price changes in excess of ER's assumptions:
Wages          4% per annum (7% including about 3% provided
by ER)
Fuel           Nil
Other Materials 1975, 12%; 1976, 10%; 1977, 8%; 1978, 7%;
1979, 6%.
Other expenses   5% per annum



ANNEX 14
Page 2
5.        Depreciation charged at 3.2% of average gross fixed assets for
1975 and subsequent years. This is equivalent to an average service life of
about 30 years. The charges, compared with ER's forecast, show a total in-
crease of BE 7.3 million, as follows:
ER        Annex 13
--- LE million ---
1975            8.8           8.7
1976            9.4           9.8
1977            9.9          11.0
Project period   28.1           29.5
1978           10.5          12.8
1979           10.7          14.3
Total    49.3          56.6
Net Operating Revenue
6.        Net operating revenue, before charging interest, compares with ER's
forecast as follows:
ER       Annex 13
--- EE million --
1975            10.8         8.8
1976            12.0        11.3
1977            12.9        14.6
Project period       35.7        34.5
1978            14.0        16.7
1979            15.7        18.4
Total     65.4        69.6
ER's forecasts are without tariff increases to compensate for inflation.
Cash From Operations
7.        Net operating revenue and depreciation provide a cash flow from
operations which compares with ER's forecasts as follows:



ANNEX 14
Page 3
ER        Annex 15
--- BE million ---
1975            19.6        17.5

1977           22.8         25.6
Project period       63.8         64.2
1978            24.5        29.5
1979            26.4        32.7
Total    114.7        126.4
ER's forecasts are without tariff increases to compensate for inflation.
Debt Service
8.        Terms of existing debts, including IDA Credit 284-UAR on-lent from
the Government to ER.
9.        The proposed IBRD loan of US$30.5 million to ER (excluding US$2
million for the Transport Survey) at an interest rate of 8-1/2% per annum
with repayment over 25 years including a 4-year grace period. Parallel fi-
nancing from bilateral sources on terms shown in Table 1 of this Annex,
which, on average, are not less favorable than the terms of the proposed
Bank loan.
10.       Total debt service (excluding 2% return on Government equity)
compares with ER's forecast as follows:
ER        Annex 15
--- LE million ---
1975           1.7          3.1
1976          2.0           5.2
1977          2.5           7.2
Project period      6.2          15.5
1978          5.1           9.4
1979          6.8          10.7
Total   18.1          35.6
Capital Expenditure
11.       For the project period, estimates based on early-1974 prices with
the following price contingencies added:



ANNEX 14
Page 4
(a) for local currency expenditures -
1974-79         10% p.a.
(b)  for foreign currency expenditures -
1974      14%
1975      12%
1976      10%
1977       8%
Capital expenditure estimates of BE 30 million and BE 35 million for 1978
and 1979 respectively, as shown in the Cash Flow (Annex 15) and incorporated
in the Balance Sheet (Annex 16), are in broad terms only and assume a normal
program of about half the project rate for the main rehabilitation program,
or about BE 20 million at early 1974 prices with contingencies at about
10% p.a.
Exchange Rate
12.       Foreign exchange rate of BE 0.4 to US$1 (BE 1 = US$2.50 used as
nearest convenient figure to official rate of BE 1 = US$2.56).

/I  Fixed assets are shown at historical cost according to ER's 1973 Balance Sheet with subsequent additions at cost shown in Annexes 9 (1974)
and 10 (1975-77) less: (i) amounts for capital spaces uich are included as additLons to surking capital (see Note 3 below); and (ii) amounts
for consultancy services whieh are deducted from Reserves (see Note 6 below). For eapital expenditure in 1978 and 1979 see Annex 14, para 11,
/2  Other non-current assets include debts Iong-ourstanding from Government departments and agencies of which setleIments are assumed to be
FE 15 million in 1975, FE 25 million in 1976, and FE 10 million in 1977. The further reductions of bE 10.2 million in 1976 and hE 16.9 million
in 1978 represent settlement of remaining deferred assets (see Note 4 for corresponding note on deferred liabilities).
/3 Working capital increases com.prise normal additions (due to inflation etc.) as shown in the Cash Flow, Annex 15, and augmentation of capital
spares (see Nate I above). In 1976 bE 3 million is assumed to be written off inve.ntoies so account of disposal of obsolete stores with a corres-
ponding reduction in net revenue surplue transferred to Reserves (see also Note 3 to the Cash Plow, Annex 15).
/4  Defereed liabilities include debts long-outstanding to Government departments and agencies of which settlements are assumed to be RE 10 million in
1975, RE 15 million in 1976, and RE 5 million in 1977. The further reductions of RE 10.2 million in 1976, RE 5.7 million in 1977, and bE 19.2 million
in 1978, represent settlement of remaining deferred liabilities (see Note 2 for co-responding note on deferred assets).
/I Government assistance is assumed to be in loan form but could be additions to equity (see also Note 6 to the Cash Flow, Annex 15).
1r Reserve are increased by the ansual net surpluses (Annen 13) less: (i) annual payments of RE 2.4 million to Governmeet as a 2% return or equity:
(ii) cost of consultancy services not capitalized; and (iii) amounts written off for obsolete stores. In 1977 and 1978 reserves are increased by
Fg 5.7 million and RE 2.3 million respeotivaly being the excess of remaining deferred liabilities over remaining defetred assets resulting from
the settlements referred to in Notes 2 and 4 above.  These net settlements are not expected to involve cash transfers.
/7  Without envarse of RE 84.5 million of Government debt into equity in 1973, the ratio would have been 47/53.
