PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
SECOND TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1698-IVC)
PREFACE
This is the completion report (PCR) for the Second Tourism
Development Project in Cote d'Ivoire for which Loan 1698-IVC was approved
on May 15, 1979 in the amount of US$14.2 million. The loan was closed on
December 30, 1988 following three extensions of the Closing Date; final
disbursement was made on July 26, 1989, and the undisbursed amount of
US$46,040 was cancelled with effect from that date.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Occidental and Central Africa Department, of the Africa Regional Office and
is based, inter alia, on documents contained in project files, Staff
Appraisal Report, President's Report, the Loan Agreement, supervision
reports, consultant studies, and correspondence between the Bank and
Borrower, information provided by staff involved with the project during
its execution, and a PCR mission to Cote d'Ivoire in March 1989.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft was se,nt to the Borrower on September 25, 1990, for comments by
November 13, 1990, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
SECOND TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1698-IVC)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A. Obiectives
1.        The objective of the Second Tourism Development Project was to foster the
development of tourism in C8te d'Ivoire as a means of helping the diversification
of the economy, and as a source of income, employment and foreign exchange earnings.
It was also expected to continue and expand the institution building effort started
under the First Tourism Project (Loan 1124-IVC). To achieve these objectivas the
project, as originally conceived, consisted of (i) a line of credit to Credit de
C6te d'ivoire (CCI) for hotel financing; (ii) a wildlife program to improve the
Azagny National Park; and (iii) a technical assistance program for tourism sector
institutions. A program to rehabilitate the Comoe National Park (CNP) was added
to the project in early 1985, to utilize the uncommitted loan balance (paras 2.02,
2.03, and 2.08).
B. Implementation Experience
2.        At the close of the project, 18 hotels had been approved for financing
through the line of credit. The 18 hotels, all in operation, comprise 1,030 rooms,
some 270 rooms fewer than the appraisal target of 1,300. Construction costs and
financing terms agreed at the time of individual sub-project appraisals remained
well within the original estimates in the case of Small and Medium Hotels (SMH),
whereas original estimates of design and costs were greatly exceeded in the case
of five of the largest hotels. Due to implementation delay and lack of coherent
commitment to the project's objectives, the Azagny National Park was completed
behind schedule.   The rehabilitation program of the Comoe National Park was
satisfactorily completed (paras 3.01-3.07).
C. Results
3.        The appraisal assumptions which forecasted hotel needs were rendered
invalid by the adverse economic developments of the 1980s in Cote d'Ivoire. The
result has been a combination of mutually reinforcing negative factors for the hotel
industry: an oversupply of hotels in the country, low occupancies, and financial
losses exacerbated by poor managerial conditions (paras 3.10-3.12).
4.        The selection of CCI as the Government agency responsible for the line
of credit component, without a strong institutional building element, played a
crucial role in the poor financial results of the project: by January 31, 1989 only
151 of actual amounts due was repaid, despite a technical assistance and training
program which was initiated under the project in 1987 to correct the managerial
and financial deficiencies of the SMH.   During the project period, CCI faced
mounting financial difficulties in all of the sectors where it was involved and
became insolvent. It is now being liquidated (paras 3.13-3.14).



- vi -
5.        As a result of a lack of decision on the part of the Government, the
Azagny National Park, the buildings and equipment provided under the project remain
unused.  A Park Directorate has been set up to manage the Comoe National Park
(paras 3.16-3.17).
6.        The technical assistance provided under the project was well done, but
its effectiveness has been limited because the Government has not induced hotel
operators to use the accounting and managerial procedures developed under this
component (paras 3.18 and 5.01).
Sustainability and Reevaluation
7.        The hotels face several short-term problems, which if attended to, might
result in their viability in the long term. Sustainability of the Parks depends
on the Government's capacity to properly operate thew (paras 3.19 and 3.20).
8.        The reevaluation of the line of credit to hotels suggests that it is most
likely to be negative. The same applies to the Azagny National Park because it is
not open to visitors.   The principal justification for the Parks lies in the
environmental and ecological benefits (paras 4.01-4.04).
Findings and Lessons Learned
9.        The technical assistance consultants did an excellent job in diagnosing
the problem being experienced by the hotels (para 5.01).
10.       The Borrower's performance was mixed.  Performance on implementation of
physical works was consistently good. The main areas of weakness were failure to
(i) follow through the technical and training program to strengthen hotel
management; (ii) monitor CCI's debt recovery performance; and (iii) hand over the
management of the Azagny Park facilities to a private enterprise (paras 6.01-6.02).
11.       As regards the Bank's performance, the appraisal did not adequately assess
the risks involved, and supervision was unsatisfactory. There are indications that
a more timely intervention and sustained follow-up by the Bank could have had a
positive influence on the mounting financial and managerial problems facing the main
executing agency, CCI (paras 7.01 and 8.04).
12.       In retrospect,  the inclusion of environmental considerations in the
project, through the rehabilitation of two important national parks (Azagny and
Comoe), contributed to the long-run economic development of C6te d'Ivoire
(para 8.03).
13.       The project has had a catalytic effect in reviving the Government's
interest in further development of the tourism sector (para 8.06).
14.       Main  lessons  learned  are  the  following:    (a) responsibility  for
administering a line of credit should only be given to a competent Borrower agency,
or provision should be included in the project for a strong institutional building
element to strengthen the agency; and (b) the Bank should avoid financing projects
in a sector in which it plans to discontinue lending operations, unless it is
prepared to make adequate provision for supervision (para 8.07).



REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
SECOND TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1698-IVC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The success of the first tourism project (Loan 1124-IVC, PCR dated June
24, 1983) lay in its attempt to diversify the economy and create income generating
opportunities, employment and foreign exchange earnings. Built on the experience
in the first project, the second tourism project was conceived as the last of two
interventions in the sector. It was, unfortunately, launched at the time when the
Bank was ending its direct involvement in tourism lending, and tourism staff were
being re-deployed to other areas.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The Second Tourism Development Project was prepared and appraised during
a period of favorable macro-economic and market prospects, particularly in Abidjan.
Bednights in Abidjan's classified hotels increased at an average of 13.72 per year
between 1970 and 1977, a period of dynamic economic performance (with GNP growth
of over 102 during 1976 and 1977, and real growth of import-export volumes averaging
6.42 during 1971-1976).  Overall room occupancy rates, which stood at 652 in 1974,
had in 1977, reached 77Z in the 4- to 5-star categories and 89Z ir -*'ie 3-star and
below category.   These figures under-state overall potential demand,  as many
visitors were turned away due to lack of space. By the early 1980s, the Government
had identified the need for an additional 2,892 beds or 1,055,700 bednights in
Abidjan alone through 1984 (i.e. in addition to those then under construction or
firmly programmed and financed). Moreover, an additional 1,000 rooms were estimated
as needed for beach-based tourism. There was also a shortage of hotels in the 1-
and 2-star category catering largely to Ivorians and visiting Africans. The second
tourism project was expected to satisfy these needs.
Proiect Objectives
2.02      An important objective of the second project was to foster the development
of tourism in COte d'Ivoire as a means of diversifying foreign exchange earnings
and creating employment.    It was  also expected to continue  and expand the
institution building effort started under the first project.
Project Description
2.03      As defined at appraisal, and described in the loan agreement, the Bank
loan of US$14.2 million provided for the following components:
(a) a line of credit to CCI for long-term debt financing of a portion of the
foreign exchange cost of hotel construction (US$12.0 million);
(b) a wildlife protection program (US$1.0 million); and
(c) a technical assistance program for tourism sector institutions (Ministry
of Water and Forests (MWF), Credit de COte d'Ivoire (CCI), the Office
National du Tourisme (ONT) and SIETHO (US$1.2 million).



2.04      The sum of US$12 million was to be onlent to CCI on the same terms as
the Bank loan, to provide long-term debt financing for a portion (62Z) of the
foreign exchange costs of a country-wide 1979-84 hotel construction program
comprising 1,300 hotel rooms in Abidjan and 20n rooms in the interior.   CCI's
exposure to any one client was expected to be limited to 252 of its net worth.
Equity was expected to come predominantly frcn private sources. Sub-projects were
to have a debt service coverage covenant to limit acquisition of significant
additional debt. Additional cofinancing was to be supplied via medium-term funds,
most of which were to come from Central Bank rediscounts.   The interest rate
structure included a one percent fee for CCI to compensate the Government for taking
the foreign exchange risk on Bank funds.
2.05      The sum of US$1 million was to finance the foreign exchange component
of a rehabilitation program to preserve the wildlife and delicate ecological balance
of the Azagny National Reserve while opening it up to tourists. The program, based
on the recommendations of a study conducted by German technical assistance,
consisted of clear demarcation of the area, construction of facilities and civil
works to make the park accessible and entertaining to tourists, and equipment and
vehicles for effective surveillance of the park.
2.06      Finally, a total of US$1.2 million was earmarked to finance 156 man-months
of technical assistance to ONT, SIETHO, MWF, and CCI.
2.07      The total project cost, including taxes of TJS$0.1 million, was estimated
at US$63.6 million which included contingencies of US$14.7 million. The estimated
foreign exchange con ant of the project was estimated at US$39.5 million. Project
implementation was to be financed by the Bank, the Government of COte d'Ivoire,
financial intermediaries and the private sector in the proportion of 22?, 2?, 43Z
and 33X, respectively.
Amendments
2.08      By mid-1982, when all the hotel sub-projects had been approved, and a
sizeable outstanding balance was left due to the strength of the US dollar to the
CFAF, plans were being made for the reallocation of undisbursed funds. In May 1985,
after preliminary design and cost estimates were drawn up, the Government of Cote
d'Ivoire (GOCI) formally requested a reallocation to help finance a program to
rehabilitate the Comoe National Park, the largest natural protected area in West
Africa.   n is request for the uncommitted loan balance of US$3.0 million was
approved ..a January 1986 for a program estimated to cost US$4.2 million (CFAF 1.4
billion). The corresponding sections of the loan agreement (Sections 3.11, 3.12,
and 3.13) were amended in October 1986 to include institutional arrangements,
staffing, financing and protective measures to sustain preservation of the Park.
The Closing Date was postponed to December 31, 1987 to allow for this new component
to be executed. The additional program expected to take 18 months (July 1986 to
January 1988) comprised the following components:
(a) infrastructure improvement and renovation of about 700 km of Park tracks;
(b)  reorganization  and  strengthening  of  park  management,   including
establishment of a single administrative entity (BAPNER) responsible for
Park management and protection in the entire country; and



(c)  park-related  development of peLipheral  zones  carried out  in close
collaboration with local administrative structures and agricultural
extension services.
Proiect Design and Organization
2.09      The project is noteworthy for including in its design environmental
preservation components and its attempt to transform two of the cotntry's wildlife
concentrations into tourism assets. It appears, however, that delays in the start-
up of The Azagny Park component exacerbated the poaching activities and illegal
cultivation; by the time the component got underway there was a marked reduction
in the once fertile concentration of fauna in Azagny.
2.10      In terms of objectives, the staff appraisal report (SAR) appears to be
internally inconsistent in its own assessment of the country's tourism potential.
On the one hand, it acknowledged that C8te d'Ivoire had little potential for mass
vacation tourism because of, inter alia, high transport costs from the main tourist
generating countries, costly services in the country, poor climate and mostly unsafe
beaches. Moreover, the few hotels in the interior (with the exception of the Club
Mediterranne) catering to tourists were already experiencing very low occupancy
rates at the time of appraisal.  The Government-owned company (SIETHO) in charge
of several of these hotels in the interior lost about US$2 million in 1977, and
expectations for improvements were dim.  Indeed, the company was liquidated in
December 1984. In spite of this bleak context, the SAR explicitly stated as one
of its principal objectives the encouragement of the growth of vacation tourism.
This objective in itself was in conflict with the package of hotels that were
finally constructed, viz., those in the 1- and 2-star categories which cater
basically to local and African businessmen and transiting Ivorians.
2.11      The late decision to include a rehabilitation program for the Comoe
National Park appears in retrospect to have been a very sound one. The principal
justification for the program lay in the environmental and ecological benefits to
be derived ftom protecting and preserving the Park from a process of severe
degradation.  The program has helped to avert problems which, in the long run,
could have affected the important agricultural activities downstream from the Comoe
river basin.   As the largest natural protected area in West Africa, the Comoe
National Park is registered on the world heritage list of UNESCO.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Line of Credit to CCI
3.01      After an initial slow start-up due to delays in signing the sub-loan
agreement between Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAM) and CCI, the pace of the
project accelerated. Selection of candidates for technical positions took place by
November 1979 and commitments for hotel sub-projects amounting to about 60X of the
line of credit were at an advanced stage of preparation. By mid 1982, some 14 hotel
sub-projects totalling 848 rooms were approved; 4 were already operational and
US$7.54 million had been committed. Sub-loan approvals slowed thereafter due to
uncertainties in the market outlook. There had been a decline in the number of
room-nights occupied (-4Z), combined with an increase in the number of available
room-nights (22.9%) resulting in an overall average occupancy decline from 81% in
1979 to 63% in 1980.  It is significant to note that the decline of the hotel
industry in the early 1980s has not been reversed since, and this has had an adverse



-4-
impact on profitability and debt servicing capacity of the hotels.   They were
additionally hurt by macro-austerity measures taken by the GOCI during project
implementation, viz: (i) elimination of the use of hotels as a sour;e of long-term
occupancy by foreign experts; and (ii) elimination of incentives for government
employees to use hotels. Concerns about long-term viability caused the Bank to halt
sub-project approvals in 1982 until a then ongoing study on market trends was
completed. A stipulation in the Project Agreement that all commitments be made
before December 31, 1982 had to be postponed by one year. Construction once again
resumed in 1983 but with less intensity.
3.02      At the close of the project, 18 hotels had been approved for financing
through the line of credit.  The 18 hotels comprise 1,030 rooms, some 270 rooms
fewer than the appraisal target of 1,300. Average investment cost per room stood
at CFAF 14.4 million (compared with appraisal estimates of CFAF 7.8 million, in 1978
prices), ranging from CFAF 3.3 million to CFAF 24.9 million; but only 5 of the 18,
all in Abidjan (the Hilton, Le Wafou, the two Ibis Hotels and the Hibiscos) exceeded
a unit cost of CFAF 7.8 million per room.  On the other hand, actual occupancy
rates for the Tanoe, Kleh, Hilton, and Le Wafou hotels in 1986/87 only reached 12X,
21X, 52Z and 65Z, respectively, far below the appraisal estimates of average annual
occupancies of about 751.
3.03      Construction costs and financing terms agreed at the time of individual
sub-project appraisals remained well within the original estimates in the case of
the small hotels with individual ownership. Hotels with a more complex ownership
an" management pattern tended to exceed original estimates of design and costs and
this. compounded by worsened macro-economic factors, continues to seriously affect
their financial performance.
Azagnv National Wildlife Park
3.04      Start-up of this ccmponent was slowed by Government's delay in giving
the Azagny game reserve national park status, largely due to misunderstandings
between the MWF and the Ministry of Agriculture about criteria for the resettlement
of farmers (evaluation of eviction costs).  Effectiveness finally took place on
April 2, 1981, about one year after loan effectiveness. This component experienced
a cost overrun of 48Z and a time overrun of one year.
3.05      The following major physical achievements were accomplished: buildings
(a reception area, a restaurant, 16 bungalows); about 41 km of rural tracks and
trails leading to waterways permitting access (by land and water) to the difrerent
islands in the forest; observation posts; and surveillance equipment.
3.06      A good education campaign conducted by the field staff of a supervising
unit created in 1981 within MWF, sensitized farmers to the resettling program and
led to a relatively smooth resettling process. This campaign was strongly supported
by MWF and local administrative and political officials.   Compensation for the
affected families was Fet by interministerial order.
Comoe National Park
3.07      This component (para 2.08) aimed to promote protection of the Park and
controlled development of its long-term tourist potential by improving its
infrastructure and surveillance, strengthening park management, and developing
peripheral areas to involve the local population in park management and development.
This component was responsible for the third closing date extension to finalize the
program of infrastructure improvements carried out by local contractors through



-5
November 1988.  Supervision of works was done by the Direction et Controle des
Grands Travaux (DCGTx), and the program was satisfactorily completed.
Costs and Disbursements
3.08      Project costs at appraisal and completion are shown in Annex 2.  Final
costs overran the appraisal estimate by about 152. Disbursements ran behind the
appraisal estimate,  .at eventually all but US$0.05 million was disbursed.   The
remaining balance was cancelled effective July 28, 1989 (Annex 3).
Project Results
(a) Hotel Development
3.09      All 18 hotel sub-projects began operation at varying dates between 1981
and 1985 (Table 1 below).   Total investment costs amounted to about CFAF 14.9
billion (US$67.5 million equivalent) with a World Bank participation of US$8.4
million, or 12% (versus 20% at appraisal) and CCI participation of 19z.

3.10      Annexes 1 and la highlight statistics on operating performance of selected
project hotels.   The lack of consistent data provided by the public agencies
involved in the project and by the hoteliers themselves (in some cases a complete
absence of data) precludes a coherent analysis of the operating results. From the
available statistics, a number of reasons become apparent to explain the discrepancy
between appraisal projections and actual operating performance. First of all, the
SAR based its projections on a linear extrapolation of earlier favorable trends



-6
(1974-1977) when GDP grew at 6.5Z annually. This high growth had been fueled by
unusually favorable international prices for the country's main exports, sizeable
increases in foreign capital inflows, and multilateral and bilateral technical
assistance programs which were, in that period, at a peak. The SAR failed to fully
consider project sensitivities to negative country economic performance which
materialized shortly after project implementation.
3.11      Financial Results.  The main sources of data for the ex-post financial
analysis of the hotels are the unaudited profit and loss statements prepared by
individual hotels and submitted to the Ministry of Tourism.   Only five hotels
submitted this information in a consistent manner; others presented the data on
a partial year basis, while still others refused to present any data. The quality
of information can only be considered as fair to poor.   Their true financial
situation is, thus, unknown.
3.12      Annex 4 summarizes the results of the first two and three years of
operation of five selected hotels (selection based on availability of data and
consistency of presentation).   A striking feature of the financial performance of
these hotels is the low and declining level of free cash flow available to them even
when one considers that there has been no provision for depreciation, nor for
regular maintenance. Moreover, loan repayment amounts reported by the hotels do
not reflect the high level of arrears owed to CCI based on CCI's data.   The
financial viability of these hotels is not sustainable, particularly given the fact
that the market situation continues to be weak; chances of generating operating
profits in the future to assure a reasonable return appear to be small.
3.13      Loan Repayments to CCI.  CCI's portfolio of loan delinquencies worsened
under the line of credit provided under the Second Tourism Project, compared to the
First Project. By March 31, 1986, the total amount cumulatively due amounted to
CAF 3.8 billion (about US$10.6 million) of which CFAF 3.1 billion (about US$8.6
million) or 81.1Z had not been paid. Table 2 below highlights the worsened status
of loan repayments (on the second line of credit only) through January 1989. Only
15Z of actual amounts due at January 31, 1989 was repaid. Five of the hotels have
not been able to service their debts at all and none of them is up to date on
payments.   It is important to point out, nevertheless,  that the delinquency
situation was not unique to the hotels only, but pervaded CCI's entire sectoral
portfolio of loans (real estate, commerce, industry, SMH, etc.). As stated in a
1984 Bank financial  sector mission report,  CCI  suffered not only from weak
accounting and auditing systems, but from inadequate supetrision of loans, low
capacity to recover bad and doubtful loans, and inability to initiate adequate legal
procedures.   Because of the mounting financial difficulties which plagued CCI
throughout the project (see financial indicators in Annex 5), the agency became
insolvent. As a result, CCI is now being liquidated.
3.14      A Technical and Training program for (SMH) assistance program initiated
in 1987 under the project, correctly diagnosed the financial condition of the
hotels, identifying a number of important physical, managerial and financial
constraints and recommending measures to be taken that could potentially lead them
to financial viability (Annex 5).   Due to the lack of dissemination of these
findings, however, and the absence of an effective ongoing program of support and
technical assistance, in addition to the country's rapidly deteriorating economic
situation, many hotels remain incapable of turning around their financial situation.
The larger hotels, however, took a number of initiatives to address their
difficulties.  The Hilton hotel, for instance, together with its commercial bankers
engaged Coopers and Lybrand to diagnose its financial problems, determine the debt-
servicing capacity of the owning company, and make recommendations concerning



possible rescheduling of its debt. Despite the merits of these efforts, Hilton's
liquidity and broader financial difficulties appeared to be too entrenched to turn
it around, and led it to be put to auction in November 1989. Similarly, Accor, the
managers of Novotel and the two Ibis Hotels, prepared ten-year financial projections
which showed that viability could only be achieved by a combination of arrangements,
including additional capital to bring debt service up-to-date, consolidation of
remaining debt into a new 12-year loan, extension of the "agrement prioritaire"
providing seven additional years of tax holiday, and the managing company delaying
its fee derived from the gross operating profits until such time as such profits
exceeded an agreed threshold. It is probable that the financial situation of these
hotels may worsen, however, in the face of a rapidly worsening economic outlook,
as it has an important bearing on occupancy rates and by extension, profitability.

3.15      An important reason for the inability of hotels to repay CCI is the
excess of supply of rooms over demand throughout the country.   Average room
occupancy rates for hotels in the 3- to 5-star category have been on a constant
decline from 73% and 82% in 1975 and 1976 to 41% and 43% in 1984 and 1985,
stabilizing at about 452 annually during 1986-1988. Even lower levels are expected
in view of the economic crisis of 1989-90. These levels are considerably below the
break-even occupancy of about 60Z (estimated at appraisal) for the larger hotels
at average room rates of US$45.  Because of competitive pressures and declining
demand, it is unlikely that average room prices could be raised. Also occupancy



-8-
rates can be expected to increase only relatively slowly, since business traffic,
less volatile than tourist traffic, predominates. Accordingly, and taking into
account the ;.4me needed for the resumption of growth of the Ivorian economy, it may
take at least 10 to 15 years for most hotels to approach viability, to service all
debt, make adequate allowance for depreciation; then provisions could be made for
return to investors.   Even this rmodest scenario is unlikely to materialize, as
problems related to neglect of maintenance would require additional investment in
rehabilitation. Rescheduling of most hotel debt seems to be an inevitable short-
term solution.

suffered from a lack of decision on the part of the Government. Whereas experienced
hoteliers, managing a nearby hotel, were ready to promote and fully exploit the
potentials of hotel facilities at the park site, MWF failed to respond positively
to their proposals because of political interferences. As a result, the buildings
and equipment at the park remain unused, and are deteriorating rapidly.
3.17      A single administrative entity, the Park Directorate, was set up in Bouna
to manage the Comoe National Park, while a support unit (BAPNER) reporting directly
to the MWF was set up in Abidjan as part of the cabinet reorganization in July 1986.
This unit did not become functional until March 1988 by enactment of the related
decree; fortunately, this did not affect the pace of execution, nor the quality of
the high priority civil works done at the Park.
{c) Technical Assistance and Training
3.18      The results of the project's technical assistance were adequate (Annex
7); staff of the main executing agencies (MWF, SIETHO, ONT and CCI) were trained
in project appraisals and lending for hotel operations, which helped to quicken the
pace of implementation. The technical assistance introduced late in the project
was effective in accomplishing its objective: to improve accounting and management
procedures of the individual hotels and also to reduce the delinquency rate in the
repayment of CCI's hotel loans. A program of dissemination and further support and
technical assistance needs to be launched urgently to implement the recommendations
of the Technical and Training SMH Program, including training of unskilled hotel
owners/managers.
Profitability of the Project
3.19      The hotels face several short-te.m problems, which if attended to, might
result in their viability in the long-term.   Hotel owners in three cases are
untrained in hotel management and operations and maintenance in all aspects; they
are basically weak entrepreneurs. This lack of know-how is reflected in laxity in
record-keeping, and poor environmental and sanitary conditions. Hotel employees
would benefit from basic training in hotel operations. Related to the above is the
lack of a long-term objective of attaining adequate financial returns on the initial
investment as well as an appreciation of the need to   aqtately maintain fixed
assets.  This is particularly true in the 1- and 2-sta  ho *ls in the interior,
where accelerated deterioration of the buildings is a major constraint to future
viability. Considering that hotels are subject to obsolescence caused in addition
by customers' changing tastes, depreciation and obsolescence allowances should be
included in large amounts in the accounts of these hotels not only for capital
improvements but also to maintain earning power. Many hotels, however, have little
or no maintenance budgets.



-9-
3.20      Sustainability of the Parks depends upon the Government's capacity to
take the necessary steps to properly operate them. This would require budgetary
resources to implement a program for promotion and revitalization of the sites,
continued development of wildlife, and introduction of a fee structure to generate
recurrent income for regular maintenance. Such a program must be coordinated with
a plan to fully exploit the potentials of hotel facilities at the park sites,
including management by hoteliers experienced in tourism promotion. The GOCI must
also address critical off-site constraints of difficult road access.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
(a) Hotels
4.01      The ex post economic rate of return (ERR) on the hotel sub projects have
not been quantified because of the paucity and poor quality of the data available
for this analysis, but the operational performance discusbed below suggests that
the ex post ERR would most likely be negative.  Firstly, the ex ante return was
based on incremental revenues derived from foreign tourists. As depicted in Table
3 below, the levels of foreign visitor arrivals stagnated in the 1980s and by 1987
the total number of foreign arrivals fell below their 1978 levels. What is even
more significant is the change in the origin of the arrivals:  while Europeans
dominated the number of arrivals to C8te d'Ivoire from 1978 to 1982, this pattern
changed thereafter with the number of Africans arriving in the country either being
equal or in excess of the number of Europeans.   The implications here are that
incremental foreign exchange earnings have been greatly diminished because of the
reduced number of European visitors.

Secondly, hotel occupancies dropped to 35.4Z in 1984, and remained depressed
thereafter (table 4), whereas the optimum occupancy rate, computed as the one at

which the ERR on a marginal addition to hotel capacity was just equal the
opportunity cost of capital (11Z), was set at 72.8Z at appraisal.

(b) Azagnv National Wildlife Park
4.02      The fundamental ex ante economic justification for investing in the
Azagny Park was the generation of revenues in excess of the resources necessary to
establish and maintain it, and to install and operate supporting tourism facilities.
The medium-term demand forecast in the SAR envisaged 6,500 visitors per year by
1985; by the year 2000 the total number of visitors was expected to reach 22,000,
of whom 15,000 are expected to come from abroad. Incremental revenues to the park
administration were estimated to be US$160,000 per year resulting from the entry
fee of US$7. Further economic benefits were expected to be derived from visitor
spending on overnight stays and food and drink consumption in the visitor center
(US$28 per visitor), on boat rides (US$6 per visitor), on guide services (US$2 per
visitor), on the purchase of souvenirs and on transport (US$20 per person) to and
from the park.   On the basis of the economic cost and benefit streams and an
economic life of 20 years (no residual value taken into account) the internal
economic rate of return was estimated at 16.5Z.
4.03      Unfortunately, there have been no visitors to the Azagny National Park,
and hence no recurrent revenues are being generated, and given the fact that
recurrent sums are being spent on operation and maintenance, the economic rate of
return is likely to be negative.   The Azagny investment can only be justified
qualitatively for the ecological and environmental gains to the country. In the
long term, maintenance has to be encouraged through adequate recurrent funding.
To attract tourists to the park, road access has to be improved. In addition, given
the vast decrease in the wildlife population, a program has to be introduced to
encourage multiplication of the remaining animals or the introduction of new
species.  Significant environmental and cultural gains could then accrue to the
country from preserving one of the few remaining examples of West African swamp and
rain forest habitats which could offer a full range of the original species of flora
and fauna.



- 11 -
(c) Comoe National Park
4.04      The principal justification for the rehabilitation of the Park lay in the
environmental and ecological benefits to be derived from protecting and preserving
the Park from a process of severe degradation which also in the long run could have
adversely affected important agricultural activities downstream from the Comoe river
basin.
V. CONSULTANTS' PERFORMANCE
5.01      Consultants hired to help improve the accounting and management procedures
did an excellent job in diagnosing the reasons for high delinquencies being
experienced by most of the project hotels. Based on their findings, they drew up
a hotel operating manual for use as both a training instrument and for day-to-day
use in each hotel.   The manual is a competent and comprehensive document; its
effectiveness has been limited, however, by the lack of vigor with which individual
hotel operators are induced to use it by the Government agencies in charge of
monitoring them.
VI. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
6.01      Performance of CCI was generally poor.  While the agency was efficient
in disbursing loans for hotel construction, it revealed gross incapacity to monitor
and follow-up on its loans and did not meet its obligations under the Project
Agreement, as noted in Annex 8. Lax management was also reflected in CCI's neglect
in carrying out the recommendations of the technical assistance and advice financed
under the project aimed at steering the small hotels toward financial viability.
6.02      Borrower performance on implementation of physical works was consistently
good even at the end during the rehabilitation of the Comoe National Park component.
There, despite difficulty in getting rehabilitation works carried out in a remote
part of the country, the task was efficiently performed.   Even the difficult
institutional aspects, i.e., establishing a separate administrative agency for
managing and protecting the Park, were done well even though late.   The Borrower
has, however, been lax in not turning over management of the Azagny Park to a
competent experienced management company; instead, lengthy delays have occurred,
caused by conflict of interest and political interference.
VII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank's performance has to be viewed in the context of the position
of the tourism sector within the iank at the time of project design and
implementation. During the mid-1970s discussions were well advanced about the fate
of tourism lending in the Bank. A decision was taken in 1979 to phase out Bank
tourist sector operations and, by the start of the project, the Tourism Department
was about to close, marking the end of the Bank's direct involvement in financing
tourism projects. The project was thus prepared and negotiated during the final
year of existence of the Tourism Department. It was almost an afterthought to hand
over tourism projects to the Urban Division.  This led to a serious continuity
problem. Thus, during most of the project implementation, supervision was done by



- 12 -
people unfamiliar with tourism and hotel management and the project became a foster
child of urban sector lending.  Also, dispersal of the Tourism Department staff
negatively affected project supervision in terms of decision-taking and follow-
up.  The absence of a financial analyst on project supervision could have been
responsible for the failure to flag critical financial weaknesses in the project.
A more vigilant supervision effort could have resulted in an intense program of
technical assistance to CCI in the area of financial management where CCI has been
consistently weak. There was, however, a problem of internal Bank coordination in
addressing CCI as an institution, since it was the intermediary for several other
larger Bank financed operations.
7.02      While the information available in the regional files at the Bank provided
good background data as a whole, there have been some important data gaps which
were neglected by both the Bank and the Borrower. At the time of the appraisal,
no reliable statistics on hotels in the interior existed. Few efforts have been
made to systematically collect data on hotels in the interior over the 6-year
implementation of the project. Because of the importance of these hotels in terms
of the objectives of the project, a systematic attempt should have been made at data
collection and maintenance of an up-to-date database in order to provide a better
picture of activity within the sector.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      With respect to the hotel component, as noted above, the weak financial
condition of most project hotels has been the result of external and internal
factors.  First, the economy went into negative growth soon after the start of
implementation, which was quite contrary to appraisal expectations that the rapid
economic growth experienced in the 1970s would be sustained. Secondly, the country
was ill-equipped to effectively market hotels in the 1- and 2-star category, nor
was there sufficient and timely provision of technical assistance and training to
assist these hotels.  As a result, many project hotels are still inefficiently
managed and operated and continue to incur substantial financial losses.
8.02      With respect to CCI,  the main agency responsible for the project,
insufficient attention was given to installing adequate control systems, adequate
supervision, and legal procedures to enhance its capacity to recover bad and
doubtful loans. Clearly, the selection of CCI as the Government agency responsible
for the project, without a strong institutional building element, played a crucial
role in the poor financial results of the hotel line of credit component.
8.03      With respect to the Parks, the inclusion of environmental considerations
in the component's design, namely conservation of two national parks, and consequent
commitment of the Government to manage them, has, in retrospect, added benefits,
though unquantifiable, to the long-run economic development of Cate d'Ivoire.
8.04      The Borrower's performance was mixed.  Performance on implementation of
physical works was consistently good, even at the end during the difficult
rehabilitation of the Comoe National Park. Institutional arrangements were carried
out as required under the project, even though late.  The main area of weakness
lies in the Government's failure to follow through on important software aspects
of the project, such as utilizing the manuals prepared under a technical assistance
contract to strengthen hotel management; monitoring CCI's debt recovery performance;
and handing over the management of the Azagny Park facilities to a private
enterprise (paras 6.01-6.02).



- 13 -
8.05      As regards the Bank's performance, the SAR appears to have been internally
inconsistent in its assessment of the country's tourism potential and did not
adequately assess the commercial risks involved. There are indications that timely
intervention and sustained follow-up could have addressed mounting financial and
managerial problems facing the main executing agency, CCI. However, despite the
severity of financial difficulties facing CCI, the project continued to be rated
"one" or 'twon throughout its implementation and no financial analyst was assigned
to its supervision for several years.  The Bank's tardiness in addressing this
situation was undoubtedly influenced by the closing of its Tourism Department, and
the dispersal of Tourism staff shortly after the project was initiated (paras 2.10,
3.02, 3.10, and 7.01).
8.06      The project has had a catalytic effect in reviving the Government's
interest in further development of the tourism sector.   The Government has now
prepared a 1989 National Tourism Development Plan and is actively pursuing ways to
foster a multisectoral approach to tourism development.   In this context, the
project has provided essential infrastructure and services for future activity in
the sector.
8.07      Main  lessons  learned  are  the  following:    (a) responsibility  for
administering a line of credit should only be given to a competent Borrower agency,
or provision should be included in the project for a strong institutional building
element to strengthen the agency; and (b) the Bank should avoid financing projects
in a sector in which it plans to discontinue lending operations, unless it is
prepared to make adequate provision for supervision.

Hotels included in this analysis are: Hibiscuts, Goma, Elite, Tanoe and Sielike, 3 of which are
one-star hotels while the other too are two-star hotels.
9 It should be pointed out here that tfte loan repaymont amounts reported by these hotels are
not consistent with CCI's loan reimbursement schedule. They generally underreport the
significant deliquency of both principal and interest. tnde,d some hotels have consistently not
repatid any of their obligations (see Table 2 of text).
