The appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. I.T. Christie, G.C. Guarda,
E. Nelson (consultant) appraised the project in July 1978. In the field, the
mission was assisted by Mr. F. Mendoza (WA2); in November, a further mission
consisting of Messrs. I.T. Christie, G.C. Guarda and M. Sarris visited the
Ivory Coast to appraise the wildlife component.

I. THE TOURISM SECTOR
A. The Tourism Sector
1.01       Travel to the Ivory Coast is mostly business motivated and centered
on the capital, Abidjan. Abidjan is the main port of entry (by air and sea) and
the leading commercial center for West Africa and accounts for two-thirds of the
country's growing industrial production. Numerous restaurants and nightclubs
cater to visiting businessmen as well as to a large expatriate community. Abidjan
also has an active market for African art and crafts, sold in the numerous bazaars
and galleries of the city. The Ivory Coast has little potential for mass vacation
tourism. Transport costs are high from the main tourist generating countries and
services in the Ivory Coast are also expensive, the climate is hot in February and
March and rainy from May to July and undertows make swimming dangerous on many
beaches. Nevertheless, there is some scope for beach tourism and for tourists who
wish experiences out of the ordinary. Thus, Club Mediterranee has successfully
promoted a village at Assinie, a resort characterized by long expanses of sandy
beach and palm groves. Tropical forests and savannas complement the coastal
lagoons of Abidjan, Assinie and Grand Bassam, and provide an attraction for people
who wish to experience the "tropics" in relative comfort. Moreover, the friendly
attitude of the Ivorian people, their customs, folklore and handicrafts constitute
valuable and distinctive tourism assets.
1.02       During 1970, the first year in which tourism statistics (based on air-
port arrivals) were kept, there were an estimated 45,000 foreign arrivals by air
in Ivory Coast; by the end of 1974, the number had grown to 93,000 and in 1977 to
138,000, a compound growth rate of about 17%. Europe accounts for 60% of arrivals;
Africa accounts for 27% and has been increasing its relative share in recent years.
Two-thirds of the Europeans were French, followed by Italians and Germans with 7
and 6% respectively. About 40-45% of visitors come to the Ivory Coast on business,
about 36% on vacation, 10% for family reasons and the balance for other reasons
(Annex I, Table 5). The airport statistics overestimate vacation tourists at the
expense of business tourists and in fact recent surveys by independent consultants
put business arrivals as high as 75% of arrivals (85% in Abidjan).
1.03       As of March 1977, hotel capacity in the Ivory Coast comprised 132 hotels
with a total of 4,804 rooms, up from 2,381 rooms in 1971 (a growth rate of 13%).
Only 50 of these hotels reach the service and facilities' standards needed for
official classification and are grouped as follows:
Table 1: CLASSIFIED HOTEL CAPACITY

In addition, there are 2 vacation villages and 82 unclassified hotels, mostly
small pensions or hotels de quartier.  About 41% of total hotel capacity is
managed by international management companies and 40% is publicly owned (Annex I,
Table 6).
1.04       The Government owns a hotel company, the Societe Ivoirienne d'Expansion
Touristique et Hoteliere (SIETHO), which operates properties throughout the Ivory
Coast (except Abidjan). At Assinie, SIETHO owns and operates the 316-room
Les Paletuviers resort and leases another 200-room resort to Club Mediterraneze;
in the interior, it operates 14 other properties, several of which were built for
independence day celebrations and which have little commercial justification.
With the exception of the Club Mediterrande and the Korhogo Hotel, occupancies
are quite low. The chain lost about US$2 million in 1977. If SIETHO is to be
made profitable, it needs strengthening of both its management and operations.
1.05       Reflecting the growth in demand, room occupancies in Abidjan hotels
are very high, having risen from 73% in 1970 to 78% in 1977 (Annex I, Table 7).
The only dips in occupancy occur between May and August (Annex I, Tables 8 and 9);
otherwise, hotels are full for most of the year and it is very difficult to find
a room without an advance reservation. Although hotels being built under the
first Bank tourism development project are expected to help keep capacity up with
demand until 1981, there will still be a shortage of hotel rooms in Abidjan, which
the proposed second tourism development project is designed to rectify.
1.06       At the beach and in the interior, occupancies average 21 and 30%
respectively on an annualized basis (Annex I, Tables 10 and 11). These low
occupancies occur partly because some hotels are closed for part of the year but
largely because the Ivory Coast has been unable to penetrate the European winter
package tour market or to encourage significant numbers of visitors to Abidjan to
venture to other parts of the country.
1.07       In 1977, tariffs in Ivory Coast hotels ranged from CFAF 12,000 (US$54.54)
single for a five-star room to CFAF 3,500 (US$15.90) for a one-star room (Annex I,
Table 12). In 1978, tariffs were increased by an average of 15%. Tariffs are
controlled by a price commission, comprising representatives of the Ministries of
Tourism and Commerce, which sets ceiling prices on published tariffs by category.
Partial data suggests that although prices in four-star hotels (about 10% of
capacity) are near ceilings, in other categories they are well below, perhaps
because of discounts offered. The commission has shown itself willing to review
prices regularly upon sufficient demand by hoteliers and now holds reviews on an
annual basis. Nonetheless, price control could lead to distortions particularly
for those hotels which have a low category rating but are in prime locations and
the Government is going to remove it as hotel capacity expands (para. 5.06).
1.08       Construction costs have varied considerably in the past, depending on
the purpose, style, size and category of hotel. Hotels built during 1970-77
(Annex I, Table 13) averaged about CFAF 7.5 million (US$34,000) per room. Latest
cost estimates for hotels under construction or recently completed (in 1978 prices)
are US$50-60,000 per room for five-star hotels, US$40-45,000 for four-star and
US$30-38,000 for three star; two- and one-star hotels vary greatly up to US$20,000.
It must be emphasized that established norms leave great flexibility in design
standards and that no two hotels of similar category are likely to have the same
construction cost per room.



1o09       There are 5 national parks and 3 game reserves in the Ivory Coast (see
map) accounting for nearly 6% of the national territory. After years of unrestricted
hunting which decimated the animal population, the Government has enacted policies
of environmentl control and in 1974 banned hunting. As a result, the wildlife is
gradually reconstituting itself in numbers large enough to be of interest to
tourists. Visits by hotel guests and expatriates living in Abidjan have been
increasing, particularly at Azagny and Comoe. In spite of this progress, much
remains to be done to improve management of the wildlife and parks, which are still
subject to poaching and encroachment by squatter farmers; at the same time, better
facilities for visitors are needed.
1.10       Between 1964 and 1974 the Government invested about US$60 million in
superstructure and infrastructure in the tourism sector. With major infrastructure
in place in Abidjan and Assinie the Government is leaving hotel construction to
private initiative. This policy, which was supported under the first Bank tourism
project, will be continued under the second. To encourage private investment in
hotels, a Tourism Incentive Code was introduced in 1973 (Law 73-368). The incentives
under this code include exemptions from customs, excise and value-added taxes on
imported materials and equipment required for construction and up to seven years'
exemption from income tax, real estate taxes, sales tax, license fees and several
other local taxes. These incentives (similar to those offered under the industrial
incentives code) are considered consistent with the needs of the sector (para. 5.07)
for the duration of the proposed project.
1.11       Training of hotel staff has been a problem in the past but will shortly
be removed as the Canadian International Development Agency is providing CAN$ 4.5
million for a 200-student school. The school consists of academic and practical
training facilities but has no practice hotel. CIDA will finance half of the
construction cost (CAN$ 1.5 million) of the school and provide CAN$ 3 million for
course preparation and teaching. Construction has begun and completion is expected
in 1979.
1.12       A bottleneck to the growth of vacation tourism in the past in the Ivory
Coast has been the Government's air policy which is designed to protect Air Afrique
in which the Government is a shareholder. Foreign carriers were limited to few
flights and few seats per flight, typically a 100-seat limitation on a single
weekly flight; 1/ those airlines wishing to increase their passenger traffic have
had difficulty in the past getting permission: (a) to fly extra flights; (b) to
sell seats above quotas; and (c) to schedule charter flights. Recently, however,
the Ministry of Tourism with Bank support has been successful in inducing the
authorities to remove restrictions on these last two items and now the civil
aviation authorities routinely grant quota exemptions and charter authorizations.
With these changes, entry by air has been greatly facilitated and the bottleneck
has been largely removed.
1/ If, however, the foreign carrier is willing to operate additional "pool"
flights with Air Afrique there are no restrictions on the number of such
additional flights.

1.13       Tourism's main direct impact on the economy is through foreign exchange
receipts from visitors which increased to about US$30 million gross in 1977 (1.0%
of total receipts from goods and nonfactor service exports), up from US$8 million
in 1970. Employment in the sector amounts to about 5,000 jobs, most of which
is in hotels, restaurants and transport. In addition, there are self-employment
opportunities in the production and distribution of handicrafts and in other
activities which supply part of their output to the hotel industry. Budget
revenues, deriving mainly from the tourism development tax, and from hotel corpo-
rate income and staff salary taxes, currently amount to about US$5 million per year.
Despite recent rapid growth, the direct contribution of tourism to GDP is estimated
at less than 1%.
B. Financial Environment
1.14       The Ivory Coast is a member of the West African Monetary Union estab-
lished in 1962 and composed of seven countries with a common central bank, the
Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO). Financial institutions
in the Ivory Coast include four commercial banks, four development banks, several
foreign banks which have established local offices, the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement (CAA) which manages the public debt, the Societe Nationale de
Financement (SONAFI) which participates directly in projects of national interest,
a Guarantee Fund which guarantees credits to small enterprises, and the Caisse de
Stabilization et de Soutien des Prix des Produits Agricoles (CAISTAB) which is
the agricultural price stablization fund. In addition there are several leasing
institutions. A stock exchange restricted to Ivorian investors, was established
in 1976.
1.15       Ivorianization of the financial sector is progressing steadily:  the
Government has a 100% interest in Banque Nationale de l'Epargne et Credit, 21%
in Banque Ivorienne de Developpement Industriel (BIDI), 82% of Credit de la
Cote d'Ivoire (CCI) and 67% in Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Agricole.
It has participations of between 10 and 33% in 3 commercial banks which are
largely owned by French banks associated with American, German and Italian
institutions. These banks have an Ivorian, either as general manager or as
deputy and Ivorianization of their professional staff is increasing. At the end
of 1975, local participation in the equity of commercial and development banks
was 54.5%, about one-fifth of it in private Ivorian hands.
1.16       Apart from CCI, no institution specializes in financing hotels in
the Ivory Coast although insurance companies and pension funds have shown a
little interest in the sector. The Eurodollar market provides mostly medium-
term finance at currently high interest rates often requiring a Government
guarantee. Commercial banks make short- and medium-term loans to hotel projects
(usually for equipment) for 2 to 8 years (current interest rate, 8-13%), redis-
countable at BCEAO. The only development bank which has invested significantly
in the hotel industry is BIDI, a DFC established in 1965 in which IFC has a
participation, and which is now leaving most hotel financing to CCI. The few
nondiscountable medium-term loans made carry an interest rate of 13% fixed by
BCEAO. Potential sources of long-term hotel financing in the Ivory Coast are
therefore quite limited. In this environment, CCI has established itself as the
bank providing long-term hotel credit.

1.17       Although inflation has not been a problem historically within member
states of BCEAO, there have been recent sharp increases in prices in the Ivory
Coast. Based on its policy of restraint of credit expansion as well as the
Government's decision to reduce the pace of public investment, BCEAO estimates
that the rate of inflation will be sharply reduced. Bank data and estimates of
inflation in the Ivory Coast are shown in the following table:
Table 2: RATES OF INFLATION
1975  1976  1977  1978  1979  1980  1981

Import price deflator      -0.5  12.4  11.5    6       7     7      7
II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Content
2.01       The first tourism development project supported development of tourism
as a means of diversification of the economy and as a source of income, employ-
ment and foreign exchange earnings for the Ivory Coast. It included strength-
ening of CCI and the Ministry of Tourism, assistance in project promotion as
well as subproject financing. It has helped stimulate a substantial increase
in private investment in hotel construction which was previously undertaken
mostly by Government. The second project would build on the experience gained
with the first. It would further strengthen CCI and the Ministry of Tourism,
provide assistance for national parks, improve sectoral policy and encourage
the growth of vacation tourism.
2.02       The proposed loan of US$14.2 million would provide funds for:
(a) a line of credit for long-term debt financing of
a portion of the foreign exchange cost of hotel
construction (US$12.0 million);
(b) a wildlife program (US$1.0 million); and
(c) a technical assistance program to the Ministry of
Water and Forests, CCI, the Office National du
Tourisme (ONT) and SIETHO (US$1.2 million).



- 6 -
B. Line of Credit
2.03       The line of credit would be used to provide long-term debt financing
for a portion of the foreign exchange cost (estimated on average at 62% of total
cost) of hotel construction. A total of about 1,300 hotel rooms would be
financed under the project in the period 1979-84; commitment of the funds is
expected to be completed by the end of 1982. About 1,100 of these rooms would
be in Abidjan with the remainder throughout the country. Unlike the first project,
which financed mostly four- and five-star hotels, under the second loan hotels
would be in the one- to three-star category unless the Bank should otherwise
agree, since it is in these categories that hotels have the highest occupancies
(90%). Agreement to this effect was reached during negotiations.
2.04       Using the demand projections set out in Chapter 4, and assuming a
long-run room occupancy rate of 75% and a double occupancy factor of 1.2 (Annex I,
Table 17), 1,500 additional rooms will be required in Abidjan by 1985. The line
of credit would therefore finance about three-quarters of anticipated needs in
Abidjan. Outside Abidjan, new hotels will be required only in towns such as
Bouake, San Pedro and, possibly, Korhogo and the beach. For such projects,
agreement in principle will be sought from the Bank before significant work is
started on subproject promotion and appraisal. Agreement to this effect was
obtained at negotiations.
2.05       Financial plans for subprojects would be based on the following
proposals:
Source                Term       % of cost
Hotels less than 100 rooms
Equity                     Promoters              -         minimum 25%
Long-term debt             CCI and other          up to     variable
banks              17 yrs.
Medium-term debt           Local banks,           8 yrs.    up to 40%
suppliers, etc.   minimum
Hotels more than 100 rooms
Equity                     Promoters             -          minimum 35%
Long-term debt             CCI and other          up to     variable
banks              17 yrs.
Medium-term debt           Local banks,           8 yrs.    up to 40%
suppliers, etc.   minimum
Accordingly, the aggregate investment program for the 1,300 rooms under the
line of credit would be as follows:

Investment costs are built up from  an average per room baseline cost of
CFAF 7.8 million (US$35,450) in 1978 prices.  This is the cost of the most
recently constructed three-star hotel in Abidjan and compares favorably with
construction costs in other West African cities. Promoters and managers have
already identified a number of projects which have been approved by the Ministry
of Tourism. CCI would use Bank funds to provide an average of 50% of long-term
debt, the balance to be provided as cofinancing or separately. Medium-term debt
is unlikely to pose a problem since funds are available through the BCEAO's redis-
count facility; CCI could act as lead Bank in consortia to provide this finance.
2.06       The terms of subloans provided from Bank funds would vary according to
the type and category of project as well as specific financial and economic
considerations. Loans would be tailored to such hotel characteristics as long
construction periods and economic life, and slow build-up of revenue in the
early years of operation. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
maturities would not exceed 17 years and that grace periods would not exceed the
construction period and first two years of operation, and in no case would exceed 4 years.
2.07       In line with the Government's policy of leaving hotel development to
the private sector, agreement was reached during negotiations that projects
would be sponsored by private promoters (local and foreign) who would hold majority
equity participations. To the extent that promoters cannot put together a
majority participation, allowance would be made for banks to provide equity
capital with provisions and terms for eventual repurchase by promoters. Hotels
would be managed by either experienced individual hotel managers or by hotel
management companies with an equity participation.
2.08       The interest rate structure, similar to that under the first project,
would allow for a suitable spread for CCI plus a one percent fee to compensate
the Government for taking the foreign exchange risk on Bank funds. The rate to
hotel borrowers would be 12%. 1/ CCI's spread should give adequate compensation
1/ Plus the Bank commitment fee of .0075 on undisbursed amounts, which would
be passed on to subborrowers.



-8-
for its costs and risks, and given current estimates of inflation (Table 2), the
effective cost of funds is expected to be positive over the life of the project.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government would take the
foreign exchange risk, as under the first project, for a fee of one percent.
2.09       Subloans would be made on the basis of appraisals prepared by CCI.
Appraisals would follow the guidelines successfully established under the first
project. The market, management, technical, costing and financial aspects of
recent appraisals have been acceptable and CCI has agreed to modify its economic
analysis to include a rate of return based on in-hotel revenue and costs and an
analysis of incremental occupancy rates and pricing considerations. For a sub-
project to be acceptable, the economic rate of return should be at least equal to
the opportunity cost of capital in the Ivory Coast estimated at 11%. Agreement
was reached during negotiations on the details of such an analysis.
2.10       An individual subproject free limit of US$500,000 equivalent would
permit CCI to approve small subprojects of up to 60 rooms on the basis of
financing 20% of subproject cost with Bank funds; the aggregate free limit would
be US$3.0 million to permit the Bank to review subprojects amounting to 75% of
the total credit component. Subprojects above this limit would be subject to
approval by the Bank.
2.11       Subborrowers would be required to set up accounting and control
procedures based on the Uniform System of Accounts for Hotels (copies of which
have been given to CCI) or on another accounting and control system acceptable
to the Bank. A quarterly review would be made by CCI of financial statements
and key operating statistics for each of its hotel borrowers, and large hotels
would be required to submit annual financial statements audited by independent
auditors acceptable to CCI. Small hotels would submit limited audits prepared
by a "fiduciaire". CCI would follow closely the Ministry of Tourism's reports
on standards of service in the hotels it finances.
C. National Parks and Wildlife Component
2.12       The national parks and wildlife component consists of (a) an infra-
structure and equipment package (para. 2.15) and (b) a resettlement program
(para. 2.16). The technical feasibility study was based on the findings of a
German Technical Assistance Agency (GTZ) team which has been working in the Ivory
Coast for the last three years. The German studies recommend that the national
parks of Comoe, Tai and the reserve of Azagny be given priority for development.
The Bank agreed with the Government to concentrate on Azagny as it has some
unique advantages and its existence is threatened by squatter farmers making
unauthorized forest clearings.
2.13       Azagny is a relatively small area (193 km 2), surrounded by water on 3
sides (Ebrie lagoon to the east, the Bandama river to the west and Azagny canal
to the south). Due to its relative isolation and difficult terrain (nearly half
the area is permanent wet land), Azagny has preserved several forms of West
African wildlife and flora. Vegetal formations range from mangrove, waterlilies,
raphia and pandanus in the swamps (39%), to tall grasses in the open savannas
(5%) gradually giving way to bush, calamus thickets and wet woods (32%), and
to chunks of dense primary forest (19%) which cover the area's two islands and
many peninsulas. No less varied and interesting is the wildlife, which includes



-9-
at least 70 elephants, some 200 buffalos, numerous forest antelopes, dwarf hippos,
bushpigs, leopards, wildcats, as well as various species of monkeys, birds and
large reptiles such as crocodiles, giant lizards and pythons. The ease of access
from Abidjan (two hours by road), the density of animals and the exceptional
ecological interest, make Azagny ideally suited for offering even a hurried
visitor a glimpse of the "real" Africa. Moreover, since the area is small, it
can be easily managed and the investments necessary to open it up to the public
are modest.
2.14       The plan for operation of the park calls for limiting entrance at a
few controlled points and organizing two major areas of exploitation: the south-
western corner for viewing game in the open savannas and the north-eastern corner
for forest hikes and swamp excursions by boat or on floating boardwalks. Conditions
of access and usage of Azagny as well as user charges are being studied and will be
codified in suitable internal regulations for the park. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that these regulations be acceptable to the Bank and that they
be enacted by January 31, 1980.
2.15       The proposed investment at Azagny is designed to protect the wildlife,
maintain the delicate ecological balance and at the same time open up the area to
tourists. The program consists of clear demarcation of the area's limits,
construction of 1 brigade headquarters and 6 ranger stations, construction of
45 km of all-weather tracks and some 50 km of trails, fording of water bodies with
several culverts and 2.3 km of floating boardwalks, clearance of a 25 km circuit
of canals, development of a visitor center including tourist information, rest-
rooms, a restaurant, bar, kitchen, 10 lodging units and related equipment (2 diesel
generators, a pumping station, water treatment unit and solid waste incinerator),
provision of 2 four-wheel drive vehicles, 12 motorcycles and 3 motorboats for the
surveillance staff, installation of 6 radio-telephone stations, improvement of 2
picnic sites, 7 tree-top look-outs, 3 parking lots and 10 slipways.
2.16       The resettlement program concerns about 120 families who have moved in
within the past 5 years, illegally clearing forest land and starting production
of coffee and other cash crops. This is progressive with more and more families
encroaching farther and farther into the reserve. To stop this process, it will
be necessary to (a) upgrade the reserve to national park status; (b) redefine the
limits of Azagny (para. 2.17), minimizing the need to resettle families; (c) de-
classify suitable areas in the neighboring Go Forest; and (d) resettle 120 families.
Resettlement for public purposes is carried out frequently and efficiently in the
Ivory Coast and, relocation indemnities are paid out according to law. The reset-
tlement procedures for Azagny are already underway. The Sous Prefecture and the
National Parks Department have held public hearings at which the large majority
of squatters have stated their willingness to move out, provided that fair
compensation is paid. Areas for resettlement have been identified in the forest
of Go and funds earmarked in the Ministry of Finance's special indemnification
fund. Resettlement will proceed when the decree creating the national park of
Azagny and redefining its limits is promulgated (para. 2.17).
2.17       Azagny's present status as "partial reserve" affords a measure of
protection under Ordinance 60-556, June 25, 1960, but does not preclude
farming and certain other uses. Therefore, to safeguard the area's ecology,



- 10 -
the National Parks Department has been obliged to keep the reserve closed to the
public (except for overflights). Since only the legal framework which provides
for full protection is that of "national park", a decree creating the national
park of Azagny and redefining its limits has been drafted and approved by
concerned agencies; it now awaits final signature.
D. Technical Assistance
2.18       Office National du Tourisme.  Two consultants would be appointed each
for a two-year period for ONT within six months of loan signature. The first
position, started under the first project, would be renewed and would bolster
ONT's capability to administer the agrement professionnel (para. 3.17).  It is
expected that the incumbent, financed under the first project, will continue in
this position. The second position is for a small hotel investment promotion
advisor. There are currently over 50 requests for assistance to organize small
hotel projects throughout the country. The advisor would assist these investors
to organize their projects (or recommend that they be discontinued), secure the
necessary approvals and find financing. This would take the pressure off CCI,
which is also deluged by would-be investors, and ensure the orderly processing
of investment proposals.
2.19       SIETHO.  The objective of this technical assistance component is to
help improve SIETHO's operations with a view to eliminating the need for annual
operating subsidies and Government assumption of portions of the company's term
debt. An audit of SIETHO is currently being carried out by independent auditors
as well as a management study, financed by the Ministry for the Reform of Public
and Semi-public Companies. Provided these reports demonstrate a need for this
technical assistance, they will give the background for discussion of terms of
reference and tasks to be undertaken by two technical assistance appointments
proposed under the loan. The appointments would be each for two years. One
appointee would be a financial advisor and the other an operations advisor. The
financial advisor would be responsible for advising on the financial condition of
SIETHO at the corporate level and improving financial and accounting reporting.
The second appointee would be an operations advisor whose task would be advising
on the preparation of appropriate management systems, procedures and manuals at
the operating unit (hotel) level.
2.20       CCI.  The position of advisor (Conseiller Technique), created and
financed under the first project, would be maintained under the second for a period
of two years. Attached to the general directorate, the advisor's main role would
be to advise the director general on hotel investments although he would also
advise on other sectors; he would also assist the hotel division in promotion
and preparation of hotel projects. The advisor would help promote economic
appraisal of projects and implement follow-up procedures.



- 11 -
2.21       Ministry of Water & Forests.   A field engineer would also be appointed
to the project unit for the national parks component for three years. His functions
would be to coordinate implementation of the infrastructure and buildings in Azagny,
preparation of tenders and supervision of works.
2.22       All technical assistance appointments should be made on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Agreement was reached during negotiations
on the above arrangements.
E. Project Cost
2.23       Total project cost, including taxes of US$0.1 million equivalent, 1/
is estimated at US$63.6 million equivalent, including US$14.7 million contingencies.
The estimated foreign exchange content of the project is US$39.4 million. Detailed
cost estimates for the project are given in Annex I, Tables 1 and 2 and are sum-
marized in Tables 4 and 5 below.

2.24       Since the hotel investment program cannot be exactly predetermined,
the final mix and timing of hotels which will be financed under the line of credit
is unknown. Estimates have been based on a tentative commitment schedule (35, 40,
25% of total funds in each year of a 3-year period). Civil works estimates are
based on per room construction costs of hotels recently constructed or presently
under construction; the cost of furniture and equipment is based on average shop-
ping prices and contracts recently awarded. The average investment cost per room
before interest during construction and net of import duties and value added tax
is estimated at CFAF 7.8 million (US$35,450) in 1978 prices and at CFAF 10.1
million (US$46,000) including all contingencies. Civil works represent some
37.0% of total costs, furniture and equipment 37.0%, professional services and
working capital 16% and land 10%. The overall foreign exchange cost is estimated
at 62%.
2.25       Cost estimates for the wildlife component, based on preliminary
engineering, have been derived from three separate sources: the GTZ estimates
prepared in consultation with local contractors, those of the Ministries of
Tourism and Water and Forests and those of the Ministry of Public Works,
Construction and Urban Planning. Prices have been increased by the official
distance/location factor of 1.243 to reflect Azagny's conditions, while an even
10% fee has been added for design supervision and technical guidance. The foreign
cost of civil works including buildings is 52%, of equipment 84% and of profes-
sional services 65%.
2.26       Six internationally recruited appointments will be made for technical
assistance for an estimated total of 156 man-months at an average cost of US$8,900
per man-month including local costs. Except for a portion of local travel and
subsistence expenditures, technical assistance is a foreign exchange cost.
2.27       An average increase of 10% has been allowed to cover physical contin-
gencies for civil works, equipment and furniture for all project components
including hotels to be financed under the line of credit. Price increases are
estimated over March 1979 base costs according to the implementation schedules
of the various project components and the following annual price escalation rates:

F. Financing Plan
2.28       The project financing plan calls for an IBRD loan of US$14.2 million
equivalent, or 22% of total project cost. The total Government budgetary
contribution will be US$1.5 million, or 2.3% of total project cost on behalf
of the Ministries of Tourism and Water and Forests. Financial intermediaries,
domestic and foreign, are expected to provide US$26.9 million equivalent for
medium- and long-term debt and private investors US$21.0 million in equity.
The financing plan is summarized in the following table:
Table 7:  FINANCING PLAN

of which taxes                0.1
Two of the six technical assistance positions were started under the first
project and will continue under the second. The contracts for the incumbents
expired in November and December 1978. To assure continuity, the Bank has
agreed to finance retroactively the foreign cost of these experts between expiry
of their present contracts and signature of the proposed project.
G. Lending Terms
2.29       The loan would be made to the Ivory Coast represented by CAA, which
would channel funds to the executing agencies, at the prevailing Bank rate
(7.90%) and standard commitment of 0.75% on undisbursed amounts. It would be
for 17 years including 4 of grace. The Bank would enter into a project agreement
with CCI which would receive hotel credit funds and its portion of technical
assistance funds; CCI would service this debt and collect the foreign exchange
risk fee on behalf of CAA. The Ministry of Water and Forests and ONT would receive
funds for technical assistance and the wildlife component as a grant and Government
would service this debt. SIETHO would service the debt associated with its
technical assistance.
2.30       The proposed Bank loan would be repaid on a flexible amortization
schedule conforming substantially to the aggregate amortization schedules of
subprojects, with technical assistance amortized over the full period of loan
repayment.



- 16 -
H. Implementation
2.31       The project would be implemented in about 5 years from loan effective-
ness (Annex I, Table 4) with a proposed completion date of September 30, 1984.
The expected closing date is December 31, 1984. The last date for submission of
subprojects to the Bank would be December 1982.
2.32       CCI would promote subprojects and carry out appraisals of all subloans
through its hotel division set up under the first tourism project. This division
would work closely with ONT which awards the agrement professionnel (para. 3.17).
A representative of CCI's hotel division would sit on the interministerial commit-
tee (Conseil Restreint des Investissements Touristiques) which considers all
applications for incentives and would advise the committee on the financial aspects
of all projects submitted for the award of incentives. Assurances were received
during negotiations that these arrangements would be implemented.
2.33       The technical assistants retained for ONT would be attached to the
Department of Studies and Planning which carries out the agrement professionnel.
They would each be assigned qualified counterparts who would eventually take over
the experts' functions. Assurances were received during negotiations that these
arrangements would be implemented.
2.34       Implementation of the wildlife component will be supervised by the
Ministry of Water and Forests. A project unit, attached to the Cabinet, will be
created for the component. Works will be executed by the Ministry of Public Works
and operated by the National Parks Department of the Ministry of Water and Forests.
The project manager shall be a person experienced in park and forest management to
be appointed and maintained on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. It is
expected that the project manager will be provided by GTZ under its new technical
assistance contract (para. 2.35). Assurances were received during negotiations
that both the creation of the project unit and appointment of its director would
take place by January 1, 1980.
2.35       GTZ has just signed a three-year contract with the Ministry of Water and
Forests to continue providing technical assistance in park management; it has agreed
to provide some assistance with the Azagny component. This is a positive factor
inasmuch as the leader of the technical assistance team was responsible for
preparing the Azagny feasibility study and there would therefore be continuity from
feasibility study through project execution. The proposed assistance could include
a percentage of the team leader's time as project manager for the Azagny component.
In addition, GTZ would provide two scholarships for the wildlife institute at
Garoa, Cameroon (for the two chefs de brigade), and short-term internships to visit
other national park systems. Funds are also available for final design and for a
person whose role would be to train local residents and boat owners as tourist
guides using extension methods. GTZ's contribution has been confirmed by letter
to the Bank.
2.36       The Azagny project unit will work closely with the Ministry's Department
of Conservation for surveillance of Azagny and effective control of poaching. The
present surveillance structure will be strengthened, with the creation of a new
brigade station in N'Zida, 3 permanent guard posts and 3 temporary ones from which
intensified patrolling of the park will be carried out. The staffing of these units
is shown in Annex V, Chart II. The increased personnel requirements will be met
largely with graduates of the Ministry's training school at Bouafle. For tourism



- 17 -
management aspects, the project unit will work at a technical level with the
Department of Studies and Planning in ONT (where the two experts financed under
the project will be housed) and with CCI's Hotel Department which will assist in
funding private individuals or companies to manage the concessions in the park.
I. Procurement and Disbursement
2.37       Procurement under the line of credit would be according to CCI's
procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. Building contracts would be awarded
on the basis of local competitive bidding following procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Because of the diversity of items, and also the brand preferences of hotel
promoters, it is expected that equipment and furniture contracts would be made up
of small packages. Equipment and furniture for a 100-room hotel, for example,
would cost between an estimated US$1.3 and 1.8 million, made up to 6 to 10 small
packages. Contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment would be awarded
either on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally or on the basis of
prudent shopping in accordance with CCI's procedures. It is expected that most
furniture contracts would be won by local manufacturers and most equipment contracts
by foreign manufacturers.
2.38       Execution of the wildlife component will be carried out by the Ministry
of Public Works. However, the particular nature of certain works (such as
clearance of canals by cutting underwater vegetation or the construction of
floating boardwalks in the swamp) may require direct implementation by the park
management on force account (en regie). The total value of works to be carried
out under this formula is less than US$225,000. All other works will be carried
out according to the standard procedures of the Ministry of Public Works through
local competitive bidding. Procurement of vehicles, boats, radiotelephones and
utility equipment for the lodge will be handled through comparative shopping or
competitive local bidding. No single item in the wildlife procurement list is
of such import as to warrant recourse to international bidding procedures.
2.39       The loan would be disbursed to meet:
(a)  100% of CCI disbursements on approved subloans under
the line of credit (US$12.0 million);
(b)  25% of expenditures for infrastructure works (US$0.1 million);
(c)  65% of expenditures under construction contracts for
buildings (US$0.5 million);
(d)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment
and furniture (US$0.4 million); and
(e)  100% of the foreign cost of technical assistance
(US$1.2 million).
Disbursements would be made on fully documented expenditures except for works
carried out by force account and disbursements under (a) which will be made
on the basis of a certified statement of expenditures by CCI. The documentation
would be available for inspection by supervision missions.

III. BORROWING AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
A. Credit de la Cote d'Ivoire
3.01       Established in 1955 and headquartered in Abidjan, CCI is a multi-
purpose development bank which finances housing, industry, trade, artisans,
hotels, consumer durables and automobiles. Its share capital of CFAF 2 billion
is fully paid in. The Government is the major shareholder (82%); the Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) holds 9% and BCEAO the remaining 9%.
CCI's Board of Directors meets approximately 6 times a year and consists of 12
members, 10 government appointed officials, 1 representative of CCCE and 1 from
BCEAO who, since 1975, is the vice chairman. The board has delegated authority
to approve most routine loans to a loan approval committee, consisting of the
board chairman, 1 representative of BCEAO, 1 from the CAA and 2 government
representatives. In addition, the director general of CCI has the authority to
approve housing loans up to CFAF 15 million and loans to enterprises up to
CFAF 50 million.
3.02       CCI's present organization (Annex II, Chart 1) comprises a general
directorate and three departments (investment, finance and administration).
A division for organization and computing activities and a division of internal
control are part of the general director's office. Project promotion, appraisal
and supervision are handled by the investment department which is also in charge
of arrears collection. CCI currently has five branch offices in Bouake,
Korhogo, Abengourou, Daloa and Man.
3.03       The present director general has been at CCI almost since its inception.
He has spent the last seven yearsin his present position and understands the
institution well. He is assisted by a deputy director general. As of June 1978,
the total staff of CCI, including the branch offices, amounted to 214 of which
33 are professionals. The professional staff is generally well trained
academically but with limited experience and it is thinly spread. There are
eight expatriates employed by CCI, including three working in computing activities
and an advisor to the director general financed by the first Bank tourism
development loan.
3.04       CCI s by-laws, which give its operating policies and guidelines,
were revised in May 1975 to incorporate modifications regarding appraisal
criteria, exposure limits, financial policy and staff development suggested
during appraisal of the first Bank small scale enterprise project. Equity
investments are limited to 25% of a company's share capital or 25% of CCI's
net worth whichever is lower. CCI's total exposure in a single company cannot
exceed 25% of its net worth, or 80% of project cost although exceptions can be
made for loans guaranteed by the Government. The by-laws also set terms and
conditions for different categories of loan including maturities, minimum
required equity, spread, use of loan proceeds and acceptable guarantees.
3.05       The bulk of CCI's resources have come from BCEAO rediscounts, term
borrowings from CAA and CCCE and term deposits from the Caisse Nationale de
Prevoyance Sociale and CAISTAB. CCI has also received financing from USAID
through the USAID/Conseil de l'Entente African Enterprise Program and three



- 19 -
lines of credit from IBRD, 1 for tourism (US$9 million) and the other 2 for
SME (US$5.6 million and USS12.6 million).
3.06       CCI's loan approvals have grown over the last five years as follows:
Table 8: LOAN APPROVALS 1973 and 1977
1973                                 1977
Number    CFAF million        %      Number      CFAF million   %
Short-term
(up to 2 yrs)        8,142         1,205         22       13,524          4,174      26
Medium- and
long-term            1,840          4,218         78         980         11,870      74
Total               9,982          5,423       100       14,504         16,044    100
Over the last ten years, lending for housing has been decreasing relatively while
credits to industrial enterprises and hotels have increased significantly.  Lending
for consumer durables has been irregular while vehicle financing has increased
sharply. The geographical distribution of CCI's loan portfolio reflects Abidjan's
dominant position although in FY 1977 approximately 40% was outside Abidjan.
CCI's equity investments amount to CFAF 275 million in 8 companies.
Provisions
3.07       Provisions against loans amounted to CFAF 730 million at the end of
FY 1977 and CFAF 7.0 million for equity investments. Specific provisions covered
62% of doubtful loans and 67% of contentious loans. In addition, there are 3
separate internal guarantee funds totaling CFAF 911 million which provide additional
amounts to cover possible loan losses for automobiles, consumer durables and small-
scale enterprises. Finally, a provision for general risks is made each year to
reduce taxes (para. 3.10). This account amounted to CFAF 921 million in 1977.
Based on this, and a review of selected accounts outstanding, CCI's auditors concluded
that the level of provisions is adequate. The Bank
Procurement and Disbursement
3.08       CCI's procedures for procurement and disbursement are generally
adequate. For consumer durable lending, disbursements are made directly to
suppliers. For industrial loans, CCI disburses to the supplier or the construction
contractor after verification of prices and work performed by its technical
department. For hotel and other large loans, CCI reviews borrowers' procurement
plans and ensures that proper goods are obtained at reasonable prices.



- 20 -
Audit
3.09       CCI's accounts are reviewed annually by the Government and an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. Although receipt of audits to date
has been slow because of start-up problems and lack of familiarity with Bank
requirements, the overall quality of the reports is good.
Financial Performance
3.10       CCI's financial position is sound.  Assets reached CFAF 29.7 billion
as of December 31, 1977 more than twice the 1973 level. The term debt equity
ratio stood at about 5.1:1 as of end 1977, well below the 8.3:1 ratio agreed
to under the first SSE line of credit. As shown in Annex II, Table 1, CCI's
profits after provisions have been increasing since 1975 and in 1977 amounted to
CFAF 9.4 million. As a public institution which is not expected to pay dividends,
CCI is not concerned with showing a profit but tries to maintain a sound balance
sheet: thus gross profit in excess of a nominal level is transferred to a tax-
free general reserve account. Such transfers are limited in any one year to
5% of loans outstanding and cumulatively to 10% of loans outstanding. At present
reserves are well below these limits. If these transfers are included in net
profit, CCI's profit in FY 1977 was CFAF 224 million, or about 5.1% on net assets.
Balance sheets, income statements and financial ratios in Annex II, Tables 1 to 3
detail CCI's financial condition.
Prospects
3.11       Financial projections and the assumptions on which they are based are
presented in Annex II, Tables 1 and 2 and Appendix 1. These projections assume
that the proposed loan is made. CCI's pipeline of hotel projects consists of
7-8 projects requiring US$10-12 million in financing from CCI. In order to meet
its projected operations, CCI will have to mobilize about CFAF 18 billion
(US$81 million) in the next 5 years. The proposed loan would cover about 13% of
this. The balance would continue to be provided by advances from BCEAO, CAA and
CCCE, the SME project as well as a proposed increase in equity. Over the fore-
cast period, CCI's profits and debt/equity ratio remain satisfactory.
3.12       CCI was appraised by IDF in June 1978 and a small- and medium-scale
enterprise project, a renewal and broadening of the first SSE loan made in 1975
(1162-IVC), was approved by the Executive Directors on March 6, 1979. Amongst
the general findings and conclusions of the IDF appraisal are that CCI's internal
control is weak. The IDF mission recommended that internal control be improved
and that CCI's internal control unit be strengthened. As pointed out above,
professional staff is thinly spread. Under the SSE project, an internal training
program, together with outside training, is being set up to improve the staffing
situation. Following the 1975 banking reform in which the distinction between
commercial and development banks was removed, CCI is studying the possibility of
adding savings accounts to its range of services. CCI has commissioned a study
to determine the opportunities in that field and has agreed to keep the Bank
informed of progress and advise it of any proposed major change in its activities.



- 21 -
Performance under First Tourism Development Project
3.13       CCI's performance under the first tourism development project has been
satisfactory. Signed on June 11, 1975, the loan included a line of credit to CCI
for financing a two-year period of hotel construction, technical assistance to
help promote and appraise hotel subprojects and funds for a market study to help
set strategy and identify realistic tourism targets. All Bank funds are now comit-
ted. Disbursements amount to 25% of the Bank loan; now that four subprojects are
under construction, however, disbursement of committed funds is expected to be
rapid. CCI has established itself as the premier tourism financing bank in the
Ivory Coast and has introduced sound financial and appraisal criteria. Whereas
before the loan, most hotel construction was financed by the Government, under the
first loan, only minor amounts are from local public funds. Private Ivorian
interests represent over 50% of ownership in subprojects; other international
financing agencies and insurance companies have also invested in the subprojects.
Foreign management companies have been attracted to the projects and induced to
hold equity positions.
B. The Ministry of Tourism and Related Agencies
3.14       As successor to several less important agencies, a Ministry of Tourism
was created under Decree No. 71-675 of December 12, 1971. Its major functions
were to set and implement tourism policy through (a) identification of zones for
tourism development and planning proposals for their implementation; (b) marketing
and promotion of the Ivory Coast; (c) regulation and control of the tourism sector
in general and of the hotel industry in particular; and (d) coordination of public
and private activities in tourism. In a major reorganization of the institutional
structure in 1977, most of these functions were delegated to a new Office National
du Tourisme (ONT) and the Ministry of Tourism was streamlined. Under this arrange-
ment, the ministry sets and ONT executes policy.
3.15       The new Ministry of Tourism consists of the minister, his "cabinet"
and a few technical advisors specialized in (a) financial and economic aspects
of tourism; (b) tourism training; and (c) marketing. Offices in Paris and
Frankfurt are supervised directly by the ministry.  Two parastatals, the Ivory
Coast Travel Agency (ICTA) and the Societe Ivoirienne d'Expansion Touristique
et Hoteliere (SIETHO) remain under the tutelle of the ministry.
3.16       ONT was created on October 18, 1977, as a semi-public entity which
functions under private law. Its budget (Annex I, Table 14) is derived from
a tourism development tax of 4% on all hotel and restaurant sales which was
introduced in August 1977. ONT, with an establishment of about 120 people, has
a general directorate, a research and development department, a training
department, a promotion department, a handicrafts department (replacing the
former Office National de l'Artisanat) and four regional offices in the Ivory
Coast.
3.17       An important aspect of ONT's work is the technical evaluation of
projects to ensure that architectural, engineering and environmental aspects
are sound and that all permits necessary for construction have been obtained.
On ONT's recommendation, the ministry grants the agrement professionnel or
government approval which is necessary before a promoter proceeds with any
tourism project (Decree No. 72-488, By-law 8/MET/DR) and before an application
for incentives under the Tourism Incentive Code is considered.



- 22 -
C. Societe Ivoirienne d'Expansion Touristique et Hoteliere
3.18       SIETHO is a state-owned hotel company which was created in 1961 and
emerged in its present form in 1968. The chairman (president) is the Minister
of Tourism who presides over a board of 12 members drawn from various ministries
and public agencies. Management of SIETHO is delegated to a director general,
appointed by the chairman. SIETHO is organized into 3 main divisions:
administration, operations and maintenance and has about 500 employees (including
3 expatriates).
3.19       SIETHO owns, invests in, leases and/or manages 16 hotel properties
with a total of 1,845 beds (Annex I, Table 15). Of these hotels, 11 are operated
directly and attained an overall occupancy of about 30% in 1977. Revenues from
operations (CFAF 1,010 million in FY 1977, or US$4.6 million) cover 67% of opera-
ting costs, the balance being provided from state subsidies. Accumulated net
subsidies were CFAF 719. 9 million (US$3.3 million) at the end of FY 1977 or about
20% of assets (Annex I, Table 16). Reasons for the poor operating results include
the heavy corporate overhead at headquarters and the fact that some hotels were
built for political rather than commercial reasons although these latter, in fact,
do not attain better results than the former. Nonetheless, fundamental reasons
are weak unit management (with the exception of Club Mediterranee and the Korhogo
hotel, para. 4.09) and marketing which the proposed Bank technical assistance is
designed to improve.
D. Ministry of Water and Forests
3.20       The major functions of the Ministry of Water and Forests (Decree 78/689,
August 18, 1978) are to (a) supervise the Ivory Coast's forests, prepare refor-
estation, management and conservation programs and set guidelines for the commercial
exploitation and export of wood; (b) supervise and manage the country's inland
water-ways and prepare fisheries projects; (c) classify, conserve and manage the
country's national parks and reserves; (d) assure the conservation and improvement
of the natural environment; and (e) protect wildlife and control hunting and
fishing. These functions are exercised within a framework which divides the
country into five forest inspectorates in turn divided into cantonments and brigades.
Cantonments may be specialized (forest, inland water, national park, etc.). The
organization chart (Annex V, Chart 1) reflects these functions.
3.21       The National Parks and Reserves Department of the ministry would be
responsible for operating the wildlife component of the project. The department
employs about 260 personnel, 22 of them with a university level education. The
department's operating budget has increased from CFAF 37.7 million (US$171,500)
in 1976 to CFAF 41.4 million (US$190,000) in 1978; the investment budget has
increased from CFAF 82.5 million (US$375,000) to CFAF 277.0 million (US$1.3 million)
over the same period. The project unit would assure coordination with the other
departments of the ministry for such matters as wildlife protection and environ-
mental protection.
IV. DEMAND AND MARKET PROSPECTS
4.01       The structure of business demand supported by a secondary pleasure
market is likely to continue with business travelers being concentrated in Abidjan
and pleasure travelers staying there before going to destinations along the coast



- 23 -
and in the interior (para. 1.02). Given the Ivory Coast's cultural and economic
ties, Europe is likely to remain the major generating region; reflecting the strong
trade ties with other West African countries, the African market is also likely
to continue to be strong. Prospects for Abidjan, the beach and the interior are
discussed in turn below.
A. Abidjan
4.02       Hotel statistics gathered by the Ministry of Tourism (Annex I, Table 7)
indicate a rapid growth of tourism demand for Abidjan between 1970 and 1977. In
this period, bednights in classified hotels increased from 302,000 to 744,000,
representing an annual growth rate of 13.7%. The growth was not continuous through-
out the period, a decline in hotel bednights being registered in 1974 as a result
of the world economic recession. If the analysis is restricted to the more recent
1974-77 period, the growth rate in bednights in Abidjan's classified hotels was
20.1% (from 429,000 to 744,000). This bednight growth rate is indicative only of
realized demand. Since hotel room occupancy rates increased during that period
so did the number of visitors turned away due to lack of space, and the growth
rate of potential demand (i.e., realized demand plus turn-away demand) was
undoubtedly even higher than the 13% long-run trend.
4.03       The rapid growth of visitor traffic to Abidjan has been determined by
a variety of factors including:
(a) the vigorous growth of GDP and export-import volumes.
Between 1971 and 1977 Ivorian GDP grew 6.5% annually
in constant terms. The real growth of export volumes
averaged 5.2% in the 1971-77 period and of imports,
10.8%;
(b) the location in the capital city of industrial,
commercial and accommodation facilities as part of
the Government's conscious effort to establish Abidjan
as the leading industrial and business center in West
Africa. Public sector contributions to this effect
included the establishment of an industrial park near
the city, the construction of a major convention
facility at the Hotel Ivoire, as well as several
additions to this hotel. About two-thirds of the
country's industrial activities, which expanded at an
annual rate of 15% in the '70s are currently located
in or near Abidjan. During the 1965-73 period, the
Abidjan population increased 11.5% annually and is now
an estimated 1.1 million; and
(c) the increase in foreign capital inflows (two-thirds of
industrial activities are currently foreign owned) and
the growth of multilateral and bilateral technical
assistance programs. Abidjan's population today
includes an estimated 50,000 French nationals.
4.04       Because of its market opportunities, infrastructure and hotels,
Abidjan will continue to be the focal point of the country's industrial and
commercial development. The factors causing the growth of business visitor
demand in recent years are thus likely to continue being important in the



- 24 -
future. GDP is projected to maintain its long-term growth rate of 6-7% per annum.
As the Ivorian economy grows and diversifies, investment and import-export volumes
will also continue to expand. The Government recognizes that continued foreign
participation in developing the country's resources (which include recently found
oil reserves) will be necessary for a long time, if the pace of economic growth is
to be maintained. This will attract increasing numbers of business visitors and
support further urban expansion.
4.05       For these reasons, the mission believes that the development of hotel
bednights will follow past trends. Regressions were run using, variously, a time
series of observed bednights, real GDP, investment and total foreign trade. The
simple time trend of bednights over the period 1970-77 provided the best fit,
yielding a growth rate of 12.3% and explaining 94% of the annual variation in
observed bednights and it has been assumed that this rate will continue in the
future. On the basis of this regression equation, projected bednights in Abidjan
(Annex I, Table 17) would evolve as follows:
1977 (actual)         744,300 bednights
1980                  974,000
1985                1,800,000
B. Beach
4.06       There are two basic markets for beach-based tourism at Assinie: foreign
residents living in the Ivory Coast (mostly on weekends - residents have an average
length of stay of less than two days (Annex I, Table 10)) and the European winter
package tourists. Bednights at the 2 vacation villages grew from 43,777 in 1972
to 78,835 in 1976, a growth rate of 16%. Seasonal occupancy at the 2 resorts is
26%, or 21% on an annual basis. The Assinie village, benefiting from Club
Mediterranee's management expertise and market strength, now attains satisfactory
occupancies, reputedly exceeding 85% in the high season between December and March;
the second village, SIETHO's Les Paletuviers, on the other hand, is less effectively
managed and since it has never had a sound marketing program has never succeeded
in penetrating the European package tour market.
4.07       Tourism officials maintain that accommodation capacity at the beach
should be expanded in order to reach a critical mass which they estimate to be
about 1,000 rooms. Whether Assinie has the potential for developing mass
tourism can be questioned. Its advantages include relative proximity to Abidjan,
favorable climatic conditions in the winter months and a tropical landscape
featuring wide, fine sandy beaches, palm groves and mangroves. On the other
hand, it is considerably more distant from generating markets than the beaches
in Senegal and The Gambia and has unpleasant climatic conditions in summer. In
addition, the rapidly falling ocean shelf creates powerful undertows near the
beach which make swimming unsafe.  In spite of these drawbacks, it is conceivable
that in the long run European demand for winter beach vacations will grow to the
point where new hotel projects at Assinie become feasible.  Clearly, however,
development efforts in the short term should be concentrated on increasing the
utilization of existing accommodation rather than on expanding capacity.  The
improvement of Les Paletuviers' management and the implementation of a marketing
program designed to attract package tours from Europe and Abidjan should be part
of these efforts.



- 25 -
C. Interior
4.08       Offering an atmosphere of total depaysement to non-Africans, the
folklore, traditions and wildlife of the interior are undoubtedly the most
distinctive tourism assets of the Ivory Coast. Although bednights in hotels of
the interior have increased from about 55,000 .&n 1972 to over 137,000 in 1976
(Annex I, Table 11), room occupancies are still of the order of 30%. An exception
is  Bouake (and Korhogo discussed below), a regional industrial and agricultural
center on the north/south axis between Ouagadougou and Abidjan. There, in spite
of significant expansion of capacity, occupancies are in excess of 80% in some
hotels.
4.09       Despite difficult communications in the rainy season and expensive
air transport, there is considerable scope for increasing rates of utilization
in existing capacity outside the two main cities. The successful example of
the Korhogo hotel is worth mentioning in this connection. Despite its having
expanded from 22 to 55 rooms, this hotel raised its bed occupancy from less than
50% to above 70% in 1977 due to the appointment of a professional hotel manager
who, with the assistance of ICTA, succeeded in attracting package tours from
Abidjan.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Analysis of Hotels
5.01       The line of credit will be utilized largely to finance medium
category hotels (three stars in the Ivorian classification system, approximately
equivalent to the two-star category under the French nouvelles normes) in
Abidjan. Several investors and managers interested in this kind of project have
already been identified. The mission therefore examined the profitability of
a 100-room hotel of this type under current revenue and costs and various price,
occupancy, and incentive scenarios. While returns for specific projects will,
of course, vary from case to case, the results for the model give a good profile
for a typical investment as envisaged under the proposed line of credit.
5.02       The main sources of data are operating receipts and costs collected by
the mission and financial reports (income statements and balance sheets) submitted
to the fiscal authorities of 7 city hotels with a total of about 1,200 rooms and
Ministry of Tourism data on costs of hotel operation. In addition, consultant
studies (e.g., market appraisal of smaller, lower category hotels) and feasibility
studies for hotels currently under construction (Sebroko, Novotel, Konankro) were
used. The basic assumptions on capital costs, revenues and operating expenses
are given in Annex III. Average room rates take into account information on
double occupancy and discounts from published tariffs. Employment is assumed to
be fixed with no seasonal variation. Similarly, given the level of occupancies,
utility and maintenance charges are assumed to be fixed. It has been assumed
that the hotel would be managed by a professional management company, whose
remuneration would be 3% of sales and 10% of Gross Operating Profit (GOP), to
ensure proper systems and training for the hotel. On the evidence available,
there is no significant difference between rates of change in hotel revenues
and costs and general indicators of inflation. During construction, a 10% rate
of inflation was used, dropping to 7% for the operating phase. An economic
life of 20 years was used throughout.

5.03       Table 9 summarizes the first 8 years of operation of the model under
the basic assumptions. Gross Operating Profits level off at 31% of sales (after
the sales tax exemption period when the rate is about 10 points higher) and the
ratios of net profit to sales and to equity turn positive in the third year;
dividends of 14% could be paid from the third year. Cash flow is sufficient to
provide comfortable debt service and interest coverage. Accumulated losses in
the first 2 years offset somewhat the income tax holiday advantage (7 years);
the 10% FNI, 1/ however, is not exempted and is paid in any year where there is
taxable income. The basic rate of return is 13.7% on investment and 13.0% on
equity in current prices; in constant prices the rates are 6.7 and 6.0%
respectively.
5.04       These rates of return are not high but are consistent with experience
found in other countries and are adequate to provide assurance of reasonable
returns to investors, lenders and managers. Investors are likely to have stable
annual returns and, given the dynamic Abidjan urban real estate market, the possi-
bility of capital gains if the property is sold; lenders have the assurance of a
sound capital structure, adequate collateral in a well maintained building and
the cash flow to service debt comfortably; managers have the prospects of a
strong market situation which should generate the operating profits necessary
to assure a reasonable return.
5.05       Particular conditions affecting the model are the high tax rates
(50% in the base case) and interest rates (11.5-15.5% nominal) which account for
the lower returns to equity in spite of a fair degree of leverage (65/35 debt/
equity ratio initially). The other factor heavily influencing the base rates
is replacements. Removal of replacement costs (based on technical amortization
of buildings and equipment) increases the rate of return on equity by over 80%
and the overall rate of over 40%. To the extent that replacement policy is a
management decision rather than a physical requirement, the base case may under-
state returns. Sensitivity tests on the base case (in constant prices) are
summarized in Table 10.
1/  FNI (Fonds National d'Investissement) issues certificates equal in value to
10% of taxable income which carry a 40-year life and 2-1/2% interest rate.
They can be used for new investments within 3 years up to their total value
or up to 75% of their value can be used for the purchase of SONAFI bonds
which carry 10-15 year maturities and 7% interest. If not utilized by the
owner, FNI funds revert to the Government. It is not clear whether this
10% deduction should be considered as a reserve or as a tax. The mission
calculated RORs with and without FNI, that is, at 50 and 40% corporate tax
rates. At the 40% tax, the rates of return are 7.7% (overall) and 7.8%
(equity).

In the base case, a room occupancy curve of 55, 65, and 75% for the first 3
years of operation was used. These rates are below rates prevailing at several
existing three-star hotels but are considered reasonable insofar as rates will
probably decline with capacity expansion and certainly, over the 20-year economic
life assumed, sustained higher rates would be unlikely. Although a hotel typically
does take three-five years to reach full operating level, with the pressure on
three-star hotels in Abidjan, hotels may reach high occupancies more quickly.
For this case, i.e., assuming the hotel reaches 75% in its first year of operation,
the rate of return increases from 6.7 to 8.6% (overall) and from 6.0 to 9.6%
(equity). In recent years, large hotels have taken two years to reach full
operating levels.
5.06       Hotel tariffs are controlled by the Ministries of Tourism and Commerce
who together form the commission on hotel prices. Such controls are designed to
provide an orderly link between sectoral prices and the general movement in prices
at the macro-level and to eliminate temporary fluctuations which could endanger
the medium- and long-term growth of tourism. However, such controls may reduce
profitability in a sector where rates of return are already low and are contra-
dictory to the Government's hotel investment incentive policy which is aimed at
raising rates of return and encouraging entry to the sector. The policy should
therefore be reviewed with a view to eliminating such anomalies and to let market
forces operate. The Ivorian authorities are aware of the distortions that price
controls can bring and, with regular reviews, have been increasing ceilings to



- 29 -
respond to the general movement of prices. In the short run, however, the Govern-
ment is strongly opposed to relaxing price control but in the medium term, as hotel
capacity expands and competition heightens, it is willing to review its policy and
to relax controls. The Government would remove price controls on hotels tariffs
by the end of 1981 in order to permit hoteliers to charge market prices. In its
place, the more flexible system of price liberation should be established whereby
hotel managers would register prices (reflecting both quality and location) with
Government; prices would then be posted in the hotel and Government would ensure
that hotels do not charge more than posted tariffs. It was further agreed that
until price controls are removed, the Government would introduce a single ceiling
system instead of the present two-tier system and that prices would be reviewed
at least annually.  In the profitability analysis, it was assumed that a single
ceiling system is in force.
B. Incentives
5.07       Incentives play a critical role in providing the level of returns to
equity. Without incentives the rate of return on the model hotel falls to 2.4%
on investment and to 0 on equity. The impact of each incentive is shown below:
Table 11: IMPACT OF INCENTIVES
Investment IRR %    Equity IRR %
Base case                              6.7                 6.0
No incentives                          2.4                   -
No income tax holiday                  5.3                 3.5
No import duty exemption               4.3                 1.8
No sales tax (TPS) exemption           3.6                 0.8
Of the incentives, the sales tax is clearly the most important inasmuch as it
provides cash flow in the early years of operation; the import duty exemption
also has significant impact. Present incentive levels are effective in increasing
low returns on investment to higher levels and should be maintained in the short-
to medium-term.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Hotels
6.01       Since individual hotels to be financed under the project have not been
identified, economic rates of return have been estimated for a marginal addition
to hotel capacity represented by the "typical" hotel subproject described in the
financial analysis above. Rates of return have been calculated for alternative
sectoral occupancy rates and, therefore,given the projected demand growth, for
the corresponding alternative assumptions about the size of the program. The



- 30 -
optimum occupancy rate (program size) would be the one at which the ERR on a
marginal addition to hotel capacity just equals the opportunity cost of capital
(11% in the Ivory Coast).
6.02       The net benefits from a new Abidjan hotel comprise (a) the incremental
guestnights due to the hotel, multiplied by (b) the benefits associated with them,
less (c) the reduction in revenues in other hotels due to the lower prices which
would be charged with the new hotel as compared with the situation without it,
and less (d) the incremental costs associated with the new hotel, i.e., investment
costs, fixed operating costs, and the variable operating costs associated with
incremental visitors. The following paragraphs discuss the estimates of these
items.
6.03       Some of the visitors who are expected to stay in the new hotel are
not incremental to the economy because they could have been accommodated in
existing hotels in periods in which they operate below saturation levels. As
saturation is difficult to measure, the sensitivity of the ERR to the different
estimates of incrementality set out in Table 12 is tested. The "low estimate" of
incremental guestnights is based on the assumption that all guestnights are incre-
mental on days when occupancy rates are 90% or higher and, since weekend guest-
nights in Ivory Coast hotels comprise mainly businessmen staying over from one
week to another, that the same proportion of weekend as weekday guestnights is
incremental. The "high estimate" assumes that the nonincremental bednights are
only one-half of those in the low incrementality case, and the "base case" incre-
mentality estimate is the mean of the two.
Table 12: ESTIMATE OF INCREMENTAL GUESTNIGHTS AT
DIFFERENT SECTORAL ROOM OCCUPANCY RATES
Sectoral room occupancy rate           70%        75%       80%        85%
Proportion of guestnights
which are incremental:
Low estimate                     .36       .43        .51        .62
High estimate                    .68       .71        .76        .81
Base estimate                    .52       .57        .63        .71
The same incrementality ratio is applied to all types of visitors (Ivorians,
foreign residents, businessmen and vacationers; Annex IV, Table 4). The ultimate
occupancy rate on a "mature" hotel will be higher than the sectoral average which
includes new hotels with occupancy rates lower than the average. With a demand
growth rate of 12%, and with the initial occupancy build-up assumed in this report,
mature Ivorian hotels will on the average have occupancy rates 4% higher than the
sectoral average.



- 31 -
6.04       Benefits include expenditures in hotels by all incremental hotel
guests and expenditures outside the hotel by nonresidents (who account for 68% of
guestnights). Hotel revenues per room occupied (including the 10% sales tax and
5% service chxrge), 1/ amount to US$72.60, in 1978 prices. Of this, US$35.78 are
room receipts, US$19.96 food receipts, US$10.74 beverage receipts, and US$6.13
other receipts. Assuming a 1.2 double occupancy factor, total hotel revenues per
guestnight come to US$60.50 and room revenues to US$29.82. 2/
6.05       Based on a 1976 survey of departing tourists, plus adjustments for
subsequent changes in prices, it is estimated that European businessmen spend
US$35.54 per day outside hotels, African businessmen US$24.79, and holiday visitors
US$26.62. Expenditures outside hotels average out at US$32.69 per foreign guest-
night and thus total expenditures per foreign guestnight come to US$93.19. To the
extent that some visitors would stay in nonhotel accommodations in the absence of
hotels, these incremental expenditures may be overstated. On the other hand, the
above benefit estimates do understate the economic return to the Ivory Coast from
incremental foreign business visitors. Their expenditures in the Ivory Coast may
be less important than the share of the Ivory Coast in the gains from the trade
and investment which they initiate. In the absence of a basis for estimating
these gains, the latter are excluded from the analysis, thus introducing a
conservative bias in the estimation of the economic returns.
6.06       Not all revenues to hotels from incremental visitors are incremental
to the Ivory Coast economy since an increase in hotel capacity would lead to
lower prices (and lower profits) to existing capacity than would have prevailed
in the absence of capacity expansion. Since foreign hotel visitors to Abidjan
are for the most part businessmen, the short-term elasticity of demand for hotel
accommodation is probably quite low. Nevertheless, demand is not completely
inelastic, especially in the longer-run, as there are alternatives to staying in
hotels such as nonhotel accommodation or greater use of telecommunications and it
may also be possible to stay in the country for shorter periods of time. The
base case assumption is that the elasticity of foreign guestnights with respect
to price (measured by foreign visitors' daily expenditures in the Ivory Coast)
is -5. This means that expenditures by incremental visitors should be reduced
1/  The 6% tourism tax, which is expended exclusively on tourism promotion, is
excluded from the benefit and cost streams.
2/  The estimates of prices which would obtain at different sectoral occupancy
rates are approximate since the interactions of prices, occupancy rates, and
congestion are known only imperfectly. It has been assumed that (a) the
hotel tariffs in the financial analysis apply to a situation of 75% sectoral
occupancy rates, (b) that expenditures per foreign visitor per day are
higher by 2% for each 5 points increment in the sectoral occupancy rate, and
(c) that these changes in price are reflected in the room tariff alone which,
since the room tariff is one-third of total expenditures per day, rises by
6% for each 5 points increment in the sectoral occupancy rate. The resulting
room revenues per guestnight are as follows:
Sectoral occupancy rate                 70%       75%      80%       85%
Room revenues per guestnight (US$)   28.12    29.82    31.60    33.50



- 32 -
by 20% in estimating benefits. Only 60%, however, of the decrease in profits
due to the capacity increase would be suffered by Ivorians; the rest would be
borne by foreign management companies and investors. Therefore, 88% rather than
80% of the expenditures of incremental visitors are included in the net
benefit stream.
6.07       The costs associated with the incremental hotel have been derived from
the financial analysis, with the exception that variable costs associated with
nonincremental demand have been excluded from the analysis. The costs associated
with providing goods and services to visitors outside hotels are analyzed in
Annex IV, Table 1, which also indicates the incremental investment/output ratios
used to estimate the investments required to meet incremental demand for these
services.
6.08       On the basis of the Ivorian input-output table, investment and opera-
ting costs were disaggregated into: (a) African skilled labor; (b) African
unskilled labor; (c) land; (d) other domestic resources; (e) foreign exchange;
and (f) duties and indirect taxes. Foreign exchange is shadow-priced at 1.15 of
the official exchange rate, based on the ratio of the domestic prices of traded
goods and services to the prices at which they are traded with foreigners (1.00
and 1.22 are used for the sensitivity analysis). The value of non-African
(expatriate) labor is considered only through the economic impact of the disposal
of its income on foreign exchange, domestic expenditures and taxes and comes to
82% of its nominal cost. African labor is considered on a "regional" basis,
with benefits to non-Ivorian-African labor valued in the same way as benefits
accruing to national labor. This gives a shadow rate for all unskilled African
labor of .65 of the market wages. Economic pricing of .5 and .85 of the market
price is used in the sensitivity analysis. African skilled labor and other
domestic resources are valued at their market price. Land is valued at an
annual rental of 11% of its purchase price, inflated by 3% per year to reflect
a rising real cost.
6.09       The following table sets out the rates of return on the marginal unit
of hotel capacity for different sectoral occupancy rates and hence for different
sized investment program. Interpolating the best estimate ERR's, the optimum
sectoral occupancy rate (when a new hotel earns 11% at the margin) would be 72.8%.
Occupancy rates and hence the implied program sizes are sensitive to incrementality;
the low incrementality estimate would imply the desirability of a 77.5% rate,
whereas use of the high incrementality assumption would imply a rate of less than
70%. The shadow pricing assumptions are also significant: exclusion of shadow
prices would raise the target occupancy rate to 79.4% suggesting an investment
program somewhat smaller than the proposed 1,300 rooms in Abidjan.
6.10       A sectoral occupancy rate of 75% has been chosen for determining the
hotel expansion program to be financed by the proposed project. At this
occupancy rate, the rate of return on a marginal unit of hotel capacity would



- 33 -
come to 14%, somewhat above the opportunity cost of capital. This also provides
an estimate of the ERR on the typical hotel to be financed under the loan. 1/
6.11       This analysis indicates that the "simple" ERR on a hotel, which
considers the receipts and costs of the hotel alone, without adjustments for
incrementality, price elasticity, or shadow prices, is a few points under the
best estimate ERRs (in the case of the 75% occupancy rate it is in fact 11.5%).
Use by CCI of an 11% cutoff rate for "simple" ERRs in its appraisals may there-
fore be expected to provide a useful indicator of the economic viability of pro-
posed Abidjan hotels, without requiring elaborate analysis of externalities and
shadow prices. More comprehensive economic analysis will normally be required
for hotels in other areas which would typically require construction of comple-
mentary infrastructure.
Economic impact
6.12       The hotel investment program financed by the project is expected to
have a significant impact on employment, on the balance of payments and on
Government revenues. During the construction period about 5,000 man years of
employment will be generated. Once all 1,300 rooms envisaged by the project are
completed, 1,500 permanent jobs will have been created in the hotels and as many
jobs in activities directly related to tourism outside the hotels. Further
incremental employment will be created in sectors which supply part cf their out-
put to the tourism industry. When all hotels built under the project are in full
operation, foreign exchange receipts of US$31 million are expected annually. Once
account is taken, however, of foreign exchange payments for the operation and
maintenance of new tourist facilities, the net foreign exchange inflow is estimated
at US$20 million, or 65% of gross receipts. Public sector receipts from the tourism
development tax (para. 3.16), income taxes on hotel corporate income and the
salaries of hotel employees, sales taxes and import duties generated by the hotels
under the project are expected to amount to US$8 million per year from 1992 onwards,
when all the exonerations provided by the tourism incentives law expire.
B. National Park
6.13       The fundamental economic justification of the investment program at
the Azagny park is that the park will generate revenues in excess of the resources
necessary to establish and maintain it and to install and operate the planned
tourism facilities. There will also be scientific and cultural gains from
preserving one of the few remaining examples of West African swamp and rainforest
habitats still offering a full range of the original species of flora and fauna.
The investment costs of the program described in paras. 2.12 to 2.17 come to
US$1.8 million in 1978 prices, including physical contingencies. Project opera-
ting costs, including all costs except those which would be incurred if the area
were not turned into a national park, amount to US$50,000 per year.
1/ Although the ERR on going ahead with the program, as compared with not going
ahead with it, has not been calculated, it would be higher than that on the
marginal hotel since the hotels in the program, taken as a whole, compete
with, and divert clients from, existing capacity only, whereas any particular
hotel in the program competes with both existing hotels and other hotels
in the program.

6.14       The present level of demand is low largely because of the physical
constraints that the project is designed to remove. The medium-term demand
forecast envisages 6,500 visitors per year by 1985, about half of whom are
expected to be foreign visitors. In the longer-term, by the year 2000, the
total number of visitors is expected to reach 22,000, a number approaching the
organizational and ecological limits of the park. 1/ About 15,000 of these
visitors are expected to come from abroad; most of the rest will be foreign
residents of the ivory Coast (the foreign population of Abidjan alone was about
50,000 in 1978).
6.15       Incremental revenues to the park administration when the full visitor
potential is reached are estimated at somewhat less than US$160,000 per year
resulting from a US$7 entry fee for incremental visitors and from existing
visitors who currently pay no fees. Given the type of expected visitors and
the general level of hotel and tourism service prices in the Ivory Coast, the
level of the proposed entry fee is considered reasonable.
6.16       Further economic benefits are expected to be derived from visitor
spending on overnight stays and food and drink consumption in the visitor center
to be built under the project, on boat rides, on guide services, on the purchase
of souvenirs and on transport to and from the park. 2/ Food and lodging expendi-
ture is expected to amount to an average of US$28 per visitor while expenditure
on drinks would average to US$7 per visitor. Expenditures on boat rides are
estimated at US$6 per person while the average visitor is expected to spend US$4
for souvenirs sold in the visitor center. Guide services are expected to cost
US$2 per park visitor. The cost of transport to and from the park would come
to an average of US$20 per person.
6.17       On the basis of the economic cost and benefit streams (Annex V, Table 1)
resulting from the assumptions, projections and estimates described above and an
economic life of 20 years (with no residual value taken into account) the internal
economic rate of return for the Azagny park investment program is 16.5% and the
present value of net benefits is US$544,000. A decrease in project benefits of
25% or an increase in investment costs of 25% would leave economic returns above
the opportunity cost of capital. If the project were defined to include tourist
facilities alone (excluding the US$465,000 cost of relocating families which now
live within the proposed limits of the park), the economic rate of return would
be 25.7% and the present value of net benefits US$962,000.
1/ The base for the visitor series is 3,212 for 1979; the growth rates used
are: 20% for 1980, 15% for 1981 and 10% annually thereafter (see Annex V,
Table 1).
2/ A large number of the expected nonresident visitors to Azagny would prolong
their stay in the Ivory Coast in order to visit the park. Some of them
will be accommodated in the small hotel in the park while others will
occupy their hotel rooms in Abidjan for an additional night. A smaller
number will in fact be likely to keep their room in Abidjan while spending
the night in the park lodge or in the hotel in neighboring Grand Lahou.
Benefits from increased occupancy of this hotel and of other hotels in
Abidjan have not been credited to the project.

and a project manager appointed and maintained on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank not
later than January 1, 1980 (para. 2.34);
(q) the proposed staffing for Azagny would be maintained
unless the Bank should otherwise agree for the duration
of the project (para. 2.36); and
(r) by the time the last hotel under the first line of
credit opens, the Government would introduce a
system of price liberation to replace the present
price control on hotel tariffs (para. 5.06).
With these conditions fulfilled, the project would be suitable for a World Bank
loan of US$14.2 million.
