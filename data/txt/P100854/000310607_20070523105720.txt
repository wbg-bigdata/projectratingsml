Description         As a key component inthe Government's efforts to reform the public sector
                    and support the competitiveness o f the productive sectors, the Presidency,
                    the Ministry o f Finance and the Minister o f Public Works have initiated a
                    major strengthening o f the Ministry o f Public Works. This DPL focuses on
                    the core components o f that reform program, namely improving
                    effectiveness o f the Ministry's infrastructure planning capabilities; a
                    reorientation o f contracting and concessioning activities toward service
                    standards and greater competition in the bidding process; an integrated
                    approach to project management; a strengthening o f the Ministry's
                    regulatory capacity; and the development o f an appropriate normative and
                    organizational structure for the Ministry. The loan i s supported by a
                    Technical Assistance Loan in which the Bank will help finance capacity
                    buildingandtechnical consultancies ineacho fthe core areas o freform over
                    a five year period. The amount o f the DPL i s to be disbursed in a single
                    tranche upon effectiveness.
Benefits            The overall development objective i s to support the Government's reformo f
                    the Ministry o f Public Works by strengthening its planning functions;
                    developing performance standards for contracts and concessions; improving
                    project management; strengthening regulatory oversight of public works and
                    private contracts; and embedding the organizational changes in appropriate

I.INTRODUCTION

InfrastructureDevelopmentinChile

1.    Inthe early 1 9 9 0 ~the Government of Chile took stock of its infrastructure needs
                              ~
and estimated its infrastructuredeficit at US$l1billion with additional losses due to lack
o f competitiveness o f US$1.7 billion annually.' In determining how to respond to this
need for massive investments and significant improvements in service delivery, the
Government also recognized that the public sector did not have the resources to carry out
the major works required, nor could it commit its budgetary resources exclusively to
infrastructure investments given the country's social investment needs.

2.    To help face this challenge, the Government called on the private sector to take part
in the building, maintenance and operation o f major road works.       Thus, the Chilean
Concessions System was born, allowing the private sector to finance economically
profitable projects and recover their investment primarilythrough direct charges to users.
In the years since its inception, the concession program has expanded both in terms of
sectors and design. Sectorally, Chile now has what may be the world's most extensive
concession program encompassing roads, ports, railroads, bridges, tunnels, reservoirs,
jails and canals. In addition, the current list o f projects to be concessioned includes
hospitals and even public plazas and sports stadiums. Chile's concession program uses a
variety o f structures to allocate risk and to achieve financial-economic equilibrium,
including explicit transfers from government, revenue and volume guarantees, shadow
tolls and entirely user fee-based contracts,      To reflect these different risk-sharing
arrangements, the Government has experimented with biddingunder least cost variables,
least net present values and lowest cost subsidy requirements.

3.    As the diagram below illustrates, the Ministry o f Public Works' concessions
portfoli-including       roads and highways, bridges, airports, dams, canals, prisons, and
other public edifices-has     risen from about 450 billion pesos in 1995 to over 1 trillion
pesos in 2005 in real terms. More strikingly, the share o f private sector participation in
those yearly investment levels has risen from 9 percent to 65 percent over the course o f
the last decade.

4.     The public and private infrastructure expenditures graphed above represent about 2
percent o f Chile's GDP per year.2 Those investments levels-in                    tandem with electricity
sector unbundling, telecommunications liberalization, municipal water and sanitation
privatizations, and a separate port concessioning program-represent                              a financial
commitment to infrastructure services beyond that of any other country in Latin America.
At between 5 and 7 percent o f GDP per year, Chile's total infrastructure investment
levels-all     sectors, public and private-are            similar to the expenditure levels of East
Asia's higher performing economies. Chile's average growth level over the last 15 years
has also outpaced most o f the rest of Latin America due to a convergence of strong
economic policies, including this stable commitment to infrastructure investment.

5.     There i s widespread agreement that a substantial part o f Chile's infrastructure
deficit would not have been reduced over the past decade, concomitantly with the
strengthening o f public finances, without concessions and other public-private
partnerships. The concessioning program in particular has attracted global attention due
to its depth-larger       than the public finance component of public works in recent years,
and breadth-covering          such varied sectors as highways, airports andjails.

6.     In addition to the growing concessions program, over the last two years the
Government o f Chile has announced a significant expansion in the public financing o f
infrastructure. The intent i s to provide Chile's regions and export products with greater
access to markets and to further improve the levels of basic services for Chilean
consumers. The administration recognizes that both its growing public investment and
concessioning programs will require greater attention in terms o f planning, contract
design, project management and oversight in order for them to maximize their potential
as contributors to higher growth levels.


 Sectors covered by Ministry of Public Works include transport assets such as inter-urban roads, urban
roads, highways, bridges, and airports; water resource infrastructure such as dams, storm drainage systems,
and canals; rural infrastructure such as small water systems, ferry landings, and fishing ports; and public
buildings such asjails, hospitals, and schools.

11.COUNTRY CONTEXT

Recent Economic Developments in Chile

7.    Over the past four years, the Chilean economy has reestablished solid economic
growth, fueled by robust domestic demand and record high copper prices. GDP growth
accelerated from 2 3 percent in 2001 and 2002 to 5.7 percent in 2005. Growth in 2006
                     -
slowed to 4.0 percent.       Macroeconomic indicators also demonstrate a strong overall
performance with declining levels o f debt to GDP, rapidly increasing average income
levels, and low and stable inflation.

8.    The latest IMF Article IV Review completed in September 2006 commended
Chilean authorities for their continued implementation o f sound policies based on a
cautious fiscal rule, a good inflation targeting framework, and trade liberalization. The
IMF noted that these policies, combined with a solid financial system, have led to
sustained economic growth and contributed to poverty reduction. With a disciplined
fiscal policy, a broadly neutral monetary policy, and foreign currency earnings expanding
as a result o f historically high commodity prices, the Government's primary concern has
become the achievement o f higher economic growth.           In an updated assessment o f
developments and policies in Chile made in April 2007, IMF staff reiterate that the
country's macroeconomic policies set or conform to best international practice in many
areas. The economic slowdown in 2006 i s explained partly by one-off disruptions in
copper production, high energy costs, and lumpy investment, while the economy i s
expected to grow closely in line with potential this year (see Annex 3). Chile i s on the
standard 12-monthArticle IV consultation cycle.


Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

9.    On March 11,2006 Michelle Bachelet succeeded Ricardo Lagos as Chile's elected
President-the     fourth successive representative o f the Concertacibn coalition to hold the
office since 1990. The new government reaffirmed its commitment to the prudent
macroeconomic management and the outward oriented economy o f previous
administrations while expanding access to public services that will help more Chileans
contribute to the country's growth and development. The 2007 Budget, submitted to
Congress on September 30, 2006, i s in line with these priorities. Total government
spendingwill be increased by 8.9 percent in real terms, with more than two thirds o f this
increase going to social programs. The spending increase i s to be financed in part
through increased copper revenues.

10. The central government has become a net creditor, with debt claims equivalent to 7
percent o f GDP at end-2006. Gross central government debt has fallen from 38.8 percent
o f GDP in 1991 to a record low o f 5.3 percent of GDP at end-2006. Gross Central Bank
debt declined from 52.8 percent o f GDP in 1991 to 16.6 percent at end-2006. Low debt
levels contribute toward insulating the economy from the adverse effects o f external
shocks and allow the government to pursue stabilization policies.            Chile's strong
economic performance and continued favorable global conditions resulted in an upgrade


                                                                                           3

of its Moody's long-term foreign-currency credit rating in July 2006, from "Baal" to
"A2"' bringing it to the levels of new EU members such as Poland and the Slovak
Republic.

11. Looking ahead, the medium-term macroeconomic projections o f the Chilean
authorities are for real GDP growth to stabilize at about 5 percent per annum, which it
considers the country's sustainable growth rate (Table 1). The strong macroeconomic
fiarnework provides a solid basis for these growth projections, with stabilization policies
having enhanced the country's growth prospects. Public savings have grown to the point
where the country is a net creditor and the Government's credibility as a debt issuer in
international markets has been further enhanced.                  Adverse shocks would be
counterbalanced by the Government's ability to pursue counter-cyclical fiscal policies,
thereby reducing macroeconomic instability and ensuring the sustainability o f social
expenditures. Inturn, the country is expected to reap the socio-economic benefits o f the
increased social expenditures since the early-1990s interms o f higherhuman capital and
productivity.

12. Chile's actual medium-term growth could well be higher than projected in the
authorities' baseline scenario depending on how effectively the challenges are met. Chile
has an enviable macroeconomic policy environment, solid financial sector and laudable
institutions. The challenge now i s to foster policies that encourage innovation; enhance
educational quality and attainment for all Chileans, and provide adequate physical
infrastructure for growth.         One area o f focus is the continued strengthening o f the
framework for infrastructure investment and service delivery. The proposed reform o f

the Ministry o f Public Works i s integral to this aim, as it i s designed to improve growth
prospects by improving administrative efficiency, reducing subsidies and contingent
liabilities, and strengthening the competition framework inthe infrastructure sector.



111.THE GOVERNMENTPROGRAMAND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES


LatestGovernmentPlanfor Growth

13. To boost job creation and growth, President Bachelet created the "Infrastructure
Development for Competitiveness Plan" at the inception o f her administration to ensure
that public infrastructure can help different productive sectors be more effi~ient.~The
Plan calls for a US$115 million increase inpublic spending on infrastructure in2007, and
it marks the first step in an ambitious program over four years, from 2007 to 2010. The
Plan depends significantly on private sector involvement through improved collaboration
and through tax incentives to stimulate private investment inpublic roads. Inannouncing
the Plan, the President noted that the Public Works Ministry would be supervising
infrastructure concessions worth US$2.2 billion between 2007 and 2010.

14. On March 13, 2007, the Government announced the details o f its "Chile Invests"
Plan that provided details on the context inwhich this greater emphasis on infrastructure
investment would be carried             The new plan includes an initiative entitled, "Creating
a More Agile Government," which directly calls for the modernization o f the Ministry o f
Public Works and describes the key points o f the Institutional Strengthening Program.
The Plan calls for a new legal structure for the Ministry that separates out responsibilities
for roles and hnctions (e.g., planning, contract design, execution, oversight); strengthens
technical capacities (e.g., through integrated project management); and creates the
Superintendency o f Public Works to regulate contracts and concessions.

15.    Several other initiatives described in the new growth plan also support the
objectives and components o f the reform.               Under "Accelerating Investments," the
President outlines a program for improving the execution and quality o f public
investments.        This includes better planning coordination, greater oversight o f
investments and maximizing the competitive bidding processes in public works
contracting-all     core elements in the Institutional Strengthening Initiative.              Under
"Expanding Human and Capital Innovation," the Presidency refers to the need for
integrated plans for the development o f key clusters or supply chains ("clusters claves"),
such as the fishing, forestry, and mining industries.               This concept is central to the
Integrated Planning initiative underway at the Ministry o f Public Works and the specific
analysis referred to inthe Growth Planwill serve as the basis for the first set o f integrated

investment plans undertaken at MOPW. Finally, "Making Chile a Tourism Destination"
describes the importance o f efficient and effective transport networks that link the
regions-a   primary concern o f MOPW as it embarks on its institutional strengthening
program.


Linkto the ProposedDevelopmentOperation

16. The current administration has identified specific constraints to the operations and
institutional structure o f the MOPW that it believes will need to be addressed in order for
Chile to reach a new level o f efficiency and accountability in infrastructure investment.
Those challenges include:

    Planning:
        0  Lack o f medium and long-term planning with an integrated geographic
           perspective orientedto the competitiveness o f Chile's productive sectors.
           Low level o f interaction with other relevant stakeholders in infrastructure
           sector and a lack o f societal or consumer voice inproject planning.
           Investment programs which are contract-driven rather than integrated along a
           supplychain, leadingto coordination difficulties and inefficient expenditures.

    Standards, Contracts and Competition:
           Lack o f explicit service standards embedded in concessions or public works
           due to an historic focus on input-driven rather than performance-based
           contracts.
        0  Uneven levels o f competition during biddingprocesses for either concessions
           or public works exacerbated by lack o f information correlating outcomes to
           contract size, structure, design elements or biddingprocedures

    Project Management:
           Low levels o f accountability related to project outcomes due to an atomized
           approach to project management with different individuals responsible for
           each stage o fproject development.
           Poor availability o f information about project costs, contract management or
           design and construction issues.

    Oversight and Regulation:
           Institutional inability to provide effective oversight o f contracts and
           concessions according to agreed upon levels o f service, let alone cost
           elements.
           Lack o f ability to consider consumer concerns or even to assure public access
           to information inthe oversight o f services.




                                                                                          6

     Organizational Reform:
            An organizational structure that does not provide for clear separation o f roles
            and responsibilities among the four major areas of activities-planning,
            contract design, project management and regulation.

17. Measures to address these challenges make up the core components o f the
Institutional Strengthening Program for the Ministry o f Public Works. The Government
o f Chile has requested that this reform initiative be reflected in a Development Policy
Loan (DPL) and supported with a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) from the World
Bank.     The two loans focus on strategic interventions that reflect the Bank's
infrastructure lending and technical assistance program throughout many Middle Income
Countries. Integrated planning, rational project management, appropriate public-private
contract design, and regulatory structures that protect both consumers and investors are
areas o f core competence for the Bank.

18. The Government o f Chile has requested the Bank's involvement inthis initiative in
order to leverage the Bank's experience in logistics and territorial planning, the design o f
public-private contracts, in project management and in the development o f regulatory
frameworks for infrastructure. In addition, the Bank offers a comparative advantage in
its ability to draw upon global knowledge, sustain a policy dialogue, and exploit
synergies with other operations and technical support including, but not limited to, the
Territorial Development Project, the Transantiago Urban Transport DPL and TAL, and
the fee-for-service technical assistance on the valuation o f contingent liabilities in
infrastructure. Finally, both the Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry o f Public Works
were attracted by the synergies that could be gained from having both a DPL and a
Technical Assistance Loan to finance several o f the key initiatives spelled out in the
objectives section o f this Project Document. The thematic and substantive linkage o f the
two projects provides an effective framework for monitoring and evaluating the
implementation ofthe reform program.

19.     The imperatives laid out in the Government's Program are directly linked to the
Institutional Strengthening o f the Ministry o f Public Works. Indeed, the Ministries o f
Finance and Public Works expect the proposed reform to deliver benefits that are called
for specifically by the Presidency and which will outweigh the cost o f the reform
initiative-estimated at about US$60 million over 5 years-by          between one and two
orders o f magnitude. These benefits include administrative efficiencies, fewer subsidies
and contingent liabilities, more efficient contracting and concessioning, greater
competitiveness through lower logistics costs, and greater public confidence in Chile's
service provisionmodel. These are described insome detail below.

        Administrative Efficiency of MOPW:
        0   The Ministry o f Public Works spends about US$120 million per year on
            administrative costs. If the planned reforms-particularly      those related to
            Integrated    Project   Management     and   the    complementary      systems
            implementation being rolled out by the Ministry-are    able to drive efficiency
            gains in the design, contracting and implementation o f works equal to 15



                                                                                          7

         percent of administrative activities, the entire reform will pay for itself in less
         thanfive years.

    Reduction inCost o f Subsidies and Renegotiations:
         Another motivation for the reform i s the increasing frequency, size and
         publicity surrounding Chile's concession renegotiations, and, relatedly, the
         potential cost o f MOPW's revenue and traffic guarantees for concessions. As
         presented in the Table below, the Ministry o f Finance and the World Bank
         have estimated the present value o f potential expenditures on guarantees at
         US$5.2 billion-about        72 percent o f the total expenditure from existing
         concessions. Clearly, the triggering o f all guarantees i s an almost impossible
         scenario to imagine in Chile's current economic and political condition.
         Nonetheless, the value o f remaining subsidies and payments for services is in
         itself US$2.4 billion and the Government has spent around US$777 million in
         renegotiation commitments to date-about            11percent o f the total value o f the
         concessions program.

    Because o f these potentially large liabilities, the Ministry o f Finance has decided
    to establish a process for closely monitoring MOPW's program o f guarantees and
    the related renegotiations. The Government i s convinced that greater oversight of
    concessionaires' performance against contracted service standards and better
    information about the true unit costs o f original investments will help to reduce
    the frequency and unit costs o f "convenios complernentarios."

    OPerational & Investment Efficiency o f Concessions and Contracts:
        The Ministry o f Public Works currently manages an annual budget o f about
        US$l.2 billion for expenditures on public works and leverages an additional
        US$600 million to US$l.10 million on privately financed concessions. The
        concessionaires' financing portion i s a reflection o f the contribution o f user


                                                                                                    8

fees to the cost o f constructing, maintaining and operatinginfrastructure assets
under the MOPW's jurisdiction. One o f the primary motivations, or objectives
o f the Institutional Strengthening Program, is to seek greater efficiency and
accountability inpublic and private investment contracting, that i s to eliminate
"gold-plating" (Le., over-investment in otherwise necessary assets) and the
construction o f "white elephants" (i.e. investments in unnecessary assets).
This will be done through a combination o f the strengthening o f oversight
mechanisms and improved Planning processes that look at demand for
infrastructure services across an entire region and logistics chain.

The contractual design, biddingprocedure and regulatory reforms are intended
to make MOPW's concessioning program more efficient. As can be seen
from the Diagram below, that program has varied in value from US$600
million to US$l.l billionper annum in recent years. A 15 percent gain inthe
value for money from these contracts could lead to US$lOOmillion per year
savings.

In addition, operational and investment efficiencies o f rehabilitation and
maintenance works are a primary target o f the "Standards, Contracts and
Competition" initiative o f MOPW's reform program which seeks to establish
output-oriented contracts and greater competition in the bid selection and
award process.     A review o f performance-based road conservation contracts
conducted by the World Bank in 2005 shows that perfomance-based
rehabilitation and maintenance contracts can save between 15 and 30 percent
o f total expenditures when compared with standard short-term contracts, once
contractual costs and agency contributions are considered. While MOPW i s
moving toward a deeper form o f conversion from short-term input oriented
contracts to longer-term output driven contracts, and intends to apply the same
approach across all sectors, a 15 percent savings for the roads and highways
portion (70 percent o f budget) o f MOPW's public expenditures would be
around US$126million per year.

         Reduction inChile's Lopistics Costs Burden:
         0    One of the most important links between the Institutional Strengthening
             initiative and the Government's growth program i s the desire to increase
              Chile's competitiveness. The best proxy for the competitiveness o f Chile's
             products, from the perspective o f the services provided by MOPW, i s logistics
              costs: the burden borne by shippers for transporting, storing and transferring
              goods. The World Bank has estimated Chilean logistics costs as a share of
              GDP at 16 percent as compared to OECD competitors who spend on average
              10 to 11 percent o f GDP.'                      If better intermodal linkages through more
              effective planning and project implementation decreased the logistics burden
             on firms by so much as 10 percent, that economic windfall alone would be
             US$2.3 billion. Indirectly, but more importantly, Chilean producers would be
              able to reinvest a large portion o f the savings from the lower cost of transport
              services which would contribute to greater competitiveness, job creation and
             growth.

         Increased Public Confidence inBasic Service Provision Model:
         0   While increased public confidence in the way in which Chile contracts and
             manages basic service provision cannot be quantified, its political and social
             benefits are o f first-order importance to the current Administration. Intrying
             to govern a nation with extraordinarily high income disparities, a growing
             sense o f democratic entitlement, and increasingly vocal frustration from the
             high cost of services, the Government sees the responsiveness to consumer



 These estimates do not consider ocean shipping contribution to logistics and do not weight for differences
between nations' baskets of goods produced and consumed. Economies that are dependent upon the
shipment of low-value goods, such as commodities, may have higher over-all logistics costs than countries
that primarily move higher value-added goods.


                                                                                                         10

            concerns inthe design and execution o f works and contracts as an invaluable
            objective o f the proposed reforms.

Participation

20.   Broadening participation in public infrastructure investment i s one o f the central
motivating factors for this initiative. The current administration has found that a lack o f
information about the pricing and quality o f service provided by contractors has
undermined public and institutional confidence in the effectiveness o f Chile's well-
known concessioning program.

21. In order to make real the concept o f participatory policy setting and oversight in
public investment, the Ministry o f Public Works has set about reforming its approach to
regulation, creating a Unit for Oversight ("Fiscalizacidn") o f Public Works for quality-
of-service oversight and imbedding its functions in detailed draft legislation. The draft
versions o f those laws have already been subjected to detailed scrutiny by consumer
groups, the associations o f construction firms, concessionaires and the relevant chambers
o f commerce. The Bank has contributed to the development o f this project, inreviewing
and commenting on the interim drafts as it moved toward the final draft submitted to
Cabinet for review.

22.   The detailed design o f the implementing rules and regulations for the Unit and
potential Superintendency o f Public Works will benefit from further consultations with
user groups-both   domestic and industrial, as well as investors and operators. One o f the
expected outcomes will be a new window for consumers into infrastructure contracts
allowing them to comment and seek redress for insufficient performance vis-a-vis quality
o f service commitments.



IV.BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

Linkto CountryPartnershipStrategy

23.   Size o f Proposed Prowam: The 2007 Chile Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
proposes a flexible program approach which will define the Bank's program over the
continuum o f a lending range. The total amount o f lending is expected to be between
US$200 and US$250 million. In the 2002 CAS, the Bank committed approximately
US$450 million. Because exposure to IBRD, and public external debt in general, i s not
an issue inChile, the amount o fnew lending depends on client demand.

24.   Objectives: The objective o f the joint IBRD-IFC Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) i s to support Chile's efforts to converge with OECD income levels and living
standardsby (i)  accelerating growth and (ii) buildinga more equitable society. The Bank
Group strategy is based on the maintenance o f close engagement with the authorities,
which in recent years has yielded important results in support o f key Government
programs and through flexible, timely support that advances Chile's development vision



                                                                                        11

and leverages the Bank's comparative advantage in strategic sectors and global
experience indifficult development challenges.

25.   The Bank has worked closely with the authorities to identify areas where it might
be best prepared to support these objectives: innovation and business climate; education;
social protection; regional development; environmental management; and, centrally,
infrastructure and public services.

26.   The Government o f Chile has requested the Bank's involvement inthis initiative in
order to leverage the Bank's experience intransport and logistics planning, the design o f
public-private contracts, regulatory frameworks, and organizational reform. In addition,
the Bank offers a comparative advantage in its ability to draw upon global knowledge,
sustain a policy dialogue, and exploit synergies with other operations and past
experiences.

27.   The Technical Assistance Loan for the Institutional Strengthening o f the Ministryo f
Public Works that parallels this proposed DPL focuses on core activities for which the
World Bank provides a comparative advantage inits technical capacity and global reach.
While the overall Program i s estimated to cost about US$63.4 million-including
systems upgrades and other modernization initiatives, the TAL from the World Bank will
finance US$11.7 million in studies, training and technical support related to reforms in
the core business functions and legal/regulatory andorganizational arrangements.

Collaborationwith the IMF and Other Donors

28.   The Bank Group's program i s beingcoordinated with Chile's other development
partners, notably the IMF and IDB.

29.   International Monetary Fund (IMF): The joint World Bank-IMF FSAP was
completed in August 2004. The IMF has worked as a team-member on the Fee-for-
Service Project for Valuing Contingent Liabilities inInfrastructure.

30.   Inter-American Development Bank (IDB): The most recent IDB Country Strategy,
which was presented to the IDB Board inJanuary 2007, envisages continued engagement
with proposed lending o f approximately US$350 million. The Bank is working closely
with the IABD on all fiduciary products, including the CFAA, and on developing new
options for country systems in procurement.            In addition, the IDB's Multilateral
InvestmentFund (MIF) has initiated two grant programs ininfrastructure both o f which
are closely related to Bank operations. The first was a grant for US$1.25 million for the
development o f the concept design for Transantiago. Most recently, the MIF's Board
has approved a US$900,000 grant program for the "Development o f an independent
regulatory system for the quality o f service o f Public Works." These grant funds will help
finance the development o f the Superintendency o f Public Works and the tasks covered
under the MIF's program have been coordinated with the Regulatory Strengthening
Component o f the MOPW InstitutionalStrengthening Technical Assistance Project.




                                                                                         12

31.   The International Finance Corporation (IFC):       The IFC has provided support to
advance the Government's development objectives in growth and competitiveness, and
has placed greatest emphasis on projects in which IFC's involvement would have a
demonstration effect in sectors identified as high priority by the government, including
infrastructure and, increasingly, energy.      In recent years, IFC's interventions have
focused on support for SMEs and specialized financial market activity including housing
finance, infrastructure, tertiary education, and the social sectors. From FY02 through
FY06 IFC committed US$364 million, including US$148 million for syndications
through the B-loan program. The commitments financed nine projects in five diverse
sectors spanning education, finance, information, transportation and utilities. As o f
December 31, 2005, IFC's portfolio for Chile stood at US$264 million (including
syndications), about twice the level at the beginningo f the 2002 CAS period.

32.   Global Environment Facility (GEF): A GEF Air Quality and Sustainable Transport
project for Santiago was approved by the Board in November 2003. The purpose of this
US$6.980 million grant is to help reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) from ground transport
through the promotion of a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting
forms o f transport, and the adoption of sustainable low-GHG transport measures. To that
end, the GEF project will support the implementation o f the 2000-2010 UrbanTransport
Plan for Santiago and will complement the proposed DPL in two ways: Firstly, it will
finance the next stage o f the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) o f Transantiago,
currently under progress. Secondly, it will help consolidate the reform program through
the design o f a social mitigation strategy for transit workers that might have to leave the
sector; monitoring o f the operation environmental impacts; and scrapping o f the obsolete
buses that will stop runningin Santiago.




                                                                                         13

Relationshipto Other BankOperations

33.   There are currently six IBRD loans and one GEF grant in Chile's operations
portfolio. The primary lending and advisory operations of relevance to the proposed
program are the Contingent LiabilityValuation Fee-for-Service Technical Assistance; the
Infrastructure for Territorial Development Project; and Transantiago Urban Transport
DPL and TA Loans. These are briefly described below:

34.   Valuation o f Contingent Liabilities: The on-going fee-for-service work on the
valuation o f contingent liabilities that i s beingconducted by the Bank in conjunction with
the Ministries o f Finance and Public Works i s perhaps the most directly relevant piece o f
work for the proposed project. Its objective i s to assist the Ministries o f Finance and
Public Works to measure, value and mitigate contingent liabilities related to explicit and
implicit guarantees for infrastructure investment.          The objective o f the technical
assistance i s to develop and facilitate the adoption o f the model that estimates the likely
cost of these liabilities over time. The modeling initiative arises from a recognition that
the degree and value o f concession renegotiations have grown considerably in recent
years.

35.   Infrastructure for Territorial Development Project: In2005, the Bank approved the
Infrastructure for Territorial Development Project which aims at increasing the effective
and productive use o f sustainable infrastructure services by poor rural communities in
selected territories. The project has three components: 1) assist local stakeholders and
regional government agencies; 2) support feasibility and design studies o f subproject
proposals to submit for financing, rehabilitation o f rural roads and construction,
rehabilitation and expansion o f rural water, sanitation, electricity and ICT infrastructure,
and supervision o f the mentioned works; and 3) support project coordination units at
national and regional levels, implementation o f studies and capacity building to
strengthen policies and institutions in areas o f territorial planning and rural infrastructure
service delivery, and project monitoring, evaluation and learning as a contribution to
national level expansion o f the program. The Territorial Development Project captures
the geographic approach to integrated planning in which several areas o f intervention-
roads, water, power, telecommunications, rural market development-are             planned and
implemented simultaneously within in a target area. This cross-sectoral planning and
investment concept to raise regional productivity and living standards is a core
component o f the Planning initiative being undertaken by the Ministry o f Public Works
and supported by the proposed DPL. While the scope of the two projects and degrees o f
decentralization are different, the implementation challenges of this project               are
instructive in all ways-conceptually,        administratively and operationally-to    the DPL
andTAL for MOPW.

36.   Santiago Urban Transport DPL and TAL: Transantiago-an              urban transport plan
designed to integrate the transport system o f Metropolitan Santiago-is           intended to
reduce congestion and pollution and increase safety through the development o f
dedicated bus lanes and the rational use o f urban transport services. The Bank has
supported the implementation o f Transantiago with a US$30 million Santiago Urban


                                                                                            14

Transport DPL. In addition there is a US$6 million technical assistance loan to support
implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

37.  Other relevant analytical activities planned for the near future include a Regional
Development Strategy for two regions.

Lessons Learned

38.  The design o f the Program takes into account the experiences gained and challenges
felt by the three most recent infrastructure projects (Santiago Urban Transport DPL,
Santiago Urban Transport Technical Assistance Loan and Infrastructure for Territorial
Development Loan), as well as infrastructure DPLs implemented inother Latin American
countries. These lessons may be summarized as follows:

       Commitment o f the Government to the Bank's operations i s crucial. Past projects
       have ensured this commitment from the start through close with the implementing
       agencies in project design. However, this does not always capture the political
       risks associated with reforms. Sufficient commitment to launch the Program and
       to initiate reform o f internal processes and structures has come from the MOPW
       itself, with budgetary support from Ministry o f Finance. The DPL's link to the
       TAL helps to raise the political profile o f the project and to spread the
       responsibility for success to other key Cabinet ministries-particularly           the
       MinistryofFinance. Moreover, apolicy-level statement from the President, who
       has explicitly called for the Institutional Strengthening o f the Ministry, provides a
       basis for pursuit o f the legislative underpinnings o f the reform. Over the medium
       term, the reform itself has to become part o f a broad-based discussion about the
       efficiency, efficacy and responsiveness o f government to the demands o f
       domestic and industrial consumers.


    0  Stability o f the implementation unit staff is essential. Some recent operations
       have been delayed due to frequent changes o f the team in charge of the
       implementation. The TAL that will finance the reforms that are at the core o f the
       proposed DPL will use, and further train, core MOPW staff for fiduciary,
       procurement and legal oversight rather than create a free-floating PIU. MOPW
       has already appointed the key members o f the Project Management Team and
       they have begun training in Bank procurement and project management
       procedures.

    0  Even with Chile's deserved reputation for technical, legal, financial and economic
       skills, capacity buildingi s required inpublic institutions inorder for reforms to be
       implemented properly. The TAL specifically addresses this issue, reform by
       reform, with detailed plans for capacity building inthe areas o f planning, contract
       design, regulation and project management.

       Creating consensus among the various stakeholders o f a project i s central to
       successful implementation. This lesson i s particularly important for an initiative
       that involves different approaches to planning, and greater regulation and


                                                                                          15

        transparency o f works contracts and concessions.         Over the past year, the
        Government has begun the process o f consultations with key stakeholders inside
        and outside of Government-particularly          surrounding the creation o f the
        Directorate for Oversight ("Fiscalizacidn ") and in the preparation of the bills
        amending the Law on Concessions and creating the Superintendency o f Public
        Works. Further consensus will be achieved on planned reforms through the
        organization o f workshops and seminars with consumer groups, investment
        groups, construction associations, the relevant chambers o f commerce and with
        the introduction o f international best practices. Financing for this capacity and
        consensusbuildingi s included inthe TAL.


Analytical Underpinnings

39.   Beyond the analytical work on contingent liabilities described above, the
Government o f Chile has undertaken several important studies to prepare for the program
outlined inthis document.

40.   General Reform Program: The design o f the DPL, and the supporting TAL, i s
underpinned by several analytical initiatives that are described below. The institutional
restructuring o f MOPW itself i s being driven by an internally prepared 1OO-page program
document that lays out all o f the intended areas o f reform for the Ministry. The World
Bank has advised inthe development of that document and has assuredthat the structure
and key components of the Technical Assistance Loan run parallel to the MOPW's
internal plans. To support this effort, the President o f Chile, on March 12, 2007, made a
public pronouncement in which she described the Institutional Strengthening Program of
the Ministry o f Public Works as a central initiative in the Government's endeavors to
reform the public sector and return to higher levels o f growth. The Ministry o f Finance
has directly supported the reform initiative by budgeting US$7.5 million in funds
explicitly for MOPW's institutional strengthening program inthe 2007 budget.

41. In addition, the reform is supported by two studies that are focused on the
regulatory and organizational change elements.         These studies include a study of
Institutional Issues, and a Design Strengthening Plan to help the MOPW. In parallel to
these studies, MOPW's information systems group has mapped the management systems
required for supporting the reform o f the Ministry.

42.   Regulatory Arrangements: As the institutional and regulatory studies evolve, the
World Bank has been supporting the regulatory reform process by providing information
on best practices for regulatory bodies throughout OECD countries with similar scope
and objectives as the nascent Unit for Oversight ("Fiscalizacidn") and proposed
Superintendency o f Public Works.       The initial review has found that, while several
industrial countries have moved toward perfonnance-based contracts in roads and other
areas o f public works, there are very few cases o f independent regulation for these sub-
sectors. Conversely, most OECD countries which have implemented clear regulatory
responsibility for infrastructure services have done so for network utilities such as water
supply, electricity, gas, or telecommunications. That said, the Australian states o f New


                                                                                        16

 South Wales, and, inparticular, Victoria, are the fbrthest along in exploring the potential
of independent quality-of-service regulation for services similar to those implemented by
MOPW. With project preparation resources, the World Bank prepared a description o f
the Australian arrangements.     New Zealand also has contract design and regulatory
mechanisms specific to the roads sector which will be o f relevance to the Chilean
proposal.

43.   Performance-Based Contracting and Road Maintenance Concessioning:                The
program for shifting from short-term maintenance contracts to medium-term,
performance-based and network-wide "conservation" concessions has been prepared by
the Roads Directorate o f MOPW. The major 3-Volume Study on the new road program
for non-traditional concessions i s complete and the pilot projects are near initiative in
Region IV based upon this analytical work. A matrix summary o f the major similarities
and differences between this program and Chile's standard road concession program is
attached to this Program Document inAnnex 7.

44.   Planning: Chile's Office o f Innovation has initiated a study o f Supply Chain areas
("Clusters Claves") to identify those which would most benefit from an integrated
approach to infrastructure service planning and investment. As a result o f this analysis,
the Planning Department o fMOPW will first implement its integrated planningapproach
for the Fisheries Sector. Inaddition, the Planning team o f MOPW has also contracted an
independent consultant to provide basic training in the concepts o f land-use/territorial
modeling. These initiatives lie at the core o f the reform to the planning function that the
Administration envisions as they will allow MOPW to plan investments in unison with
other infrastructure providers, to minimize investments in (`white elephants" (Le,
unnecessary assets) and to coordinate multimodal linkages in the transport network that
reduce logistics costs and, inturn, help the competitiveness o f Chile's goods.

45.   Environmental Risks and Mitigation: A series o f studies have been conducted on
Chile's needs in the area o f environmental management. These papers were presented in
August at a conference in Chile organized and sponsored by the World Bank. Recent
appointment o f a Minister o f Environment by the President echoes the recommendations
o fthat work.


V. THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

46.   The Ministry o f Public Works represents, in many ways, a linchpin in the Chilean
economy. Its own budget o f US$1.25 billion makes it one o f the largest financiers o f
construction inthe country. The additional US$600 million to US$1.1 billion per year in
concession investments that it leverages makes it the primary driver o f public-private
partnerships in the country. Its rural infrastructure programs provide direct services for
much o f the country's poor. Its modest attempts at monitoring contracts and concessions
provide users with their primary source o f protection. Perhaps most profoundly, the
infrastructure network that it builds underpins the competitiveness o f most major
industries inChile.




                                                                                         17

47. Proposed Program Development Objectives: The over-all policy objective of the
Development Policy Loan i s to support the Government's reform of the Ministry o f
Public Works by strengthening its planning functions; developing performance standards
for contracts and concessions; improving project management; strengthening regulatory
oversight of public works and private contracts; and embedding the organizational
changes inappropriate legal and normative structure. This, inturn, is meant to contribute
to the Government's objectives o f greater efficiency in the use of public resources; and
increased transparency, competition and citizen participation in the contracting and
concessioning o fpublic works.

48. The DPL will support each of the five main areas o f MOPW's Institutional
Strengthening with the following specific development objectives, including:

Operation Description

49.   The proposed DPL will provide support for the primary elements o f reform o f the
Ministry o f Public Works-Chile's    primary source of investment and concessioning of
infrastructure. From the planning of infrastructure through to the regulation o f contracts,
the Institutional Strengthening Program covers each stage inthe on-going activities o f the
Ministry and seeks to sustain those changes through a new organizational structure. The
Diagram below outlines the main Policy Areas o f support recognized by the DPL and the
parallel reforms supported by the attending TAL.

the Government to launch each key area o f reform. (These are described inthe following
section on Prior Actions.) Just as importantly, the program defines (i)                                                                                                                        a subsequent series

the reform period i s being supported by a Technical Assistance Loan from the World
Bank. The monitoring o f progress o f the TAL'Scomponents will allow for the evaluation

preparation o f a second DPL with prior actions or triggers related to the expected results
from each area o freform ifthe Government were to request such support at a later stage.

 Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership
   TheinstitutionalStrengthening ofthe MinistryofPublic Works has entered into the political vocabulary
   of the Bachelet Administration, which has provided the highest level o f ownership to this sectoral reform.
   The President andthe Minister ofFinance have specifically delineated the objectives and components of
   the program inpublic address and have committed the Administration to presenting the legal package
   that underpins the proposed reform this year.
   To date, the Administration has shown its willingness to pushahead with difficult public sector reforms
   and its f i s t major Cabinet changes illustrate the general popularity o f the proposed Institutional
   Strengthening Program. Inparticular, the Government has worked to incorporate the concerns of the
   major private sector stakeholders, the union officials within the Ministry, the nascent consumer advocacy
   community and the related public agencies.
   Extensive analytical work has beenundertaken over the last year, with contribution from the Bank, to
   develop the new legal framework, and to assess global best practice inthe areas o fplanning, contract
   design, concessioning, project management and regulation.

 Principle2: Agree up front with the governmentand other financial partners on a coordinated
 accountabilityframework

   The policy matrix represents the result o f extensive discussions with the Ministryo fPublic Works and
   the Ministry o f Finance over the course o f the evolution and preparation o f the project.
   The Inter-American Development Bank'sMultilateral Investment Fundis contributing grant funds to a
   core component o f the Institutional Strengthening initiative-Regulatory       Strengthening. The tasks to be
   financed by the World Bank under the related TAL and which are referenced inthis Program Document
   reflect the harmonization o f the two institutions' objectives and interventions.

 Principle3: Customize the accountabilityframework and modalitiesof Bank support to country
 circumstances

   The DPL tranche releaserepresentsa signal ofthe Government's commitment to the reform and aplace
   mark for the achievement o f the plannedobjectives over the coming years. The related TAL provides the
   continuity neededto assure the implementationof these technically complex reforms over the course of
   five years.
   Chile's particular requirementsincluded Bank support for Technical Assistance inalignment with each
   of the stated objectives o f the DPL. This provides a clear linkage to accountability and allows the
   MinistryofFinance to maintainanactive role inthe oversight of the sectoral reform.

 Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresultsas conditionsfor disbursement

   The number o f prior actions has been limitedto five. Inaddition, there is a single condition for
   effectiveness representing the presentation o f a draft law to Congress which is seenas a milestone o f the
   Executive's commitment to the Program. Together, these six actions represent the first critical steps in
   each o f the main areas o f reform.

 Principle5: Conducttransparent progressreviewsconduciveto predictableand performance-based
 financial support

   The Programhas been designed and timed explicitly so that the cost o f the Institutional Strengthening
   will be included inthe 2007 budget o f the Ministryo fPublic Works.
   The proposed mechanisms for review are closely related to expected progress ineacharea ofreform and
   strike a balance between achievable results and the desiredobjectives o f the components.




                                                                                                              20

Policy Areas

51. The description, government actions, challenges, Bank assessment and objectives
for each area o f reform are described below.       Prior actions and conditions for loan
disbursement are provided inthe subsequent boxes:


Policy Area 1: Integrated Planning

52.   Description: Currently, the MOPW plans its investments at the project level. Each
technical directorate-roads,    ports, airports, water resources-has   a planning manager
whose primary responsibility i s to secure the resources necessary for financing the
envisioned works. This inductive process leads to uneconomical investment decisions
and prevents the integration o f investments (e.g., among sectors regionally and between
inter-connected modes o f transport). Moreover, the planning function i s at risk o f being
captured by narrow budgetary incentives as each directorate i s compelled to use its
planningstaffto make the case for greater resources.

53.   Government Actions: The initial government actions involve redefining both the
approach to planning and the skills base to improve and strengthen the role o f planning.
The approach currently under design and supported by the TAL include the latest
international best practices in the areas of supply chain integration and territorial
development. Both o f these schools o f planning look at regional development beyond
political borders and across sectoral interventions and seek synergies ininvestment.

54.   Challenge:    Technically, as planning approaches are broadened, it becomes
increasingly difficult to drive project design and implementation raising the risk that the
project pipeline-and    needed investments-will      slow.   This challenge must be met
through significant training and capacity building so that project staff can develop a
greater understanding o f planning tools at all levels o f the organization. In addition,
overcoming the institutional incentives for using planning functions at the directorate
level in order to lobby for funding will have to be backed by bold organizational
adjustments at the Ministry.

55.   Bunk's Assessment: This i s a core initiative for the MOPW which addresses both
the internal organization structure and incentives as well as efficiency inuse o f resources.

56.   Objectives of Reform: The objective of this area o f reform i s to assure the rational
use o f resources and highest value for money in investment. This will be done by
strengthening the MOPW's process o f planning in two dimensions:            (i)Regional or
geographic planning for the development o f infrastructure platforms that raises the levels
o f both productive and social infrastructure throughout a given macro-zone; and (ii)
Integrated planning along supply-chains to identify infrastructure bottlenecks and
increase sectoral competitiveness, incorporating all infrastructure, service and regulatory
components of a given product's logistics systems.




                                                                                          21

Policy Area 2: Standards, Contracts and Competitiveness

57. Description: Inthe area o f infrastructure concessions, the Ministry o f Public Works
has found that it needs to improve its ability to oversee the current contracts or to
negotiate change orders from a position o f knowledge. While advocating for the creation
o f an independent regulatory body (Superintendency o f Public Works-see            below), the
MOPW recognizes that a new oversight agency i s not enough; greater information i s
required on each concession and works contract, and, more hndamentally, the contracts
themselves need to be more oriented toward output or performance indicators rather than
input or detailed investment mandates in order to meet the expectations o f users.
Likewise, for public works contracts, the MOPW i s planning to migrate from short-term
(3-5 year), input-defined maintenance contracts for individual roads toward longer term
(13-17 years) road "conservation" concessions for road networks. Annex 7 provides a
detailed description o f all the primary elements o f these new types o f conservation
concessions and contrasts them with MOPW's standard concessioning program for
higher volume roads.

58. Bank Assessment: The Bank has long supported the adoption o f performance-based
contracts throughout Latin America and inmiddle income countries in other regions with
sufficient capacity to monitor and evaluate performance. These contracts generally
provide the opportunity for greater efficiency and higher quality road networks although
they require more careful oversight.

59.   Challenne:     There are several challenges related to standard setting, contract
redesign and review o f competitive tendering processes that comprise this initiative. The
single greatest challenge i s defining the service standards that are expected from the new
contracts so that they are both monitorable and reasonable. That is, the new design must
not inject elements o f risk into the contract that result in lack o f interest from bidders for
contracts, yet they must provide users with safe infrastructure over the long term that i s
reasonably priced given the level o f service. An additional challenge for the conversion
o f public works contracts to longer term concessions i s to sustain yearly budget limits in
the caseo funforeseen expenses.

60.   Objectives of Reform: Develop levels o f service standards for infrastructure and
establish the use o f model contracts and procedures to promote competition and to assign
risks appropriately.


Policy Area 3: Project Management

61. Description:      The current approach to Project Management at MOPW can be
described as compartmentalized. Separate managers are utilized, according to area o f
micro-specialization, for each stage in the development o f a project: feasibility, design,
construction, monitoring.      This provides for disjointed implementation, stress on
communication among teams, and lack o f accountability. It also inhibits the accurate
collection o f information about an investment, makingregulation difficult.




                                                                                             22

62.    Government Action: The MOPW i s now beginning the process o f implementing a
more modern "lifecycle" project management approach in which individual project
managers will retain responsibility for projects from inception to completion and will
draw upon the necessary skills to undertake each stage o f development accordingly. A
program o f twelve pilot projects o f varying sizes, geographic location and sectors has
been identified while selected staff members have begun attending training on modern
management techniques. Directorate-level resolutions have been passed naming Project
Managers and assigning them "lifecycle" responsibilities for specific projects.

63.    Challenge: In this area, the greatest challenge will be developing the skills at the
individual level to oversee projects throughout their lifecycles. In tandem, the Ministry
will have to derive a new organization model at the directorate level which supports this
approach.

64. Bank Assessment: The Bank recognizes that this reform, perhaps more than any
other, delves into the culture o f operations that has long evolved at the MOPW.            In
assessing the pragmatism o f the initiative, the Bank supports the piloting approach-
conducted jointly with extensive training on project management methodologies-
envisioned by the Ministry.

65.   Objective of Reform:      Modernize the design and construction process under an
integrated management approach that covers the full life cycle o fprojects.



PolicyArea 4: Strengthening of Regulation or Oversight ("Fiscalizacidn'9

66. Description:       Although more than half o f all recent investments in Chile's
infrastructure are undertaken by private concessionaires, there is currently no
independent regulatory body overseeing MOPW's concessions. The MOPW has found
that its own ability to assess real costs is hindered by its limited ability to access
information, exacerbated by the input-orientation o f contract design. While the massive
private investments program to date has contributed to Chile's competitiveness and
growth, concerns have grown recently about the asymmetry o f renegotiations to the favor
o f the private sector; the lack o f transparency in contracts; the lack o f consumer voice in
the design and oversight o f the quality o f the infrastructure service provided; and the
potential for rent-seeking by service providers given the lack o f information and
regulation.

67.   Government Action:       Chile's current administration has taken the initiative in
addressing these imbalances in the market by drafting a new law to create a
Superintendency o f Public Works and by instigating a process for redesigningnew public
works and concessions contracts according to output or performance criteria.           In the
interim, the Administration has created a Unit for Oversight ("Fiscalizacidn "), under the
Ministry o f Public Works, but with its own budget allocation, a former Minister of
Housing as Unit Director, a staff o f 40 and facilities that are separated from the main
MOPW offices. The Unit has been give the power to advise on regulatory policies, assist



                                                                                          23

in the drafting of the law, and prepare contract and concession standards that will be
reviewed as part o ftheir on-going responsibilities.

68.   Challenges: The challenges will be, most immediately, passing the proposed bill
through Congress and enacting it as a law. Beyond that, strengthening the Unit cum
Superintendency so that it will be able to play the role o f fair assessor o f performance
based on independently secured information will be a complex process. Last challenge
will be to involve users inthe monitoring process through an efficient Consumer program
and to address their concerns.

69.   Bank Assessment: There are few countries in the world-including             within the
OECD-that      have successfully implemented an independent regulatory body for
transport infrastructure and other forms o f public works.         This is both innovative,
challenging and, for Chile, important, given the role o f these contracts inthe provision o f
services throughout the country and the recent deterioration in public trust surrounding
these arrangements.

70.   Objective of Reform:      Develop a regulatory framework (fiscalizacidn) for all
infrastructure services to be implemented by an institution that i s independent o f the
planning and contractingprocess


PolicyArea 5: OrganizationalReform

71. Description: On March 19th, 2007, the President o f Chile announced her
administration's intention to enshrine the organizational changes under consideration at
MOPW-as       defined in the TAL-in      a new Ministerial Law for Public Works (``Ley
Orghica del Ministerio de Obras Publicas 'y. This initiative will need to incorporatethe
structure and procedures for each step o f the lifecycle o f activities of the MOPW. The
Bank will finance, under the TAL, about half o f the cost of this endeavor which will
include the use o f legal experts, and coordination with the institutional development team
inthe drafting and consultation process needed to present the amended law to Congress.
Should a full legal reform prove to be impracticable, the resources will be utilized for the
development o f normative arrangements that allow for the separation of roles and
arrangements among the planning, contracting, project management and oversight
functions o fthe Ministry.

72.   Government Action: MOPW officials estimate that the proposed legal packages to
be presented to Congress will require considerable consultations and redrafting as they
work through the legislative process. By prior experience, each bill goes through an
average o f five revisions.

73.   Furthermore, the MOPW envisions contracting a reputable international firm with
experience inorganizational change and business process re-engineering to undertake the
core institutional development work associated with MOPW's reform.




                                                                                         24

74. In addition, MOPW has requested that the Bank finance, under the TAL, a large
portion (about 50 percent) o f the cost o f defining the work scope and institutional
arrangements for a new integrated Water Resource Directorate. This task stands alone
from the other institutional arrangements since it i s dependent upon on-going discussions
with other agencies dependent on water resources, namely agriculture, fisheries and
municipal water and sanitation services as well as the newly created Environment
Ministry. The Bank financed portion will thus focus on the integrating and coordinating
aspects o f the proposed unit, resulting in a strategy for the institutionalization of a unified
oversight body. The final definition will be financed by MOPW.

75.   Finally, the Ministry o f Public Works has identified a series o f initiatives required
to provide a baseline o f norms, implementing rules and regulations that will redefine the
detailed functions o f the Ministry according to the new planning, contracting, project
management, works execution and oversight activities. The steps inthis process include
creating a cadastre or registry o f existing norms; and clarifylng the procedures that
regulate the creation, evaluation and approval o f new projects; creation o f the systems
and procedures for populating, maintaining, disseminating and updating information
systems; implementation o f those procedures; and the creation o f a web-based database
o f the new norms and procedures. The Bank has been asked to finance, under the TAL, a
small portion o f these processes, particularly related to the procedures for creating new
implementing rules and regulations.

76. Challenaes: The single greatest challenge to the over-all reform i s Congress's
willingness to pass the underlying legal instruments-particularly the Law for the
Creation o f the Superintendency o f Public Works, the Amendment to the Law on
Concessions and the Amendment to the Ministerial Law for Public Works (``Ley
Orgdnica ")-in order to establish firmly the proposed structural and operational reforms.

77. Bank Assessment: The legal challenges remain as a modest risk to the success o f
this program although the President o f the Republic has publicly raised the
Administration's commitment to pushing through the legislative agenda related to
MOPW's reform. The Superintendency and Concessions Laws are already presented to
Cabinet and are expected to be presentedto Congress by end-May 2007. Inthe event that
legal reform i s not practicable, MOPW will focus on the significant institutional and
procedural changes that can be undertaken without a change in the law. These include
the conversion o f contracts to outputhesults orientation, new bidding procedures to
maximize corruption, strengthening o f integrated planning and project management
processes, and the oversight responsibilities o f the Unit for Oversight ("Fiscalizacidn ")
of Public Works.

78.   Objective of the Reform: To institutionally and legally separate the areas o f
planning, contracting, execution and regulation of MOPW's sectors in order to allow for
a system o f checks and balances according to a rational and transparent assignment o f
roles and responsibilities.




                                                                                             25

Summaryof PriorActions

79. The proposed DPL derives its Prior Actions from the first key steps taken by the
Government of Chile under each policy area listed above.            In the Policy Area o f
Integrated Planning, the Government i s attempting to move from investment-level
planning to a planning approach that incorporates regional development needs across
infrastructure services as well as the competitiveness o f supply chains for key export
products. The first two key steps that incorporate these elements have been launched.
Programmatic agreements between MOPW and the regions have been signed in at least
two o f the regions outside o f the Greater Santiago Region that define the manner in
which the regional governments and the central ministry will jointly develop
infrastructure planning and financing arrangements. On the logistics, or supply chain
contribution to planning,        the Minister has launched the "Infrastructure            for
Competitiveness Plan," initiating the process o f producing four integrated infrastructure
plans to better serve the core industries o f Mining, Agriculture, Tourism and Forest
Products.

80. Inthe Policy Area o f Standards, Contracts and Competition, the Ministry envisions
the migration from input-defined contracts and concessions to those that are driven by
results or service standards. The first major effort to define a sample set o f performance
standards for long-term road maintenance and conservation concessions has already been
completed. The medium-term outcome will be a set o f standards and basic contract
structures for all sectors o f MOPW's involvement as well as refined biddingprocedures
that maximize competition among investors, operators and contractors.

81.   In Project Management, MOPW's intent to move from a highly fragmented
approach to task oversight toward integrated responsibility and accountability in project
management has already been launched. The Prior Action undertaken i s the issuance of
two Ministerial Resolutions naming Project Managers with explicit responsibility for the
integrated lifecycle o f specified projects. By the end o f the reform period, the Ministry
hopes to have transformed the approach to project management across all sectors,
injectinghigher levels o f accountability for project outcomes, impacts and information.

82. Inthe area o f Regulatory Strengthening, the Government has embarked on perhaps
the most ambitious element o f reform o f MOPW. While it has already established and
staffed a Directorate or Unit for Oversight ("Fscalizacidn "), the conversion o f that unit
into a truly independent body capable o f regulating concession and contract performance
according to service standards will take several years.

83.   Finally, the policy area o f Organizational Reform seeks to create a normative and
organizational system o f checks and balances by separating MOPW's roles o f planning,
contracting, and execution o f works and oversight o f services. The MOPW has drafted
and presented to Cabinet a Law of the Superintendency that details the key institutional
objectives o f the strengthening program related to oversight functions and the monitoring
o f service standards in contracts and concessions. The single condition o f effectiveness
o f the proposed loan i s the presentation to Congress o f a draft law that i s substantively
consistent with the draft already reviewed by the Bank, and which establishes, inter alia,


                                                                                          26

a new mechanism for oversight o f public works contracts and concessions, and new
criteria for the approval o f concessions based on levels o f service.

84. Annex 2 contains the detailed Operations Policy Matrix while the Box below
provides a summary o f the Prior Actions, already completed, which correspond to each
Policy Area o f the Institutional Strengthening Program.

VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

Poverty,Social andEnvironmentalImpacts

85.     In Chile, the social impacts of investment activities such as land acquisition,
resettlement or public health are categorized as components o f environmental impacts
and so this assessmentcombines social and environmental aspects under one heading.

86.     The Bank recognizes that the Ministryo f Public Works, like any agency involved
inthe financing o f infrastructureprojects, plays a central role inthe environmentally and
socially sustainable development o f Chile's economy. It i s the Bank's view that this loan
will result inno significant negative poverty, social or environmental impacts. Inorder to
leverage the opportunity o f the reform, the Bank and the Ministry have incorporated into
the Institutional Strengthening Program-supported             by the proposed Technical
Assistance Loan-several      tasks aimed at lessening the social and environmental impacts
o f public works.   The tasks call for assessing and strengthening the areas o f impact
assessment, contract design and oversight as well as the feedback mechanism for
consumers and third parties affected by project development. In addition, the Integrated
Planning Component o f the reform program i s intendedto introduce two rounds o fpublic
consultations into the early stages o f investment planning so as to minimize negative
social impacts and maximize consumer benefits.

87.     Overall, the Bank has found that Chile has a strong system o f social and
environmental safeguards, particularly in terms o f the legal and policy environment.
Projects are categorized according to potential risk, magnitude and importance o f social
and environmental impacts, similar to the World Bank's approach. Currently, two
different types o f environmental assessments are carried out, based on project category.
A full Environmental Impact Study is required for projects which pose potential adverse
impacts on health, natural resources, entail major resettlement o f population, are located
near protected areas or have a high potential o f affecting the scenic value o f an area or
could potentially alter areas o f high cultural or historical value. Projects that do not pose
potentially adverse impacts are subject to more limited Environmental Impact
assessments. In addition to the EA legislation, projects have to comply with specific
environmental and natural resources legislation according to their particular setting.
These specific norms refer to projects that can involve:

        cutting trees inor near forested areas;
        constructionactivities inor near wetlands;
        activities which implyimpacts on local fauna;
        landuse plans imply additional restrictions on subproject location;
        water rights must be available for all water supply systems;
        wastewater treatment plants entail additional health permits;
        projects near cultural property sites follow specific legislations; and
        construction activities require permits for burrow pits, quarries and extraction o f
        river materials.



                                                                                           28

Based on the strong legal and policy environment, and the Government's commitment to
addressing environmental and social impacts, Chile is a strong candidate for making use
of the country's own systems and gradually reducing the prescriptive approach to
safeguards inBank-fundedoperations. This i s expected to bringabout a more sustainable
and consistent approach to safeguards at the country level, with reduced transaction costs
and improved quality and consistency inindividual operations.


Implementation, Monitoringand Evaluation

88.    Because the sustainability o f the program defined in the DPL is directly related to
the successful implementation o f the related TAL'S components, the Monitoring and
Evaluation of each component o f the Institutional Strengthening Program will be an
integral part o f tracking the sustainability o f this DPL. Indeed, the TAL encompasses the
reforms in all o f the core business areas o f the Ministry as well as the development o f
MOPW's organizational and normative structure.


Fiduciary Aspects

89. According to the conclusions o f Chile Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA), Chile's PFM fiduciary risk i s low due to the existing accountability
policies and practices. Chile scores high on financial management outputs in fiscal
discipline, transparency and supporting efficiency in operations because underlying all
financial management operations are clear rules, strict adherence to the rules, dedicated
and qualified staff and management which rewards ethical and efficient behavior and
there i s a matching o f responsibility with accountability given the decentralization of
financial management to the service agencies. Taking into account the CFAA conclusions
and assessment o f Chile PFM fiduciary risk, there i s no additional condition for the
proposed operation.

90. The current Foreign Exchange control environment within the Central Bank i s
satisfactory6. Foreign Exchange management and monetary policy are transparent7. In
particular the Central Bank i s publicly disclosing extensive information on these aspects
and independent audits are carried out on annual basis. The Central Bank's 2006 audit
report was reviewed and did not disclose any issue on Foreign Exchange control.

91. Procurement Practices: Chile's procurement system has the confidence o f the
public, the bidding community and civil society as it is generally regarded as fair,
transparent and well managed. The World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank are currently assisting the Government in carrying out an update o f its latest
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). The assessment involves a broad

cross-section o f national agencies and the results are expected in June 2007 when the
Government and the Banks will jointly review and validate them. These results are
expected to demonstrate in an objective manner the extent to which the procurement
system in Chile is indeed competitive, transparent, economic and efficient, and achieves
the same principles outlined inthe Banks' procurement policies. These findings will also
make it possible for the World Bank to start developing an appropriate framework for
movingtowards greater reliance on the country procurement system.

DisbursementsandAuditing

92. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy loans. The untiedbalance o f payments / budget support will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and not tied to any
specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. Once the loan is
approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the loan will be deposited
by IBRD in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the
Central Bank o f Chile at the request o f the Borrower.

93. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the Loan into said account, an
equivalent amount i s credited inthe Borrower's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited
in the foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system. Ifthe
proceeds o f the loan are used for negligible purposes as defined inthe Development Loan
Agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to respond promptly upon notice from to
IBRD, refund an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to IBRD. Amounts
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this
loan will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Finance.


RisksandRiskMitigationMeasures

94. The first risk identified is the possible loss o f a ministerial champion for reform due
to political changes, which i s rated as "Modest." Three measures have been taken to
mitigate this risk. First, the DPL i s reinforced by a Technical Assistance Loan which
provides resources for execution o f the reforms as well as explicit commitments toward
the monitoring and evaluation o f progress for each o f the underlyingtasks that comprise
the Institutional Strengthening Program. Second, many important tasks included in the
DPL and the TAL are not part o f the political agenda or subjected to debate with
concessionaires, namely improvements to the planning function, project management
approach and changes in road contract design mechanisms. Third, the most politically
sensitive reform initiative-increased role o f independentregulation of concessions-has
been directly championed by President Bachelet. The bills to create the Superintendency
of Public Works and amend the Concession Law have been drafted and are currently
under Cabinet review.

95. There is a risk that the process o f broadening MOPW's planning approach could
slow down the project pipeline and hinder investment flows.            This risk is rated as


                                                                                         30

"Modest." As a mitigation measure, significant training and capacity building will be
provided so that project staff can develop a greater understanding o f planning tools at all
levels o f the organization. In addition, the planning training will be linked to that for
integrated project managers so as deepen the application o f the new planning tools.
Finally, a realistic transition period should allow a pipeline o f projects to develop under
current approaches, then through short-term and regional plans and, finally, through
longer-term and moreintegrated plans.

96. A third risk is that the re-balancing o f risks in concession design and strengthening
o f regulation result in declining interest o f the private sector in investment. This risk i s
assessed as "Modest" and three mitigation measures are in place. First, the project
includes a concession design component that looks at appropriate risk-sharing from both
economic and financial perspective. Second, the project comprises a detailed analysis o f
all MOPW contractual results as well as a market study that informs MOPW o f
characteristics o f local and internationalmarkets, by sector. This will allow the design o f
contracts that maximize competition and maintain equilibrium between risks and rewards
from the perspective o f investors/operators. Finally, a parallel series o f diagnoses will be
conducted on bid procedures. The results o f this analysis will be incorporated into the
next generation o f contract designs and biddingprocesses o f the Ministry so as to assure
attractive contracts, fair risk-sharingand maximum competition for the bids.

97. The fourth risk i s the possibility that the bills creating the Superintendency o f
Public Works and amending the Concessions Law are not approved by Congress. This
risk is considered "Modest," as the President o f the Republic, the Minister and the
administration have engaged in extensive stakeholder consultations to draft a legal
package that i s both compelling to consumer groups, the general public, representatives
o f the majority coalition and to many key elements o f the private sector, including the
Chamber o f Construction.

98. The last risk identified i s the prospect o f Congress not passing into law a new
organizational structure for MOPW, which i s considered as "Modest". While it i s very
hardto predict the outcome o f legislative initiatives, this risk is mitigated by the fact that
the President o f the Republic has offered a public commitment to the reform agenda and
has specifically called for a new "Ley Orgcinica "-that      is, a Law on the Organizational
Structure o f MOPW. In addition, a separate proposed law for the Superintendency o f
Public Works enhances the possibility o f a fundamental reform being enacted prior to a
full legal change for the Ministry. Finally, in the event that legal reform is not
practicable, MOPW will focus on the significant institutional andprocedural changes that
can be undertaken without a change in the law (e.g., conversion o f contracts to
outputhesults orientation, new biddingprocedures to maximize corruption, strengthening
o f integrated planning and project management processes, and the oversight rights o f the
DirectorateUnit for Oversight or "Fiscalizacidn "),

99. Considering the considerable mitigation efforts that are part o f the planned
institutional strengthening activities and the result o f an explicit presidential-level
commitment to the reform, the overall risk rating for the DPL i s considered as "Modest."

      Desde el comienzo de su mandato en Mano del 2006, la Adrninistracion de la
      Presidenta Michelle Bachelet se ha cornprometido con el objetivo de lograr
      "Crecimiento con lgualdad de Oportunidades". Este prophito inspira un ambicioso
      Programa de Gobierno que refleja la existencia de un consenso tacito, segun el cual
      10s frutos de la prirnera generacion de reformas se encuentran ya asegurados y es
      precis0 enfrentar 10s desafios pendientes para avanzar en el camino del crecimiento.
      El acento en la prornocion del crecimiento economico se plantea con el fin explicit0
      de alcanzar un mejor nivel de inqresos y de vlda de la poblacion, en terminos
      equivalentes a1 de 10s paises de la OECD. El Programa propone entrar en una nueva
      fase de desarrollo, lncorporando medidas innovadoras tendientes a impulsar el
      crecimiento economico, la innovacion y la competitividad, y procurando una mayor
      lgualdad de oportunidades para todos 10s ciudadanos.

      El Programa de Reforma lnstitucional del Ministerio de Obras Publicas (MOP), se
      enmarca en este Proqrama de Gobierno, particularmente en lo referido a la
      promocion del crecimiento economico, a la cornpetitividad y a1 "Nuevo Trato
      Ciudadano", pilar que incluye medidas de reforma del Estado tales como la mejora
      de la calidad de 10s servicios publicos, la mayor transparencia y la participacion
      ciudadana. En 10s parrafos que siguen se describen sucintamente 10s antecedentes,
      objetivos y componentes del Programa del MOP.

      La infraestructura publica es, sin lugar a dudas, un eje fundamental de la economia
      chilena y el MOP es responsable de planificar, construir, mantener y operar dicha
      infraestructura, para fomentar el crecimiento economico y el desarrollo social.
      Actualrnente, el presupuesto anual del MOP asciende a US$ 1.500 rnillones,
      convirtiendolo en un importante inversor del sector de la construccion del pais.
      Adem&, fue bajo su ambito de cornpetencia donde, a principios de los aiios 90, nacio
      el exitoso sistema de concesiones chileno, que ha sido esencial para disminuir el
      deficit de infraestructura del pais. Las inversiones, en el marc0 de las concesiones
      administradas por el MOP, han oscilado en 10s liltimos aiios en torno a 10s US$ 1.OOO
      rnillones anuales, convirtiendo a1 Ministerio en el principal administrador de esta
'*+   rnodalidad de asociaci6n publico-privada en Chile.

   '  Para continuar en la senda del crecimiento economico y alcanzar mejores

8     condiciones y niveles de calidad de vida para todos 10s chilenos, es necesario
fi.?  remover barreras a la competitividad, e implementar medidas tendientes a impulsar
      el crecimiento econbmico y la innovacion, para         hacer de Chile un pais mas
      competitivo y con mayor igwldad de oportunidades para todos sus ciudadanos. En tal
    -4sentido, el rol del MOP adquiere una nueva relevanciay debe redefinirse.




                                                                                                32

Si bien 10s exitos alcanzados durante 10s irltimos 15 aiios son indiscutidos, existe
amplio consenso respecto de la necesidad de mejorar la eficiencia del gasto publico
en infraestructura, perfeccionando el diseiio del sistema de concesiones y logrando
un mayor grado de accountability, tanto en las obras pirblicas como en las
concesiones, estableciendo estandares explicitos de calidad de servicio para 10s
usuarios. Con el fin de dotar al MOP de las herramientas que le permitancumplir este
nuevo roll la presente Administracion se ha propuesto llevar a cabo un vasto
programa de reforma institucional, para el cual ha solicitado el apoyo del Banco
Mundialen un conjunto de areas especificas.

Los objetivosy acciones del Program de Reforma son el resultado de mas de un aiio
de trabajo al interior del MOP y de consultas con actores externos relevantes en
diferentes ambitos de accion. Existe, en efecto, un equip0 multidixiplinario
compuesto por el staff del MOP con responsabilidadesespecificasen cada una de [as
areas de reforma, el cual ha trabajado en la identificacion de las principales
deficiencias detectadas, elaborando propuestas de mejora, que se describir6n a
continuacion.

El BancoMundial ha acornpahado el trabajo de estos equipos, practicamentedesde el
principio, proveyendo apoyo tecnico y legal. Asimismo, se ha llevado a cabo un
proceso de dixusion publica con actores claves en 10s ambitos de accion del MOP,
tales como la Camara Chilena de la Construccion, la Asociacion de Concesionarios de
OOPP, los Gobiernos Regionales y divenas Orqanizacionesde la Sociedad Civil. Estas
discusiones han permitido realizar un analisis m& objetivo y tener una vision mas
amplia de las metas a Lograr.

Durante el trabajo antes dexrito, se identificaron 10s principalesdesafiosque el MOP
enfrenta, respecto de sus procesosfundamentales, 10s que se citan a continuacion:


Planificadon
   Carencia de planificaciona mediano y largo plazo, que considere una perspectiva
   inteqrada desde el punto de vista geoqrafico, y orientada a1 desarrollo y a la
   competitividadde 10s sectores productivosdel pais.
   Bajo nivel de interaccion con otros actores relevantes en el sector
.  infraestructura, y escasa participacidnpor parte de 10s usuarios en el proceso de
   planificacion.
   Programas de inversion que carecen de integracibncon determinadas cadenas de
.  abastecimiento, resultando en problemas de coordinacion y gastos poco
   eficientes.
   Ausencia de analisis de riesgos y evaluacion ex- post en el proceso de
   planificacion.


Estandares de Servido, Contratosy Competenda
.  Ausencia de representacion explicita de los interesesde 10s ciudadanos y usuarios
   en el diseiio de 10s contratos (tanto en obras publicas como en concesiones) y en
   la regulacionde 10s sewicios.
=  Niveles disimiles de competencia en los procesos de licitation de obras publicas y
   concesiones, lo que disminuye la efectividadde tales procesos.




                                                                                       33

Gestion de Proyedos
    Bajos niveles de accountability respecto de resultados en proyectos de obras
.   publicas, product0 de un enfoqw fragmentado, donde distintas personas son
    responsablesde las distintasfases de ejecucionde un mismo proyecto.
    Falta de informacion sistematizada acerca de costos, gestion de contratos, y de
    diseiioy construccion de proyectos.


Regulad6n

.   lnsuficiente capacidad institucional para fiscalizar de modo apropiado 10s
    contratosde obras publicas, de acuerdo a 10s niveles de servicio establecidos.
    Necesidad de fortalecer la capacidad para recoger las preocupaciones de 10s
    usuarios y asegurar su acceso a la informacion, como parte de la funcion
    regulatoria.


Como resultado de este diagnostico, surge la estructura del Proqrama de Reforma
Institucional, cuyos objetivos son el logo de un us0 mas efectivo y eficiente de 10s
recursos publicos y mayor transparencia, competencia y participacion ciudadana en
la contratacibnde obras publicas.

El Programa contempla tres tipos de intervencion: primero, aquellas orientadas a
Contratacion y"procesosdedel
mejorar 10s                    negocio" propios del MOP (es decir Planificacion,
                Gestion    proyectos y Fiscalizacion de Servicios de Infraestructura);
segundo, aquellas intervenciones cuyo objetivo es mejorar 10s           "procesos de
gobierno" del Ministerio (tales como, Gestion de la Normativa y Requlacion sectorial,
Desarrollo institucional, Planificacibn Estrathica y Control de Gestion y
Comunicaciones Corporativas); y en tercer lugar, intervenciones cuyo prop6sito es
mejorar 10s "procesos de apoyo" del MOP (entendiendo por tales, Servicios de
Informatica, Recursos Humanos y Servicios Generales y Financieros). Un listado
completo de 10s 11 proyectos que componen el programa y 10s objetivos especificos
de cada uno se presenta en el Anexo 1 de esta carta.

El siguiente diagrama permite visualizar 10s tres tipos de proceso seiialados y las
areas de intervenciondel Programa:




                                                                                        34

 Otro elemento fundamental dentro de la Planificaciones la valoracion ambiental. A
 fin lograr estandares propios de paises de la OECD en nuestros proyectos de obras
 pbblicas y contribuir a un desarrollo sostenible, consideramosesencial la integracion
 adecuada de los aspectos ambientales en nuestro proceso de Planificacion, a traves
 de instrumentoscomo la metodologiade EvaluacionAmbiental Estrathica.

 Ya se han hecho avances concretos hacia este nuevo enfoque en la funcibn
 planificadora. El primer0 esta representado por el lanzamiento del Plan de
 lnfraestructura para la Competitividad en Septiembre de 2006. En tal sentido,
 durante el 2006, se desarrollo un intenso proceso de planificacion en todo el pais,
 region por region, potenciando una gestion territorial integrada, dando un fuerte
 impulso a 10s proyectos regionales, y abriendo nuevos espacios a la participaciondel
 sector privadoy de las comunidades locales.

 Como resultado de este proceso se han elaborado planes de inveniones regionales e
 inter-regionales, buscando una vision de cartera de proyectos coherentes entre si,
 que incorpore la dimension economica, regional y humana. A la fecha, 10s siguientes
  Planes de este tip0 han sido elaborados, existiendo versiones preliminares de 10s
  mismos:

     Plan de Competitividad2007-2012, Sector Mineria
     Plan de Competitividad2007-2012, Sector Agricultura
  .
  =  Plan de Competitividad 2007-2012, Sector Forestal
     Plan de Competitividad 2007-2012, Sector Turismo


  El segundo avance lo constituyen 10s 27 Convenios de Programacion que se esGn
 firmando con 10s Gobiernos Regionales y otros Ministerios, en el Marco de los Planes
 de Calidad de Vida en Ciudades. Estos Convenios son instrumentos que facilitan la
 ejecucion de programas especificos de inversion en obras pliblicas en ciudades,
 donde concurren con financiamiento compartido y en un plazo dado, tanto estos
 Gobiernos Regionalescomo el propioMOP. Estos conveniosse suscriben pliblicarnente
 y se apruebanpor Decreto del Ministeriode Hacienda.

 En lo que se refiere a Esthndares de Servldo, el MOP debe dar respuesta a una
 dernanda social: progresivarnente, tanto 10s usuarios de [as obras pOblicas como la
 ciudadania en general, exigen una adecuada calidad del servicio que reciben, lo que
 hace indispensable contar con una institucionalidad que facilite o canalice dicha
 demanda y, en consecuencia, asegure su exigibilidad. La incorporacionde estandares
 de servicio explicitos en las obras que el Ministerio de Obras Pliblicas administra,
 implica un cambio transversal en la forma en que 10s proyectos se conciben,
 planifican, construyeny conservan, y por lo tanto refleja un salto en la manera en
 que el MOP realiza su gestion diaria.

 En el pasado, el MOP era el encargado de construir las obras pbblicas en forma
 directa. Con el avance del tiempo y el crecimiento de una industria privada eflciente
 en la provision de servicios de construccibn, actualmente el MOPse ha convertido en
 un organism0 que principalmente gestiona Contratos de Construccion de Obras a
 terceros. Sin embargo, las capacidades requerldas para esta tarea no se han
 desarrollado en su totalidad, lo que se refleja (entre otras cosas) en que la mayona
 de 10s contratos siguen siendo por precio unitario. Esto, sumado a una inversion
 insuficiente en estudios e ingeniena, tiene como resultado proyectos deficientes y

                                                                                        36

contratos a veces mal disefiados, lo que contribuye a la ejecucion de proyectos con
sobrecostos y sobretiempos. La modernizacibndel MOP exige que bte se convierta
en una institucion experta en el manejo de contratos, sobre todo en contratos de
largo plazo, reduciendo a1 minim0 las perdidas que se producen por ineficienciasen
el disetio y gestion de 10s mismos. Para el loqro de este propbito, se requiere, entre
otros aspectos, que el MOP desarrolle experticia en nuevos tipos de contratos y
mejore las capacidades en 10s contratosque ya estan en ejecucibn, tales como 10s de
concesiones.

En el ambito de la Gestibn de Proyectos, el principal objetivo de la Reforma es la
modernizaclon del proceso de diseho y construccionde las obras, bajo un enfoque de
gestion integrada a lo largo del ciclo de vida de 10s proyectos. Gestion integrada
significa que un profesional-el Jefe de Proyecto- se hace cargo del objetivo de poner
en servicio una obra, con base en un plazo y presupuesto definidos. Como resultado,
la responsabilidadse concentray, necesariamente, se debe asegurar que 10s Jefes de
Proyecto cwnten con las atribuciones, informacion, equipos y herramientas
necesarias para el cumplimiento de 10s cornpromisos asumidos. El logro de esto
implica un trabajo multisectorial. Primero, en materia de politica de recursos
humanos, ya que el Ministerio no contempla la figura del Jefe de Proyecto ni otorga
incentivos para evaluar el desempeiio de quienes Sean designados para cumplir este
roll con base en 10s resultados obtenidos. Asimismo, es necesario establecer criterios
adecuados para la conformacion de 10s equipos que trabajaran con el Jefe de
Proyecto. Segundo, es necesario trabajar en el establecimiento de sistemas de
informacionque permitan contar con datos detallados sobre el disetio y ejecucion de
las obras, no solo a fin de mejorar la gestion sino tambien para proveer de un banco
de datos confiable, con el cual se pueda retroalimentar la planificaciony el control.

Ya se han dado 10s primeros pasos en esta direccion, a1 emitir una Resolucion
Ministerial mediante la cual se autorizan 17 cupos para funciones criticas, que
permiten otorgar incentivos adicionales a ser asignados a aquellos funcionarios del
MOP que se desempeiiencomo Jefes de Proyecto.

En lo que respecta a Regulad6nJ el Programa tiene como elemento central la
creacion de una Superintendencia de Obras Publicas, cuya estructura, funciones y
objetivos ya se encuentran plasmadosen un Ante-Proyecto de Ley que se encuentra
en analisis en el Poder Ejecutivo, previo a su envio a1 Congreso. La nueva entidad
debiera constituirseen un mecanismo estructurante de la nueva logica de operacion
del MOP, a1 desarrollar 10s sistemas de fiscalizacion y de incentivos para que las
distintas Direcciones del MOP ponqan en el centro de su atencion la funcionalidadde
las obras respecto de la calidad de servicio que se compromete ante la ciudadania,
en lo referido a obras publicas tradicionales y concesionadas, en su etapa de
explotacion. La coordinacion entre las actividades orientadas a establecer la nueva
Superintendenciacon aquellas que se focallzan en el establecimiento de estandares
de servicio y mejora en la gestion de 10s contratoses, por tanto, fundamental para el
exito de la Reforma. Dicha Superintendencia tendna un rol clave en el ambito de las
concesiones, fiscalizandoel curnplimientode estandares de calidad de servicio.

El establecimiento de una Unidad de Fiscalizacion, dentro de la estructura del MOP
en Junio de 2006, representa un primer pax, hacia la creacion de una
Superintendenciade Obras Publicas. Esta Unidad cuenta con su propio presupuesto y
40 personas que reportan a ella directamente. Sus funciones incluyen tareas
preparatorias para el establecimiento de la Superintendencia y otras que senan
propias de la Superintendencia, una vez establecida, tales como la fiscalizacion del
cumplimiento de las variables de calidad de servicio que se definan para las obras




                                                                                        37

publicas, incluyendola supervisiondel cumplimientode 10s compromisosambientales
y de aquellos asumidos con la comunidad.


transversal a 10s componentesya descritos, 18constituye la Reforma Oqanizadonal
Un pilar esencial del Programa de Reforma, que abarca a todo el Ministerio y es

del MOP, que incluye la definicion de una mejor estructura institucional y la
adecuacion del rnarco normativo correspondiente. El objetivo de este componente es
separar las areas de planificacion, contratacion, ejecucion y replacion, para la
provision de infraestructura, a fin de establecer un sistema de contrapesos
institucionales, basado en una asignacion de roles transparente y racional (principio
de check andbalance).

En efecto, ya se han registrado avances en la preparacion de un paquete de
anteproyectos de ley para el logro de 10s objetivos propuestos. Estan en revision
dentro del Poder Ejecutivo, 10s Ante-Proyectos de Ley de Superintendenciade Obras
Publicas y la reforma a la Ley de Concesiones. Este componente tambien incluye
reformas a la Ley de Aguas Llwia, a la Ley de Agua Potable Rural y a la Ley de
Regulaclonde Embalses, las que se encuentran en una fase similar de avance. QuiZiis
el desafio mas grande en este componente sea la elaboracion de un proyecto de
reforma integral del MOP, la cual debera propner una nueva estructura general y
procedimientos para todas las actividades que realiza el Ministerio, avanzando en la
separacionde los rolesya descrita.

funciones de unidades enteras, en un diseiio de administracion matricial para la
gestion de proyectos y en la definicionde nuevos perfiles profesionales;todo lo cual
debiera reflejarse en la estructura institucional. Esto lmplica asimismo la necesfdad
de elaborar un conjunto de reglamentadones que ayuden a implementar las
disposiciones generales que se contemplenen la nueva organica del Ministerio,

Tales cambios no sedn posibles sin un adecuado involucramientoy participacionde
10s profesionales y funcionarios del Ministerio de Obras Publicas, asi como de sus
stakeholders. Por tal razon, se ha incluido en el Programa un extenso proceso de
Gestion del Cambio. Los cambios serin posibles solo en la medlda en que 10s actores
del MOP vean oportunidades y compartan las directrices de dichos cambios. En tal
sentido, se observa que el dlagnostico realizado sobre los actuales desafios del MOP
es ampliarnentecornpartldo, interna y externarnente.

Dadas la profundidady amplitud del Programa de Reforma del MOP, hems solicitado
el apoyo del Banco Mundial, no solo por aspectos tecnicos, sin0 tambien por razones
institucionales. Consideramos que la presencia del Banco Mundial es fundamental
para dar continuidad a este proceso de cambio estructural, cuya implementacion
llevara varios aiios, incluso mas alla de la presente Administracion. Por tal motivo,
quisieramos solicitar que el Banco cumpla una funcion de supervision de alto nivel a
traves de mlslonesy consultas regulares, para velar por la totalidad de las iniciativas
del Programa.

La solicitud especifica de un Prestamo de Politicasresponde a dos razones; primero,
compromete a1 Gobierno a travb del Ministerio de Hacienda en el cumplimiento de
10s objetivos del Programa de Reforma del MOP; y sequndo, le da un mayor respaldo
y viabilidad a1 Programa.

Cabe destacar que el Programa que se describe en la presente Carta de Politica
cuenta con el apeyo explicit0 de la Presidenta, quien hizo una referencia del mismo
el dia 13 de Marzo del presente aiio, en el marc0 del anuncio oficial de un Paquete
de Medidas para promover el crecimiento economico del pais. El Gobierno esta, por
tanto, comprometidocon el Programa que se ha presentado en la presente Carta de
Politica y ve con beneplacito el acompatiamiento y apoyo del Banco Mundial. El
Gobierno agradece la pronta consideracion, por parte del Directorio, de un Prestamo
de Desarrollo de Politica (DPL) por un total de US$ 30 millones.

Ms. Pamela Cox
Vice President
Latin America and the Caribbean Region
The World Bank
Washington, D C

Dear Ms. Cox:

Since the start o f its mandate inMarch o f 2006, the Administration o f President Michelle
Bachelet has committed itself to achieving the goal o f "Growth with Equality of
Opportunity." This goal has inspired an ambitious Government Program that reflects a
consensus on the need to move beyond the first generation of reforms and to confront the
remaining challenges to achieving higher levels o f growth.        In promoting economic
growth, the explicit emphasis will be placed on raising levels of income and improving
the quality o f life so as to converge with the standards o f the OECD. The Government
Program thus proposes a new phase o f development, incorporating new approaches to
supporting innovation and competitiveness and achieving greater equality o f opportunity
for all of Chile's citizens.

The Institutional Strengthening Program o f the Ministry o f Public Works (MOPW) i s a
central feature o f the overall Government Program, particularly as it pertains to the
support o f economic growth, competitiveness and the "New Citizenry Treaty."            That
Treaty calls for reform o f public institutions through improvements in the quality of
public services as well as greater transparency and citizen participation. The following
paragraphs provide a brief background to the MOPW's Institutional Strengthening
Program as well as its objectives and main components.

Public infrastructure i s a keystone o f the Chilean economy and MOPW i s responsible for
planning, constructing, maintaining and operating this infrastructure in support o f
economic growth and social development. Currently, the annual budget o f MOPW
approaches US$l.5 billion, makingit an important financier o f the country's construction
industry. Moreover, it has beenunder the control o fthe MOPW that, since the beginning
o f the 199Os,the successful system o f concessions was developed. This system has been
essential in the alleviation o f Chile's infrastructure deficit.       Investments under
concessions administered by MOPW have valued, inrecent years, around US$1.O billion
annually, making the Ministry Chile's principal administrator o f these forms o f public-
private partnerships.

Inorder to continue to raise the levels of growth andto achieve higher standards o fliving
for all Chileans, it is necessary to remove barriers to competition and implement
measures to strengthen innovation, make Chile more competitive and offer greater
opportunities for all o f its citizens. In this sense, MOPW has acquired a new relevance
and its role needs to be redefined.


                                                                                         41

Despite the tremendous successes o f the last 15 years, there i s wide consensus about the
need to improve efficiency in public spending in infrastructure by perfecting the design
o f the concession system; attaining a higher level o f accountability-for        both public
works and concessions; and establishing explicit quality o f service standards for users. In
order to provide MOPW with the tools for achieving this new function, the current
Administration has proposed to undertake a major institutional reform program for which
ithas solicited the support ofthe World Bankinspecific core areas.

The objectives and actions o f the Institutional Strengthening Program are the result o f
more than a year o f work at MOPW and from consultations with relevant external
stakeholders. The effort has been coordinated by a multidisciplinary team composed o f
MOPW staff with specific responsibilities for each technical area o f reform. That team
has worked to identify the main shortcomings o f the Ministry and has developed
proposals for their improvement which are described below.

The World Bank has supported the work o f these teams with technical and regulatory
advice since the early stages o f the initiative's inception. At the same time, the Ministry
has engaged inpublic discussions with key actors inthe areas o f MOPW's activities such
as the Chamber o f Construction, the Association o f Concessionaires o f Public Works,
Regional Governments and several civil society organizations. These discussions have
allowed for amore objective analysis and a broader vision o fthe goals to be achieved.

Through the work described above, it has been found that the primary challenges
confrontedby MOPW inits core business functions are as follows:

Planning

       Lack o f medium and long-term planning with an integrated geographic
       perspective orientedto the competitiveness o f Chile's productive sectors.

    0  Low level o f interaction with other relevant stakeholders in infrastructure sector
       and a lack o f societal or consumer voice inproject planning.

       Investment programs which are contract-driven rather than integrated along a
       supply chain, leading to coordination difficulties and inefficient expenditures.
       Absence o frisk analysis and ex-post evaluation inthe process o fplanning.

Service Standards, Contracts and Competition
       Absence o f explicit representation o f the interests o f citizens and users incontract
       design (as much in pubic works as in concessions) and in the regulation o f
       services.
       Uneven levels o f competition during bidding processes for either concessions or
       public works, reducing the effectiveness of those processes.




                                                                                           42

Project Management

        Low levels o f accountability related to project outcomes due to a fragmented
        approach to project management with different individuals responsible for each
        stage o fproject development.

        Poor availability o f information about project costs, contract management or
        design and construction o fprojects.

Regulation

        Insufficient institutional capacity to provide effective oversight o f contracts and
        concessions accordingto agreed upon levels o f service, let alone cost elements.
        Need for strengthening the capacity to capture the concerns o f users and assure
        public access to information inthe area o fregulation.

As a result o f this diagnostic, the structure o f the Institutional Strengthening Program
arose, whose objectives are the more effective and efficient use o f public resources and
greater transparency, competition and citizen participation in the contracting o f public
works.

The Program includes three types o f activities: First are those oriented at improving the
"business processes" o f MOPW (that is, Planning; Contracting; Management o f Projects;
and Oversight or "Fiscalizucidn" o f Infrastructure Services). Second are those activities
whose objective i s to improve the "governance processes" o f the Ministry (such as
Management o f Norms and Regulations; Institutional Development; Strategic Planning;
Control Management; and Corporate Communications). The third area o f activities i s
intended to improve "support processes" o f MOPW (such as Information Services;
Human Resources and General and Financial Services).            A complete list o f the 11
projects that comprise the Program and the objectives o f each one i s presented in Annex
1o fthis letter.

The following diagram illustrates the three types o f processes and Programs areas o f
activity:




                                                                                         43

                                  Business Processes                   b




It is important to note that we have requested the support o f the World Bank primarily in
those components of the Program where we feel the Bank can provide most value added
given its international experience in the area o f infrastructure.      This would be in
Territorial Planning; the Design of Standards and Public-Private Contracts; Integrated
Project Management; Regulation o f Infrastructure Services-including        the design and
establishment o f regulatory structures that protect both users and investors; and
Organizational Development including the Management and Modernization of Sector
Norms.

The following paragraphs summarize the principal reforms for each area inwhich we are
requesting Bank support.

Inthis respect, the design o f a new PlanningProcess for infrastructureinvestments and
the permanent concern for its correct application is o f central strategic relevance for
MOPW. It will determine the likelihood o f providing infrastructure that responds to real
demand levels and the urgent needs o f the development process o f Chile. The exact
characteristics o f the planning process that are expected to come out o f the Institutional
Strengthening Program are:       that it represents an integrated vision for all types o f
infrastructure, by region and by form o f management, according to a long-term
perspective and participatory manner with all sectors o f the national workforce. It should
allow for development, improvement in competitiveness, better accessibility and
guaranteed equality in levels of access for goods and services. Fundamental to the
achievement o f this objective is the implementation o f a solid planning methodology
under the responsibility o f a single Directorate o f Planning. The fragmented planning
approach, dependent on various operational directorates within MOP, has not proven to
bethe most adequate approach.



                                                                                         44

Another fundamental aspect within Planning i s environmental assessment. In order to
achieve standards in our public works projects which are appropriate to countries of the
OECD and which contribute to sustainable development, we consider the integration of
environmental aspects into our planning process to be essential. This should be done
through instruments such as Strategic Environmental Assessments.

MOPW has already made concrete advances in this new approach to the planning
function. The first has been the initiation o f the Infrastructure Plan for Competitiveness
in September 2006.       Under this initiative, during 2006, the Government began an
intensive planning process for the country, region by region, based on integrated
territorial management giving a strong pushto regional projects and opening new arenas
for participation by the private sector and by local communities.

As a result of this process regional and inter-regional investment plans have been
produced which seek to provide a pipeline o f projects that i s coherent, incorporating
economic, regional and humanconcerns. To date, preliminary versions o f the following
Plans havebeen prepared under this methodology:

        Competitiveness Plan 2007-2012, Mining Sector
        Competitiveness Plan 2007-2012, Agricultural Sector
        Competitiveness Plan 2007-2012, Forestry Sector
        Competitiveness Plan2007-2012, Tourism Sector

The second advance in Integrated Planning involves 27 Programming Agreements that
are being signed with Regional Governments and other Ministries, according to the
Framework for Quality o f Life in Cities Plans. These Agreements are instruments that
allow for the execution o f specific public works investment programs in cities in which
there are shared financing responsibilities and within a fixed timeframe, as much for
Regional Governments as for MOPW itself. The agreements are publicly available and
approved by Decree by the Ministryof Finance.

In establishing Service Standards, MOPW intends to provide a response to a social
need: increasingly, both users o f public works and Chile's citizenry in general, are
demanding an adequate quality o f service which makes it necessary to rely on an
institution which facilitates that level o f service and, as a consequence, assures its
availability. The incorporationof explicit service standards en the works administered by
MOPW implies a cross-cutting change en the way in which projects are conceived,
planned, constructed and maintained. Inthis sense, it represents a fundamental change in
the way MOPW undertakes its daily management.

Inthe past, MOPW was directly responsible for the construction o f public works. With
time and the growth o f an efficient private industry to provide construction services,
MOPW has changed into an organization which principally manages works construction
contracts undertakenby third parties. However, the skills requiredfor this task have not
beencompletely developed, a fact which is reflected inthe continueduse o f unitprices in
the majority of contracts. This, together with insufficient investment in engineering
studies, has resulted in deficient contracts that are sometimes poorly designed,


                                                                                        45

contributing to projects that are executed with cost and time overruns.                The
modernization o f MOPW requires a transformation into an organization that i s expert in
the management o f contracts, above all inlong-term contracts, minimizingthe losses that
are produced through inefficiency in design and management. In order to achieve this
objective, MOPW will have to develop expertise in new types o f contracts and improve
the capacity o f those managing contracts that are already under execution, as well as
concessions.

In the area o f Project Management, the primary objective of the reform is the
modernization o f the process o f design and construction o f works, under an approach to
project management that integrates the lifecycle o f the projects. Integrated management
means that a profession-Project       Chief or Manager-is     responsible for putting into
service a work, based on a defined timeframe and budget. Since project responsibility
will be concentrated and so it will be necessary to assure that Project Managers possess
the necessary skills, information, teams and tools to undertake their new commitments.
This implies multi-dimensional reform. First is the area o f Human Resource policy
which will require the Ministryto define the Project Manager and to establish appropriate
incentives for this new role, based on expected results. At the same time, it will be
necessary to establish teams that can work with the Project Manager. Second, it will be
crucial to establish information systems that provide the Project Manager with
sufficiently detailed data on the design and execution o f work, not only to improve
project management but also to create a reliable database that can be used to improve
planningand oversight.

The first steps in this direction have already been taken through a Ministerial Resolution
that authorizes 17 quotas for critical functions. This will allow for the provision o f
additional incentives to be assigned to MOPW staff named as Project Managers.

With respect to Regulation, the Program has as a central element the creation o f the
Superintendency o f Public Works, whose structure, functions and objectives can be found
in a Draft Law which is under review by the Executive Branch in advance o f its
submission to Congress. The new entity will constitute a mechanism structured along the
new operating logic o f MOPW. It will develop the oversight systems and the incentives
necessary for the various directorates o f MOPW to focus on the quality o f service
promised to the people o f Chile-through      both traditional public works contracts and
concessions. The coordination between those activities related to the establishment o f the
new Superintendency and the improvement in the management o f contracts is
fundamental to the success o f the reform. The Superintendency would have a key role in
the area o f concessions, overseeing the compliance with quality o f service standards.

The establishment o f a Unit o f Oversight ("Fiscalizacidn"), within the structure o f
MOPW, in June 2006, represents the first step in the creation o f the Superintendency o f
Public Works. This Unit has its own budget and a staff o f 40 that report to the Unit's
Director.     Its functions include the preparatory tasks for the establishment o f the

once it has been established. These include the oversight o f commitments according to




                                                                                        46

quality o f service variables defined for the public works, as well as the oversight of
environmental andcommunity agreements.

An essential pillar o f the Program, that covers the entire Ministry and crosses the
components already described, i s the Organizational Reform o f MOPW. This includes
the definition o f an improved institutional structure and the establishment o f the
corresponding regulatory framework. The objective o f this component i s to separate the
areas o f planning, contracting, execution and regulation from the provision o f
infrastructure in order to establish a institutional system based on an assignment o f
transparent and rational roles according to the principle o f checks andbalances.

Progress has already been made in the preparation o f a draft law package for the
achievement o f the proposed objectives. The draft laws under review by the Executive
Power include the Draft Law o f the Superintendent o f Public Works and amendments to
the Concessions Law. This component also includes drafting o f amendments to the
Stormwater Law, the Rural Drinking Water Law, and the Reservoir Regulation Law,
which are all in similar phases. Perhaps the biggest challenge o f the component i s the
MOPW integrated reform project, which will propose a new general structure and
proceedings for all o f the activities carried out by the Ministry, furthering separating of
the already described roles.

The complete implementation o f the proposed changes in the first four components will
result in new working relations, changes in the functions and structures o f the units, a
matrix administration design for project management and the definition of new
professional profiles, all o f which would be reflected inthe organizational structure. This
implies the need to develop a set o f norms that help to implement the resolutions that are
approved.

These changes will not be possible without the participation o f the staff o f the Ministryo f
Public Works as well as the Ministry's outside stakeholders. For this reason, an extensive
process o f Change Management has been included in the Program. The changes will be
possible only if the MOPW stakeholders see opportunities and share the benefits of the
reform. For this reason, the diagnostic carried out on the challenges faced by the MOPW
has been extensively disseminated, both internally and externally.

The goals that we haveproposed for the Reform Program are:
    0   Reducelogistics costs for the productive sectors o f Chile, as a percentage o fthe
        GDP
    0   Increase the efficiency of the investment inpublic infrastructure
        Reduce the execution time o fworks
    0   Increase competition among firms competing for design and construction o f
        works
    0   Support the reduction and improved management o f the contingent liabilities
        associated with the investments inpublic works
        Quantify the asset value ininter-urban roadinfrastructure and maximize the value
        with apolicies o finvestmentinconservation




                                                                                          47

         Obtain a highlevel o fpublic confidence inthe work o f MOPW, measured by
         public surveys
         Obtain a highlevel o fbusiness sector confidence inthe work o f MOPW
         Obtain a highlevel of internal confidence inthe work o f MOPW, inclimate
         measuredby internal surveys o f MOPW
     0   Attract professionals and technicians that join MOPW from the best firms intheir
         profession

Given the depth o f the MOPW Institutional Strengthening Program, we have solicited the
support o f the World Bank, not only for technical reasons, but also for the institutional
aspects. We consider the presence o f the World Bank as fundamental for the continuity
o f this process of structural change the implementation o f which will take several years,
even beyond that o f the present Administration. For this reason we would like to ask the
World Bank to fulfill a supervisory role through missions and regular consultations
related to the core areas o f the reform.

The specific request o f a Development Policy Loan i s for two reasons: First, to involve
the Government through the Ministry o f Finance to carry out the objectives o f the
MOPW Institutional Strengthening Program; and second, to give strong support to the
likelihood o ftechnical success o f the Program.

It is worth noting that the Program described inthe present Development Policy Letter,
counts on the specific support o f the President o f the Republic, who described the
Program on March 13 o f the current year, inthe official announcement of the Package of
Measurements to promote the economic growth o f the country.               Therefore, the
Government i s committed to the Program which has been presented in this Letter and
views favorably the support and collaboration o f the World Bank. The Government
appreciates the consideration by the Board o f a Development Policy Loan for the amount
o fUS$ 30 million.

Notes on Methodology for Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators


Increased Competition in Bidding: To be calculated through changes in the average
numbers o f bidders prior to and after changes in bidding processes by type o f contract
and sub-sector; and/or an analysis inthe concentration o fparticipants inMOPW contracts
and concessions. The contractor concentration analysis will calculate the changes in the
HHIndex for MOPWvs. HHIndex for Chile construction industry.
Accuracy of Cost and Time Estimates: To be calculated by considering the percent o f
variation from original to actual cost and time calculated for pre-reform sample o f
contracts vs. post-reform comparable sample.
Valuefor Money of the Reform: The cost o f the full Institutional Reform Program i s
currently estimated at US$12 million per year for five years which equates to
approximately 0.70 percent o f the total investment portfolio o f MOPW including
concessions in 2007. The core business activities financed with the Bank's TAL and

counterpart funds totals about US$6 million per year for five years, or 0.35 percent o f the
total investment portfolio o f MOPW. Efficiency gains will be calculated based upon a
"basket" o f core outputs measured for unit prices, adjusted for changes in inflation, fuel
and other inputs that are not within the span o f control o f MOPW. An indicative basket
could include 3 road projects o f different typology; 1 airport; 1 public edifice; and 1
water resource investment.
