REPOPT AND RECO11MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
7C THE EXETJTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO IRELAND
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Ireland for the equivalent of US$25 nmillion to help finance a
second education project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ireland" (R72-180), dated June 13, 1972 has been distributed to the Executive
Directors. Country data are presented in Annex I.
3.        By joining the European Economic Community (ELC), effective January
1, 1973, Ireland entered a new stage in its economic development. Access to
a much enlarged market will open new export opportunities for Irish agricul-
ture and industry. At the same time, competition from othier EEC member
countries will intensify the pressure on inefficient enterprises and force
the pace of struictural changes to increase productivity. Closer business
relations with European firms, together with existing labor reserves could
attract increased foreign private investment, thus substantially supplemenL-
ing domestic capital resources. These changes should strengthen the economy
but require an adjustment period during the next four years. On balance they
should also provide a new basis for continued growth of production and exports
smilar to that in the 1960's when GNP per capita expanded at an average rate
of about 3-1/2 percent a year and exports rose by 12 percent annually.
4.        The new awareness of EEC markets, dramatic inicreases in farmers'
incomes (1972: 36 percent) and strongly increased Government spending were
the main determinants of recent favorable economic trends. After an unsatis-
factorily low economic growth record during 1970-72, Ireland's GNP in 1973
is expected to grow by 6.5 percent in real terms involving a substantial in-
crease in real living standards, particularly for those at work. At the
same time the unemployment rate dropped from over 8 percent to about 6 per-
cent, and there was a net immigration of Irish workers. The speedy economic
recovery, however, was at the price of increased inflationary pressure, re-
inforced by emerging bottlenecks in production capacities and in skilled
labor. Wage demands in industry, for example, resulted in a wage rise of
over 16 percent and agricultural incomes are again likely to have increased
at almost the same rate as in 1972. The increase in consumer prices for
1973 as a whole will be almost 11 percent compared to approximately 9 percent



- 2 -
in each of the preceding two years. This is above the average price in-
creases in the other EEC countries, including the United Kingdom and, there-
fore, if continued, couldl jeopardize competitive advantages for Irish indus-
trial goods and services. The Irish also face uncertainties with respect
to the effects of the energy crisis in the United Kingdom and other European
countries.
5.        The more efficient industrial enterprises will certainly benefit
from access to the enlarged European market; but many Irish firms may be
too small to function efficiently under increasingly competitive conditions.
There is also a shortage of skilled labor. The Government is well aware
that new initiatives need to be developed to deal with these problems - for
example, by promoting mergers and cooperative forms of production and market-
ing, expanding and revising training programs, and developing new channels
of credit to finance industrial modernization and job expansion. Industrial
promotion programs are currently being reexamined. The Industrial Develop-
ment Authority (IDA), for example, intends to focus its grant support in-
creasingly on job-creating Irish industries in order to become less dependent
on foreign companies in meeting job creation targets. Also, in order to
encourage further the modernization efforts in Irish industry, IDA is now
prepared to approve grants for the training and re-training of workers in
existing firms, and no longer for new industries exclusively.
6.        In agriculture, higher EEC prices and expanded markets should lead
to substantial increases in output, particularly of beef. At the same time,
the Government will, however, need to reinforce its development pcolicies
directed towards both the transfer of agricultura:L labor into other sectors
and the increase of agricultural productivity through improved technology,
land consolidation, more adequate credit facilities and improved training
of farmers and technicians.   To some extent the Government is assisted in
these endeavors by the transfers from the EEC Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund (FEOCA) and the EEC Social Fund, which together amounted in
1973 to almost i 40 million (i.e. about $96 million).
.7                                                 -ebnft         rln     a
7.        Uncertainties persist with respect to the benefits Ireland can
expect from certain EEC sources, among the most important of which is the
EEC Regional Fund, on which agreement among the EEC members is still to be
reached.  Proceeds from this fund3 which was originally scheduled to become
e fe-tive by January 1, 1974, would be earmarked primarilv for regional
-estructuring programs, incluiding the provision of infrastructure..
Aniother long--terTm dcvelopment objective cf the Government is the
adaptation of tlie Irish educational systeia to the new socio-economic needs
resulting from fuller integration with the rest of Europe. This cdevelopment
is described in more detail in Parts III and IV of this report.
9.        The Irish balance of payments has remained strong.    At the end of
October 1973, Ireland held $1.1 billion ir. external reserves, equivalent to
about six months of merchandise imports. This reserve position is adequate
but by no means excessive as Ireland begins to face the increased import
bill expected during the transitional years of EEC membership.



iO.       In 1971 and  Xg.972, Trp land's net foreign- borrowings rose to an an-
nual average cf E 134 nillion, crmpared to nn average of i 50 million during
1968-70.  The greater part of capi-tal inflTws has been absorbed by the pri-
vate sector.  However, the Government and rublic enterprises have also in-
creased their external borrowings. During ?97t-72 public sector borrowing
amounted to about 40 percent cf the to'tal net capital inflow. Public bond
issues accounted for approximately half of total public borrowing abroad,
and in 1973 were above the average of the previous years. Other major pub-
lic borrowings include loans from European banks to the Electricity Supply
Board, from the IBRD to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and from the
European Investment Bank (EI3) to the frish Sugar Company. The latter was
the first loan to be granted by EIB to Ireland, and other loans are under
advanced consideration.
11.       In spite of the recent ioicreases in public foreign borrowing, total
external public debt outstanding was moderate at the end of 1972, amounting
to $679 million, of which the Bank's share was 11 percent. Service payments
on this debt totalled $77 million in 1973 equivalent to only 3 percent of ex-
ports of goods and non-factor services in 1972. Including payments on pri-
vate foreign debt, Irelard's debt service ratio is in the order of less than
12 percent. Much of the private debt is related to commercial transactions
end of relativelv short maturity.   Irelard remains creditworthy for continued
borrowing on conventional terms. Furthermore, Ireland has made good use of
IBRD financing and technical assistance to facilitate structural reforms
necessarv to reap the full economic benefit of many opportunities opened up
by membership in the EEC.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's seventh operation in Ireland,
and the second for education. It would bring total Bank lending to $122.5
million. Bank lending in Ireland began in 1969 with the first of three
loans to the Electricity Supply Board (ESB). A total of $49.5 million has
been lent to the power sector, but ESB is now meeting its external capital
requirements either through local redeemable stock issues or through direct
borrowing in foreign capital markets. In 1971, the Bank financed the first
education as well as an industrial development finance company project.
Tnis was followed by a livestock development project in 1973.    Performance
under all projects is generally satisfactory. Annex II contains a statement
of Bank loans as at November 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects. IFC has not financed any projects in Ireland.
13.       Although Ireland's full membership in the European Economic Commu-
nitv gives it access to financial support from the European Investment Bank
(EIB) and other EEC financing institutions, it may well take these institu-
tions some time to prepare themselves fully to provide assistance to Ireland.
Meanwhile, Iretand has continued to be a borrower from the Bank, albeit a
rarginal one.   Only one other project is under preparation, designed to ra-
tionalize further industrial development in Ireland, possibly through assis-
tance to an industrial zone ir. the Cork harbor area, which may be ready for
consideration by the Executive Directors in FY75 or FY76.



- 4-
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
14.       Until recently the Irish education system was not effectively serv-
ing socio-economic development needs of the country. Traditionally, the
system was characterized by: (i) an over-emphasis on academic subjects
which resulted in serious constraints in the supply of adequately trained
manpower for the major sectors of the economy; (ii) a disproportionate number
of uneconomically small schools and inherent inefficiencies in the utiliza-
tion of teachers; (iii) wide disparities in educational opportunities parti-
cularly at the secondary level, due to restrictive entrance requirements;
and (iv) a dual academic/vocational system at the secondary level which mi-
tigated against the access to educational programs best suited to the apti-
tudes and abilities of all students.
15.       In 1966, the Government introduced the first of several pilot re-
form programs designed to redress these imbalances and to promote qualitative
improvements and greater efficiency in the educational system. At the pri-
mary and secondary levels, the Government has amalgamated over 1,000 smaller
primarv schools into larger units. It also established 30 pilot secondary
comprehensive schools; and, eventually, the Government plans to convert
the entire secondary school system into this pattern.
16.       The Government is meeting the immediate need for training farmers
in improved production techniques and farm management methods by providing
a network of training centers throughout the country; 28 out of 50 proposed
centers are already in operation. An equally critical problem, however, is
the need to improve the training of technicians and professionals who will
assume responsibilities for advisory services, policy making and research
in a modernized agricultural sector. This will require major changes in
agricultural training including the rationalization of small and uneconomical
agricultural colleges and the introduction of curriculum reforms to meet
changing manpower requirements in agriculture.
17.       In order to facilitate the development of training programs for
middle and high-level technicians as a viable alternative to academically-
oriented universitv training, thel Government has established the Higher
Education Authority to coordinate the development of all third level educa-
ticn. Moreover, as a first step toward implementing these programs and meet-
ing th- ,ilost critical manpower needs, the Government has already set up a
svster o02 regional technical co'Lleges to train middle-level technicians.
18.       Emplovment opportunities are expected to increase from 1.07 million
in 1971 to 1.27 million in 1986, and the type of job opportunities is expect-
ed to change. A reduction of 107,000 agricultural jobs, forecast by 1986,
is expected to be offset by a net increase of 144,000 jobs in manufacturing
and other industries, and 95,000 jobs in services.
19.       Also during the period 1971-1986 additional requirements for train-
ed manpower are estimated at 631,000 in the following major categories:



professional and technical personnel 88,000 (14 percent of total additional
requirements); managers, officials and owner operators 79,000 (13 percent);
clerical 110,000 (17 percent); foremen, craftsmen and operatives 228,000
(36 percent); service worlcers 95,000 (15 percent); and the remaining 31,000
(5 percent) consisting of sales workers, laborers, and farmers. In terms
of educational strategy, this implies the need for a more practical orienta-
tion in general education and for a greater emphasis on technical and skill
training programs.
20.       The first Bank; education project in Ireland in 1971 provided a
major impetus to the Government's efforts in its program of introducing and
motivating reforms in the education sector. It particularly aimed at assist-
ing the Government in expanding its reform efforts in general secondary and
vocational education, secondary level technical education and higher level
technician and commercial education. Specifically, this project included
a technical assistance component and building and equipment of 24 new sec-
ondary comprehensive schools, which offer a broad curriculum of elective
academic and pre-vocational subjects, with emphasis on self-motivated study
and problem-solving rather than on rote-learning. This project also included
building and equipment of one secondary technical school, one regional tech-
nical college, one college of commerce, and 20 Agriculture Education Centers
(for which county authorities subsequently assumed responsibility). Imple-
mentation of the project is proceeding satisfactorily.
21.       The reform needs to be accelerated and further expanded, however,
if the new demands being imposed on Ireland's educational system are to be
met. Thus, the proposed project is expected to establish firmly Ireland's
educational reform program.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
22.       Following the Government's request for a continuation of Bank as-
sistance in the education sector, Bank missions visited Ireland in March
and July, 1972 to identify components suitable for Bank financing and to
advise the Government on the preparation of a second education project. The
Government subsequently prepared the project, which was appraised in March/
April 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington, November 5-8, 1973. The
Irish delegation was headed by Mr. Sean Murray, Assistant Secretary of the
Department of Finance, and included Mr. Noel Lindsay, Director of the Project
Unit in the Department of Education.
Project Description and Objectives
23.       To help meet the projected demand (1971-86) for skilled workers
and technicians at all levels, the proposed project would strengthen and
expand adult training programs and post-secondary agricultural and technical
education at levels sufficient (i) to meet about 42 percent of the projected
shortfall of middle and high-level technicians; (ii) to provide about 30



- 6 -
percent of the total supply of skilled workers required by industrv; (iii)
to supplv I100 percent of the teachers required in secondary level technical
subjects; and (iv) to provide qualitative improvements in the faci:Lities and
program of the faculty of agriculture at Universitv College, Dublin, which
is the principal source (85 percent) o' all degree level agricultural spe-
cialists in Ireland.
24.       Specifically, the project wouldl comprise:
(a) The construction and equipment of:
(1) 14 comprehensive secondary schools;
(ii) five industrial training centers;
(iii) expansion of seven existing regional technical
colleges;
(iv)  an institute of higher education;
(v) a technical teacher training institute; and
(vi) a faculty of agriculture,
(b)  The provision of computer systen equipment for third level
technical institutes included in the project, and
(c) The provision of equiDment for the project unit.
The project is described in greater detail in the Loan and Project Sunmary
attacred as Annex ITT.   The Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of a Second
Education Project Ireland" (237a - IRE) is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors.
25.       Thf, various components of the proposed project will attack the
ra.lor problems confronting the Government's efforts to adapt its educational
svstem to moderrn r.ees.  The 1i4 new comprehensive schools would provide ac-
cormiodation for 25 percent of the expected increase in secondary level en-
rollment between 1q73 and 1980, and also serve as centers for adult educa-
tion.  iT is necessary to move quickly in establishing enough schools based
00 t1nf: -eFr concept to achieve wide public acceptance; in areas where the new
s -hools b'.'e beern established, the communities haive quickly become convinced
ol their value.
26.       Consolidation and modernization of education facilities would also
be enhanced through replacement of 27 inadequate existing rural secondary
schools with 10 out of the 14 new comprehensive secondary schools, replace-
ment of five small existing technical teacher training centers with the pro-
posed new one and replacement of obsolete facilities used by the Faculty of
Agriculture at University College, Dublin. Furthermore, the Government's
plans to encourage development outside the Dublin area would be furthered by
the provision of a National Institute of Higher Education (NIHE) irL Limerick,



as well as b1y industria3. C4a-li n_ cen~zers and regional technical colleges lo-
cated in seven development: centers throughout the country, in accord with edu-
cational objectives, industrial development plans and the Government's 1972
regional development plan.   A major modernization of curricula to serve cur-
rent and future needs will be undertaken at the Faculty of Agriculture, Uni-
versity College, Dublin; curricula improvements will be continued at all other
project institutions in accordance with educational reform objectives adopted
by the Government.
27.       With respect to the new Faculty of Agriculture at University College,
aiblin, assurances have been obtained from the Government that a major re-
vison of the curriculum now under consideration would be finalized. It will
provide for greatly increased options in general as well as for specialized
agrictultural programs and would include: (i) an increase in elective courses
and in independent study time for students; (ii) the introduction of new
courses into the fourth year and an improved balance between course work and
practical work at the experimental stations; and (iii) the provision of pro-
grans for upgrading or retraining many of the agricultural specialists now
emploved in private and public sectors.   Adoption of a revised curriculutn
and development plan satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of disbursement
for this item.  Of the total loan, an amount of about $830,000 is allocated
to this item; the new curriculum is expected to be adopted by June 1974.
28.       A second item s-ibject to a czondition of disbursement is the pro-
vision of computer equipment at NIHE and the third level technical institu-
tions included in the project; an integrated computer development plan will
be furnished to the Bank before disbursements are approved. In this case
the purpose is to avoid costlv duplication and overdesign of equipment which
might othervise result if each institution developed separate systems; these
plans will also ensure that prioritv use would be for technical training pro-
grams and related industrial research needs. The computer plan is essential
for an assessment of the use of the equipment, particularly with regard to
the likely effectiveness of comiputer time-sharing and the determination of
the most appropriate equipment. This item also amounts to $800,000; the
proposed plan is expected to be received and reviewed by the Bank before
late Spring 1974.
29.       Ireland is also preparing a comprehensive national plan for the
development of third level technical education. A committee within the Edu-
cation Department is working on this plan and has instructions to complete
it within two years, at which time it will be sent to the Bank for review.
As this plan will provide the guidelines for the future development and ra-
tionalization of third level technical education throughout Ireland, engineer-
ing degree courses will be sanctioned in the regional technical colleges only
if they are consistent with the plan.
30.       The Government intends to grant an appropriate level of autonomy
to all third level technical institutions consistent with assuring that the
objectives of the comprehensive national plan are fulfilled. The Government
undertook that a constitution which provides such autonomy to NIHE would be
adopted within two years from the date of the Loan Agreement.

31.       The estimated total cost of tihe project is about US$63 million,
includinag a foreign exchange component of US$25 mi:Llion.  The proposed loan
of US$25 million would cover the foreign exchange component, whiclh is about
40 percent of the total cost of the project.    The local currency expenditure,
amounting to just under $38 million, would be covered bv the Irishi Government.
To ensure early completion of two of the important components included in the
project, i.e. the Industrial Training Centers and facilities for the NIhE,
the Government has already awJarded contracts for some of the civil works
involved. These contracts totalling about $5.10 million and having a for-
eign exchange cost of about $1.41 million hiave been awarded in accordance
with the Banik Guidelines.  The proposed loan would, therefore, include up
to US$300,000 of retroactive financing towards the foreign exclhange expend-
itures made for thiese works and equipment since August 1, 1973.
32.       Unit capital cosCs for all project institutions compare favorably
to similar Bank projects and are considered reasonable on the basis of a
detailed review of all construction, furniture, and equipment requirements,
consistent with Ireland's educational and training objectives. Due to the
use of modular systems, industrialized components and cost control methods
developed durirg the first education project, construction costs are expect-
ed to remain about 10 percent lower than market pr:ices in Ireland for com-
parable construction in the prIvate sector.    Use factors are efficient, rang-
ing from 76 to 87 percent for c'Lassrooms and fromt 60 percent to 87 percent
for laboratories, workshops and other specialized facilities.
33.       The Irislh Government's recurrent expenditures in 1972/73 on educa-
L4on representei about 15 percent of c*urrent revenues, and public expend-
itures (capital and recurrent) about 5.1 percent of GNP. IWith the additional
½l~ftcl4es introduced, under the Bank's first and the proposed second educa-
t.jon project, ny 19A5  hle publi.c expenditure on education is expected to
:.icrease to about 6 percent of G.NF. This is a realistic target in relation
to zhe couintrv's e!ducation deve:Lopment requirements and financial capacities.

gin of 15 percent of the C.l.F. cost of competing imports or the existing rate
of duty, whlichever is lower.



Disbursements
35.       Disbursements for furniture and equipment would be 100 percent of
foreign expenditures (C.I.F. cost), if a foreign bidder wins the award, or
100 percent of total expenditures (ex-factory price) in case of a successful
local bidder. Civil works disbursements would be on the basis of 27.7 percent
of total civil works expenditures, representing the estimated foreign exchange
component of civil works financed under the proposed loan.
Project Administration and Implementation
36.       The existing Project Unit, established within the Ministry of
Education to administer the first education project, is operating effectively
and would be assigned similar responsibilities for the proposed project. The
enlarged unit would include the following full-time officers: a Project
Director, a Deputy Project Director, two Project Architects, a Project
Technical Educator, two Project General Educators and a Project Procurement
Officer.
37.       The project would be completed in about five years.     Construction
started in September 1973, and is expected to be completed by July 1977;
delivery and installation of furniture and equipment for all institutions
would be completed by December 1977, after which it may require up to one
year to complete guarantees and clear accounts. The implementation schedule
is tight and reflects the Government's view of the urgent need for rapidly
consolidating its educational reform programs to supply the trained manpower
required for the country's further development.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRU1ENTS
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between Ireland and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan
Agreement contains the standard provisions for education projects.
39.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

satisfactory pace.
Ln. No. 726 Second Power Project; US$20 million Loan of March 3, 1971^
Closing Date:  March 31, 1976.

EEC and the political troubles in the North. Investment levels have picked
up since Ireland voted to join EEC, and this loan is expected to be fully
committed shortly.

Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This loan assists in financing the construction of 24 secondary
comprelhensive schools, and one secondary technical school, one regional
college, and one college of coummerce; it also provides for technical assist-
ance from specialists in education planning and construction.    It became
effective in November 1971 anid implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
Disbursements have begun to accelerate in recent months.
