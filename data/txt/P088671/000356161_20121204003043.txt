KYRGYZ REPUBLIC - WATER MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
                      (WMIP - P088671)
        IDA GRANT H212 KG, JAPANESE GRANT TF056324

                                   Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for Kyrgyz Republic, Water Management Improvement Project
   (WMIP, IDA Grant No: H212 KG, Japanese Grant No: TF056324, P088671), will be
   extended from December 31, 2012 to November 30, 2013.

2. The project currently is Unsatisfactory for Project Development Objective (PDO) and
   Moderately Unsatisfactory for Implementation Progress. The project is scheduled to
   close by December 31, 2012, has been rated Moderately Unsatisfactory from May
   2011 onwards, and was downgraded to Unsatisfactory in November 2012. In case of
   a project extension until November 30, 2013, the current implementation progress
   would enable the project to achieve a Moderately Satisfactory rating for the PDO at
   project closing.

3. The project has suffered from significant implementation delays. Under Component 1
   – Rehabilitation and Modernization of Irrigation Infrastructure, with the current
   project closing date of December 31, 2012, only 13 out of 20 contracts will be
   completed, and 7 contracts (covering 6 schemes) will remain uncompleted. The
   reasons for this slow progress are: (i) under-resourced contractors; (ii) underestimated
   construction periods for sites at remote locations; (iii) the events in the south in 2010,
   where around 75% of the civil works are conducted; and (iv) inadequate procurement
   and slow tendering at the start of the project.

4. If the project is not extended, the Recipient would be responsible to finance around
   US$2.5 million outstanding under 7 contracts for 6 irrigation schemes. Given the
   significant budget constraints faced by the Recipient, it is most likely that the
   rehabilitation of these 6 schemes would not be completed. This situation would lead
   to several adverse results: (i) the incomplete schemes would not provide adequate
   water supply to around 80,000 beneficiaries (farmers and their households) covering
   15,000 ha; (ii) the rehabilitation works initiated in 5 schemes have already partially
   dismantled/replaced the existing water conveyance infrastructure, and if rehabilitation
   is not completed, the water supply to targeted beneficiaries would be worse than
   before the project intervention and would be prone to rapid further deterioration
   because of uncontrolled water flows; and (iii) the incomplete works, including the
   resulting uncontrolled water, would likely have an adverse impact on the livelihoods
   of beneficiaries in the project area and would also generate negative publicity.

5. The proposed extension is necessary to complete the civil works for the rehabilitation
   of 6 irrigation schemes under Component 1. With the project extension, the outcome
   indicators for the first part of the PDO of “improving irrigation service delivery and
   water management for the benefit of a sustainable increase in irrigated agricultural
   productivity? could be achieved. The completion of works under the 6 schemes will
   increase disbursement from 79.9% currently to 99%. The Recipient through the DWR


                                              6
   has submitted a revised implementation plan and budget to IDA to complete the civil
   works by November 30, 2013.

6. The project extension would not enable the outcome indicators for the second part of
   the PDO of “improving national water resource governance for the benefit of water
   users and the nation as a whole? to be fully be achieved. This is due to unsatisfactory
   progress under Component 2 – Management of Water Resources. In spite of
   significant efforts from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the Project
   Implementation Unit of the WMIP, the National Water Council (NWC) has not been
   convened by the Prime Minister’s office since project effectiveness in 2007 and
   therefore has not issued the relevant resolutions for implementation of the Water
   Code. In order to achieve part of the results for improved water resource governance,
   the government will need to take several actions: (i) prepare a proposed roadmap,
   which details critical actions, NWC resolutions, milestones and the timeline for
   implementation of critical elements of the Water Code, including delineation of river
   basin boundaries, establishment of the SWA, preparation of river basin plans and a
   National Water Strategy; and (ii) convene the NWC to discuss and endorse the
   roadmap and issue the agreed resolutions to start implementation of the Water Code.
   In case the government does not complete these actions by January 25, 2013, a
   notification of suspension for Component 2 will be issued. In case the government
   prepares a detailed roadmap and convenes the NWC, the IDA task team and
   government will review the PDO and prepare a separate project restructuring paper in
   the first quarter of 2013 to revise the PDO (if necessary) and the outcome indicators
   to reflect what is achievable in the remaining project period. This would ensure that
   the project would close Moderately Satisfactory.

7. No changes to the current FM arrangements are required. The most recent FM
   supervision of the project confirmed that in general the PIU has established
   acceptable FM arrangements including accounting, reporting, budgeting and funds
   flow, internal controls and staffing. The project audit report for FY 2011 with
   unmodified (clean) opinion has been submitted on time. The management letter did
   not contain any major internal control or accountability issues. The project audit
   report and the accompanying project financial statements have been considered
   acceptable to the Bank. FMRs under the project are usually received on-time and
   generally found to be acceptable.

8. This will be the 2nd extension of the project. In February 2011, the project had a
   level two restructuring extending the closing date from December 31, 2011 to
   December 31, 2012.
