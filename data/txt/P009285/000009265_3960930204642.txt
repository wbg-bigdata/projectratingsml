MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ELEKTROPRIVREDA OF SERBIA, YUGOSLAVIA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
FOR THE KOLUBARA B THERMAL POWER AND LIGNITE MINE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Elektroprivreda of Serbia, Yugoslavia, with the guarantee of the Socialist
Republic of Yugoslavia, to help finance the Kolubara B Thermal Power and
Lignite Mine Project, is submitted for approval. The loan for $300.0 million
would have a term of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  During the 1960s and 1970s Yugoslavia's economy grew
rapidly, with the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaging about 6%
p.a. This performance, however, was supported by large investments where
insufficient attention was paid to quality or cost. Moreover, the economy's
ability to adjust to external shocks was reduced by an excessively
accommodating credit policy and by rigidities and distortions, including low
mobility of capital and labor, negative real interest rates, an increasingly
overvalued exchange rate and highly protected domestic industries. In
addition, the growth of wages exceeded the growth of labor productivity in the
late 1970s. In the early 1980s, Yugoslavia embarked on a long term economic
adjustment and restructuring program which was supported in the 1980-85 period
by two i;1Af standby arrangements, the first Bank SAL (FY83) and debt
restructuring agreements with governments and commercial banks. Although the
external balance of the economy improved, strong internal imbalances persisted
and were reflected in increasing enterprise losses and stagna-ut output
performance. A period of sustained stagflation set in, with unemployment
increasing and inflation reaching about 60% per month by late 1989.
3.       In January 1990, the Yugoslav Government launched a stabilization and
restructuring pr tram supported by a new IMF Standby and SAL II. The program
combined a curret. : reform, a wage freeze, a convertible currency, an exchange
rate freeze, and a partial price freeze with a tight monetary and fiscal
policy. It also included comprehensive measures to restructure the banking
system and the enterprise sector and to start the privatization process. The
results during the first half of 1990 showed that the program was successful
in reducing inflation and restoring confidence, specifically in the country's
currency and, more generally, in the economy and in the Government's new
approach to economic management. By June 1990, inflation was brought down to
zero, with buoyant export performance and record-high foreign reserves (about
$9 billion). However, industrial output continued to decline and agriculture
suffered from a drought. Due to strong socio-political pressures, wage
restraints were gradually abandoned by the enterprises and public expenditures
on pensions and wages increased sharply. An accommodating monetary policy led
to a reappearance of inflation in summer 1990 and the exchange rate became
increasingly overvalued. Trade performance suffered as a result and the



- 2 -
economy appeared to be heading toward another bout of stagflation. Since
early 1991, however, the Federal Government has been trying to control
inflation, with some limited success. Thus, while the inflation rate. was
about 15% between January and February, it fell to 3% in Rarch. The
Government also devalued the dinar twice in this period to restore the
competitiveness of the economy. Unless accompanied by complementary fiscal
and income policy measures, however, inflation is likely to resurface. The
Federal Government continues to show remarkable tenacity in trying to
implement an appropriate stabilization and adjustment program despite strong
political difficulties.
4.       Yugoslavia's energy sector, and in particular the electricity sub-
sector, has been substantially affected by the economic downturn. Investments
were reduced, price levels did not keep up with inflation and enterprises
became severely short of cash to meet their operating needs, as well as
finance any sizable expansion program.
5.       The Kolubara B Thermal Power and Lignite Mine Project is the largest
and most crucially important energy investment project under implementation in
the country. It is located in Serbia, the country's only net energy exporting
republic. The Project is environmer.tally acceptable and is needed to meet the
anticipated electricity needs of Serbia and its suppli'^s to other republics in
the late nineties. It is economically viable and fits within the country's
least cost Investment program for the sector.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The main thrust of the Bank's
assistance strategy in Yugoslavia has been to support the country's ongoing
economic reform drive. In order to deepen the supply response of the
adjustment, the proposed country assistance program includes lending
operations in support of: the further restructuring of the financial and
enterprise sectors; the development of small and medium enterprises,
particularly in the growing private sector; the development of agriculture;
and the further strengthening of the social safety net. Of equal importance,
sector and project investment operations in the transport, energy, water
supply and environment sectors aim at supporting the country's efforts to
improve broad sectoral policies, primarily in the areas of: pricing and cost
recovery, investment choice, operational efficiency, strengthening maintenance
capacities, achieving an appropriate balance between maintenance and new
investments, and improving the quality of life. The proposed project conforms
to this approach.
7.       The project would be the Bank's first involvement in the coal and
thermal power sub-sectors. There is already a shortage of power in the
country and in a five year time-frame this is expected to become an acute
problem. The urgent need to rehabilitate the aging thermal power plants in
Serbia would further intensify the problem. Lignite is the country's largest
and only known major indigenous source of electricity generation for the
future as: (a) most of the sizable hydro resources have already been
developed; (b) the oil and gas reserves are very limited; and (c) a moratorium
has been placed on new nuclear plants until the year 2000. Consequently, the
proposed project is in line with the energy policy of Yugoslavia to develop



- 3 -
lignite-fired thermal uni.ts in association with the domestic lignite mine
development. Implementation of the project started in 1985 and stopped
shortly thereafter due to foreign exchange shortages. The Bank support for
the project will ensure its completion and the timely implementacion of needed
power generating facilities and mining development to address the future
energy shortage. More importantly, the proposed loan would assist in the
strengthening of the Serbian institutions in the energy sector to make them
financially stronger and help rationalize electricity prices. Finally the
project would substantially strengthen the monitoring of air quality as a
basis for developing appropriate environmental policies and actions.
8.       Project Objectives.  The objectives of the Project are to:  (i) meet
the growth in demand for electricity in Serbia most economically, including
its supplies to other republics, in the late nineties; (ii) facilitate
rehabilitation of aging thermal generating units in Serbia; (iii) introduce a
sy<;tematic air-quality monitoring and study program in the Kolubara area; and
(iv) improve the financial performance of EPS and EP(S) and strengthen their
capacities in financial management/accounting.
9.       Project Descriltioi.  The Project comprises:  (i) construction of a
7.0 million tons per year lignite mine at Tamnava West in Serbia; (ii)
construction of a 700 MW (2 x 350 MW) mine-head Thermal Power Plant and
auxiliary facilities at Kolubara B site located at the north end of Tamnava
west mine field; (iii) urgent maintenance/rehabilitation of Thermal Power
Plants in Serbia; (iv) technical assistance for: (a) an eight year Power
Plant rehabilitation action plan in Serbia aimed at extending the life span
and improving the efficiency of power plants including the air quality control
facilities resulting in better dust emission control; (b) financial
management, accounting and relevant training and cost of service studies fo_
tariff determination and monitoring; (c) a diagnostic study based future
mining development plan and subsequent implementation program for (i) the
Kolubara area to avoid potential conflicts between the existing and planned
land use under the project and due to possible future mining extension; and
(ii) for the restructuring of Serbia's uneconomic and unsafe underground
mines; and (d) long-term regional air quality monitoring and study programs
providing critical information on environmental implications to ensure
appropriate future lignite based power development policies and actions.
10.      The Project would be carried out by EPS over five and a half years
and would cover funds for civil works, equipment and materia's, technical
assistance and training. On completion, project facilities will be
transferred to EP(S), the eventual owner. The total financing requirement of
the project is estimated at US$1,314.3 million equivalent (including interest
during construction), with a foreign exchange component of US$545.3 million
(42%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement
schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Yugoslavia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing project locations is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9420-YU, dated May 20, 1991, is
being distributed separately.

11.      During negotiations the following agreements have been reached:
-        with the Republic of Serbia:  (i) to take all steps necessary
(including provision of funds) to ensure completion of the Stuborovni water
supply dam by 1994 to start operation during that year, to ensure timely water
supplies for the Kolubara B thermal power station; and (ii) to contribute
necessary fun.s for the project's implementation in a timely manner, should
there be a shortage of counterpart funds.
-        with EPS:  (i) to furnish the Bank for review and comments the
results and the findings of the load characteristics study by January 31, 1992
and based on that carry out a cost of service study; (ii) (a) to carry out a
long-term mining development plan at Kolubara on the basis of terms of
reference and the timetable agreed with the Bank; and (b) to discuss the
results of the study with the Bank before implementation of Phase 2 of the
Kolubara B power plant and associated mine expansions' or the development or
extension of other existing mines to supply that plant; (iii) to initiate a
major long-term program of regional air-quality monitoring and study on the
basis of terms of reference and the timetable agreed with the Bank; (iv) to
implement the agreed Serbian Power Plant Rehabilitation Action Plan on the
time schedule indicated therein; (v) to take all steps necessary to maintain:
(a) annual ratios cash operating costs to operating revenues of not more than
.95, and (b) annual ratios of the sum of operating expenses (excluding
depreciation), taxes, financial expenses and debt service, in relation to
total revenues of no more than .97. These targets would be monitored on a
quarterly basis and EPS would take immediate remedial actions as necessary to
keep its performance in line with the targets; (vi) to ensure: (a) the average
revenue collection period for electricity sold not to exceed 60 days in 1992
and 1993, 45 days in 1994 and 30 days thereafter; (b) for accounts outstanding
more than the stipulated days immediately; institute the appropriate legal
actions to ensure collection; provide a provision for doubtful debts in its
accounts; and serve notice of disconnection if payments are not received
within 30 days of the date of such notice; and (c) for electricity purchased,
to pay the accounts within 60 days in 1992 and 1993, 45 days in 1994 and
within 30 days thereafter.
-        with EP(S):  to maintain:  (i) in each fiscal year starting 1992
internal annual cash surpluses not less than 35X (three years moving average)
of capital expenditures incurred; and (ii) debt service coverage (internally
generated cash surpluses in relation to servicing long-term borrowing) not
lower than 2 in 1992, 2.5 in 1993 and 3 thereafter.
-        both with EPS and EP(S):  (i) to develop and implement an action
program for restructuring the underground mines; the program should be
submitted for Bank comments by March 31, 1992; (ii) to carry out a study to
identify the needed actions to improve the accounting and financial management
systems and commence implementation of the actions that would be agreed with
.1/ The proposed project is the Phase 1 development.



* 5 -
the Bank after joint review of the diagnostic phase of the study by June 30,
1992; (Mii) to forward to the Bank by November 30 of each year for review and
comment the proposed revenue sharing agreement, starting with the agreement
for 1992; (iv) to submit audited accounts and audit reports not later than
five months after the end of each financial year; and (v) to forward each year
by October 31 to the Bank the proposed annual investment program (together
with the financing plan) covering the next five years.
12.      Justificati2n.  The Bank carried out a national least-cost power
expansion study for the period 1990-2000 to update and improve the economic
analysis prepared by the Borrower. The results of the optimization study
demonstrates the economic merit of the proposed project and the optimum timing
of its commissioning. The Kolubara B project will add about 2,000 GWh to the
power system starting from its commissioning in 1996 and 4,000 GWh in 1997.
The optimization study confirmed that construction of the Kolubara B project
provides the least cost and quickest solution to meeting the power shortage in
Yugoslavia. The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is estimated at
about 14.5X. Finally, the project will contribute substantially towards
institutional building to improve efficiency and management of the power
sector in Serbia.
13.      Risks.  The proposed project is a baseload generating facility.  The
plant will burn the same quality of lignite as is presently mined in the area
for other existing chermal power plants. The implementation organization
(EPS) and operation agency [EP(S)] have proven expertise in construction,
mining, operation and maintenance of similar lignite mines and thermal power
plants in Serbia. No special risks are expected in construction and
operation. The proposed project meets requirements of prevailing Serbian and
Bank environmental guidelines, policies, and procedures and no major
environmental project risks are anticipated. In particular, air quality
estimates made under the most conservative assumptions concluded that the
proposed project will meet all emission standards with respect to dust,
nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emission. Provisions made in the project
design will also enable the plant to meet more stringent emission standards if
they are required in the future. In the face of continuing difficult macro
and micro economic situation, particularly the re-emerging inflation, the
financial situation of the enterprises may be affected by: (a) the financial
difficulties of their clients, and (b) pressure from the federal/republican
authorities to oppose increases in 4lectricity prices as in the past. While
no immediate tariff adjustments are necessary, for the future specific
financial covenants will minimize this risk.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
