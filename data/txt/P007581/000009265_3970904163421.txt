MEXICO
CHIAPAS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA)
Guarantor:        United Mexican States
Beneficiary:       Secretary of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH)
Amount:            US$90 million equivalent.
Terms:             Fifteen years, including three years grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project
Objectives and
Description:      The proposed loan is one of two being presented
simultaneously (agriculture and rural roads development) as
part of the Bank's participation in an integrated
development program for the State of Chiapas, in the
Southeast of Mexico. The Chiapas Development Plan is
designed to address the main constraints for the
development of the State--namely, a depressed social
environment, underutilized agricultural resource and lack
of adequate communications-through an integrated approach
placed in the context of a wider development scheme for the
southeastern region of Mexico. At the core of this program
are the investments required to achieve balanced socio-
economic development of the areas of influence of the
proposed parallel agriculture and rural roads' projects.
The proposed project would support an initial phase of this
program through execution of an agricultural development
program in coordination with other social and economic
developments. It aims to bring new land into rainfed crop
production and intensify crop and livestock production on
existing land, increase agricultural production and
productivity, and generate rural employment and income.
The project would cover an area of about 317,500 ha. To
achieve these objectives the project would (a) construct
flood control and road works; (b) strengthen administra-
tion; (c) provide for on-farm works; (d) provision of soil
conservation structures; (e) strengthen production support
services; and (f) conduct studies.



- ii -
Beneficiaries:    The project would largely focus on 'ejidos" and small-hold-
ers, directly benefiting about 32,000 rural families and
providing full-time employment for about 15,000 people. In
addition, it would benefit most of the urban families in
area of influence of the flood control and service road
works.
Project Risks:    The project faces three possible risks.  The first flows
from the fact that the institutional framework for
coordination of Federal and State level planning and
implementation activities is new and largely untested in
practice. This institutional risk may also have
implications for the provision of adequate and timely
counterpart funding. To address this problem, the
Government is taking steps to improve the institutional and
budgetary capabilities of the executing agencies involved.
The second and third risks could be (a) the beneficiaries'
failure to adopt high-yield technologies; and (b) reluc-
tance to switch to intensified crop production. Both would
be minimized by strengthening the extension, research and
promotion services, and providing drainage and river
control infrastructure improvements. The project's major
target group-small farmers-are expected to respond
positively to incentives under the project. Therefore,
adequate safeguards are provided against the three major
risks of the proposed project.

I. AGRICULTURE AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A. The Agricultural Sector
Agriculture in the Economy
1.01      Mexico's agricultural sector contributes about 10% of the gross
domestic product, employs about one-third of the country's active labor force
and contributes about 6% of the country's exports. Between 1945 and 1955,
agricultural production growth rates averaged about 6% annually, but declined
to about 4.4% between 1955 and 1965, and to less than 3% between 1965 and
1980. During the latter period, production increases from newly irrigated
land slowed down and agricultural terms of trade gradually worsened. How-
ever, agricultural production increased at an annual average rate of about
8.5% in 1981 and 1982. The increase was the combined result of favorable
weather conditions, higher farm-gate prices and large input subsidies under
the Government-sponsored Mexican Food Program (SAM). During most of this
period, the population grew at an annual rate of about 3.3%, but growth has
declined recently to about 2.5% annually.
1.02      The reduced agricultural production growth before 1981, coupled
with increasing internal demand, resulted in increased food imports and
deterioration in the agricultural trade balance. In 1979 the country experi-
enced its first agricultural trade deficit, and in 1981 the deficit was over
US$1 billion. However, since 1982 the agricultural trade deficit has begun to
decrease primarily due to reduced imports influenced by substantial devalu-
ations. Since 1970, corn, wheat, soybeans, sorghum and powdered milk have
been the principal food imports, representing almost 82 of total imports in
1980. During the same period, cotton, coffee, and vegetables constituted the
main exports.
Production, Trends and Past Agricultural Policy
1.03      Mexico's basic crops, which include maize, beans, wheat, rice,
sorghum, soybeans and sugarcane, are produced on about 75% of the cultivated
area. Production has varied strongly from year to year with a growth trend of
1.5% to 2.5% over the 1970s, i.e., well below the population growth rate.
Government intervention in the price setting and marketing of these crops
gradually grew stronger over the decade. With the pressure to protect the
consumer against increased food prices during a period of gradually increasing
inflation, the terms of trade worsened and negative protection rates pre-
vailed. As a result, imports of these crops increased sharply: maize imports
from 736,000 tons in 1970 to 3.8 million tons in 1980, and sorghum imports
from 10,900 tons in 1970 to 2.8 million tons in 1981. From 1980 to 1982, the
Government attempted to reverse this trend by substantially increasing farm-
gate prices and introducing a range of input subsidies in the context of SAM.
Farmers responded positively (para. 1.01), but as consumer prices for the
basic products were allowed to rise at much lower rates, consumer subsidies
also increased, and the Government program turned out to be too costly to
maintain after 1982.



- 2 -
1.04      The production of export crops (mainly coffee, fruits and
vegetables), which has remained relatively free from Government intervention
in trade and prices, showed an annual average growth of about 12% up to 1979.
In the ensuing three years, exports of these crops stagnated, mainly due to an
increasing overvaluation of the Mexican currency. However, indications are
that since 1982 growth has resumed. On livestock activities, beef production
grew at an annual rate of 7Z between 1975 and 1982; pork, poultry and egg
production increased at even higher rates, between 10% and 12% annually over
the same period. These growth rates were sufficient to cover increased domes-
tic demand, and Mexico's traditional beef exports were basically maintained.
Milk, however, which is produced under controlled prices, grew only about 1.8%
per annum during this period. Milk imports in the ten years before 1982 rose
at an annual rate of about 20%, and presently equal about 16X of total produc-
tion in fluid equivalent.
1.05      Growth in related sectors has been mixed: (a) the agroindustrial
subsector grew 10% during the 1970s, and in 1979 accounted for about 18% of
the industrial sector's output; (b) the forestry sector, which includes about
21 million ha of commercial wood, is underexploited, producing only about
9 million m3 of wood products in 1981; and (c) the fisheries subsector has
shown significant growth in recent years rising from an annual catch of about
0.25 million tons in 1970 to about 2 million tons in 1982. Approximately 30%
of the value went into exports (mainly shrimp), and about 50% of the total
catch went into fish meal.
Present Agricultural Policy
1.06      At the end of 1982, when the new Government took office, there was
an urgent need to reassess and reorient agricultural development policies.
After substantial devaluations, domestic farm-gate prices had deteriorated in
real terms. Strong price increases, especially for the basic commodities,
were required if farmers were to maintain and increase production levels. On
the other hand, in order to lower high inflation levels, there was a need to
contain increased food prices. Also, in view of high public sector deficits,
the Government's agricultural subsidy policy needed to be overhauled.
1.07      The Government's policy, as outlined in the National Development
Plan for 1983-1988, is designed to accelerate agricultural growth, alleviate
poverty, and correct regional economic and social imbalances. The policy
emphasizes the importance of agriculture in increasing Mexican exports and
production of import substitutes. The stated policy over the medium term is
to guarantee farm prices which are consistent with international prices. How-
ever, in the short term, emphasis is being placed on adequate compensation for
the increased cost of production and a reasonable profit margin to producers
to determine price levels. Prices for basic crops and milk (i.e., mostly the
controlled sector) increased between 120% and 160% in nominal terms during
1982, 1983 and 1984, and are presently 80-90% of international prices at cur-
rent exchange rates. Input subsidies have been substantially reduced; subsi-
dized prices for cash inputs (fertilizer and seeds) are now only available to
small farmers holding less than 20 ha each. Interest rates on agricultural
subloans, which until now were fixed and generally negative, have been made
variable and are expected to approach positive levels in the medium term. The
movement in rates has been referenced to the latest average cost of funds to



multipurpose banks (ACF)1/. Irrigation water rates were increased an average
of about 200% during 1983 and subsequent adjustments are being made toward the
stated goal of recovering operation and maintenance costs wherever possible,
under a general strategy to improve the use and management of Mexico's water
and soil resources. The Government has also taken steps to decentralize plan-
ning, programming and implementation of rural development projects to state
and local levels and to improve interagency coordination. Agricultural policy
dialogue between the Go';ernment and the Bank has been intense in the recent
past, and both have agreed to a continuous policy dialogue in the future.

US$56 million; and
(g) Small-Scale Agriculture Infrastructure Development (1643-ME) -
US$60 million.
1.09      Since issuing the Staff Appraisal and Presidentts Reports for the
Eighth Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2454-ME) on June 4, 1984, the Bank
has issued completion reports on three irrigation projects (Panuco, Loan
969-ME; Sinaloa, Loan 970-ME; and Papaloapan Rural Development, Loan
1053-ME). It is currently processing the completion reports for the Bajo Rio
Bravo Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1111-ME) and the Second Inte-
grated Rural Development Project (PIDER II, Loan 1462-ME). The lessons
learned and taken into consideration in designing the proposed project have
been that: (a) in preparing irrigation projects, the alternative of developing
rainfed agriculture should always be considered; (b) a strong extension
service is necessary for the development of agriculture; (c) projected

bonds, notes and certificates of deposit, excluding checking and savings
accounts. The ACF is established monthly by the Bank of Mexico.



-4-
agricultural production targets should be based on tested models; (d) large
civil works components require advanced preparation before appraisal;
phasing should be considered for large projects with expected long implementa-
tion periods; (f) complex multi-sectoral projects, such as PIDER, with many
components and executing agencies, are difficult to manage and implement; and
(g) projects in new areas especially where experience and knowledge are
limited, should be modest in scope and design, reflecting a pilot approach.
1.10      Implementation of ongoing projects, with the exception of credit, is
currently slow because counterpart funds are limited and financial control
procedures are cumbersome. The Government, in cooperation with the Bank, is
now reviewing the financial control procedures in order to accelerate
disbursements. Also, under the Bank's Special Action Program, all ongoing
projects have been reviewed, cost estimates have been revised, an increased
share of the project cost is being financed by Bank funds for two years and
partial loan cancellations have been made where implementation was lagging
substantially, totalling US$220.4 million in 1984.
B. Regional Development
Background
1.11      The Government's policy, as outlined in the National Development
Plan for 1983-1988 (para. 1.07), calls for special efforts to promote develop-
ment in depressed regions throughout the country. Within the confines of its
regional development program, the Government has placed high priority on the
State of Chiapas in the Southeast of Mexico.
Strategy for Development in Chiapas
1.12      The State of Chiapas is one of the least developed states in the
country, with a per capita income of US$350, compared to the national average
of USS2,250. The State's population is currently estimated at about 2.3
million, with over 65% of the people living in rural areas. Agriculture
accounts for only about 35% of the State's GDP.
1.13      In May 1983 the Government of Mexico announced a long-term multi-
sectoral development program for the State--the Chiapas Plan--as part of its
regional development strategy. The basic strategy of the Chiapas Plan is to:
(a) promote a more balanced distribution of social and economic benefits
through economic growth and special development programs; (b) decentralize
dectsion-making and management in favor of the State Government and local
aut  rities for resource allocation and implementation of development pro-
grams; tc) institutionalize and reinforce the participation of the rural popu-
lation in the formulation and design of investment programs; Cd) develop local
resources and offer incentives to increase production of efficient import
substitutes and exports; (e) utilize fully potential land resources by
improving infrastructure, as well as the technical capacity of the producers
to adopt new cropping systems and technology; and (f) promote conservation of
the land resources and environment. The proposed development program is
expected to be carried out in several phases over a 15-year period. At the
outset, the Government plans to focus primarily on accelerating agricultural



-5-
growth and improving the physical infrastructure, mainly roads, throughout the
entire State.
1.14      Agriculture, the mainstay of the local economy, would focus on
bringing new land into cultivation, intensifying crop and livestock produc-
tion on existing land and promoting improved technology for export expansion
and efficient import substitution. While agricultural production could be
increased substantially statewide, the Coastal Plain offers the largest and
easiest area to augment production significantly.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Background
2.01       The State is divided into four distinct regions:  the Tropical
Coastal Plain, the Central Depression, the Central Highlands (the Altos) and
thp Selva (tropical rainforest). The level of development varies considerably
among these regions, with the Coastal Plain accounting for most of the econo-
mic growth in recent years. In this initial phase of development, the project
area (Annex 1, Table 1, and Map) would consist of about 317,500 ha: 255,000 ha
(80%) on the Coast, 55,000 ha (18%) in the Central Depression, and 7,500 ha
(2Z) in the Altos. The Selva, an environmentally demanding and sparsely
populated area, would not be included in this first phase of development
because adequate investment studies have not been undertaken. It is
contemplated that, with further studies and experience in tne region, develop-
ment would be undertaken in the Selva in subsequent phases of development in
Chiapas.
2.02      The population of the project area is estimated to exceed 300,000,
of which about 175,000 (60%) are rural and 60,000 (20%) are landless. Of the
economically active population (166,000), about 55% are engaged in agricul-
ture. Income levels are low and the present estimated average annual family
income is less than US$1,900. The Coast is an area to which agricultural
labor from other regions of the State migrate for regular and seasonal
employment. Seasonal migrant labor includes underemployed producers from
other areas (especially the Altos) and landless rural people. The harvest of
coffee, banana and cottoa crops also attracts substantial seasonal labor from
Guatemala. Employment in public and private construction has been a major
source of off-farm employment in the past. However, the opportunities for
construction employment have been substantially reduced by current economic
conditions.
2.03      About 250,000 indigenous people with different cultures and
languages live in the Altos, making it almost a state within the state. For
the majority of the population, the opportunities to increase their income
either from the land or off-farm employment in the area are limited. Strong
cultural and family ties have so far inhibited permanent migration to other
areas to seek better opportunities. Various development programs have been
modestl.' successful but manage to benefit only a small part of the population.



2.04      The Coastal and Central Depression areas have a good potential for
rainfed agriculture and adequate surface and ground water for future irriga-
tion development. However, in all of these areas the dominance of rivers
contributes to flooding and inadequate communications. Presently, much of the
Coast is not cultivated because of the high risk of flooding and crop loss.
In the Central Depression a higher percentage of the land is now cultivated;
however, in some areas yields are often reduced as much as 60% in wet years
due to flooding and poor water infiltration and drainage.
2.05      As a first order of priority, the proposed project, as a first phase
of the Chiapas Plan, would focus on flood control and drainage in the Coast
and the Central Depression and on increasing productivity and production under
rainfed conditions in the Coast, the Central Depression and the Altos. All of
the project areas have adequate rainfall (1,500 to 3,000 mm over a six-month
period) and temperatures suitable for seasonal rainfed crop production. Rain-
fall and temperature of the Central Depression are well suited to basic crop
and horticultural crop production. The Coastal climate is suitable for a wide
range of crops, including cereals, cotton, soybeans, rice, sugarcane and
tropical fruits. The more temperate climate of the Altos is excellent for
fruit production (apples, pears, peaches and oranges).
B. Agriculture and Land Use
2.06      In the project area on the Coast, about 80,000 ha are used for crop
production and 175,000 ha for livestock production. The Coast's principal
crops are maize (29,000 ha), cotton (19,000 ha), soybeans (17,000 ha),
sugarcane (12,500 ha) and cocoa (9,500 ha). In Comitan in the Central
Depression about 12,500 ha are used for maize and bean production, 10,000 ha
for pasture and about 1,000 ha for other crops; 8,500 ha are normally not
cultivated because they are too wet. By and large, productivity remains low,
particularly in the Central Depression; however, the scope for improvement is
considerable (details on land tenure, soils and climatic conditions are avail-
able in the Project File).
2.07      Of the total project area of 317,500 ha, about 55% is owned by
ejidos (over 27,000 ejido families) and the remaining 45% by nearly 4,800
private land owners. Ejido holdings average about 8.8 ha and private hold-
ings average 28.6 ha on the Coast, compared to an average of about 6.8 ha and
16.2 ha, respectively, in the Central Depression. Approximately 75 holdings
used for livestock production in the Coastal area (about 10% of the total) are
larger than 200 ha. in the Altos 85% of the cultivable land is held by ejidos,
the remainder is communal and small private land holdings. Land holdings are
highly fragmented, ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 ha, leaving more than 80% of the
population at or below the subsistence level.
2.08      Areas proposed for development under the project are already part of
designated rainfed districts. In accordance with the Agricultural Development
Law of 1981, the Government can declare lands suitable for crop production as
"Production Units," thereby applying a maximum limit of 200 ha per holding.
Alternatively, under with the Federal Water Law of 1972, the Government can
establish -Drainage Districts" as was done under the San Fernando Project
(2191-ME). In Chiapas the Government plans to utilize the Production Unit
concept which provides more flexibility within such designated areas regarding



-7-
the use of land for crop and livestock production. Appropriate administrative
action would provide for acquisition of lands in excess of 200 ha, acquisition
of rights-of-way, and recuperation of investment and infrastructure operation
and maintenance costs, in accordance with the producers' ability to pay,
determined by socioeconomic studies.
2.09      With the proper mechanism, existing legislation provides for:
(a) the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform (SRA) and the Secretariat of Agricul-
ture and Water Resources (SARH) to coordinate regularization of land tenancy
and expedite certification of land in favor of ejidos and small-holders; and
(b) SARH, SRA and the Secretariat of Finance (SHCP) to determine appropriate
recuperation of investments and cost of operation and maintenance.
2.10      Service roads in the project area, except for those in the Altos,
are poor or nonexistent, which adversely affects marketing and development in
the area. In the entire State, there are only 500 field level extension
agents (one for each 6,400 ha) to cover more than 3.2 million ha used for crop
and livestock production. The scattered nature of agriculture and livestock
production areas and difficult communications require a higher than average
ratio of extension staff. Specialized services are available from the Mexican
National Coffee Institute (INMECAFE), the National Cocoa Commission
(CONADECA), the National Fruit Commission (CONAFRUT) and the National
Indigenous Institute (INI).  In general, the state extension services suffer
from lack of qualified and trained staff and inadequate subject matter
specialist support. SARH estimates that about 33% of the crop area and 20% of
the livestock area receive adequate technical support.
2.11      The National Institute for Agriculture Research (INIA) and the
National Institute for Livestock Research (INIP) have research centers in
Chiapas. However, the number of research stations and the number of scienti-
fic staff are inadequate to cover needs of the State and to develop appro-
priate technologies and farming methods to induce production in the region.
2.12      Many farmer organizations in Chiapas (including ejidos) have formed
in response to a variety of Government programs that elicit group requests for
various services. Most ejidos are relatively permanent general agricultural
associations. Other specialized associations, such as those for conservation,
and fruit, vegetable and flower production are common in the Altos. Both the
generalized and specialized organizations would act as vehicles to support
development in the region.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
3.01      In support of the Government's integrated regional development
strategy and the Chiapas Plan, the Bank in this initial phase of development
would focus on the agricultural sector and rural roads infrastructure,
financing in parallel the Chiapas Agricultural Development Project and the
Chiapas Rural Roads Project. The proposed Chiapas Agricultural Development
Project was prepared by SARH's Commission for the National Hydraulic Plan
(CPNH). CPNH was assisted by SARH's Directorate of Studies, its State



- 8 -
Representative, the State Government and the State Committee for Planning and
Development (COPLADE). A Bank identification mission visited Mexico in
October 1982 (just prior to the change in administration), and the project was
finally identified during the visit of a Bank mission in July 1983. Prepara-
tion was completed in February 1984 and the project was appraised in March.
Available working papers and supporting documents are listed in Annex 6.
B. Project Objectives and Description
3.02      The project-which has a high priority in Mexico-has been designed
in accordance with the Government's multi-sectoral regional strategy for
development and the Chiapas Plan (para. 1.13). Bank participation would
support the Government's strategy to increase agricultural production;
accelerate economic growth; alleviate poverty; and correct regional, social
and economic imbalances. The project draws substantially from the experience
of the pilot PRODERITH project in Chiapas (Loan 1553-ME), as well as other
operations, such as PLANAT, Papaloapan and PIDER (paras. 1.08-1.09). The
objectives of the project would be to increase:
(a)  the area available for rainfed crop production and
intensification of crop and livestock production;
Cb)  agricultural production and productivity with a view to
improving self-sufficiency and increasing exports; and
Cc) rural employment and family income.
3.03      To achieve these objectives the project would:
(a)  improve infrastructure by constructing river control dikes,
farm service roads and drains;
(b)  strengthen administration of the rainfed districts operations
by providing field offices, housing, workshops, equipment and
vehicles for operation and maintenance;
(c)  provide financial assistance for on-farm works, including
drains, land clearing, and land smoothing;
(d)  provide for construction of soil conservation structures;
(e)  strengthen production supporting services, extension, research,
training, fellowships, and technical services (including
national and international consultants); and
(f)  conduct studies (basic, feasibility, marketing, environmental
and socioeconomic) to provide data for this project and future
development in the State.
3.04      The project would be carried out over a seven-year period focusing
on medium- and low-income producers, directly benefiting about 32,000 rural
families and providing full-time employment for 15,000 people. It would
benefit most of the urban families in the area of influence of the flood



- 9 -
control and road works. Annex 1, Table 2 outlines the project implementation
schedule. Annex 2 outlines design criteria and concepts for infrastructure
and on-farm development.
C. Detailed Features
Infrastructure
3.05      Dikes with Roads.  In order to protect farmland and rural
communities, the Coastal project area of 255,000 ha would require construction
of about 350 km of flood control dikes, along the rivers that flow from the
mountains through the area to the Pacific Ocean. A road surface 6-8 m wide
would be constructed on the dike corresponding to the top width and mass
required for embankment stability. Dikes would average 1.5 m high. The area
between dikes would be maintained in their natural state and used for pasture.
3.06      Service Roads.  The project would construct and rehabilitate about
475 km of farm service roads in the Coastal and the Central Depression areas
complementing the proposed parallel rural roads project. These roads would be
constructed to proven SARE standards: 4-6 m width and 0.15-0.3 m all-weather
gravel surface, depending on anticipated load conditions and soils available
for embankment; for upland roads, a 4 m width would normally be adequate.
Construction of new roads would involve stripping of surface soils under
embankment areas to provide for a stable base. Borrow areas would be graded
to minimize shallow standing water that could cause health control problems in
areas where malaria is still prevalent. Suitable borrow materials are
available within a reasonable distance of all subproject areas.
3.07      Drains.  Drains would be required to remove excess surface water and
control the water table. Depths would be limited to 1.5 m to avoid excessive
lowering of the water table. About 600 km of drains would be constructed to
the following dimensions: (a) primary drains-4 m bottom width, 1.5 m depth,
2:1 side slope; and (b) secondary drains--1.5 m width, 1.1 m depth and 2:1
side slope. Designs would vary to conform to soil type and hydraulic and
hydrologic requirements. Design capacities are based on flows obtained from
48-hour duration storm based on a five-year frequency event except on very
flat lands (under 1X land slope) where drainage curve procedures are used.
Drainage curves are in accordance with accepted international standards and
generally conform to USDA/Soil Conservation Service requirements for drained
agricultural land.
3.08      Drains with Roads and Auxiliary Structures.  About 300 km of farm
service roads with drains would be constructed in accordance with SARE
standards (paras. 3.06 and 3.07). Most of these roads would be in the Coastal
areas where few roads exist. About 300 auxiliary structures, such as fords,
bridges, culverts, sediment traps and crossings, would also be built as part
of the civil works (dikes, roads and drains). Sediment traps are required
near the outlet of many channels to minimize the movement of coarse-grained
sediment into estuaries and lagoons. This practice would also help reduce the
transport of non-soluble chemicals attached to water transported particles
that could cause environmental degradation in receiving bodies of water.
Filter strips to catch sediment would be maintained to help control agricul-
tural chemicals used in areas where water from crop fields would flow directly



- 10 -
into channels. In order to control and reduce erosion and agricultural chem-
ical transport, vegetation would be planted on channel slopes and spoil
banks. Vegetation on dikes and road side slopes, borrow areas and back slopes
would also contribute to the control of erosion and environmental quality of
these areas.
Administration and Operation
3.09      Field Offices.  For implementation and operational purposes the
project would provide office space, storage and staff housing facilities in
the projec': area. Six field offices would be constructed: two in the Coastal
subproject ereas and one in each of the four Central Depression subproject
areas. The construction engineering staff and production service staff would
be based at these centers. A general description and breakdown of investment
costs for offices and workshops are shown in Annex 1, Table 3.
3.10      Workshops.  The project would provide six buildings for workshops,
staff housing, and equipment and spare parts storage. These workshops would
be developed and supplied with the necessary tools and equipment for service
and repair of vehicles and maintenance of equipment, and would be located with
field offices wherever practical.
3.11      Equipment for Infrastructure Maintenance.  The operation and mainte-
nance of the road network (475 km), drainage system (900 km), dike  system
(400 km), and auxiliary structures (300) would require heavy equipment,
including motor graders, front-end loaders, backhoes, crawler tractors, water
trucks, fuel and water transport trailers, draglines, and miscellaneous small
tools and equipment (Annex 1, Table 4). Maintenance of the infrastructure,
which is traditionally the responsibility of each rainfed district, is a vital
element under the project and would require a substantial annual budget; 0&M
during implementation has been included as part of the project cost.
3.12      Vehicles for Construction and Production Operations.  The project
would provide for the purchase, operation and maintenance of vehicles required
for construction and production operations and services, and are included as
part of the investment costs for research, extension and administration.
On-Farm Development and Soil Conservation
3.13      In order to assist on-farm development, the Government would provide
mediur- and long-term credit for construction of field drains, terracee, land
clearing and smoothing, and soil conservation structures (Annex 2). About
100,000 ha (30% of the total project area) would require some investment for
on-farm development for crop production costing about US$21 million, or an
average of US$210/ha. About 10% of the project area for full development
(Annex 1, Table 1) would require smoothing to remove depressions where water
collects. Land clearing on about 15% of the area would be required to
facilitate efficient field operations for crop and livestock production. It
is estimated that about one-third of the works associated with on-farm
investment would consist of soil conservation works (terraces, gulley erosion
control, reservoirs and grass waterways) which would benefit the community and
would be financed from the SARH budget as a public investment. The major part
of the soil conservation investment would be in the Altos, one of the poorest



- 11 -
areas of the State where socioeconomic analyses indicate that 85% of the popu-
lation is at or below the subsistence level. The holdings are small and frag-
mented (I to 3 ha) on steep fragile soils unsuitable for cultivation without
the benefit of soil conservation structures.
Production Supporting Services
3.14      Extension Services.  At present there are 169 extension workers,
supported by 26 administrative staff in the five rainfed districts (where the
subprojects will be located) to service about 1.5 million ha used for crop and
livestock production. However, to promote a higher level of production and
efficiency under the project, an additional 345 technical staff (288 field
level technicians and 57 subject-matter specialists and other support
personnel) would be provided to strengthen services throughout the five
districts, with particular emphasis in the subproject areas. The level of
coverage in the subproject areas would be about one technician for each
1,000 ha (1:110 farm families) based on the successful intensive PRODERITf
experience required to obtain a rapid transition from traditional extensive
livestock to intensive crop and livestock production. This intensive
extension system would only be maintained during the development phase.
Extension workers would eventually move on to new development areas and
staffing would be reduced to a level of about one technician to 3,300 ha
(1:300 families) in the five districts of the area of influence of the project
(1:340 in Chiapas). The cost for the seven-year period to cover incremental
staffing, vehicles, equipment, and operating costs is shown in Annex 1,
Table 5. Additional information on extension service operations is in the
Project File (Annex 6).
3.15      Research.  The overall objective of research under the proposed
project would be to strengthen existing operations and help generate, test,
and disseminate technical packages that would increase agricultural production
(paras. 5.01-5.03). Project support to research would focus upon supporting
INIA's programs at the Agricultural Research Stations at Rosario Izapa
(CAERI), in Central Chiapas (CAECECH), and on the Coast of Chiapas (CAECOCHI),
and INIP's programs at San Cristobal and Escuintla. Primary areas for study
would be geared toward: (a) improving yields of existing and non-traditional
crop or pasture species suitable for cultivation in Chiapas; (b) developing
and testing new varieties; (c) improving management practices and developing
farming systems; and (d) carrying out practical research appropriate for these
areas in order to benefit from major project investments in drainage infra-
structure. Investments provided to CAECECH in the Central Depression
would ensure the establishment of a satellite research program involving at
least two researchers to work exclusively on problems of the Comitan area,
which is expected to undergo significant changes in production techniques as a
result of drainage investments. Adequate technology is already available from
the PRODERITH project and existing research institutions and programs to
support initial agricultural production development under the project.
Technical packages developed at the research centers would be disseminated
through the Communications Unit in Tuxtla (CIAPAS), either directly to farmers
or indirectly through formal links with the extension service. The cost to
meet the incremental program for a seven-year period to cover construction of
offices, storage, laboratory and library facilities, as well as the purchase
of vehicles and laboratory and audio-visual equipment, staffing and operating



- 12 -
expenditures is shown in Annex 1, Table 6.   A summary of the extension and
research operations and methodology are available in the Project File.
3.16      Training of Staff.  To upgrade and improve the proficiency of
administrative and technical support staff, funds would be allocated to
provide training for selected personnel (Annex 1, Table 5). Training of
extension staff would be carried out at the Tropical Center for Extension and
Training (CRECIDATH) in Vera Cruz, a facility built specifically for this
purpose under the PRODERITH Project, Bank Loan 1553-ME. All new extension
staff would receive a three-month training course on aspects related to the
extension needs of Chiapas, with particular emphasis on the approach that has
been tested under the PRODERITH project (para. 4.14). Final selection of the
extension staff would depend on satisfactory completion of the training and a
final entrance examination. It is estimated that over the project period,
approximately 1,200 extension staff would be trained; based on historical
experience, approximately half would continue in a long-term role in the
extension service. Infrastructure staff responsible for supervision of
drainage works construction and operation would receive short-term training on
specific technical aspects of their job at one of the existing training
centers. In addition, administrative and technical support staff would
receive training in sociological and environmental aspects related to
management and execution of the project.
3.17      Training of Farmers.  Courses in farmer organization, improved
production techniques, and maintenance of drainage infrastructure would be
provided throughout the project period to a total of about 3,000 farmers.
Qualified trainers would be selected from among the technicians who have
completed the technical training described in para. 3.16. The courses would
generally be held in local SARH offices in Chiapas or on-farm demonstration
plots.
3.18      Fellowships.  A total of 12 man-years of fellowships for intensive
local or overseas training would be financed under the project (Annex 1,
Table 5) for middle-level managers to broaden their knowledge in their
respective areas of technical responsibilities.
3.19      Technical Services.  The project would provide funds for national
and international technical services (consultants) to support SARH to
strengthen its operations in the areas of soil conservation, environmental and
socioeconomic impact analysis and research, extension communications, and the
conduct of pre-investment studies. About 180 man-months of technical services
would be provided under the project for this purpose (Annex 1, Table 7).
Studies
3.20      Chiapas is relatively undeveloped and has inadequate knowledge and
experience available to draw upon in the formulation and design of agricul-
tural development proiects. This project would be the first phase of a much
larger and longer-term multi-sectoral investment program for the State.
Therefore, the project includes a major component for studies that would
provide knowledge not only for this project but for future development.
Detailed costs are indicated in Annex 1, Table 7, and a general description of
each study is outlined in Annex 5. Specific areas of study financed under the
project would include:



- 13 -
(a) pre-investment (including feasibility) studies on about
330,000 ha and basic studies on about 300,000 ha in other areas
of the State, including the Selva, and preparation of
investment projects;
(b) detailed soil surveys at the farm level to determine soil
classifications and optimum land use when excess water is no
longer a constraint;
(c) bathymetric and hydrographical surveys of the lagoons and
permanent wetlands of the Coast;
(d) a study to determine marketing requirements in the project area
at full development; and
(e) periodic socioeconomic and environmental Impact reviews in the
subproject areas.
D. Project Costs
3.21      The total project cost would be about US$181.6 million, net of
taxes, including a foreign exchange component of about US$57 million, or 31%
of the total. The base cost, calculated at March 1985 prices, is estimated at
about US$131 million, and physical contingencies are about US$13 million,
based on an estimate of 15% for civil works and 10% for equipment, vehicles,
goods and materials. Price contingencies are based on Bank guidelines and are
calculated at 5% for 1985, 7.5% for 1986, 8% for 1987-1990, and 5% thereafter,
and are estimated to be about US$38 million, or 29% of base costs. Total
phased and detailed cost estimates are presented in Annex 1, Tables 8, 9 and
10. Project costs are summarized below:

E. Project Finaneing
3.22      The proposed Bank loan of US$90 million (50% of the total project
cost) would be to Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA), on standard Bank terms,
and would cover about US$57 million of foreign exchange requirements and US$33
million (26%) of local costs. The proposed financing is summarized below:

NOTE:  Purchase of goods and equipment are normally exempt from taxes;
taxes on civil works would not exceed 8% of cost.
F.  Procurement
Civil Works
3.23      Major civil works (principal roads, dikes and drains) estimated to
cost about US$35 million, would be packaged in contracts of not less than US$2
million, and procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank guidelines for procurement. Other small civil works (buildings,
roads, soil conservation stiructures, drains, etc.) would normally be packaged
in contracts of more than US$200,000 and be procured in accordance with Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. These works are
estimated to cost about US$45 million and would be scattered in time and
place. Minor civil works not suitable for packaging in contracts larger than
US$50,000, estimated to cost an aggregate of not more than US$6 million, would
be purchased according to Government/SARH procedures for force account or
direct contract acceptable to the Bank. For any civil works contracts
expected to exceed US$1.5 million, the Bank's prior approval would be required
before invitations to bid were issued and contracts awarded.
3.24      Civil works procurement procedures used in Mexico were recently
reviewed in detail and found to be generally satisfactory. A working paper on
LCB procedures is in the Project File (Annex 6). Procurement is carried out
in accordance with the Public Works Law which became effective January 1,



- 16 -
1984. The Borrower would be encouraged to modify its procedures in order to
conform more closely to Bank policies. In particular, the time for bidding
would be increased, and contracts would be awarded to the lowest qualified
bidder.
Equipment, Goods and Services
3.25      Equipment for operation and maintenance, estimated to cost about
US$6 million, would be procured under ICB procedures in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Vehicles, equipment, spare parts and materials for administrative
services, operation and production services and training, expected to cost
about US$10 million, would as far as practical be packaged in contract amounts
not less than US$150,000; each would be procured according to LCB procedures
acceptable to the Bank. Equipment, goods and material contracts costing less
than US$150,000 would be procured according to Government/SARH procedures
acceptable to the Bank, and would not exceed in the aggregate US$4 million.
Qualified domestic manufacturers for the supply of equipment, goods and
materials, would receive a preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is
lower. Consultants for technical services would be selected in accordance
with terms and conditions of the Bank guidelines. For all contracts for
equipment, goods and materials expected to exceed US$250,000, the Bank's prior
approval would be required before invitation to bid were issued and contracts
awarded. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it
would follow the procurement arrangements outlined in paras. 3.23-3.25.

G. Disbursements
3.26      Disbursements would be made over seven and one-half years.  The
proposed disbursement schedule (Annex 1, Table 11) is based on-the profile for



- 17 -
agricultural projects in Mexico. The proposed Bank loan of US$90 million
would be disbursed against normal documentation. Purchase of small items and
contracts for less than US$20,000 would be grouped together as far as practi-
cal and disbursements made against statements of expenditures (SOEs).
Disbursements for contracts for buildings and other works, normally costing
less than US$150,000, would also be made against SOEs. All contracts and
supporting documents for SOEs would be retained by the executing agency for
review by the Bank as required and would be audited. In order to provide for
timely payments of reimbursement applications, NAFINSA would establish a
Special Account in US dollars to cover three months of estimated expendi-
tures. The Bank would make an initial deposit of US$6 million. The Borrower
would claim reimbursement of the Bank's share of expenditures from the Special
Account upon presentation of withdrawal applications forwarded to the Bank,
fully documented for replenishment of the Special Account. The Bank would
require a monthly statement of the Special Account which would reflect
transactions during the previous month. The project provides for retroactive
financing for infrastructure, not to exceed US$9 million, for expenditures
incurred after July 1, 1984. Assuming Board presentation in April 1985, the
Completion Date would be March 31, 1993. During negotiations, the Borrower
provided assurances that it would establish a Special Account and submit
monthly statements to the Bank, as described above.
3.27      The table below indicates the categories and items to be financed
from proceeds of the loan as follows:

IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION
A. Organization and Management
4.01      The project would be organized, managed and executed along the
lines that SARH has traditionally used in its projects in the rainfed
districts (Chart 1). SARH's Bank-financed rainfed district projects have
operated in a similar manner: the Tropical Agriculture Project (PRODERITH),
Loan 1553-ME; the Rainfed Agriculture Project (PLANAT), Loan 1945-ME; and the
San Fernando Rainfed Agriculture Project, Loan 2191-ME. All infrastructure
design, tendering, construction and supervision would be carried out under
SARH's Secretariat for Large-Scale Irrigation through the District Offices of
the Resident Engineers. Operation, maintenance and technical services for
agricultural production, under the responsibility of the Undersecretariat for
Agriculture and Operations, would be carried out by the chief of each of the
rainfed districts in which subprojects are located (Tapachula, Villaflores,
Tuxtla Gutierrez, San Cristobal and Comitan).
4.02      The SARH State Representative in Tuxtla Gutierrez would be respon-
sible for SAMI's coordination, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the
progress of execution of each rainfed district subproject. The basic advisory
units in each district would be a Managemert Committee and a Technical
Committee. Both would have representatives from among producers and the
Federal, State and local Governments to assure coordination and integration of
the annual operation program of each district. The SARH State Representative
would keep COPLADE informed of the project progress and problems so that
COPLADE could take these aspects into consideration in the coordination of
planning and programming of future operations.
4.03      The principal SARH agencies involved in promoting agricultural pro-
duction under the rainfed district system would be: the General Directorate
for Production and Agricultural Extension (DGPEA), the National Institute for
Agricultural Research (INIA), the General Directorate for Soil and Water
Conservation (DGSA), the National Institute for Livestock Research (INIP), the
National Fruit Commission (CONAFRUT) and the National Institute for Forestry
Research (INIF). The National Marketing Organization for Basic Foods
(CONASUPO) would support the project through the purchase and storage of basic
foods, principally maize and beans. The Government's banking system, princi-
pally the Agricultural Trust Fund (FIRA), the Trust Fund for Credit in Rainfed
Districts (FICART), the National Rural Credit Bank (BANRURAL) and the commer-
cial banks, would provide credit for on-farm investment and production. SARE
would also provide additional technicians to prepare, evaluate and supervise
subloans in support of the banking system.
B. Project Design and Execution
4.04      SARH had a 1984 allocation of Mex$ 1,850 million (US$12.3 million)
for infrastructure, rights-of-way, design, construction, supervision of
construction and operation in the project area. Several small contracts have
been let and construction is proceeding on two drainage canals on the Coast
and part of the main collector drain at Comitan in the Central Depression.
The initial designs and construction specifications would be based on the



- 19 -
PRODERITH pilot project experience and design and construction in the project
area already being implemented and financed from the 1984 and 1985 SARH
budgets 2/. Under the project SARH would prepare annual project execution
programS.  The first year's program and final infrastructure designs were
completed as a condition of Board presentation. SARH would then prepare and
submit annual programs by December ) of each year during the project to cover
the following calendar year; assurances to this effect were provided at
negotiations. The first year's program would focus on: (a) acquiring rights-
of-way; (b) designing and constructing dikes, drains and service roads;
Cc) designing service centers and workshops; and (d) hiring technical staff
for the initial planning, construction and operation phase.
C. Design Criteria for Drainage and River Control Infrastructure
4.05      The design criteria (Annex 2) for drainage and river control infra-
structure are based on actual topographic and hydrographic surveys, measure-
ments of river flows, precipitation, run-off, infiltration, as well as
existing and proposed Land use. The river control dike system design would be
built to support a 24-hour peak flow, 10-year frequency storm, while the
drainage system design capacities would be based on a 48-hour peak flow,
5-year frequency storm. The design criteria have also taken into considera-
tion the experience of areas already developed in Chiapas, and in particular
the 5,000 ha pilot project located at Acapetahua on the Coast financed under
Loan 1553-ME. International consultants engaged under Loan 1553-ME have
assisted SARR in the preliminary evaluation and design of the drainage and
river control system for the Coast. Design criteria have taken into consi-
deration the need to minimize construction costs, lowering of the water table
for crop production, and maintaining an adequate water table for off-season
pasture and crop production. The estlmated implementation schedule and basic
costs (at time of appraisal and updated to October 1984) are indicated in
Annex 1, Table 2; detailed infrastructure costs and phasing are indicated in
Tables 9 and 10.
D. Selection of the Project Area and Beneficiaries
4.06      The project area and beneficiaries are well-defined in the Central
Depression. However, in the Coastal area, of the total 255,000 ha to be pro-
tected from flooding by dike construction, 90,000 ha would be fully developed
with drains and on-farm works for intensive crop and livestock production
(Annex 1, Table 1).  Select.on of these full development areas has not yet
been completed; a proportion of them would be identified as part of each
year's annual development program under the project (para. 4.04). The basic
criteria for selection of areas for full development would be that: (a) the
lands (less than 50 ha) be occupied primarily by ejidos and private small-
holders; (b) the lands be technically and economically suitable for agricul-
tural production; and (c) the support services (credit, extension, etc.) would
be provided in an adequate and timely manner. During negotiations assurances
were provided that the above criteria would be used in selecting such areas.
2/   Infrastructure cost estimates are based on actual 1983 and early 1984
experience in the project area.



- 20 -
4.07      The Coastal project area is divided into several watersheds by the
17 major rivers that cross the plain.  In addition, mini-watersheds would be
formed between the rivers by the design and construction of the drainage
system, thus providing ample flexibility in selecting areas for full devel-
opment that are essentially occupied by ejidos and small-holder farmers. In
the Altos the 7,500 ha to be developed for fruit production would be selected
by SARH in coordination with CONAFRUT. This is a continuation of an ongoing
voluntary program strongly supported by the area farmers. In all areas SARM's
extension workers and promoters would work closely with the beneficiaries in
the selection of areas and preparation of the annual development program.
4.08      There are about 76 holdings, comprising IOZ of the area, that exceed
the legal limit established by the Agricultural Development Law of 1981 for
lands declared suitable for rainfed crop production. In accordance with the
criteria for selection of beneficiaries (paras. 4.06 and 4.07), these holdings
would as far as practical be avoided in selecting areas for full development.
Existing legislation (paras. 2.08 and 2.09) would provide for SARH and SRA to
coordinate action to acquire and redistribute land in excess of the 200 ha
limit in those cases where it is not practical to avoid infrastructure
development that would benefit large holdings.
E. Construction, Operation and Maintenance
Construction
4.09      Land acquisition for rights-of-way (about 2,750 ha) for the
construction of dikes, drains, roads, and service centers has already been
initiated and will continue to be handled by SAXM's Legal Department. Land
would be acquired by out-right purchase or easements, and SARH would
compensate farmers for crop losses. Compensation for land and crops is
included in project costs.  SARH's Department of Large-Scale Irrigation would
design infrastructure according to usual SARM practices and standards, handle
tendering, and supervise construction through its Offices of Resident
Engineers. Private contractors would carry out the construction; adequate
contracting experience and capacity are available in Chiapas and neighboring
states. The estimated infrastructure implementation schedule is indicated in
Annex 1, Table 2.
4.10      During the first year, the Government would begin implementation in
each of the areas. Six regional operational and administrative centers (field
offices) would be established and staffed to support project implementation.
Production operations would be the principal goal of the project and the
transition (production, promotion training and demonstration phase) would be
initiated in the first year of the project. Each of the rainfed districts
would be responsible for operations including extension and research activ-
ities as well as maintenance and operation of the infrastructure system.
4.11      Since there would be a parallel Chiapas Rural Roads Project (pro-
viding for construction of 1,000 km and improvement of 2,000 km of rural
communications roads throughout the State, as well as increasing access to the
project areas), it would be essential that SARH coordinate its project area



- 21 -
service roads program (providing access within the project area) with the
Secretariat of Communication and Transport (SCT) rural roads program (criteria
for review of the roads program is indicated in the Project File). In the
interest of economy and efficiency it is important that similar load factor
and complementary roads constructed by SARE and SCT be designed, constructed
and maintained to the same standards. In order to promote this objective in
Chiapas, COPLADE, in its capacity as the State development planning and
coordinating agency, would encourage and promote integrated planning and
uniform design standards for construction or rehabilitation of rural roads and
service roads whenever practical. During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that it would carry out a review of rural roads
construction and maintenance practices in the State with a view to
rationalizing design, construction and maintenance practices, of SARH and
SCT, by December 31, 1987.
Operation and Maintenance
4.12      In its annual project implementation plans SARH would provide for
financing and execution of a regular periodic operations and maintenance (O&M)
program for drains, dikes and roads in the project area. These operations
would be the responsibility of each rainfed district carried out through their
existing offices and field offices and workshops to be established under the
project. Initial emphasis would be given to rehabilitation maintenance of
existing infrastructure, and a plan would be formulated to take over O&M of
new works as they are completed. A budget would be allocated for each
district adequate to cover the O&M of tne equipment (para. 3.11) and infra-
structure provided under the project. Beneficiaries would be encouraged to
contribute labor for O&M in order to minimize the cost and the level of
charges to be collected. As this project is part of an integrated development
program for Chiapas it is important to analyze the relationship of the projeci-
O&XM in the context of the SARH O&M program for the State. To determine the
magnitude and status of its rural roads operations, SARH would conduct a
statewide review and inventory with the objective of rationalizing its road
system with SCT and improving the standards of maintenance to maximize the
life of the infrastructure investment. During negotiations, the Borrower
provided assurances that the Government would allocate an adequate annual
budget for O&M of infrastructure and rationalize the SARK and SCT rural roads
construction, operation and maintenance program, and allocate maintenance
responsibility between the agencies (para. 4.11).
F. Extension
4.13      Responsibility for coordinating the technical assistance effort in
the rainfed districts would rest with their respective Operations Depart-
ments. The five districts would be divided into about 12 units, which in turn
would be subdivided into about 64 zones in the immediate area of admin-
istrative structure (Chart 1). In every unit, aside from the regular exten-
sion staff, there would be selected specialists in production, organization,
pest control, soils, social work, etc.



- 22 -
4.14      Under the project, execution of the extension component would remain
the responsibility of the rainfed districts, but would be modeled along the
lines of the well-tested PRODERITH approach which is linked to agricultural
research through the Division of Applied Research in INIA and the equivalent
unit in INIP. A description of the extension system is summarized in
Annex 3.
G. Research
4.15      Assistance for research under the project would be designed to
strengthen programs through the existing national institutions and INIA, INIP
and INIF, which would continue to emphasize production-oriented commodity
research. Satisfactory research programs have been formulated, and results
are being achieved under the PRODERITE project. The institutions would
strengthen multi-disciplinary research for each commodity program to tackle
the broad spectrum of research needed. The programs would be subject to
review by INIA's regional project committees and by its Division of Applied
Research. This division would mairtain close contact with exteasion organi-
zations to ensure that research is closely related to the production problems
of the region. INIP has already adopted this production-oriented approach.
It has established multi-disciplinary teams and a unit equivalent to the INIA
Division of Applied Research, which is responsible for reviewing the programs
and maintaining close contact with the extension services. The heads of the
respective units would control the research programs financed under the
project, while responsibility for overall direction and coordination would
rest with the Subdirectors and the Directors General of INIA and INIP.
4.16      Both INIP and INIA have active pasture research programs. Conse-
quently, a high degree of coordination between the INIA forage program and the
INIP program for production systems based on pasture would be required to
avoid duplication and to ensure a free interchange of information. To this
end, the Directors General of INIA and INIP have already established a small
working group to ensure effective coordination of efforts and meet an a
regular basis.
H. Credit
4.17      The Government would provide medium- and long-term investment credit
to farmers from existing resources on a priority basis through Government
banking institutions, such as FIRA, FICART, BANRURAL, and commercial banks
(para. 4.03) under terms and conditions now being applied under Credit VIII
(Loan 2454-ME). SARK, through its extension, promotion and farmer organi-
zation services, would assist the lending institutions with the implementation
of credit for on-farm development. Short-term credit would also be needed for
seeds, fertilizers, chemicals and mechanization. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that it would make adequate investment and
production credit available from existing resources.
I. Special Studies
4.18      As the project is a first phase of a longer-term agricultural
development program for Chiapas, it is essential to carry out pre-investment,



- 23 -
soil, socioeconomic, environmental, and marketing studies to provide data for
this project and future development (para. 3.20). SARH's Secretary of
Planning and Studies would be responsible for the studies, which would be
carried out by the Directorate General for Studies and the Directorate
General for Planning. Pre-investment (including basic and feasibility) and
soil studies would be undertaken in the normal course of SARH operations in
Chiapas. SARH is already preparing terms of reference and making satisfactory
arrangements to conduct the survey of lagoons and the permanent wetlands of
the Coast. Socioeconomic and environmental studies would be carried out on a
continuing basis in collaboration with the Secretariat of Urban Development
and Ecology (SEDUE) and COPLADE; action would be taken to correct problems
identified during the course of these studies. Current marketing operations
although adequate, appear inefficient and costly. Development under the
project and the Chiapas Plan would result in a substantial increase in
production that would amplify any marketing constraints. In particular,
Chiapas produces a surplus of basic crops, as weli as coffee, bananas, cocoa
and fruits that must be marketed in other parts of Mexico. This creates a
complex marketing channel, which requires a careful review when contemplating
a substantial increase in production. Studies would be undertaken with the
assistance of consultants, as required. Detailed costs are indicated in
Annex 1, Table 7. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that it would, through SARH, undertake environmental and socioeconomic impact
reviews on a periodic basis, and carry out a marketing study by July 31,
1988.
J. Technical Services
4.19      In view of the limited development experience in Chiapas, the high
potential for agricultural production, and the delicate environmental and
sociological conditions in the State, there is an urgent need to accelerate
the formulation of knowledge and data as the basis for future development. To
achieve this objective the project would provide 180 man-months of local and
international consultants (para. 3.19). The major focus of the technical
services component would be to support programs that would address the fragile
environmental and sociological conditions in Chiapas. About 108 man-months of
technical services would provide continuing support of the soil conservation
programs which are vital to sustain agricultural development and production in
the humid tropics, as well as rural communities programs initiated under the
Bank-financed PRODERITH project (Loan 1553-NE). About 72 man-months of tech-
nical services would support pre-investment, environmental, and socioeconomic
studies, and monitoring and evaluation required for this project, as well as
provide scientific and technical information for future development throughout
the State.
K. Accounting and Auditing
4.20      Prior to submission to the Bank, all documentation, including
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) for which reimbursement would be claimed
from the Bank loan, would be subject to the independent review and approval by
SPP in accordance with its established control procedures. SARE would
maintain separate accounts adequate to reflect the resources, expenditures and
the financial situation of the project. An audit satisfactory to the Bank
would be made of the accounts, and SOEs and submitted to the Bank for each



- 24 -
year. The audit would be in accordance with sound auditing procedures
consistently applied by qualified auditors. Certified copies of the state-
ments audited, together with the report of the auditors, which would also
cover SOEs, would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the
close of each fiscal year. The Borrower shall furnish to the Bank such other
pertinent information concerning such accounts as the Bank shall reasonably
request from time to time. During negotiations the Government provided
assurances that SARH would adhere to accounting and auditing procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
L. Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.21      SARR, in coordination with COPLADE, would maintain a multi-
disciplinary group to monitor and analyze project execution, beneficiary
acceptance and response to the development investment, changes in the produc-
tion system (cropping patterns, intensity and yields), and environmental and
sociological changes. The monitoring and evaluation team would be responsible
to the project executing agency. The first priority in the early stages of
project execution would be to support management. Thus, the monitoring and
evaluation group would monitor project execution progress and problems and
keep SARH management and COPLADE adequately informed. Their findings would be
taken into consideration in the preparation of each year's program and budget
for the project. The group would also assist project management in identi-
fying implementation problems and constraints so that these findings could be
acted upon in a timely manner.
4.22      The monitoring and evaluation group would select small areas within
each subproject as models to: (a) monitor and analyze beneficiary participa-
tion; (b) determine beneficiary acceptance of the development program and
objectives; and (c) measure progress in the transition from traditional live-
stock and subsistence crop agriculture to intensive commercial livestock and
crop production. The availability of adequate technology and the dissemi-
nation and application of appropriate technology would also be analyzed. The
procedures for promotion, farmer organization, technical assistance, and
identification of systems that work and do not work would be analyzed and
brought to the attention of the various agricultural production supporting
services. Trends and achievements in cropping patterns, yields and benefits
would also be measured and analyzed.
4.23      The environmental and socioeconomic analyses would be essential to
monitoring and evaluation activities. Initial environmental analysis would
consist of measurable elements, such as soil erosion, and sedimentation
carried off and deposited in the water courses during the construction
period. In the latter production phase, analysis would focus on the water
quality, including possible chemical contamination of water courses, lagoons
and wetlands, and proper use of agricultural chemicals (including ferti-
lizers). Social monitoring and analysis would focus on changes in land
tenancy, organization of beneficiaries, employment, and household income.
4.24      The group would maintain a regular exchange of information and
findings with SARH and COPLADE and prepare and submit a detailed semi-annual



- 25 -
report.  The costs of monitoring and evaluation are shown in Annex 1,
Table 12. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it
would continue monitoring and evaluation of project operations and the
agricultural, socioeconomic and environmental impact of the project.
Reporting
4.25      SARH would submit an annual progres5 report to the Bank no later
than 60 days after the end of each calendar year. These reports would
present physical implementation achievements, as well as expenditures and
disbursemeats by component. SARH would also explain any deviations from the
implementation program. A project completion report would be submitted to
the Bank within six months after the Closing Date. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that it would satisfy reporting requirements.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND MARKETING
A. Changes in the Production System
5.01      The project would have a major impact on incremental production by:
(a) bringing new land into production and converting land now used for
extensive livestock production to intensive crop and livestock production;
(b) intensifying crop production on existing lands; (c) changing cropping
patterns from essentially subsistence crops (maize and beans) to a wide range
of commercial crops (para. 2.05); and (d) strengthening research, extension,
farmer training, farmer organizations, and credit. Illustrative investment
models, as shown in Annex 4, have been developed, demonstrating the trans-
formation of agriculture at the farm level. changes in the cropping pattern
and intensity through the application of improved technology, yield increase
and income benefits. It is expected that producers would adopt new and
improved technology and increase the area under crop production and yields.
Adequate improved production technology is already known and available in the
area from the experience of the PRODERTIH pilot project on the Coast, as well
as from the more advanced commercial farms established on land not subject to
flooding both in the Central Depression and on the Coast. An immediate impact
would be achieved by the increased use of inputs (particularly fertilizer and
improved seeds), once the risk of flooding is reduced. The smaller farmers
(particularly ejidatarios with an average of less than 10 ha on the Coast and
7 ha in the Central Depression) would have a greater incentive to change from
livestock to crop production in order to utilize family labor and increase
family income. Larger farmers would tend to continue to focus on livestock
and mixed farming. The project has been designed to provide intensive tech-
nical assistance necessary to promote new technology and farming systems.
Farmers would be organized to facilitate production and marketing, and dissem-
ination of crop and livestock production technology (paras. 3.14 and 3.15).
5.02      Under the project, the area utilized for annual crop production
would increase (Annex 1, Table 13) from about 118,000 ha to 170,000 ha (about
45Z), while cropping intensity would increase about 10% at full development.
Simultaneously, the area used for livestock production would be reduced from



- 26 -
about 175,000 ha to 133,000 ha (25%). However, with increased livestock
intensity through the improvement of pasture, animals and management, it is
expected that the number of animals and the level of milk and meat production
would increase over time.
5.03      ln addition to the 90,000 ha on the Coast that would benefit from
full development (construction of dikes, roads, drains, on-farm works, and
improved production supporting services), 165,000 ha would benefit from the
construction of flood control dikes and associated roads. It is estimated
that the current value of production in the Coastal area (US$120 million)
would increase by about 10% simply from the provision of flood control, roads
and technical services. In the Central Depression, there would also be a
significant increase in crop production (from 33,000 to 45,000 ha) while
cropping intensity and yields would also increase. The most dramatic change
in the cropping pattern and production value would occur on the 7,500 ha in
the Altos (presently about 50% used for subsistence production of maize and
beans) which would be converted to commercial fruit orchards. Nurseries in
the project area have a capacity to supply more than 50Z of the planting
materials and additional materials would be supplied from SARH and CONAFRUT
nurseries in other states.
B. Yields and Production
5.04      In addition to the large increase in the area cropped and changes
in the cropping pattern and intensity (Annex 1, Table 13), there would be
even more significant increases in yields as the result of flood control,
drainage and improved production technology (particularly the use of higher
levels of inputs). At present, there are wide variations each year in the
area planted and harvested due to frequent heavy rains and flooding, and
yields are low because farmers reduce their risks by using a minimum of
fertilizer and improved seeds. It is expected that the infrastructure would
control excess water and eliminate losses, except during extremely wet
seasons that should not occur more than once in five years. It is estimated
that yields of the principal crops (maize and beans) would double in the
first six years of development. With average soil conditions on the Coast,
yields of maize would increase from 1.5 to 3.0 t/ha and in the Central
Depression from 2.0 to 4.0 t/ha, while bean yields in both regions would
increase from about 0.6 to 1.2 t/ha. Livestock carrying capacity is
estimated to increase from 1 AU (animal unit) to 1.4 AU/ha; thus maintaining
or possibly increasing the total animal population. Under existing conditions
of periodic flooding and poor communications in the project area, it can be
assumed that the existing situation would continue without the Droject and
that there would be little or no change in the net value of production without
the investments under the project.
C. Illustrative Farm Investment and Production
5.05      A series of illustrative farm development plans have been
calculated which indicate that incomes of project beneficiaries would provide
substantial incentive to farmers to participate in the on-farm development
works and technical assistance program. Results are based on farm models
(Annex 4), which are considered representative in terms of actual investment
mixes, cropping patterns, regions of the State, subproject areas, and size of
holdings.

D. Marketing
5.06      The principal products of Chiapas are maize, cotton, coffee,
bananas and other fruits, beans, soybeans and cocoa. Demand for these
products is adequate, and Chiapas exportts a large part of these commodities to
other parts of Mexico. CONASUPO is the principal organization for marketing
of basic cereal crops (maize, beans, sorghum and soybeans) at prices
predetermined by the Government. Other products are handled directly by
private sector intermediaries including fruits from the Altos, which are
distributed throughout the Southeast Region of Mexico. At the national level
the demand for apples, pears and peaches far exceeds the supply. The wide
range of agricultural commodities, dispersion of production, inadequate
communications, complex intermediary systems, and lack of a local agroindustry
for processing of meat, vegetables, fruits and dairy products, limit the
development of a rational efficient marketing system.
5.07      Although inefficient, the present marketing system is adequate for
current levels of production. However, studies would be undertaken to
determine measures needed to strengthen and modernize storage the system in
order to handle increased production (paras. 3.20 and 4.18). In areas of the
project alone, maize production would increase more than 100Z from 120,000 to
250,000 tons, while rice production would increase from about 12,000 to 90,000
tons; substantial increases in other crops would also occur. Although the
intensity of livestock production would increase, the area devoted to
livestock would decrease, thus the number of animals and the quantity of meat
and milk production are not expected to change significantly. Fruit and
vegetable production would increase substantially; some credit is available
for strengthening the marketing sector for perishable products (fruits,
vegetables, meat and eggs) on a national basis under the Bank-financed
Marketing Project for Perishables (Loan 2262-ME).

VI.   BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
6.01      The proposed project is a cornerstone of the Government's regional
development strategy to improve social and economic conditions in depressed
areas in the country. As a first phase program, the project would have a
substantial impact by addressing poverty problems and expanding agricultural
production. Further, the investment cost of about US$400/ha makes the project
a suitable prototype for expanded development of the entire State. At full
development, incremental production of the principal products-mainly maize,
rice, soybeans, and fruits--would amount to a yearly foreign exchange savings
of about US$45 million in 1983 prices. The project would directly benefit
about 32,000 farm families, increasing employment opportunities in the
proposed project area. Eventually, the project would provide full employment
for about 15,000 additional persons (or about 405,000 yearly man-days),
stemming migration from the project area to Mexico's already over-populated
cities. The amount of employment generation would also contribute to improved
income distribution in the project area. Average farm earnings of direct
project beneficiaries would increase from about US$1,900 to US$4,800 per
family at full development.
6.02      The flood control and drainage infrastructure and access roads would
benefit most of the urban population by reducing property damage and improving
communications in the area of influence of the project. The project would
strengthen the institutional capacity in five rainfed districts and the
delivery system for extension, research, credit, soil conservation and
environmental protection. The project would also provide the knowledge and
experience required to develop similar areas in Chiapas.
B. Economic Rate of Return
6.03      The economic rate of return has been estimated at about 19%
(Annex 1, Table 14) and is based on quantifiable benefits from crop and live-
stock production over the next 20 years. Other secondary benefits, such as
incremental production from flood control, part-time employment, and the urban
population's benefit from flood control, were not included in the
calculation. In calculating the economic rate of return, the transition from
the traditional to the new intensive system was determined in accordance with
land use projections represented by the farm models. The construction and
phasing of basic infrastructure was projected according to the investment
schedule for the project. Prices for traded commodities were calculated
according to Bank projections for 1984 in constant prices and adjusted for
handling, processing, and transportation costs to reach the average farm-gate
prices; for other products, prevailing farm-gate unit prices were used. Labor
costs have been calculated taking into account the high unemployment and
under-employment in Chiapas; thus, family labor was considered to be 80% of
the unskilled labor market wage. Similarly, unskilled labor was estimated at
70% of its market price. Subsidies were eliminated and other production costs
were priced at local market conditions on the grounds that they best reflect
opportunity costs.



- 29 -
6.04      The calculation of the economic rate of return includes costs of
civil works, buildings and related infrastructure required for project imple-
mentation. It also includes costs of extension; training; research; admin-
istration; the necessary machinery and equipment for the development and main-
tenance of dikes, roads and drainage systems; and physical contingencies.
Cost of studies were deleted from the economic analysis because they relate
principally to future development.
C. Sensitivity Analysis
6.05      A sensitivity analysis to test the impact of changes in costs,
benefits and prices of other factors was also made (Annex 1, Table 15).
Switching value tests indicate that the rate of return is not particularly
sensitive to changes in any particular component. Project benefits could be
reduced by 36% and the economic rate of return would still remain at above 12%
(the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Mexico). Prices would have to
decrease by about 19% and yields by about 20% to lower the economic rate of
return to about 12%. A switching value test on the assumption of delays in
reaching full agricultural development was performed. It indicated that a
delay in benefits of about three to four years would be required to cause the
economic rate of return to drop to 12%.
D. Cost Recovery
6.06      Most on-farm development costs would be recovered through the credit
program. The 1972 Water Law provides the basis for O&M and investment cost
recovery for irrigation and drainage works in irrigation and drainage
districts. The 1981 Agricultural Development Law provides for reclassi-
fication of land from livestock production to crop production use and the
redistribution of holdings in excess of 200 ha. Under the existing legisla-
tion with appropriate administrative arrangements, socioeconomic studies would
be undertaken to determine the beneficiaries ability to pay. Similar
arrangements would be required to achieve any form of cost recovery under the
Chiapas project.  During negotiations assurances were provided that the
Government would take appropriate action to provide for recovery of operation
and maintenance costs, and investment cost to the extent possible, upon
completion of infrastructure in each of the subproject areas.
E. Project Risks
6.07      The main project risks are the possible: (a) inadequate and untimely
allocation of counterpart funds; (b) beneficiaries' failure to adopt yield
increasing technology (agronomic practices, improved seeds, and increased
levels of inputs); and (c) their reluctance to make the transition from
livestock to crop production.
6.08      The project's design should help reduce each of the above risks to
acceptable levels. Given the relatively small size of the proposed project
with respect to the whole Chiapas Development Program, in case prolonged
economic austerity were to put a ceiling on counterpart funds, the Government



- 30 -
would have the flexibility to reassign limited budgetary resources and
continue implementing the project's high priority investments proposed within
a reasonable period. In order to minimize the other two risks that benefi-
ciaries could fail to adopt yield increasing technologies or be reluctant to
switch to intensive crop production, the project implementing agencies would
draw on the lessons of experience obtained under a Bank-financed pilot
tropical agriculture project and strengthen the extension, research and
promotional services in the project area. In addition, the major target group
under the project--consisting of ejidos and small farmers-is most likely to
respond positively to incentives under the project, especially after drainage
and river control infrastructure, land transport, marketing and storage
facilities are improved.
F. Environmental Impact
6.09      SARH and the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology have
already initiated environmental impact studies in accordance with current
legislation and are cooperating fully on all environmental aspects of the
project. Civil works, in particular the drainage system, would be designed to
protect the environment by: (a) utilizing sediment traps to minimize soil
particles from being carried into the permanent wetlands and lagoons;
(b) controlling the use and run-off of agricultural fertilizer and chemicals;
and (c) maintaining a depth and flow of water in the drains to reduce the
possibility of establishing breeding areas for mosquitos and the water-spawned
insects. SARH, in collaboration with SEDUE and COPLADE, would design and
establish environmental monitoring and control systems (including water
analysis check points) for drainage networks under the project to measure
possible detrimental effects of chemicals and fertilizers discharged through
the drainage systems from intensified crop and livestock production. Research
would be conducted to determine fertilizer and chemical application rates and
methods compatible with obtaining optimum yields and protecting the environ-
ment from chemical contamination. The extension services would advise farmers
on the safe and proper application and use of fertilizers, chemicals and
cultural practices required to protect the user and the environment. Cultural
practices would include soil conservation measures, such as terracing, contour
cultivation, and incorporation of crop residue into the soil. These practices
would conserve soil and moisture, reduce run-off of water and soil particles
that would otherwise carry fertilizers and chemicals to areas where they could
cause detrimental effects.
G. Sociological Impact
6.10      The project is designed to focus on ejidos and small-holders, those
farmers who (in accordance with sociological analyses) are most likely to take
advantage of drainage and flood control to intensify crop production and
convert grazing land to crop production. Thus, the project would have a
positive impact on the socioeconomic balance within its areas of influence.
It would reduce the concentration of production from the hands of a few large
livestock holdings and privately developed (more prosperous farmers) lands for
crop production. In addition, the project would create temporary employment
during the construction phase, generating about 15,000 full-time jobs in the
areas of intensified crop and livestock production, as well as substantial
part-time employment for weed control and harvesting. The increased



- 31 -
employment opportunities in the project area would reduce the need for the
unemployed and underemployed to migrate to other areas seeking opportunities
for jobs. The social benefits of additional services and commerce generated
by project production would also have a long-term impact.
VII.  SUMHARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government
would:
(a) follow procurement arrangements summarized in paras. 3.23-3.25;
(b) establish a Special Account and submit monthly statements to the
Bank (para. 3.26);
(c) submit by December 1 each year the execution program for the
infrastructure works to be carried out during the next calendar
year (para. 4.04);
(d) follow the criteria outlined in para. 4.06 in selecting areas
for full development;
(e) carry out a review by December 31, 1987, of rural roads
construction and maintenance practices in the State wit; a view
to rationalizing design, construction and maintenance practices
of SARH and SCT (para. 4.11);
(f) allocate an adequate annual budget for OE& of project
infrastructure (para. 4.12);
(g) make adequate investment and production credit available from
existing resources (para. 4.17);
(h) carry out a marketing study in the project area by July 31,
1988, and make periodic socioeconomic and environmental impact-
reviews in areas of influence of the project (para. 4.18);
(i) submit documents, periodic reports, financial statements, audit
reports and a completion report as required (paras. 4.20 and
4.25);
(j) carry out monitoring and evaluation of the project on a regular
basis (para. 4.24); and
(k) recover infrastructure operation and maintenance costs and
investment costs to the extent possible (para. 6.06).
7.02      With the above assurances the proposed project would be suitable for
a Bank loan of US$90 million on standard terms for Mexico.

CHIAPAS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Infrastructure and On-Farm Development - Concepts and Design
Infrastructure Concepts and Design Criteria
1.        Previous Experience. Designs in the project area are essentially
based on previous experience in the Coast, Central Depression, and Altos areas
which have similar infrastructure development. In addition, valuable
knowledge and experience in design, construction and production have been
obtained under the Tropical Agriculture Project, Loan 1553-ME, under which a
5,000 ha scheme located at Acapetahua (in the proposed subproject area for the
Coast) has now been completed. Foreign consultants were also engaged under
Loan 1553-ME to advise and assist SARH with the formulation of development
plans, including the design of infrastructure for the proposed project area.
2.        Design Criteria.  Design details and criteria are available in a
document Propuesta de Infraestructura pare el Proyecto' which is available in
the Project File. These documents analyze and discuss: (a) the cause and
effect of the lack of adequate drainage and river control; (b) alternative
solutions; (c) design criteria; (d) schematic designs; and (e) preliminary
layout designs.
3.        Rainfall and Intensity.  The cause of flooding in all of the
subproject areas is the relatively high rainfall (1,500 to 3,000 mm) over a
period of about six months. Furthermore, the project areas (particularly the
Coast and Central Depression) are relatively flat plains located adjacent to
mountains (where rainfall is even higher) resulting in frequent high intensity
runoff into the adjacent potential agricultural areas. The 24-hour rainfall
registered often exceed 150 m; with an intensity of abcut 400 mm occurring
once in 25 years. Monthly rainfall normally ranges between 300 and 700 mm.
Flows of 3,000 m3/sec have been recorded in the principal river, Suchichiata
and 1,000 m3/sec in the rivers Coatan and Pijijiapan. Forty-three rivers,
originating in the adjacent Sierra Madre cross the Coastal plain of Chiapas;
17 rivers of significant importance to justify river control infrastructure,
flow through the area to be developed under the project.
4.        Dike and Drain Capacity.  The river control dikes are considered as
the principal flood control infrastructure to reduce or eliminate flood water
carried off from the adjacent higher elevation areas. Dikes would be designed
to carry a 24-hour duration 10-year frequency storm, whereas drains would be
designed to carry a 48-hour duration 5-year frequency storm. These design
criteria were based on evaluation of alternatives taking into consideration
the risk of crop and property loss and economic factors. Criteria used are
hydrological and hydrographic calculations using known factors of river flow,
rainfall, infiltration, topography, ground cover, and probability. The fact
that flooding does not normally pose a risk to loss of human or animal life
was also taken into consideration.

On-Farm,Development
5.        On-Farm Field Drains. High water table and accumulation of surface
water would require field drains on a large part- of the area of the Coastal
and Central Depression subproject areas.   Standard designs similar to
USDA/Soil Conservation Service criteria are already being used in the coastal
and Comitan areas and would be used under the Chiapas Agricultural Development
Project. Most cross-sectional areas would be trapezoidal with depths of less
than 1 a and bottom widths less-than 0.5 a. Some field drains would have a
V--type configuration with side slopes variable according to the soils, flow
capacity and farm and crop requirements. Grass waterways would also be used
where appropriate. Filter strips of grass would be required for a significant
number of these field drains to minimize sediment deposits in drains and to
help control the transport of agricultural chemicals that could have an
adverse environmental impact. The grass strips would be required where water
from cropped areas would flow directly intci field ditches. Cultural
practices, including incorporation of crop residue in the soil, row alignment,
etc., would be used to optimize drainage and soil conservation.
6.        Terraces.  About 10,000 ha of crop land, with 5% or more slope,
would be protected with terraces in the Altos, San Miguel II, Comitan, and
Suchiapa subproject areas. The Altos terraces (7,500 ha) would be individual
tree circular-type and bench-type terraces (constructed using labor-intensive
means) for establisbment of apple, orange and peach orchards. All the sloping
land between terraces would be planted with grass to minimize erosion.
Terraces in row crop areas would be narrow based with grass "backslopes for
better stability and erosion control. Grass waterways would normally be
needed to dispose of excess water safely down the slopes. Design of terraces
and waterways would be based on local experience, soils, rainfall, land slope,
slope length, and the type of crop cover. Because of the high rainfall in
some months and frequency of high intensity rainfall, long-graded terraces
would be avoided. The length of terraces would be designed to avoid erosive
velocities.
7.        Soll Conservation Practices. Where applicable various soil
conservation practices would be used throughout the subproject areas. Such
practices would include: (a) contour cultivation; (b) grassed or rock-lined
waterways; (c) gully control structures; and (d) minimum tillage systems.
Contour farming systems are planned on slopes between 3% and 6Z where soils
and cropping systems create potential erosion problems. Normally, gra,sed or
rock-lined waterways would also be needed in the areas where water flows
concentrate to protect against the development of new gullies. Minor gully
erosion would also be controlled by shaping the water course and using grass
or rock to line the newly shaped waterway. Major gullies are to be controlled
by installing smaJl earth dams that back water over the gully head cut to
protect against further migration up the water course. Some of the more
difficult gullies would be protected by building rock dams. Conservation

tillage systems are being introduced primarily in areas where tractorized farm
equipment is being used. The basic practice would involve incorporating crop
residues into the soil to improve water infiltration, levels of organic matter
and soil structure.  Minimum tillage would also be promoted where suitable
tractor and animal draft equipment is available.

CHIAPAS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Extension Services and Farmer Organizations
Introduction
1.        Strengthening of extension services and farmer organizations is
considered to be important under the project to achieve the goals of
transition from extensive livestock to intensive crop and livestock pro-
duction. Extension workers and promoters would be required to establish and
maiutain regular contact with farmers in the project area to obtain farmers
views and opinions regarding the formulation and execution of development
programs, as well as to provide technical advice. The organization of farmers
into formal groups would facilitate a regular dialogue for the benefit of the
producers and Government agencies. Formalized farmer organizations would also
facilitate access to credit, marketing and production facilities.
Extension Services
2.        At present, some technical assistance is being carried out in the
project area by the existing extension service and at Acapetahua on the Coast
under the intensive PRODERITH pilot program. Under the project, execution of
the extension component would remain the responsibility of the of the rainfed
districts. However, it would be modeled along the lines of the well-tested
intensive PRODERITH approach which is linked to agricultural research through
the Division of Applied Research in INIA and the equivalent unit in INIP. A
training center, training courses, and programs, have been established and
proven under the PRODERITH project and would be utilized to improve staff
proficiency and capability.
3.        Field activities would be carried out by the five rainfed district
resident offices, using a concept of three operational teams, namely: Research
(Field Trials), Extension Techniques (Divulgation) and Evaluation. Based on
existing technological information and results to be generated under the
project-supported research programs, technological packages would be
field-tested and demonstrated at the farm level. The divulgation teams would
then promote the use of Improved seeds, fertilizer, and agronomic practices
through farmer organizations (either existing or set up with project technical
assistance), taking into account existing socio-economic conditions of the
area. Im addition, they would assist farmers in organization and procurement
of credit, inputs, and production and marketing. Finally, the evaluation
teams would analyze production results and advise project management, research
institutions and others of problems as well as benefits so that these lessons
can be taken into consideration in planning subsequent research, extension and
production programs.

ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2
4.        The divulgation teams would include technical personnel with
experience in various disciplines (crop and livestock production, plant
protection, farmer organization, maintenance of works, credit and social
work). The teams would initially set up the extension effort in a given area,
ejido or farmer group, and would provide intensive assistance to farmers and
new extension workers for a period of about two to three months. At the end
of this time, the team would move on to a new area or farmer group leaving
behind the individual technicians/extensionists who would then be responsible
for carrying out routine extension duties. This approach has been
successfully implemented in several pilot areas of the humid tropics of
Mexico, including Coastal Chiapas, under Loan 1553-ME.
5.        The technical packages developed in conjunction with INIA and INIP
would include cultural practices such as improved seeds, land preparation,
timeliness of planting, appropriate use of fertilizers, insect and disease
control measures, and soil conservation and drainage techniques. An integral
part of the process would be the identification of progressive farmers in each
unit with whom the extension teams would carry out a "field demonstration'
program. Under this system, a farmer would prepare his land according to
prescribed practices and would pay for all cash inputs. The extension agent
would supervise the program and assist the farmer to obtain credit. The
extension agent would also arrange for other farmers to attend demonstrations
at various times throughout the growing season. These demonstrations would
also enable research results from INIA and INIP to be quickly transferred to
the farm level, as well as provide feedback to researchers, which is vital to
any effective research effort. When new programs, practices and concepts are
being considered, selected farmers would be brought to SARH training centers
or to CRECIDATH for lectures, demonstrations and seminars. These farmers,
along with the progressive farmers mentioned above, would be the major means
of disseminating technical information and promoting its adoption. Of parti-
cular concern to the technical assistance program would be soil conservation
and drainage maintenance practices. SARH staff, in addition to planning and
designing field ditches for surface drainage, would advise farmers on con-
serving surface water by controlling the outflow from drainage systems in
order to maintain optimum soil moisture.
Farmer Organizations 1/
6.        The PRODERITH pilot project at Acapetahua on the Coast (financed by
the Bank under Loan 1553-ME) has established a new model farmer organization
to integrate various Government services with centralized special services
(such as veterinary). Local production services, and promoters are available
to facilitate continuing direct contact with the farmers to assist them in
dealing with the variety of Government services. Under the pilot project
farmers are also encouraged to form specialized groups for cocoa, bananas,
etc., within mixed farming ejidos. The integrated PRODERITH model for farmer
organizations would be applied under the project.
1/   SARH and SRA have recently announced (March 1984) an intensified
coordinated initiative devoted to education and assistance to
small-holders.

CHIAPAS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Illustrative Farm Models
1.        The project area is noted for its tropical and sub-tropical climatic
conditions, relatively high rainfall of 1,500 to 3,000 mm distributed over a
six-to seven-month period, soils with above-average potential; however
agricultural production and productivity is severely limited by frequent
flooding and saturation of the soil. The flooding and wet soil conditions
create a high risk for production of most annual crops. Thus, farmers have
traditionally left some land idle, while using most of the land for extensive
grazing of cattle, and selected areas with better drainage, for production of
subsistence crops. To reduce the risk farmers use a minimum input/minimum
output system of cultivation. Those farmers in the area who are fortunate to
have higher elevation land or have put in ad hoc drainage and dike systems
have achieved yields of maize, soybeans, rice, beans and other crops
substantially above the national average and in the range of those proposed
for full development under the project. About 60,000 ha area near the border
with Guatemala was drained years ago under previous Government development
program, and is one of the most productive and technologically advanced
agricultural areas in Mexico, although that drainage system now also requires
rehabilitation.
2.        The rural and the urban population in the area are also restricted
by the scarcity of rural roads and the almost non-existence of all-weather
roads. Fortunately the type of flooding that occurs is not a threat to human
or animal life, but does cause significant crop and property damage losses to
both the rural and urban populations. In particular, the Coast has proven
potential for high yields of a wide range of annail and tree crops such as:
maize, rice, cotton, soybeans, beans, tobacco, vegetables, fruits, coffee,
cocoa, oil palm, bananas and other minor crops. The Central Depression, with
a semi-tropical climate also has a proven high agricultural potential but for
a narrower range of crops with particular emphasis on maize, soybeans, beans
and vegetables. Whereas the Altos with extremely limited and fragile culti-
vable soils, and fragmented small-holdings, has traditionally been used for
subsistence production of maize and beans. More recently, in an effort to
increase the income of the rural families in the Altos, high value cash crops
have been successfully introduced which include fruits (apples, pears, peaches
and oranges) flowers and vegetables. The more temperate climate of the Altos
is well suited for these crops.
3.        The project would focus on ejidos and small-holdings of less than 50
ha to: (a) distribute the benefits to the maximum number of rural families;
and (b) maximize the transition from livestock to crop production.
Small-holders bave more incentive to crop their land once flood control and
drainage infrastructure is in place because they can obtain a larger income
than from livestock and they already have a surplus of family labor. Larger
holdings will tend to improve livestock production and mixed farming.

4.        The following seven illustrative farm models indicate how production
and productivity are expected to improve at the farm level as a result of
project investments in infrastructure and production supporting services.
Targets are based on results already achieved in dry years and on some
commercial farms in the area that already have flood control or are on lands
not seriously affected by flooding. For the purposes of illustration and
given the relative size of the three regions involved, the seven models have
been developed as follows:
Area              Model Type No.               Description
A.  Coast                 Ejido Models (2)            8 ha Crop Farm
130 ha Crop/Livestock Farm
Private Models (2)         20 ha Crop Farm
45 ha Livestock Farm
B. Central Depression   Ejido Model (1)               7 ha Crop Farm

C. Los Altos              Ejido Model (1)              1 ha  Fruit Unit
Model No. 1: Coastal Ejido Crop Farm (8 ha)
5.        Model No. 1 represents a typical cropping operation with one
ejidatario farming about 8 ha of land: 3 ha of annual crops (maize, rice,
beans, sesame, watermelon and tobacco), 1 ha cocoa, 2 ha of pasture and
2 ha unproductive. Under the project, the entire 8 ha would be drained, 2 ha
would be cleared and smoothed and the crop mix would be simplified by
eliminating unproductive land. The total investment cost in field drainage and
associated works is estimated at about Mex$ 120,000. The proposed development
plan is expected to raise the cropping intensity from 100l to 137Z by full
development in year 4. Crop yields are estimated to rise as follows: maize,
beans, sesame and tobacco from 1.5 t to 3.0 t/ha, 0.6 t to 1.2 t/ha, 0.6 to
1.2 t/ha, and 1.0 to 1.8 t/ha, respectively. The labor requirement is
expected to rise from about Mex$ 100,000 to about Mex$ 239,000 by full
development.
Model No. 2: Coastal Ejido Mixed Crop/Livestock Farm 130 ha)
6.        Model No. 2 depicts a 130 ha ejido with 10 beneficiaries and a
cropping pattern of 100 ha of pasture, 5 ha of maize and beans for home
consumption, and 25 ha of unproductive land. The development program calls
for the entire 130 ha to be drained and for the cropped area to increase to 80
ha and the pasture area to be reduced to 50 ha. Productivity would increase
due to project investments and technical services support. The total
investment cost is estimated at Mex$ 2.92 million and would include field
drainage (130 ha), land smoothing and clearing (65 ha), pasture establishment

(50 ha), and fencing. The proposed development plan is expected to raise the
cropping intensity by 40% over the four-year transition period. At full
development in year 7, crop yields would reach about 3.0, 3.5, 1.0, and
1.5 t/ha respectively for maize, rice, beans and watermelon, and the livestock
carrying capacity to increase from 1.0 to 1.6 animal units per hectare. Total
labor requirements are expected to increase from present levels of 1,630
man-days to about 4,135 man-days per annum, and net farm income per family
before debt service is estimated to increase from Mex$ 57,000 to about
Mex$ 300,000 by full development.
Model No. 3: Private Coastal Crop Farm (20 ha)
7.        Model No. 3 represents a 20-ha private farm with one beneficiary
family currently operating an extensive pasture system due to flooding
problems. Under the project the unit would be converted to an all-crop
operation over a six-year period. Investments in field drains (20 ha) and
land clearing and smoothing (10 ha) are estimated to cost Mex$280,000. With
the development plan, the cropping intensity would increase about 25% over
four years and full development yields of soybean, maize, groundnut and sesame
are expected to reach 2.5, 3.0, 2.0 and 1.2 t/ha, respectively. Total labor
requirements are expected to increase from 280 man-days to 560 man-days per
annum at full development and net farm income before debt service to increase
from Mex$ 130,000 to about Mex$ 652,000 by full development in year 7.
Model No. 4: Private Coastal Dual-Purpose Livestock Farm (45 ha)
8.        Model No. 4 represents a 45-ha private dual-purpose livestock ranch
with one beneficiary family currently operating an extensive pasture system.
Under the development plan the entire 45 ha would be drained and 20 ha of
improved pasture (most likely Brachiaria decumbens) would be established, and
three high quality bulls and miscellaneous milking equipment would be
purchased. The total investment cost is estimated at about Mex$ 1,487,500.
As a result of the development plan the livestock ca-rying capacity would
increase from about 1.0 to 1.4 AU/ha by full development in year 7. Likewise,
the following technical coefficients would improve: total annual milk sales
from 4,300 1 to 11,900 1 due to an increase in average lactation yield from
300 to 50G 1, in calving percentage from 60% to 70% and in the number of cows
in milk from 14 to 24; and liveweight sales of beef would increase from about
3.3 t to 6.7 t per annum due to an increase in the number of steers fattened
(6 to 10), cows culled (4 to 7) and in their liveweight at sale (steers from
300 kg to 350 kg and cull cows from 375 kg to 450 kg). Total labor require-
ments are expected to rise from 625 to 1,000 man-days per annum and net farm
income before debt service is estimated to increase from Mex$ 258,000 to about
Mex$ 663,000 by full development.
Model No. 5: Central Depression Ejido Crop Farm (7 ha)
9.        Model No. 5 depicts a 7-ha ejidatario holding with one beneficiary
family in the Comitan area. Currently 4 of the 7 ha are considered to

ANNEX 4
Page 4 of 4
be cropped (although substantial reduction in yields occurs in wet years) with
the balance beinig unproductive due to regular flooding. The entire farm is
seriously affected by poor drainage; thus, all 7 ha would require field drains
and 2 ha of laud clearing and smoothing, at an estimated cost of about
Mex$ 45,500. The proposed development would raise the cropping intensity from
about 60% to 100% over six years and increase maize and bean yields from 2.1
and 0.8, to 4.0 and 1.2 t/ha, respectively. Total labor requirements are
expected to increase from present levels of 155 mandays to about 229 mandays
per annum and net farm before debt service from Mex$ 61,000 to about
Mex$ 198,000 by full development.
Model No. 6: Private Central Depression Dual-Purpose Livestock Farm (20 ha)
10.       Model No. 6 represents a 20-ha private livestock ranch with one
beneficiary family operating an extensive pasture system. With the develop-
ment plan the entire 20 ha would receive field drains, fencing and corral
facilities at an estimated investment cost of about Mex$ 1,180,000. The
livestock carrying capacity is expected to increase from 1.2 to 1.9 AU/ha by
full development in year 7. The following technical coefficients are also
expected to improve: milk production per cow from 400 liters to 800 1 per
lactation, calving percentage from 60-70%, number of cows in milk from 7 to
11, and non-bull liveweight sales from 1.5 t to 3.8 t due to an increase in
sales of culled cows (2-4) and steers (2-5) and an increase in their
respective liveweights at sale from 400-475 kg and 325 to 375 kg. Total labor
requirements are expected to rise from 500 man-days to 750 man-days per annum
at full development and net farm income before debt service from Mex$ 94,000
to Mex$ 463,000 by full development.
Model No. 7: Los Altos Ejido Fruit Model (1 ha)
11.       This model represents the estimated impact of project tree crop
investments in the densely populated, rugged area of Los Altos. Since average
holdings are small in the region, the development plan proposes to establish
high value fruit crops with technical support from CONAFRUT in production and
in marketing. Investments, which would be in the form of a grant, would
provide individual terracing for trees, purchase of trees, and the payment of
salaries to farmers to provide for subsistence during the three-year develop-
ment phase. The entire holding would be converted to fruit trees from the
current situation in which only half of the area (0.5 ha) is used, although
not suitable, for subsistence food crops such as maize, beans and vegetables.
The entire plan would take five years to fully establish the 0.7 ha of apples,
0.2 ha of peaches and 0.1 ha of oranges and would take a total of 16 years to
reach full development, although some species of fruits would be produced in
years 4 and 5. The yield of apples, peaches, and oranges is expected to reach
15, 20, and 30 t/ha, respectively, by full development. Total labor require-
ments are expected to rise from 20 to 108 man-days per annum and net farm
income before debt service to significantly rise from about Mex$6,400 to Hex$
449,000 by year 16.

CHlIAPAS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Special Studies
1.        The agricultural land resources in the State of Chiapas are largely
underdeveloped and underutilized. Of the 7.4 million ha, only 1 million ha
are used for crop production and about 2.5 million ha are used for livestock
production. It is estimated that the area for rainfed crop production could
at least be doubled. In addition, because of an abundance of surface and
ground water, there is good potential for irrigated crop production.
Development has been constrained by lack of roads, flood control, drains, farm
services, etc. Development is also complicated by social and economic
constraints (20% of the population is indigenous and mare than 20% is living
at or below the subsistence level according to socio-economic analyses). The
Government has given the Southeast Region, which includes Chiapas, a high
priority for development, and in order to accelerate development data must be
collected and evaluated. Therefore, the following studies would be conducted
under the project.
Basic and Feasibility Studies in the Project Areas
2.        Basic and feasibility studies have been completed on about
205,000-ha out of the 255,000 ha in the project area on the Coast. Funds have
been allocated for a study of the remaining 50,000 ha in the area of Tapachula
which is scheduled for completion by mid-1985. Basic and feasibility studies
have been completed for the 55,000 ha in the Central Depression and 7,500 ha
in the Altos.
Monitoring of the Water Table and Ground Water Surveying
3.        Monitoring of the water tables would be necessary to evaluate the
effects of the drainage system and determine whether modification of drainage
system designs, including drainage control structures, may be required in the
future. Closely related to the monitoring of the water table would be a ground
water study-in the project area as well as areas being considered for future
development. The ground water survey would determine the availability and
quality of water for domestic consumption as well as for possible
supplementary irrigation.
Survey of the Coastal Lagoons
4.        SARH is already making arrangements to conduct hydrological and
topographical surveys of the coastal lagoons and adjacent permanent wetland
areas. The objectives of these studies would be to: (a) determine the
baseline status of the lagoon prior to construction of infrastructure
(particularly the drainage system) that would discharge into the lagoons;



- 65 -
ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 3
(b) monitor the effect of the construction works (particularly sedimentation)
on the lagoons and determine methods to limit and control possible detrimental
effects on the forest, fauna, fish and wildlife; (c) monitor and control the
ran-off of agricultural fertilizers and chemicals into the lagoons and
wetlands; (d) increase the productivity of the lagoons (particularly fishing);
and (e) preserve the lagoons.
Monitoring and Evaluation of the Drainage System
5.        As this would be the first large-scale experience with drainage and
river control on the Coast, it is important that measures be taken to monitor
and evaluate the effect on the water table in relation to design of
infrastructure in the future as well as the effect on crop production. This
would be particularly important for the second cycle crop, which depends on
residual moisture.
Soil Surveys
6.        Semi-detailed soil surveys are now available, and some estimates
have been made of the change in classification of soils when excess water is
no longer a constraint. Continuing soil surveys would be required to
determine the overall reclassification of soils for the purposes of future
optimum land use planning. More detailed soil studies would also be required
even at the individual farm level in connection with the design of on-farm
works and preparation of detailed investment plans. Soil studies would be
fundamental to the design and implementation of appropriate soil conservation
works and practices.
Chiapas Pre-Investment Studies for Future Development
7.        As part of the Chiapas Plan and the long-term development program
for the State, pre-investment (basic, pre-feasibility and feasibility) studies
would be carried out on more than 600,000 ha under the project. Such studies
would include about 330,000 ha located at Cintalapa, Kotocintla, La
Trineteria, Margaritas, Chicomuselo, Valle de Tulija, Palenque and San
Vincente. An additional 300,000 ha would be the subject of various levels of
basic studies. These studies would be carried out under the SARH Subsecre-
tariat of Planning and Studies, through the Office of the Director General for
Planning and Evaluation in coordination with COPLADE. Adequate local capacity
and expertise are available, and would be complemented by the technical
services component under the project.
Environmental and Socioeconomic Impact Review
8.        The project would involve a major infrastructure program and changes
in the cropping system including the conversion of large areas of traditional
grazing land to crop production. These changes imply an element of
environmental risk which needs to be controlled and evaluated to limit

possible detrimental impact. SARH, COPLADE and SEDUE would continue to
cooperate to ensure that adequate pre-investment environmental impact studies
are carried out in accordance with existing legislation. The Government would
also undertake socioeconomic studies to determine the impact of the project on
employment, income, migration of labor and the transition of agriculture and
livestock production in the area. Studies would also focus on problems and
questions related to the larger scope of development proposed under the
Chiapas Plan. The environmental study would initially focus on: (a) the water
quality and soil particle run-off at the Comitan drainage way outlet as well
as selected rivers on the Coast; (b) control of the use of agricultural
chemicals and fertilizers and a measure of chemical and fertilizer discharge
into waterways; (c) amount and effects of increased volume of water flow into
receiving bodies of water; and (d) designs and establishment of a suitable
control station network.
9.        The socioeconomic studies would focus on: (a) the existing, and
changes in land tenure situation; (b) the effectiveness of farmer
organizations and changes required; (c) employment; (d) changes in the income
and standard of living of the beneficiary; and (e) review of existing
sociological information in the Altos with the objective of determining the
types of actions that have or would have the greatest potential, to solve the
social and economic problems of the area. Guidelines for the environmental
and sociological studies are included in the project file (Annex 6).
Marketing Study
10.       Marketing facilities are considered, in the traditional sense, to be
inefficient but adequate for the present level of agricultural production in
Chiapas and no significant increase in production would occur under the
project until at least year 5. Nevertheless, the system is constrained by
inadequate communications (roads in particular), the scattered nature of
agriculture and livestock production areas, normal complex intermediary
system, lack of cold storage and processing facilities for perishable
products, and the need for a well organized and efficient transport system to
distribute the surplus of production to other parts of Mexico. The State is a
net exporter of basic grains (particularly maize), fruits, coffee, cocoa and
vegetables. In order to minimize constraints that would depress farmgate
prices, the marketing study would focus on storage requ4rements. However, all
factors mentioned herein need to be reviewed as the basis for a long-term
stratagy and action plan to improve the marketing system.
