F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The overall objective is to catalyze an integrated approach to water resource management
and pollution control in the Hai Basin in order to improve the Bohai Sea environment.
Specifically, the Project will (i) improve integrated water and environment planning and
management in the Hai Basin, (ii) support institutional aspects related to effective local,
municipal/provincial, and basin-wide water and environment planning and management,
(iii) enhance capacity building in water and environment knowledge management and
implementation, and (iv) reduce wastewater discharges from small cities along the rim of
the Bohai Sea.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1. Country Background: The very rapid growth of China's cities and industries had
created a strong demand for water in the agricultural, urban and industrial sectors in recent years.
This resulted in an imbalance between water demand and supply and as a consequence there had
been a drying up of waterways and over mining of groundwater. Surface and groundwater were
also heavily polluted with 68% of the total river length on the North China Plain considered
polluted. As well as degraded rivers in the Hai Basin, the off-shore of Bohai Sea had become
polluted to some extent and it suffered „red tides‟ in 1989 and 1998. The important fisheries and
biodiversity of the Sea were degraded and this had negative implications for the Yellow Sea and
East China Sea.
1.1.2. Integrated water and environmental management in China was also problematic because
of difficulties in inter-jurisdictional and inter-administrative cooperation. For example there were
considerable overlapping jurisdictions between Ministries with responsibilities for water and
environmental management.
1.1.3. Chinese Government Programs had begun to address these problems by identifying water
pollution in the Bohai Sea and Hai Basin as a priority in the 9th (1995-2000) and successive
National Five-Year Plans as well as preparing Action Plans and investment programs to address
the pollution problems. The Government had also commenced taking measures to address water
scarcity issues including by improving irrigation conservation and efficiency, water pricing and
by proposing construction of the South-North Transfer (eastern and middle routes) to bring about
27 billion cubic meters of water per year from the Yangtze River system to North China including
the Hai Basin. The government had also formulated related policies to improve the Bohai Sea
area including the „Bohai Declaration‟, amendment of the Marine Environmental Protection Law,
and the introduction of the „Blue Sea Action program‟.
1.1.4. Global Significance of the Project: The Bohai Sea is located in the North West of the
Yellow Sea and had provided important fisheries for China, Japan and North and South Korea.
More than 40 rivers discharged from the North China Plains into the Bohai Sea including from
the Hai Basin. The Sea also had a diverse marine life and has in the past been important for
fisheries recruitment for the East China Seas and North West Pacific. The deteriorating
environment and water scarcity could also lead to adverse impact on water quality of Bohai Sea,
which could be of global significance and concern.
1.1.5. The project supported the objectives of the International Convention on Biodiversity and
falls under the GEF International Waters Focal Area. It had direct relevance for the Global
Program for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land Based Activities. The project
also complemented other GEF initiatives including the „Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem
Project‟ and the „Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia‟.
1.1.6. Rationale for Bank Assistance: At the time of project identification, the government
was implementing policies and plans through sectoral programs that focused more on large
infrastructure investment. In general, it lacked an integrated approach which leads to a more
balanced economic development and environment protection, and considered institutional
cooperation, balanced management and investment, used science based decision making,
considered interactions between surface and groundwater; water quantity and water quality; land
and water use; and, impacts on the marine resources water.




                                                 1
1.1.7. Bank sector work had highlighted the problems of water scarcity and pollution in the
North China Plain (Agenda for Water Sector Strategy for North China) and the high financial and
environmental costs of water transfers (China Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy).
Sector work in rural development had underlined the need to improve rural incomes (Rural
China: Transition and Development).
1.1.8. The Bank had assisted with funding of 20 water resources and irrigation projects since
1995, including institutional elements, plus numerous water supply and sanitation projects in the
previous 15 years. Two in particular, the Water Conservation Project (WCP) and the second
Tianjin Urban Development Environment Project (TUDEP2) had provided direct and innovative
experiences and had links to the project objectives. Some of the projects had also been supporting
institutional aspects of water and environment at river basin and at administrative levels.
1.1.9. The government requested Bank assistance for a project to benefit the water and
environmental conditions of Hai Basin and Bohai Sea areas. Many agencies including MWR,
SEPA (now MEP), Tianjin and Beijing Municipal governments and Hebei Provincial
governments participated in project preparation and provided strong support. The catalyzing
effect of the project was considered to be very large with all entities recognizing its significance
in carrying out integrated water and environmental management (IWEM) in China.
1.1.10. The project was in line with the China Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and the sector
related goal for sustainable development and management of water and other natural resources.
1.1.11. The project did not target the whole Hai Basin or North China Plains area as a number of
the project elements were considered innovative and needed testing and adaptation to local
conditions. At that time, it was considered a good mechanism for providing significant lessons
for an eventual wider application.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The overall objective is to catalyze an integrated approach to water resource management
and pollution control in the Hai Basin in order to improve the Bohai Sea environment.
Specifically, the Project will (i) improve integrated water and environment planning and
management in the Hai Basin, (ii) support institutional aspects related to effective local,
municipal/provincial, and basin-wide water and environment planning and management, (iii)
enhance capacity building in water and environment knowledge management and implementation,
and (iv) reduce wastewater discharges from small cities along the rim of the Bohai Sea.

1.2.2 There are altogether 29 Key Performance Indicators including 12 outcome/impact
indicators and 17 output indicators as presented in Annex 1 of PAD, which are also included in
the data sheet and Annex 2 of this ICR. These indicators are summarized below as same as they
were presented in the main text of PAD:

    (1) Decreased water pollution in pilot counties (tons of reduction);
    (2) Reduced Groundwater overdraft in pilot counties (rate of water table lowering reduced);
    (3) Reduced pollution loading to the Bohai Sea from pilot counties and coastal counties;
    (4) Inter-agencies committees established in Integrated Water and Environmental
        Management (IWEM) in counties and in demonstration counties;
    (5) Formulated Integrated Water and Environmental Management Plans (IWEMPs) for 10
        selected counties in the Hai Basin and for Tianjin Municipality;
    (6) Produced eight Strategic Studies at central and Hai Basin levels and integrated findings
        into IWEMPs;
    (7) Carried out four Demonstration Projects and integrated findings into IWEMPs;


                                                  2
    (8) Formulated Strategic Action Plans (SAP) for the Zhangweinan (ZWN) sub-basin and Hai
        Basin;
    (9) Established Integrated Water Resource- Water Quality Information Management System;
    (10) Established a functional Evapotranspiration (ET) Management System for the Hai Basin;
    (11) Implementation of improved small city wastewater management in Tianjin coastal
         counties;
    (12) Construction of two small city wastewater treatment plants in Tianjin; and
    (13) Disposal of contaminated sediment from Dagu canal

1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

1.3.1   There were no revisions of the project development objectives or the key indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 The project beneficiaries remain as described in the PAD. The primary beneficiaries are
the people living in the project area who have seriously suffered from water shortage and water
pollution – especially those in the rural areas outside Beijing and Tianjin. Control of water use
and pollution in the basin will improve people‟s health, living conditions, reduce odours, and
improve aesthetic and recreational conditions.
1.4.2 Benefits will also accrue to fishers and people fringing the Bohai Sea through improved
water quality, fishery stocks and biodiversity although this will be longer term. Healthier
ecosystems and environmental aesthetics will also benefit the Basin‟s population.
1.4.3 Farmers in the project area will benefit from self management of irrigation water supply
and project investments in water-saving infrastructure, agriculture, and better water management
that were expected to increase incomes. The long term sustainability of surface and groundwater
supply for irrigation, human and industry users was also considered a significant benefit.
1.4.4 Responsible government agencies at National, Provincial and County levels are an
additional beneficiaries as project innovations enables integrated management and introduces
mechanisms which can effectively implement and monitor government water use and discharge
policies. MWR, MEP, Ministry of Construction (MOC), State Oceanic Administration (SOA),
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Ministry of Finance (MOF), Beijing Municipality, Tianjin
Municipality, Hebei Province, and, HBC (under the MWR) were involved in project
implementation.

1.5 Original Project Components (as included in the PAD)
1.5.1 The Project would support the development of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms for
integrated water and environment management in the Hai Basin, based to the extent possible on
existing institutional mechanisms. The Project would also promote development of new
coordination approaches at all levels that would adopt practical and pragmatic methods to
overcome current institutional barriers to integrated water and environment management. The
Project included four components:
Component 1: Integrated Water and Environment Management - IWEM
This component would finance consultant services, training, goods and small works. The IWEM
would be divided into following 3 subcomponents:

   (1) Subcomponent 1A - Strategic Studies: The eight strategic studies (please refer to indicator
       15 in Annex 2) focus on four primary areas of concern at the Hai Basin level: policy,


                                                3
       legal and institutional issues; environmental needs for water including the Bohai-Hai
       linkages; water quantity management; and pollution management;
   (2) Subcomponent 1B - Integrated Water and Environment Management Planning – IWEMP:
       The IWEMP subcomponent is the core of the Project. It would provide an example of the
       methods and benefits of this approach to China and to the receiving environment of the
       Bohai Sea. The subcomponent would provide the context within law, policy, institutional
       arrangements, and operational practices, for the development of practical approaches to
       IWEM at the basin, sub-basin, and county levels; and
   (3) Subcomponent 1C - Demonstration Project: This subcomponent would finance
       demonstration projects prepared and implemented under the Beijing, Hebei and ZWN
       PMOs that would serve as experimental units to carry out the IWEMPs
Component 2: Knowledge Management - KM
This component would finance consultant services, training and goods and would be
implemented under the Hai Basin PMO. The KM component would have 2 subcomponents:

   (1) Subcomponent 2A - Knowledge Management: This subcomponent would provide a
       service function for all users and clients within the Project and would provide hardware
       and software tools to help Project participants to address their specific issues; and
   (2) Subcomponent 2B - Establishment of Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration Management
       System: This subcomponent would support improvements in the conservation of water
       resources and the water environment, in order to achieve a rational water balance and its
       sustainable management, based on a focus on ET management.
Component 3: Tianjin Coastal Wastewater Management
The component would be implemented under the Tianjin PMO and would provide technical
assistance for Tianjin to address critical water pollution control issues in the coastal area related
to two infrastructure activities (Wastewater Infrastructure, and Renovation of the Dagu Canal
System) under the World Bank-financed Second Tianjin Urban Development and Environment
Project (TUDEP2). The component would have 2 subcomponents:
   (1) Small City Wastewater Management Studies. It would cover institutional, financial, and
       technical studies for wastewater management programs in small coastal cities including
       funding a small cities financial support program to help the small cities meet their
       financial obligations;
   (2) Dagu Catchment Industrial Pollution Control Program. It would support an industrial
       pollution control and pre-treatment study, and improve monitoring and enforcement of
       discharges into Dagu canal.
Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Training
This component would finance consultant services, training and goods. Hai Basin Project
management would support coordinated and integrated actions by the Ministries/Bureaus of
environmental protection and water resources at the various levels. All Project Management
Offices (PMOs) would have Joint Expert Groups to assist the PMOs in coordination, review,
supervision and in some cases execution of technical activities under the Project. The Central
PMOs would be supported by an international expert panel with broad experience in water quality
and quantity management, water and environment planning and knowledge management. The
PMOs would also arrange international and domestic study tours and international and domestic
training on a variety of topics related to IWEM, river basin management, knowledge management,
“real? water savings and ET management, pollution control, water rights and well permits,
wastewater treatment, wastewater canal clean up, wastewater reuse, ecological restoration, etc.



                                                   4
The Project would also support PMO operations, monitoring and evaluation and other Project
management aspects mainly through counterpart funding. The above activities would be
supported under this component at the following three administrative levels:
   (1) At central level for a joint PMO and joint expert group led by MWR and MEP
   (2) At provincial level for a joint PMO and joint expert group led by WRB and EPB
   (3) At county level for a joint PMO and joint expert group led by WRB and EPB

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1    There was no major revision of the project components during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 Two official extensions of the Grant closing date were made for this project. The first
extension was from June 30 to December 31, 2010, as result of the Mid-Term Review, based on
the conclusion that an additional six months would be necessary to complete the project, because
of start-up delays due to three reasons: (a) lack of counterpart funding at the Hai Basin level (the
issue was resolved after about 6-months delay); (b) unfamiliarity of the Bank procurement and
financial management procedures (the project took more time than expected to help the project
staff to learn Bank procurement guidelines and financial and disbursement procedures for
reimbursement); and (c) difficulties for project staff to understand the innovative concept and
approach of the project (the project took more time than expected to hold workshops and training
with technical assistance for the project staff to fully understand the project concept and
approach).

1.7.2 The second extension was made from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011, due to the
two major reasons: (a) delayed completion of the waste water treatment plant financed under
TUDEP2, which in turn, translated into another six-month delay in implementing the incentive
program for O&M of the plant under the TA for wastewater management in small cities along the
coastal lines; and (b) additional time would be needed for the project provinces, counties, MWR
and MEP to review and clear the outputs of the project and carry out the necessary follow-up
work to ensure project sustainability. The follow-up work also included organizing meetings and
workshops to determine what actions should be taken in order to extend the project approach
beyond the original project areas of the Hai Basin, which would enhance the project‟s
sustainability.

1.7.3 There were some minor adjustments in content and funding allocations based on the
principles of best utilizing resources to achieve the Global Environment Objectives (GEOs) of the
project, which have been made at the time of the Mid Term Review (MTR) proposed by MOF
and officially approved by the Bank (refer to mid-term report in project file):
   (1)   The KM system specific to Tianjin and Beijing Municipalities was added;
   (2)   Three additional County IWEMPs were added in Tianjin;
   (3)   An additional study into Non Point Source Pollution was added;
   (4)   Only minor adjustments were made to the investment plan during MTR review: $1,857 k
         reduction in civil works (the works to be financed under this project had been internally
         financed by government); $733 k reduction in goods (vehicles and equipment to be
         purchased under the project have been provided by government); $2,477 k reduction in
         training and study tours (overseas training and study tours were replaced by inviting
         international experts to China to provide training); $4,896 k increase in consulting
         services (above item 1 to 3 plus international consultants to deliver training to project


                                                 5
        staff in China); $500 k reduction in financial incentive mechanisms (based on the actual
        needs); $190 k increase in international workshops; and, $810 k increase in project
        management (financed with 100% counterpart funds).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Based on previous Bank project experience and sector work, the project was correctly
focused on new and innovative approaches to address the critical issues of the Hai Basin and
Bohai Sea. These included: (a) taking an integrated approach to water resources and
environmental planning and management, (b) including institutional cooperation and
development at national, river basin, and provincial levels, (c) ensuring a balanced top down
(from national and river basin levels) and bottom up (participation from water user levels)
management approach, (d) emphasizing the importance of data and knowledge management for
water environmental management including the wide sharing and compatibility of data, and, (e)
recognizing the critical need to control water consumption rather than water use or withdrawal.
The project introduced many linked innovative approaches at the preparation and design stage
based on the following world-wide recognized three principles for integrated water resources
management, including some at the leading edge internationally.
   (1) The ecological principle (the principle for ecological environment protection in the
       context of a river basin). Under this project, the control of total consumptive use of water
       and total discharge of pollution loads at the river basin level with linkages of the control
       down to the water user level) has been incorporated in the project design – water was
       managed comprehensively (not independent actions taken by water users) in the context
       of the river basin as the development and management unit with a special attention paid
       to the environment, that was, development and utilization of water resources concerned
       water use for multi-sector economic development and eco-environmental protection and
       therefore was managed in an integrated manner based on the basin as the unit. In this
       regard, the innovative part of the project was that the integrated water and environment
       management was carried out at both river basin level and water user level with the
       quantitative linkages in-between. The linkages included the maximum consumptive use
       of water (or target ET) and maximum discharge of water pollution loads as targets, which
       were enforced at both river basin and water user levels.
   (2) The institutional principle (the principle for cooperation of all stakeholders). Under this
       project, a joint conference-based decision making system for integrated water and
       environment management and all stakeholder participation have been followed in the
       project design. Water resources management is best done when all stakeholders
       participate, including the state, private sector and civil society and involving participation
       by women, and that water management should take place at the lowest levels possible.
       The innovative part of the project in this regard was that all project activities were carried
       out with the approach with top-down/bottom-up and vertical and horizontal integration to
       involve all the PMO staff and other stakeholders (farmers, private sectors, experts and
       government officials) to participate in the project management and implementation.
   (3) The instrument principle (the principle for economic value of water resources) – water is
       a scarce resource and economic good whose management requires greater use of
       incentives and economic principles in improving its allocation and enhancing equity. This
       principle has been followed in the project design – cropping pattern adjustment, ban for
       use of deep groundwater resources, and volumetric water charges were considered to
       reach the purpose of increasing farmer incomes while reducing consumptive use of water
       for sustainability.


                                                 6
2.1.2    These principles and innovations, proposed by the Bank at preparation, were not fully
understood or accepted by the government at the beginning of the project as the innovations were
significantly different from established and traditional practice in China. Each of the innovations
required further study, testing and discussion before it could be adopted by the project. This is
one of reasons for this project to take a long time than usual for preparation and implementation.

Assessment of project design

2.1.3 With the background described above, the project objectives were clearly stated and
responsive to China's and international priorities. The components were well designed and well
matched to project objectives. First, the project was fully consistent with one of objectives in the
Bank Group‟s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS / 2001-2005), which was to “support rational
and environmentally sustainable use and development of natural resources?. Second, the project
has been consistent with the Bank Group‟s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS / 2006-2010) for
China. The proposed project would support Pillar 2 of the CPS to reduce poverty, inequality and
social exclusion, through promoting balanced urbanization, sustaining rural livelihoods, and
expanding access to basic social and infrastructure services, particularly in the rural areas, and
Pillar 3 to manage resource scarcity through conserving water resources. Specifically, the project
was designed in line with the World Bank's China Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy
(CWRAS), which addresses the important issues and provided a good foundation for future Bank
assistance to China in water resources management issues. The important message in the
CWRAS addressed by the project design was that integrated water resources management is both
a top down and a bottom up set of activities. In China that means that the counties (and the
townships, villages, and individual water users) need to be directly involved in planning and
implementing integrated water resources management actions, including water rights and well
permit administration, and enforcement, discharge control, industrial restructuring, "real“ water
savings measures, wastewater treatment, treated effluent reuse, etc..

2.1.4     The project involved many counterpart organisations at national, municipal/provincial,
river basin and sub-basin, and county levels. In addition, there were many top-level water and
environment research institutions involved through competitive bidding process in undertaking
the large number of SS, KM system development and planning activities. The project also
introduced a large number of significant project innovations which were not directly aligned with
contemporary government approaches to water and environmental management. In particular,
the time taken to develop and introduce the ET-water budget approach and KM system was
longer than expected and required significant effort to persuade many officials and engineers that
it was worth adopting. An extension of the project by one year accommodated this situation so
that all objectives were fulfilled. For such an innovative project, a thorough assessment of the
capacity of implementing agencies during project preparation would be needed to determine if the
project would need a longer time during project implementation.

2.1.5 Environmental and social factors were adequately incorporated in project design.
Environmental impacts were expected to be largely beneficial. A sound concept for participation
at the different levels and for WUAs and the community was developed. The safeguards
triggered by the project were the Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, and GP4.01), and
the Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) safeguard policies. Although the project involved
small civil works Environmental Management Plan, Environmental Management Plan and
Resettlement Frameworks were prepared to minimize any impacts.

Government commitment and stakeholder involvement


                                                 7
2.1.6 The Chinese government provided assurances that it was committed to the project and
that it would take full advantage of successful results including wider replication and this has
since been demonstrated. Governments at different levels provided significant institutional
support. This involved setting up the Central Project Management Office (CPMO) jointly with
MWR and MEP before appraisal, and the PMOs were also set up at Provincial (HBC, Beijing,
Tianjin, Hebei and Tianjin Construction Bureau), ZWN sub-basin, and in each of 16
demonstration Counties. Consistent with government policy that development should, wherever
possible, be locally financed, local government commitment was demonstrated by
Provinces/Municipalities and counties/cities borrowing a share of the Bank Loan, to allocate their
own counterpart resources. MWR also arranged counterpart resources to contribute to the
operational costs of the CPMO.

2.1.7 Special arrangements were made by the CPMO for technical guidance including
establishment of a Central Independent Expert Group, a Central Joint Expert Group and an
International Expert Panel. In addition, the Hai Basin Commission set up a KM Expert Group
and ET Expert Group. The project design provided adequately for stakeholder involvement at
lower levels (refer to 2.1.7).

Risk assessment

2.1.8    Critical risks were assessed at appraisal and, where appropriate, mitigation measures
were correctly built in to the project or addressed during implementation so that they did not
materialize. One risk that was not identified in the PAD was the risk associated with the
advanced technologies that were selected to achieve project outcomes; in particular, the advanced
ET technology and KM were not well developed at that time and had to be more fully developed
during the project in order to apply it at a basin scale. This risk was overcome with government‟s
strong support by allocating more external funding for development of the RS-based ET
measuring technology.

2.1.9 Overall, this was a very timely, well designed, and highly innovative project.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The implementation of the project kept in the right track towards its objectives after it
became effective in July 2004. The investment progress was rather slow during the first two years
mainly because of lack of counterpart funding at the Basin level. This issue was successfully
resolved with the efforts made by the Hai basin Commission, MWR and NDRC. In addition, the
project took more time than expected during the first two years to provide project staff with
intensive training in Bank‟s procurement and financial management guidelines and project
concept and approaches to ensure the quality of the project implementation.

2.2.2 Mid-term review. Conducted in December 2007, the MTR found implementation largely
on track and noted the need to accelerate disbursement of domestic funds by some PMOs. The
complexity of the KM and ET aspects of the project leading to project delays were identified.
Following the MTR the government requested (a) extension of the Closing Date; (b) reallocation
of the amount of the Grant allocated among Categories; (c) adjustment of the disbursement rate of
concerned Categories (refer section 1.7); and (d) addition of a new Category “International
Workshop?, which were agreed by the Bank. There was no project restructuring.




                                                8
2.2.3 The project was implemented very largely as designed, with only small adjustments
following the MTR. The project met or exceeded most output targets. One target, the amount of
Zinc to be removed in sediment from the Dagu canal was slightly (91%) less than the target.
However the amount of sediment removed was 285% of the target and oil (287%) and Total
Nitrogen (286%) substantially and consistently exceeded targets. The shortfall in Zn removal
therefore can be reasonable be attributed to sampling errors at project design.

2.2.4 Overall, the timely MTR proved very effective in adjusting the project, accelerating
implementation and disbursement. The CPMO‟s report provided a comprehensive review and
analysis of project status. It highlighted seven important project actions requiring attention and
recommended adjustments and remedial actions for the balance of the project (the MTR report at
the project file).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 The project monitoring and evaluation system, designed with consultant support, selected
a large number of indicators to track outputs and outcomes for all parts of the project and at every
level of implementation. The M&E groups at both central and local government levels were
established to perform routine inspection against performance indicators. The M&E group at the
central level was responsible for preparing consolidated M&E report for the whole project, and
for analyzing and checking quality and consistency of the data collected by local M&E groups
and then consolidating them for the entire project. The local M&E groups were responsible for
collecting data from the data sources including monitoring stations in the field and KM System
installed at Hai Basin Commission and project counties and cities according to the M&E design
agreed during project preparation. The baseline surveys were conducted by all M&E groups right
before the project against which the M&E group at the central level evaluated the project progress,
outputs, outcomes / impacts of the project, and prepared a consolidated annual monitoring and
evaluation report, and regularly reported this to MWR, MEP and the World Bank.

2.3.2 Procurement and financial management information system (MIS) was developed under
the project as part of M&E system to keep cross-checking all the project progress numbers all the
time from both procurement and financial reports and timely send an alert if there is an error
detected by the system, and indicate where the error is. The system will stop working until PMO
finds out the problem and makes corrections. In addition, the system helped the eight PMOs for
project management and data consolidation, and also helped the CPMO to monitor and evaluate
the progress for the entire project and consolidate the actual investment cost, disbursement and
eligible expenses incurred from the eight PMOs of the project.

2.3.3 The activity was found to be more complex than planned and it was delayed due to the
need to train domestic staff in performance management systems and the number of units and
PMOs involved reporting. Overall, the monitoring and evaluation system was well designed and
implemented with reliable information on the key outcome and output indicators generated.

2.3.4 The monitoring system is in place and it is expected that monitoring of ET, the water
balance and pollutant discharges will continue after the project completion for its sustainability
under a variety of programs and budgets including the government‟s Bohai Sea Ecological
Improvement program.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance




                                                 9
2.4.1 Financial management was generally of good quality. Capacity was built through the
development of standardized written procedures and by intensive training. Issues detected
through the supervision process were promptly resolved, and audit reports were timely and of
acceptable quality. Procurement performance was good. The Management Information System
(MIS) allowed real-time tracking of procurement and the prompt identification of issues. As a
result, procurement was rapid and efficient and in line with Bank requirements despite the very
large number of contracts and contracting units (23 PMOs).

2.4.2 Safeguard policies were adequately addressed at project design. During project
implementation, the brief EMP prepared during project preparation has been well implemented
and the impacts of the very small and limited amount of small civil works constructed under the
project have been mitigated. Actually, this project is in fact a project to improve environment
management in the Hai Basin, the entire PIP for the project was considered to be the overall EMP,
which has been implemented as planned and benefited the environment and social aspects in the
Hai Basin.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Follow-on: It is assured that activities financed under the project will continue
sustainably beyond project completion. Project concepts have been adopted in a number of the
river basin level and national level issued policies, which fully supported enforcement of the most
strict water resources management proposed in the „Number 1 Central Document‟. This is the
first time that Number 1 Central Document‟ has addressed water resources management. The
government has planned to develop a National Water Resources System that took reference of the
project‟s KM system. Other project concepts and approaches that have been adopted and will
continue post project include (i) budgeted continuation of joint decision making conference
systems (joint leading groups) at HBC and ZWN as well as in the Municipalities and some pilot
Counties; (ii) inclusion of the project concepts and results in the 12th 5-year water resources
development plans at the various levels; (iii) inclusion of project results, approaches and targets
(eg. ET, flow to Bohai Sea, water quality targets in Water and at Provincial borders) in the Hai
Basin Master Plan for Water Resources Development as well as Municipal level Master Plans for
Water Resources Development; (iv) data sharing agreements between Ministries and in some
Municipalities, Provinces, and Counties; (v) the HBC ET Centre that is established with
sustainable funding from water fees to continue the ET quota system; (vi) WUAs which improve
livelihoods, provide better service and which are self funding; (vii) project concepts and
approaches have been extended to other places in China. For example, ET monitoring is used in
Gansu Province; consumption management is adopted in the MOF „Irrigation Intensification
Program‟; the IWEMP approach was extended to Jilin Province; (viii) Other Bank projects have
adopted project approaches.

2.5.2 Scaling-up. The project has successfully demonstrated IWEM for Hai Basin and for
Bohai Sea ecological improvement. The government is keen to scale this up across the whole Hai
Basin as well as across other river basins flowing into the Bohai Sea. Further illustration of
scaling up is evident from inclusion of project approaches in national policy and Masterplans. In
the Master Plan of Water Resources in Hai Basin (2011 - 2020) recently approved by the State
Council, the project approach on ET management with remote sensing technology has been
included as a new tool to control consumptive use of water resources in the Hai Basin.

2.5.3 Scaling up the project will require initiatives which include training and IWEM best
practice; institutionalization of inter-Ministerial cooperation; further improvement of ET accuracy,



                                                10
remote sensing (RS) and KM with practical and agreed ET targets, quotas and permits in non
project counties; implementation of the 12th Five-year Plans and Master Plans for Water
Resources Development; revision of laws and regulations to include modern concepts of water
management developed in this project; establishment of long-term mechanisms and financing to
ensure technological outcomes remain sustainable; and, data and information sharing between
sectors in the project area as well as nationally. It would be advantageous to include the Ministry
of Agriculture and the State Oceanic Administration in scaling-up the project.

2.5.4 It is recommended by the government and supported here, that the Bank and GEF support
a follow-up phase to consolidate and extend project approaches across all basins flowing into the
Bohai Sea consistent with the 12th Five-year Plan.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The project, as designed and implemented, is entirely consistent with the Bank‟s CPS
(2006-2010) in pillar 2 and 3 (see paragraph 2.1.11) and also in line with CWRAS on integrated
water resources management and addresses key development priorities (balanced economic
development and ecosystem protection) that remain highly relevant to China today and which are
fully consistent with successive Five-year Plans. These have been recently captured in National
level policies and river basin Masterplans. The specific targets of “water-saving? and “pollution-
reduction? match the “energy-saving? and “environment-friendly? society development goals
defined in the 11th Five-year Plan. The specific targets of “Zero over-exploration of
groundwater?, reduction of excess ET, reduction of pollutant discharge into rivers, and
implementation of the strict water resources management scheme known as the three control
“Red-lines?. The project developed viable and replicable models for China to address these
problems. The successful experience under the project is also of global significance, as many
water scarce countries are beset by problems similar to those of China.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

3.2.1 Project outcomes: Based on the detailed evaluation of the project performance indicators,
the project fully achieved its development objective of catalyzing an integrated approach to water
resource management and pollution control and this is demonstrated by the incorporation of
project approaches and results into national level policies, Five-year Plans and Master Plans for
river basin and administrative areas. The following is a summary of project outputs and outcomes
achieved to support accomplishment of each of the four objectives of GEO (Annex 2 gives the
details of project outputs, outcomes and impacts and their achievement, which contributed to the
GEO):
     (1) To improve integrated water and environment planning and management in the Hai
         Basin: The KM, ET, remote sensing, and the 8 Strategic Studies were completed and
         informed policy at National, Hai Basin and Municipality/Provincial levels. The 3
         demonstration projects of real water saving, water allocation and withdrawal, and
         pollution permitting and groundwater development, were successfully implemented and
         results promulgated. IWEM plans were developed for all 16 pilot Counties (PAD target
         was 10) and implementation commenced. Strategic Action Plans were prepared for Hai
         Basin and ZWN sub-basins. Targets to reduce groundwater overdraft exceeded targets by
         more than 500%. The project has had a profound impact on the understanding of



                                                11
        sustainable water resources management and the need to control water consumption
        rather than supply.

    (2) To support institutional aspects related to effective local, municipal/provincial, and basin-
        wide water and environment planning and management: This included joint PMOs and
        Experts Groups at different levels, cooperative and information sharing between water
        and environmental agencies, vertical and horizontal integration, and establishment of the
        regular joint decision making conference systems at the river basin and administrative
        levels. WUAs were established well in excess of project targets (407 vs 65) substantially
        exceeding the target. Technical assistance was provided by domestic and international
        expert panels.

    (3) To support capacity building in water and environment knowledge management and
        implementation: it was achieved via project implementation and special studies as well as
        by the domestic and international expert panels, 155 domestic, and 9 international events,
        and 57 study tours (43 domestic), and 2 large international workshops involving more
        than 200 international and domestic experts and over 160 papers. As a result, substantial
        progress has been made in capacity building of a large number of the government staff
        and experts through the project preparation and implementation with knowledge sharing
        of project innovations, new concept and approaches.

    (4) To reduce wastewater discharges from small cities along the rim of the Bohai Sea:
        Wastewater discharges from small cities along the rim of the Bohai Sea were much
        reduced and project targets exceeded, for example, reduction in COD and NH3-N from
        pilot Counties exceeded the target by around 135% and 146%, respectively and targets
        for reduction in pollutants entering the Bohai Sea were exceeded by 200-300%.

3.2.2 Project innovations and sustainability: The project was successfully implemented with the
following innovations which also contributed to accomplishment of four objectives of GEO and
proved to be effective and sustainable for integrated water and environment management in Hai
Basin of China.

   (1) Introduction of new concept of real water savings which targeted a reduction in
       consumptive use or ET rather than just increases in irrigation efficiency alone which
       normally leads to increases in consumptive use of water through increased effective
       irrigation areas. This innovation introduced new concept and approach to improve the
       traditional approach for integrated water and environment management in the Hai Basin.
       Experience in China had shown that focusing on improvements to physical infrastructure
       alone might increase irrigation efficiency but it could also reduce groundwater recharge
       by increasing the proportion of rainfall or irrigation water consumed by crops through ET.
       This reduced availability of water for other users and the environment. Only a reduction
       in actual consumption of water represented a genuine saving of the resource to the
       hydrological system. The project therefore introduced ET quotas or targets, which were
       based on the actual ET measured with remote sensing technology, and the models of
       surface water and groundwater use and systems. As well as setting quotas to balance
       water supply with water consumption and to reduce over use of groundwater, it also acted
       to raise understanding of real water savings and sustainable water use. To ensure
       sustainability, the consumption-based water withdrawal control has been tested in the
       demonstration subprojects in Hebei and Beijing, where the target ET has been converted
       into withdrawal which the farmers could use as the new limit to reduce groundwater
       overdraft and where only can the allocated consumptive use of water or target ET be


                                                12
    traded among water users, rather than the amount of water withdrawal. Based on the
    testing, subproject design for irrigated agricultural water savings based on this new
    concept has been extended to other water scarcity areas to ensure that the actual
    consumptive use of water or ET is less with the subproject than without the subproject. In
    addition, ET-based design approach for irrigated agricultural water savings developed
    under this project was recently awarded the second price for agricultural water savings by
    the Ministry of Water Resources.

(2) The introduction of institutional mechanisms for cooperation among government
    departments in different sectors rather than the traditional sectoral line management and
    top down (command and control) direction. This integrated institutional management
    proposed horizontal (cross-sectoral) cooperation between MWR, MEP, MOA and the
    MOC, and their national, provincial and county equivalent agencies. The innovation also
    include vertical cooperation between administrative levels, and refers to direct
    communication and constant interaction between project activities at the national, HBC,
    sub-basins, Municipality/Provincial, County and Village WUA (farmer) levels. The
    integrated management also included establishment of horizontal and vertical project
    coordinating mechanisms, signing of data sharing agreements, establishment of a joint
    decision making conference system at the Hai Basin and ZWN Sub-Basin, and inter-
    agency decision making committees at the county level, and a suite of strategic policy
    studies and demonstration projects to deal with issues important for IWEM and the
    project. To ensure sustainability, the joint review and approval of water withdrawal
    permit and wastewater discharge permit have been tested by the water and environment
    departments under the project in Hebei and Tianjin, which has strengthened enforcement
    of pollution control. The joint decision making conference system established under the
    project will continue to work and a data sharing agreement signed jointly by MWR and
    MEP will be implemented in the Hai Basin after the project completion.

(3) The introduction of a Basin-wide Knowledge Management (KM) System (including
    application of remote sensing ET measuring technology) located at the Hai Basin
    Commission and local governments which included decentralized knowledge hubs at
    lower project levels, and made it technically possible to share and allocate data at both
    basin and county levels by local governments and water use sectors within the basin. The
    key part of this is that a quantitative linkage has been established of the monitoring
    indicators (e.g. target ET and target pollution discharges) between the basin-level and
    field-level, which greatly facilitated the integrated river basin management. During the
    project implementation, MWR and MEP shared information and used common technical
    tools to facilitate joint and consistent decision-making. This KM system included shared
    water and environmental data and developed or adapted a variety of models and decision
    support systems for water use and pollution management. It served as a basis for IWEM
    decisions by water and environment agencies. To ensure sustainability, the target ET has
    been included in the Master Plan of Water Resources in Hai Basin, which has been
    officially approved by MWR, NDRC, and State Council. The indicator of target ET will
    be monitored and evaluated with satellite remote sensing technology to control water use
    at both basin level and water user level after the project completion. In addition, the
    project helped to establish two permanent ET Application Centers at the Hai Basin
    Commission and Beijing Water Affairs Bureau, which measure, monitor and evaluate ET
    changes over the irrigated areas in the Hai Basin during and after project implementation.




                                           13
   (4) The development and implementation of sub-basin and county-level Integrated Water and
       Environmental Plans (IWEMPs) to return surface and groundwater use and pollution
       discharge to sustainable levels consistent with the project‟s goals, ET quotas or targets,
       and water quality targets for water function zones. The IWEMPs also considered the
       ecological water requirements both in stream and also to achieve flow and quality targets
       for the Bohai Sea. To ensure sustainability, the IWEMP prepared and completed under
       the project for Tianjin has been officially approved by the Municipal Government of
       Tianjin and the IWEMPs completed for 16 pilot counties have been approved by the
       respective county governments. All these IWEMPs have started to implement during the
       project implementation and will continue to implement after the project completion.

   (5) Public participation: During project implementation, the outcome was achieved by
       establishing Water Users Associations (WUAs) and by promoting Community Driven
       Development (CDD) that farmers‟ income increased greatly while consumptive use of
       water was reduced. The core value of the CDD/WUA approach was to mobilize farmers‟
       incentives to participate in the whole process of the project design, implementation,
       operation and management. The communities made decisions on their own choices on the
       ways to increase their incomes and on how they were going to do water management,
       particularly on irrigated agricultural water savings and O&M of the on-farm systems. The
       cropping pattern adjustments have been considered by farmers under the project to ensure
       that water was used for higher-value crops to increase farmer incomes and water which
       was really saved was allocated to restoration of ecosystems. Beijing project area of
       farming region that is overdrawing its aquifers, the project helped 360,000 farm
       households to save water and to leapfrog technology. Each farmer got a prepaid card for
       water. Once it was used up, the pump shut down. Farmers used less water, they used it
       better, and their incomes increased fivefold. This project approach has been scaled up to
       other areas in North China.

   (6) Introduction of incentives for small-town waste water treatment and management was
       tested in Tianjin and proved to be effective. In China, a quite number of completed small
       waste water treatment plants are not able to maintain their O&M because charges for
       treatment collected from water users are too low to cover the cost of O&M. Hence there
       are little incentives for investors to build, operate and maintain these plants. To resolve
       this issue, incentives have been given to investors through providing subsidies to
       maintain O&M of the plants until the charges on treatment increase to cover the cost. The
       experience and lessons achieved under the project in this regard are to be extended to
       other small-towns in Hai Basin for waste-water treatment and management.

   (7) The demonstration and studies with experiences and lessons summarized by MEP for
       non-pollution source control in ZWN sub-basin proved to be effective. Currently non-
       point pollution sources take an increasingly bigger proportion in water pollution with the
       substantial reduction of point-pollution sources in China. In north China, most of non-
       point pollutants stay where they are produced rather than enter into rivers because there is
       much less rainfall than in the south China. They become potential pollution sources and
       would make much more serious water pollution once they are flushed into rivers during
       floods. The project summarized the experience and lessons based on the results of
       demonstration in reducing non-point pollution sources and potential pollution sources in
       ZWN sub-basin, which are to be extended to other semi-arid or arid areas in China.

3.3 Efficiency



                                               14
3.3.1 The expected project benefit targets were reached as described elsewhere. A project-
specific analysis of GEF incremental costs was prepared for the PAD (Annex 4) as per GEF
requirements, and this was revised using the same methodology at completion.

3.3.2 The total cost of the Baseline Scenario was estimated in the PAD at US$206.95 million,
including GOC expenditures of US$118.72 million and IBRD financing of US$88.23 million.
The ICR analysis undertook the same approach to defining baseline scenario costs, which is too
conservative but readily quantifiable and practical. For the GEF alternative, the total cost is
composed of baseline scenario costs (US$ 206.95 million at PAD), plus incremental costs
US$ 132.59 (US$ 131.57 at PAD). This includes US$34.34 million for GEF project total costs
(refer to Annex 1 of this ICR) and US$98.25 million from TUDEP2 for the Dagu Canal
Rehabilitation and Suburban Sewerage components of TUDEP2. Its successful implementation
was dependent upon GEF Project implementation. Annex 3 presents the Incremental Cost
Analysis and shows the incremental cost distribution according to project component.

3.3.3 Benefits accrued to a large number of beneficiaries though the pilot, county level,
IWEMPs, CDDs, County level demonstration projects, and WUAs much exceeding PAD targets.
To this can be added non-quantifiable social and environmental benefits. As indicated, the
project also had a very direct and significant impact on national policy and the 12th Five-year Plan
and this will have significant impact on all river basins contributing to the Bohai Sea, throughout
all of China, as well as internationally through China‟s international assistance programs and
influence.

3.3.4 Without GEF support, achieving IWRM at the county, provincial, river basin and
national levels is unlikely because of the well known difficulties in inter-jurisdictional and inter-
administrative cooperation and inadequate programs to implement government policies at grass
roots level. Additionally, GEF support was able to shift government focus from measures that are
visible and with immediate effect and thus geared towards infrastructure; to management that
results in the most cost effective and efficient measures being taken. The GEF project was able to
fill gaps and complement other related initiatives in the region as well as in China. In doing so,
synergies and spin-offs between initiatives were able to be achieved including internationally.
These impacts are not quantified here. In total, this is a highly satisfactory result.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

3.4.1 The project was highly relevant to current country and global priorities and to the Bank
China Country Partnership Strategy (CPS/2006-2010); it met or exceeded all targets as measured
by outcome and impact indicators and so fully attained all development objectives.

3.4.2 The rating is further justified by the highly innovative nature of the project (Section 3.2)
and successful implementation, particularly as some of these innovative elements have since
been embraced in a new and pioneering National level policy, the 12th Five-year Plan, Master
Plans at various levels and extension to other regions in China. The project provides optimism
that with wider roll-out it is indeed feasible to improve the ecological conditions of the Bohai Sea
as well as to move water utilisation on the North China Plain to sustainable levels.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts



                                                 15
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Many beneficiaries are rural poor and it is likely that many of the beneficiaries were
below the official poverty lines. Women were involved in WUAs and training and elected to
WUA committee posts although there is no direct information quantifying the extent of the
involvement. In some WUAs there is a 30% female membership requirement.

3.5.2 The number of WUAs implemented far exceeded the project target. The ICR found that
the WUAs were very positively pro-poor and provided and benefited disadvantaged groups
including the poor and women. The model is efficient, effective and easily replicable.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3 The project included many significant institutional impacts with longer term
ramifications (section 3.2) and this was one of the goals of the project. Two that deserve
emphasis are the signing of data sharing agreements between the Water and Environmental
Ministries and the joint (MWR-MEP) preparation the “Master Plan for Water Pollution
Prevention and Control in the Hai Basin during the 12th Five-year Plan Period?. Joint CPMOs
were effective at all levels.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

There were no unintended Outcomes or Impacts noted.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Efficient, consumption based, irrigation management leads to saving water, energy, and
money. It also leads to higher water productivity and crop yields, reduced agricultural labor,
increased farmer and household incomes, environmental benefits and a sustainable water supply.
The win-win benefits of management ease, increased water productivity, increased yields and
increased household incomes, are the major incentive for farmers‟ involvement and enthusiasm.

3.6.2 Beneficiary surveys in seven of the involved villages, clearly demonstrated these impacts
(Annex 5). Typically for example, water quotas have been reduced by 40% since 1999 in
Beidonggu Village of Guantao County and one irrigation cycle has been reduced from 20-30 days
to 7 days and labour hours for irrigation were reduced by 35%. In Wuji Village of Cheng‟an
County, field labor per household was reduced from 3 to 1 person and a male is no longer needed
in the field and so more remunerative, off-farm income can be sourced thereby greatly increasing
household incomes. In Dashawu Village of Beijing Municipality, wheat yields have increased by
more than 60% due to more productive and water efficient varieties. Such experiences are spread
rapidly and led to the rapid adoption of the WUA approach much beyond project boundaries.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible to Low

4.1.1 The risk to the development outcome is considered negligible to low and can be
demonstrated as the project‟s concepts and approaches have been adopted by project partners and
captured in recent national policies as well as the recent 12th Five-year Plan and „Hai River Basin
Integrated Water Resources Master Plan‟. The „Number 1‟ central document of the CPC Central


                                                16
Committee calls for „increasing fiscal investment in water resources development‟ and „striving
to make the annual average investment in water resources development from the whole society
twice as much as in 2010 in the coming ten years‟. The national policy also states that
„implementation of the strictest water resources management system‟ will be achieved through
control of „the three red lines‟ (control of total amount of use, water use efficiency, and pollutant
discharge).

4.1.2 Risk to integrated planning and management: Integrated planning and supporting KM
systems are well established and accepted at the different levels of government. Consumptive ET
control is well understood and is institutionalised into current planning and management using
simplified water balance models. There is a risk that Remote Sensing based ET management will
not be adopted as further work is required to prove the methodology under all conditions.
However, there are few alternatives to monitoring water use and consumption over such a large
area, without considerable investment in flow measurement and groundwater monitoring
equipment. This is essential to implementing a system of permits and regulation of water use.
The government has planned on-going funding of the Hai Basin ET Centre and so development
and application of the approach will continue.

4.1.3 Risk to institutional aspects of integrated management: The concepts of vertical and
horizontal integration are well understood and adopted. There is a slight risk that cooperation
between Ministries may not continue however this is considered slight. Since the project
commenced the SEPA was promoted to a Ministry level giving it equal seniority to MWR. The
two Ministries have experienced the benefits of working together, established post-project
collaborative systems, signed data sharing agreements and harmonized systems such as Water
Function Zones. There is a risk to the sustainability of WUA and CDD systems as, at least in
some Municipalities, there is a relatively high cost associated with government agency support
and the sustainability of this could be questioned. On the other hand there has been a rapid
adoption of WUA at the farmer level and so it is reasonable to expect that a lower cost model of
WUA would evolve with time provided farmers continue to see the private benefits of the
approach.

4.1.4 Risk to capacity building: The project has achieved much capacity building both in
agencies directly responsible for the project but also in the institutions and Universities that
provide technical services to the project. The government has also established an on-going ET
Centre at the HBC which will continue to build capacity. Therefore the risk here is negligible.

4.1.5 Risk to reduced waste water discharge from cities along the Bohai Sea: Infrastructure has
been established and targets have been exceeded. There is a risk that with continued population
migration to the coastal zone that waste water discharge will rise. However this is thought
unlikely because of the priority and investment being made to improve Hai Basin and Bohai Sea
conditions by the government. Other projects have demonstrated that there is scope to improve
plant efficiencies fairly easily.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory


                                                 17
5.1.1 Overall, the Bank ensured, through the preparation and appraisal process, that the project
design was sound and that the project could achieve its development objectives. The Bank also
ensured that fiduciary arrangements were adequate and that provision was made to respect
safeguards. The project was of very high strategic relevance, and the Bank played an important
role in ensuring that it was responsive to issues of the highest concern to policy makers.
Preparation and appraisal of technical aspects was well conducted tapping international expertise
where needed. The Bank effectively engaged government in dialogue, studies and fieldwork to
develop and build support for the inclusion of the many major project innovations. Bank
involvement enabled cooperation between agencies, data sharing, joint reporting, and the pushing
of ET based management and IWEMPs, etc..

5.1.2 The novelty and complexity of some of the technical elements of the project (KM and
ET) and that related management systems needed to be developed, however, resulted in some
minor implementation delays and ultimately a necessary project extension.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3 During supervision, the Bank maintained a focus on development impact, emphasizing
the targeted outcomes and the innovations being developed by the project. Supervision was
undertaken professionally and, emphasized and continued to build understanding, support, and
ownership for the more difficult innovative aspects of the project. The supervision of fiduciary
and safeguard aspects were of good quality and specialists in financial management, procurement
and social science participated consistently in supervision.

5.1.4 Issues for project implementation were promptly raised, discussed and resolved. Aide
memoires and supervision reports were full and clear. Supervision inputs and processes were
adequate. The MTR was well prepared and the mission well staffed. Preparation for the ICR
process provided training of project staff at all levels in ICR requirements and also focused on
transition arrangements

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.4 The Bank teams played an important role in ensuring quality at entry and in resolving
problems and identifying opportunities during supervision. The Bank had a substantial input into
the success of the project.

5.1.5 The project introduced many innovations essential to the sustainable improvement of Hai
Basin and Bohai Sea conditions which, without the efforts of the Bank team and its cooperative
and supportive approach to government, are unlikely to have been introduced or achieved.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory



                                                18
5.2.1 The government had and maintains a strong commitment to the project‟s development
objectives and this is exemplified by the incorporation of project approaches into national policy.

5.2.2 There was a strong commitment by central and local governments during preparation and
then implementation. This resulted in a well coordinated and effectively implemented project and
loan and counterpart funding. There was a good working relationship established with the Bank.
There was notable involvement of the Ministry of Finance as a full project partner at central and
local levels. Joint PMO and agency coordination arrangements were established. Central and
local government ensured that the CPMO and PMOs at all levels were financed, fully staffed,
trained and effective.

5.2.3 Government, although initially unconvinced by some of the proposed innovations or their
necessity, accepted the lengthy process of dialogue and study needed to work out the project
concept, design and methodologies. Some of the innovations such as joint PMOs and data
sharing are unusual in China. As well, the bottom up participative approach of the project is
contrary to traditional top-down approaches. The PMOs also took action to address any issues as
they arose and actively implemented recommendations following Bank missions. A project wide
M&E system was developed and utilized by the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

5.2.4 PMOs at Central Municipal/Provincial, HBC, and County levels were committed to
achieving development objectives. The project was complex to implement because of the large
number of PMOs involved and innovative or new concept and approaches (section 3.2.2), rather
than the traditional approaches. The CPMO performed well in this complex environment and in
directing and supporting other PMOs. Implementation issues such as project guidelines, staffing,
training, financial management, procurement, M&E and preparation for the ICR were undertaken
effectively and mostly in a timely way. Relationships between partners were good.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

5.2.5 Overall Borrower performance is rated as highly satisfactory. Project approaches are
being adopted more widely in the Bohai Sea catchment area and China more generally.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1 This project offered many innovative aspects in an overall and well throughout package.
The package was effective in changing mindsets to water resources management to an integrated
approach that uses water consumption metric. The project stressed cooperative and integrated
management, and policies and technologies that can be readily up-scaled.

6.1.2 An innovative but initially contested approach to water resources management was
successfully tested and mainstreamed because of a partnership approach between the Bank and
GOC, the flexible and learning approach under the project, and the structural linkages between
project elements. Lessons from the project include:



                                                19
(1) Targeting reduction in consumptive water use and based on ET can be a powerful
    instrument for water resources management in conditions of competing water demand for
    multiple uses, particularly in physical water scarcity areas arid and semi-arid regions in
    the World. Targeting reduction in consumptive water use and adopting measurement and
    management based on ET was highly contentious. Eventually ET based consumption
    control was accepted as the basis for allocation of water rights and quotas at all levels
    from sub-basins down to individual farmers. Using ET and remote sensing technology for
    measurement and management are powerful instruments for changing understanding and
    paradigms about real water savings and water conservation where water is scarce.

(2) Time is required to change mindsets and demonstrate the necessity of new and advanced
    concepts and approach, although there have been initial and good outcomes during a
    very short period of implementation. This project introduced many innovative aspects,
    some of which contradicted traditional approaches and which were not immediately
    accepted such as consumption rather than withdrawal control; cross-sectoral (horizontal)
    and top down-bottom up (vertical) integration rather than single Ministry top-down
    control; and the content and design of river basin KM systems. Where approaches are not
    accepted, or where concepts are advanced, there is likely to be scepticism, dispute and
    sometimes opposition. Changing mindsets takes time and can interfere with project
    implementation. However, once officials, technical staff, and farmers outside the project
    areas can have a chance to see the benefits change or good effects achieved under this
    project can then happen quickly.

(3) A new project focusing on implementation of the existing new approach, policy
    interventions and technologies developed under this project is needed as a follow-up to
    resolve the potential issues or problems which may be emerged during the project
    implementation. This project spent 2/3 of time for development of the new approach and
    policy interventions but the time left for implementation is relatively short to further test
    and improve the developed approach and proposed interventions. It is important that
    complex technologies and support systems are developed and tested for a longer period
    so that stakeholders/end users can fully understand the approach. However, with limited
    time available, this project successfully did this in pilot counties so that the technologies
    and approaches could now be more readily rolled out across the whole Hai Basin or
    wider Bohai Sea catchment as well as more widely in China and internationally.

(4) Coordination of a large network of decentralised management units requires well
    resourced and highly experienced central coordination. This project used a decentralized
    management system in which implementation and financial management were delegated
    downwards to many lower level PMOs in a variety of ministries, institutions, and at
    various levels of government. This created accountability at all levels however it greatly
    increased the complexity of bringing uniformity and compliance to all aspects of
    management. Starting projects modestly to build the capacity and experience of PMOs is
    recommended before taking on large and complex projects. Thus the experience of the
    current CPMO, decentralized PMOs and established joint decision making conference
    system would make increasing the scale of this project highly feasible.

(5) Incentives are required to make the water consumption approach work at farm level.
    Government investment for not only engineering works but also for supporting
    agronomic and cropping pattern improvements and improving irrigation management
    thereby raising farmer incomes and reducing water consumption are important. In the
    case of the Hai Basin, proximity to large urban markets, it would be important to


                                              20
        facilitate cropping change to large extent to produce higher value products per unit of
        water. WUAs proved to be an important mechanism that resulted in farmer benefits and
        water saving.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1 Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.1 The draft ICR was delivered to MWR and MEP for review and comments. The
comments received are given in Annex 6, which focuses on the recognition of the values added
by this project: (a) a new approach has been developed and used for overall control of total
consumptive use of water and of maximum pollution load discharge at the basin level, which
closely links to control of water use and pollution discharge at the water user level. This approach
is available in time to support the government strategy on performing the most stringent water
resources management system as outlined in the central document No. 1 in 2011; and (b) a joint
decision-making conference system has been established and tested on integrated water resources
and environment management between the water conservancy and environmental protection
departments and all other stakeholders in the Hai Basin, and a cooperation mechanism has been
built up in all levels of water resources and environmental protection departments, which has
been jointly participating in the integrated water and environment management in the Hai Basin.

7.1.2 The above values added by the project, among others, recognized by the government are
fully consistent with all four objectives of the GEO for this project, particularly with the first
objective - to improve integrated water and environment planning and management in the Hai
Basin, and also with the second objective - to support institutional aspects related to effective
local, municipal/provincial, and basin-wide water and environment planning and management.
It‟s believed that this project would play an important role in the future as an example to improve
the integrated water and environment management in the water scarcity areas in China.

7.2 Co-financiers

None

7.3 Other partners and stakeholders (NA)

7.3.1 Based on the survey and field visits to the project areas, the response from farmers has been
very positive and supportive about the project implementation because their incomes have been
increased greatly project-wide, while a big amount of water has been saved.

4.    Development of replicable          Qualitative Indicator:
      practical approaches to            Baseline: As far as water use control and pollution control were concerned in the Hai Basin, there were no linkages
      reducing pollution to the Bohai    between the Hai basin level or county level and water user or pollution maker levels. There had been no national level
      Sea that can be used throughout    „Number 1 Document‟ dealing with integrated water and environment management.
      the Hai Basin and in other         Achievement: The approach for integrated water and environment management was developed and carried out at both
      Chinese basins                     river basin level and water user level with quantitative linkages in-between. The linkages include the maximum
                                         consumptive use of water (or target ET) and maximum discharge of water pollution loads as targets to be enforced at
                                         both river basin level and water user levels. Both target ET and pollution loads were allocated from the Basin level or
                                         county level to water users and pollution makers. This approach can be extended to the other counties in the Hai Basin
                                         and the counties in other basins that flow into the Bohai Sea as well as nationally. The exceptional practices of this
                                         project are: (a) target ET has been incorporated into the Water Resources Master Plan of the Hai River Basin as a total

                                       Hai Basin level down to the county and water user levels; (b) target discharges of pollution loads from provinces, cities
                                       and counties to rivers and to Bohai Sea have been set up and used as total control indicators and by the national pollution
                                       control standards; and (c) IWEMPs at city and county levels have been prepared using the Target ET from the Hai Basin
                                       level and target pollution load discharge (national requirement) from the Hai basin level or/and local government levels.
                                       Project concepts and themes have been adopted in national level policies at the highest State level. Project concepts and
                                       results have been adopted in the 12th 5YP including in projects elsewhere in China.

12. Development of replicable          1. The established Joint Decision Making Conference System was tested and proved to be workable administratively for
    practical approaches to            Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in ZWN sub-basin and Hai Basin;
    improving water and                2. The established Basin-wide Knowledge Management (KM) System (including application of remote sensing ET
    environment management             measuring technology), which made it technically possible to share and allocate data (including allocation and sharing of
    resulting in sustainable water     target ET and target pollution discharges) at both basin and county levels by local governments and water use sectors
    resources use and management       within the basin;
    that can be used throughout the    3. The introduced New Concept and Approach for Real Water Savings (reduction of ET or consumptive use of water)
    Hai Basin and in other Chinese     worked well and proved to be very effective and workable in physical water scarcity areas like Hai Basin for sustainable
    basins                             use of its water resources;
                                       4. The introduced Integrated Water and Environmental Plans (IWEMPs) at the local government level were prepared
                                       and implemented to return surface and groundwater use and pollution discharge to sustainable levels consistent with the
                                       project‟s goals, ET quotas or targets, and water quality targets for water function zones;
                                       5. The established CDD-based Water User Associations (WUAs) at the bottom level worked well and played an
                                       important role in participatory irrigated agricultural water savings while;
                                       6. The introduced Incentives for Small-town Waste Water Treatment and Management were tested in Tianjin and proved
                                       to be effective and the experience and lessons can be extended to other small-towns in Hai Basin for waste-water
                                       treatment and management; and
                                       7. The experiences and lessons summarized by MEP for non-pollution source control in ZWN Sub-basin proved to be




                                                                              25
                                    effective and can be extended to other areas where non-pollution is the major sources for pollution.
                                    The above mentioned innovations have been working in the Hai Basin and can be replicable in other river basins in
                                    China. However, they would need to be further refined and improved in the Hai Basin and during their applications and
                                    replications in other river basins.

Component 1 - Integrated Water and Environment Management

13. IWEMPs for 10 counties and      Qualitative Indicator:
     the Tianjin Municipality       Target: 10 IWEMPs prepared and initial implementation started by 03/31/2007. 65 WUA formed and active
                                    Achievement: 16 IWEMPs, 160% of target, were completed and acceptance review passed by CMPO in 2010/11.
                                    Implementation of core parts of the IWEMPs (consumption control) had commenced by due dates. A total of 407
                                    WUAs, 526% of target, were established greatly exceeding the target.
                                    Comment: Completion of IWEMPs were caused by delays in KM and ET projects as well as the time required for
                                    project staff to fully understand the project‟s new concepts and approaches. Consumption control using water balance
                                    approaches were used in earlier versions when the delays in ET and KM projects became apparent. This information
                                    was used to educate officials effectively so that later implementation proceeded rapidly and smoothly.
14. Improved institutional          Qualitative Indicator:
     coordinating mechanisms for    Target: Institutional coordination mechanisms for IWEM established and functional by 12/31/2004 and updated later on
     IWEM established and           in each year, including 12 high-level Coordination Leading Groups (CLG) and 13 joint PMOs, and 13 expert groups.
     functional                     Achievement: Completed. Overall project coordination arrangements in place by due date. 16 at Pilot Counties
                                    (IWEMPs) by 2006. Coordination arrangements (CLG) included: 1 national level, 5 at Municipal/provincial (incl. HBC
                                    and ZWN) level, and 16 at county level; 5 expert groups (domestic and international), and 23 joint PMOs.
                                    Comment: The project‟s institutional coordinating mechanisms were instrumental in joint project management between
                                    the water end environment Ministries at different levels, data sharing agreements, a joint Masterplan for the Hai Basin,
                                    and use of Joint Expert Groups and project supervision. Joint management arrangements have been agreed by the
                                    Ministries to continue after project completion. Finalising arrangements in pilot Counties delayed as guidelines
                                    developed and explained to County leaders.
15. Strategic Studies:              Qualitative Indicator:
SS1: Policy and Legal Framework     Target: Strategic studies prepared and preliminary findings integrated into IWEMPs by 12/31/2006
and Institutional Arrangements      Achievement: All Strategic Studies were completed and acceptance. Appraisal passed by CMPO in early 2011
SS2: Bohai Sea Linkage              indicating the results were highly satisfactory. Results of SSs had been promoted to IWEMPs throughout the project.
SS3: Countermeasures for the        Comment: The results and achievements of the SSs are evidenced by their inclusion and impacts in IWEMPs, national
Protection and Measurement of the   policy, national laws, the State Council‟s „Number One Document‟ for 2011, the „3 red lines‟ policy and, in the
Water Ecological System             Masterplan and 12th 5YPs at the Hai Basin, Provincial and County levels.

16. SAP for Hai Basin and for          Qualitative Indicator:
      Zhangweinan sub-basin            Target: (i) Hai Basin SAP prepared by 12/31/2008; (ii) Zhangweinan SAP prepared and initial implementation has
                                       started by 12/31/2006
                                       Achievement: Completed in May 2011.
                                       Comment: These were very challenging projects technically and due to their scope and complexity. Management and
                                       technical staff and advisors required more time to understand and apply the advanced technologies and concepts (KM
                                       and ET) and this led to delays in project results. The Hai Basin SAP, in particular is a very well developed and
                                       comprehensive plan and this has fed through into the 12 5YP Masterplan for the Hai Basin.
17. Demonstration Projects:            Qualitative Indicator:
    (i) Real Water Savings             Target: Demonstration projects prepared, implementation begun, and findings integrated into IWEMPs by 12/31/2006
    (ii) Management of Water           Achievement: Completed by 2009. Project findings were extended to and included in IWEMPs throughout
          Rights and Well Permits      implementation using mechanisms such as field visits, workshops and conferences although time limited the extent that
    (iii) Control of Wastewater        this was possible
          Discharge                    Comment: Greater time than originally anticipated was required for leaders, managers and technical staff to understand
    (iv) Pollution Control and Water   and absorb the project concepts and approaches. The projects were found to have successfully demonstrated approaches
          Environmental                for real water saving and pollution control that were adopted by IWEMPs and SAPs. There is substantial opportunity to
          Improvements                 extend these results much more widely in the Hai Basin, China and internationally.

18. Policies, mechanisms, and          Target: Policies, mechanisms and instruments are defined and implemented
     instruments supporting IWEM       Achievement: Completed 2009. ET, KM and SSs results were applied to IWEMPs and SAPs and technical assistance
                                       provided
                                       Comment: Policy impacts went well beyond the original project targets through incorporation into national level
                                       policies and plans as described above.

19. Integrated Water Resource –        Qualitative Indicator:
    Water Quality Information          Target: Integrated Water Resource – Water Quality Information Management System created, tested, implemented, and




                                                                               27
     Management System                functional by 12/31/2006
                                      Achievement: Completed in 2010 and included in Hai Basin, Zhangweinan, Beijing, Tianjin and pilot Counties KM
                                      systems. A Data Sharing Agreement that included 32 hydrological stations, 75 water quality stations, and achieved the
                                      integration of Water Function Zones and Water Environment Function Zones, was signed between MWR and MEP
                                      enabling building of an integrated system. The approach was adopted and incorporated into the National Water
                                      Resources Management System and also applied elsewhere in China.
                                      Comment: Greater time than originally anticipated was required for leaders, managers and technical staff to understand
                                      and absorb the project concepts and approaches. The modelling platform developed as part of the system was used to
                                      support IWEMPs and SAPs as well as the 12th 5YP Hai Basin Masterplan. Impacts are very significant for integrated
                                      management.
20. Application Systems for the       Qualitative Indicator:
    former                            Target: Application System developed, established, and functional by 12/31/2007
                                      Achievement: Completed 2010. The system and modelling platform was used to support IWEMPs and SAPs as well as
                                      the 12th 5YP Hai Basin Masterplan.
                                      Comment: Greater time than originally anticipated was required for leaders, managers and technical staff to understand
                                      and absorb the project concepts and approaches.
21. ET Management System              Qualitative Indicator:
                                      Target: ET Management System established, tested, and functional by 12/31/2006
                                      Achievement: Completed 2009. The management and visualisation system as included in the KM is well developed,
                                      however the ET measurement technology and link to a permitting system is still under development and verification.
                                      Comment: This project was very ambitious as it aimed to apply innovative technology which was still under
                                      development. The extent of further development, testing and verification required was more than anticipated. The
                                      project has received considerable attention and interest within China and from academic institutions. It has been
                                      instrumental in changing the water control paradigm from one of water supply, and then volume demand management to
                                      one of consumption control and management. The technology has been used in other parts of China and the underlying
                                      R&D has also received national level financial support. The concept should be applied across all Counties within the
                                      Hai Basin to set water consumption quotas and where verified supported by the RS-ET technological system.
22. Mechanisms for the                Qualitative Indicator:

    after the Projects finalization   ET centre established.
                                      Achievement: Completed in 2010; development of technology delayed (PI 20); 2 ET centres established. The ET
                                      concept has been well extended to project institutions at all levels as well as more widely throughout China.
                                      Comment: The mechanism for continuation is in place including through government policy and a sustainable funding
                                      basis at the Hai Basin Commission level for the KM centre. The Beijing Municipality has also implemented a Municipal
                                      level ET Centre and system.

                                      Achievement: Completed and functioning effectively from 2004. Achievement of Target: Highly Satisfactory
                                      Comment: The joint expert groups and international panel were implemented from the start of the project and they have
                                      contributed significantly to the success of the project.
28. Conduct Training, Workshops       Qualitative Indicator:
    and Study Tours                   Target: Training, Workshops, and Study Tours included in annual training plans and carried out accordingly.
                                      Achievement: Completed at all levels. A total of 164 training sessions, 9 internationally led sessions, 155 domestic




                                                                            29
                                 sessions, 57 study tours (43 domestic and 14 international) were conducted.
                                 Comment: Exchange between project components and locations implemented effectively using guideline and standards
                                 development, training courses, field trips, workshops, domestic and international conferences etc
29. Monitoring and Evaluation,   Qualitative Indicator:
    specifically of IWEMPs and   Target: Project-wide Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system in place by 12/31/2004
    Demonstration Projects       Achievement: Completed. A comprehensive M&E system was developed and maintained under complex circumstances
                                 due to the number of PMOs and number of projects many with significantly different characteristics. The system was
                                 used to monitor progress, reporting to Bank supervision missions, and, for annual, MTR and ICR reporting.
                                 Comment: Development of and M&E system for such a complex and for such a decentralised project would have been
                                 very challenging and took some time for the project staff to understand the advanced concepts and approaches. The
                                 M&E system that was developed was comprehensive and effective in dealing with all aspects and components of the
                                 project. It was significant in supporting the ICR.
                                 Qualitative Indicator:
                                 Target: Management Information System (MIS) operational by 9/30/2004
                                 Achievement: MIS operational and decentralised to all PMOs and used to conduct project finance and procurement
                                 planning, monitoring, and reporting. The system continued to be strengthened and updated during the project.
                                 Comment: The system was well developed with the assistance of the Bank

                            Annex 3. Incremental Cost Analysis

Introduction

1.       The project has successfully achievement its PDOs the expected outcomes as contained
in PAD and described in this ICR. This forms the basis for the updated incremental cost analysis
which, by and large follows the rationale and methodology adopted in the PAD and updates the
incremental costs with actual disbursements. It should be noted that the calculation of the project
costs for the baseline scenario is very conservative (see Section on Baseline scenario below).

Background and Broad Development Goals

2.       Background: The Hai Basin is home to over 120 million people. It is spread over four
provinces and the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin and accounts for some 15 percent of
China‟s GDP. The Project area is one of China‟s most important river basins, industrial and
agricultural regions. Water has played a pivotal role in the development of the Basin, and
sustainable development is heavily dependent on water resource management. Like many other
areas in China, the Hai Basin is facing serious water-related problems, including water pollution,
water scarcity, diminishing water supplies and flooding. Over-exploitation of groundwater,
estimated by some to be 9 billion cubic meters annually, overuse of surface water resulting in
inadequate environmental flows, along with increasing groundwater and surface water pollution,
are contributing to the decline and deterioration of water resources and damaging the freshwater
and coastal environments of the Hai Basin. Present water use patterns in the Hai Basin are not
sustainable and continued rapid economic growth is jeopardized. The Basin discharges into the
Bohai Sea and is a major contributor to pollutant loadings. The sea, international water, is an
important eco-system and fishery resource, reflecting its role as a seasonal spawning and nursery
ground for the larger and more productive Yellow Sea. However, heavy land-based pollution
from urban, industrial, agricultural, and other sources in the Hai Basin, combined with over-
fishing, reduction of freshwater inflows, and habitat loss, threatens the fishery and steadily
diminishes many of the Bohai Sea‟s eco-system functions.

3.      Strategic Goals: The Chinese government‟s long term social and economic plans
(embodied by its five year plans) for the Hai Basin aim to improve water resource management
and to restore the environment and Bohai Sea– notably through pollution control measures.
Specific measures include greater efficiency in water use, water diversions from the Yellow River
to the Hai Basin, and improved flood control measures. While these initiatives are vital, they
address problems of immediate concern and insufficiently address longer-term challenges. The
south north transfer of water from the Yangtze River to northern China including the Hai Basin is
a more long-term solution, but will still be inadequate to meet demands without performing the
most strict water resources management systems.

Baseline Scenario

4.       By definition, this scenario comprises previously agreed plans and initiatives of the
Chinese Government to address water related problems at national and local levels. It reflects the
likely situation concerning the Hai Basin and Bohai Sea in the absence of GEF support. It
includes the various national programs and more detailed investment programs, generally
formulated by sector management agencies and local governments, to implement the national
plans.


                                                31
5.      The PAD Incremental cost analysis (Annex 4 of PAD) provided a long list of national
plans and regional programs/project, among others, including the following programs and
projects:

National Plans

   10th National Five Year Plan (2000-2005): Emphasized the need for sustainable
    management and use of water resources, especially intensifying agricultural water-saving
    and wastewater reuse efforts. (Planned Investment: US$ 30.5 billion)
   China Trans-Century Green Program: Emphasized construction of urban environmental
    infrastructure. The Program has three phases, spanning 15 years. Formulated through joint
    efforts of SEPA, The State Development Reform Commission (SDRC), and the State
    Economic and Trade Commission, it is an umbrella program for all pollution control
    initiatives in China, including water pollution control of the Hai Basin. (Planned Investment:
    component of National Five Year Plan)
   The South-North Water Transfer Project (SNWT Project): This, at the time, proposed Project
    was to address the serious water scarcity problems in North China, including the Hai Basin.
    The intention was to transfer 20 bcm water from the Yangtze River system to North China.
    (Planned Investment: US$10-15 billion)
   Bohai Blue Sea Action Plan: The plan sought to influence urban development, the economic
    structure, and the adoption of clean production technologies. High priority is given to the
    control and prevention of land-based pollution. The intention is to invest in new and improve
    existing sewage treatment plants, recycling and reuse of waste, and the adoption of various
    “clean? technologies. (Planned Investment:US$7.2 billion)
   Water Pollution Prevention Program of Hai Basin: The Program endeavored to ensure that
    all industries abide by national discharge standards and improve water quality. (Planned
    Investment: US$5.3 billion for water pollution control)
   Hai Basin Comprehensive Management Plan: The Plan incorporated flood control, water
    resource management, and soil and water conservation. (Planned Investment: US$1.5
    billion)
   National Irrigated Agriculture Water-Saving Program: The Program endeavored to
    rehabilitate irrigation systems and improve irrigation technologies in 300 counties, identified
    as demonstration sites. (Planned Investment: US$5.2 billion)

Beijing Municipality

   Plan for Sustainable Use of Water Resources in the Capital in the 21st Century (2001-2005):
    It focused on the development and protection of water resources. By 2005, Beijing
    Municipality planned to achieve water savings of 790 million cbm, reuse 645 million cbm of
    treated wastewater, supply 150 cbm of water from rain and flood sources, achieve a
    groundwater balance in the city, and ensure that the water quality of the city suburbs reaches
    national standards. (Planned Investment: US$3 billion)

Tianjin Municipality

   Hai Basin Tianjin Municipality Wastewater Treatment Project: The Project would complete
    the Municipality‟s 1958 Sewerage and Drainage Master Plan, which designates six drainage
    zones, a WWTP in each zone, and separate sanitary and storm sewers. (Planned Investment:
    US$274 million)


                                                32
Hebei Province

    The Hebei Provincial Government outlined an ambitious environment protection plan for
     the province up to the year 2010 to be implemented in three phases. The plan was
     consistent with national environmental plans including the Trans-century Green
     Engineering Plan and the Hai River Pollution Control and Prevention Plan, which are
     mentioned above. (Planned Investment: TBD)

Related Projects financed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank

    Water Conservation Project
    2nd Tianjin Urban Environment Project
    2nd Beijing Urban Environment Project
    FY01 Hebei Urban Environment Project
    Agenda for Water Sector Strategy for North China
    Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and Water Resources Protection Project
    Coastal Resource Conservation and Environment Management Project for the Bohai Sea

6.      It has to be taken into account, however, that these national plans are highly ambitious
and are sometimes not fully realized. Related activities are often carried through to the next
planning period and tend to be large scale investments, leaving out the medium to small scale
investment level. Another important issue is the institutional fragmentation of water resource
management as it involved amongst others, the following agencies: the Ministry of Water
Resources (MWR), the State Environment Protection Administration (SEPA), the Ministry of
Construction (MOC) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Each agency has its own planning
process, frequently leading to overlapping and/or inconsistent plans and programs.

7.      All these investments were large and may not all directly contribute to the Project
objectives of moving towards integrated water resources management in the Hai Basin and small
city and suburban wastewater treatment. Even for those water treatment projects undertaken in
the counties and peri-urban areas (in the same GEF project areas) by the local governments,
which are directly linked to the small cities water treatment support component, the estimated
investment reached some US$ 7 billion. For the purpose of the incremental cost analysis of the
PAD, it was decided to only include in the Baseline Scenario those investments related to the
closely-linked TUDEP2 and Water Conservation Project (WCP) that would contribute to the
Project objective of integrated water and environment management. In this regard, using data
from TUDEP2 and WCP, the total cost of the Baseline Scenario was estimated in the PAD at
US$206.95 million, including Government of China expenditures of US$118.72 million and
IBRD financing of US$88.23 million1. The analysis for ICR takes the same approach to defining
baseline scenario costs although these are obviously too conservative but readily quantifiable and
practical.

 The Baseline Scenario included all the costs of WCP and only the costs of Water Reuse and Institutional
Development components of TUDEP2.

Global Environmental Objectives

8.       Success in managing the Hai Basin and restoring and protecting the environment of the
Bohai Sea is of global importance, because the trans-boundary effects of water pollution are
severe. The Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea are connected, forming a
continuous circulation system. The Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea are a single large marine
ecosystem and interdependent fishery. Approximately 600 million people live in the basins that
drain into the Yellow Sea and many depend on it as a source of livelihood. Damage to the Bohai
Sea‟s function as a nursery area for fish and shellfish stocks damages the resource wealth of the
Yellow Sea. The implications are even more widespread, for pollution of the Bohai Sea
ultimately affects the East China Sea.

9.       The deterioration of the water resources in the Hai Basin is severely impacting the quality
of life of millions of people in a river basin with major population, industrial production and
agriculture production. Water pollution and water scarcity impact on agricultural production and
human and environmental health. Deterioration of the environment is also hampering poverty
reduction, the most seriously impacted are often the most vulnerable.

10.     The GEF Alternative Project will assist China to significantly improve its water resource
management practices. From a global perspective, this improvement would result in the following
benefits:
  It would help improve the Bohai Sea environment, contributing thereby to maintaining
    fishery stocks and biodiversity of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea more generally;
  Poverty reduction enhances social stability which, if not addressed, has national and
    potential international implications;
  An integrated approach to water resources management in the Hai Basin would provide a
    model for wider application in China;
  Success in China would encourage other developing countries to draw upon the lessons
    learned.

GEF Alternative

11.     The GEF Program for the Hai Basin and Bohai Sea encouraged a more comprehensive
integrated water resource management approach. As mentioned in the Base Scenario, water
resource management involves amongst others, the following agencies: MWR, MEP, MOC and
the MOA. Each agency has its own planning process, frequently leading to overlapping and/or
inconsistent plans and programs.

12.      The GEF program helped to give direction to and ensure that various plans of the
agencies involved in the Hai Basin were coordinated and properly integrated. The central focus of
the GEF alternative was to support the formulation of Integrated Water Resource and
Environmental Management Plans (IWEMPs) in pilot counties and at the sub-basin and basin
levels. Attempts to improve water resources management in China have been very top down, with
strong laws, policies, regulations and large investments, but with insufficient bottom up
implementation at the grass roots level. The purpose of the IWEMPs was to address integrated
planning and to implement practical bottom up actions that translate top down initiatives into
bottom up results. The IWEMPs developed under the GEF program included water user
participation and local government ownership in the development of plans that address:




                                                34
   i.   Water quality management aspects, concentrating on point and non-point sources of
        pollution through the implementation of discharge controls, industrial restructuring to
        clean industries, wastewater treatment in small cities, industrial wastewater treatment,
        and agricultural and livestock production related pollution controls,
  ii.   Reuse of treated wastewater,
 iii.   Improvements in water use efficiencies that result in “real? water savings by reducing
        non-recoverable losses particularly ET,
 iv.    Implementation of effective water rights and well permit systems,
  v.    Increasing water pricing combined with volumetric measurement,
 vi.    Conjunctive use of surface run-off and groundwater, and
vii.    Ecological restoration.

13.      In addition, Demonstration Projects were implemented in selected counties to deepen
experience in key complicated areas including: (i) “real? water savings, (ii) administration of
water rights and well permits, (iii) pollution control, and (iv) ecological restoration. Strategic
Studies at the basin level were to address important basin policies, programs and approaches in
order to ensure adequate government support to the lower levels for planning and implementation
of the IWEMPs and demonstration projects. Lessons learned from the pilot counties and
demonstration areas were to be shared with other counties throughout the Hai Basin and
elsewhere in China. An integrated approach was also to lead to a better understanding of
important surface/subsurface and water quality interactions, and facilitate new management
techniques.

14.      Without GEF support, integrated water resource management at the county level would
have been unlikely to be achieved because of the already mentioned difficulties in inter-
jurisdictional and inter-administrative cooperation, and inadequate programs to implement
government policies at the grass roots level. Each agency has its own programs with generally
ineffective bottom up implementation, inadequate coordination, and little vertical and horizontal
integration of activities. Water resource management involves many agencies. While the MWR
has the primary responsibility for overall management of the nation‟s water resources and SEPA
has overall responsibility for pollution control; there are considerable overlapping jurisdictional
problems between these agencies and with other ministries and agencies concerning: urban water
supply, water pollution control, groundwater management, and irrigated agriculture. MWR‟s and
SEPA‟s management role is further limited by the increasing powers of provinces following the
decentralization process. The GEF Program has provided a powerful demonstration effect and an
incentive to break through institutional barriers.

15.      The Project also included an integrated program to improve basin-wide measurement,
monitoring, modeling, and data sharing that greatly enhanced water resources management. River
reach files with a common coding system have been developed and implemented and this allows
the sharing of information that will satisfy both SEPA and MWR needs, as well as the lower-level
needs at the county level. Applications have also been developed that support the needs of
integrated water resources management for the different entities. These activities under the
Project are referred to as Knowledge Management (KM). KM improvements are needed because
an adequate system of data collection and analysis is critical to integrated water resources
management.

16.     Monitoring is another serious problem in the Hai Basin. Without effective monitoring
and enforcement, it is impossible to have an adequate system of water rights administration or
volumetric pricing.



                                                35
17.      This is the first GEF initiative of this kind. A further global benefit, therefore, is the
important demonstration effect of solving problems related to water resources through adopting a
comprehensive integrated management approach for a globally important river basin. The Project
helped to provide the management framework for integrated water resources management, which
is indispensable for a long-term sustainable approach to water use in the Hai Basin and to
reducing pollution into the Bohai Sea.

18.      Although government policy calls for an integrated framework, experience has shown
that inter jurisdictional, and inter-administrative cooperation often proves difficult. The GEF
grant has provided an incentive to break through institutional barriers and it should provide a
powerful demonstration effect.

19.      The rationale for GEF involvement was that, without support, the Government tended to
focus on measures that are visible and with immediate effect, and thus geared towards investment
in infrastructure rather than management activities and research (see baseline scenario). The
Government and research institutes would need to improve practical experience in designing
integrated water resources management instruments resulting in sustainable use of water
resources and environmental protection/restoration. The international expertise that accompanies
GEF Projects would provide Chinese authorities with a broad range of management experiences
and instruments to draw on.

20.     In addition to the global benefits described above, the Project also generated significant
supplementary benefits for China. The IWEMPs formulated under the Program enabled
government agencies at various levels to better manage and use water resources in the Hai Basin.
The improved knowledge management system, including ET management for the Hai Basin,
helped government agencies formulate efficient and sustainable water resources policies and
ensured effective enforcement of water pollution regulations and laws. These benefits are not in
the baseline scenario because of inadequacy of financing and institutional capacity limitations.
ET management using remote sensing is a principal innovative and international cutting edge
approach being introduced under the Hai Basin Project. The key to sustainable water quantity
management in the Hai Basin is to reduce present amounts of ET to sustainable levels, and the
Project provided a practical and feasible approach for achieving this objective. Eventually
reducing ET to sustainable levels will result in stabilization of groundwater systems and the long-
term provision of water for environmental purposes including delivery of fresh water to the Bohai
Sea.

21.      The wastewater management for small cities and industries along the coastal area
(component 3) directly addressed GEF‟s Operational Program #10 by demonstrating ways to
reduce land based-sources of marine pollution, in this case to the Bohai Sea. China presently pays
very little attention to small cities and suburban industrial pollution, concentrating almost
exclusively on pollution control in large urban areas.

22.     The Project leveraged GEF funds by supporting infrastructure investments in small cities
and suburban areas financed under the World Bank-financed Tianjin Urban Environment and
Development Project (TUDEP2). In addition this component supported cleanup of the Dagu
Canal system which has served as the main wastewater canal for Tianjin City for four decades
and which discharges directly into the Bohai Sea. China has many of these large sewerage
discharge canals that need to be renovated and the Project will provide a demonstration on
technically and environmentally sound approaches for this.




                                                36
23.     Success of this component provided powerful demonstrations of how to begin to address
these huge and presently largely un-addressed pollution problems.

24.      Although the scope of the proposed GEF Program is small compared to the enormity of
reducing pollution of the Bohai Sea, it provided important demonstration effects. It supported
technical assistance to control pollution from secondary cities, and suburban and rural areas,
which account for more than half the pollution loadings entering the Bohai Sea. The global
benefit, therefore, will be laying the groundwork for substantial reduction of pollution of the
Bohai Sea and an improved marine environment. This, in turn, will contribute to sustainable
management of the Bohai Sea and maintaining fish stocks and the biodiversity of the Yellow Sea
and East China Sea.

Related GEF Projects

25.      The GEF Project builds upon, fills in gaps, and complements other related initiatives in
the region that are supported by GEF. By contributing to improvement of the Bohai Sea
environment, the Program addresses an important missing link in the China/GEF relationship.
China is a participating state in two GEF/UNDP Projects for improvement of the Bohai Sea
environment: “Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia?
(PEMSEA); and “Reducing Environmental Stress in the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem?
(YSLME). The proposed GEF alternative also complements initiatives supported by other
international agencies.

26.      The PEMSEA Project is designed to assist the East Asia Sea Region to collectively
protect and manage the coastal and marine environment through intergovernmental and inter-
sectoral partnerships. It involves ten countries in Asia, including China. A key element is to
facilitate development of institutional capacity, management strategies and action plans to deal
with land-based pollution. The Bohai Sea is identified as a sub-regional sea under stress and a
pollution “hot spot?. A demonstration site has been established to reduce waste discharges and to
address environmental problems common to adjacent provinces and municipalities. The GEF
Program for the Hai Basin and Bohai Sea complements the PEMSEA Project in two important
ways:

       It will contribute to PEMSEA‟s objective to control land-based sources of pollution of
        the Bohai Sea;

       It will complement PEMSEA‟s efforts to establish inter-jurisdictional coordinating
        mechanisms to address environmental issues in the Bohai Sea by promoting integrated
        water resource management in the Hai Basin.

27.       The YSLME Project is a regional effort involving China and the Republic of Korea to
formulate and implement a regional Strategic Action Program (SAP). The Democratic People‟s
Republic of Korea has also been invited to participate in the Project, although it has so far
declined formal involvement. The long-term objective of the Project is ecosystem-based, by
supporting environmentally-sustainable management and use of the Yellow Sea. As mentioned
earlier, the Bohai Sea is critical to maintaining the fish stocks and biodiversity of the Yellow Sea.
The Hai, Liao, and Yellow Rivers have important effects on salinity in the western Yellow Sea.
Therefore, the SAP must involve the Bohai Sea and the Hai Basin. The proposed GEF alternative
will contribute to YSLME Project‟s long-term objective and support the formulation and
implementation of the SAP.



                                                 37
Incremental Costs Matrix

28.       As discussed in the Baseline Scenario section above, the Government of China has plans
or is in the process of implementing huge investments that will result in improvements in water
quantity and water quality conditions in the Hai Basin with consequent improvements to the
Bohai Sea.

29.      All these investments were enormous and may not all directly contribute to the Project
objectives of moving towards integrated water resources management in the Hai Basin and small
city and suburban wastewater treatment. Even for those water treatment projects undertaken in
the counties and peri-urban areas (in the same GEF project areas) by the local governments,
which are directly linked to the small cities water treatment support component, the estimated
investment reached some US$ 7 billion. For the purpose of the incremental cost analysis, at PAD
it was decided to only include in the Baseline Scenario those investments related to the closely-
linked TUDEP2 and Water Conservation Project (WCP), that would contribute to the Project
objective of integrated water and environment management. In this regard, using data from
TUDEP2 and WCP, the total cost of the Baseline Scenario was estimated in PAD at US$206.95
million, including Government of China expenditures of US$118.72 million and IBRD financing
of US$88.23 million1. At ICR, the analysis takes a same approach to defining baseline scenario
costs, which is obviously too conservative but readily quantifiable and practical.

30.      For the GEF Alternative, the total cost is composed of baseline scenario costs
(US$ 206.95 million), plus incremental costs US$ 132.59 ( including US$34.34 million for this
GEF project total costs2 and US$98.25 million from TUDEP2 for The Dagu Canal
Rehabilitation and Suburban Sewerage components of TUDEP2, as its successful implementation
was dependent upon the GEF Project implementation). The table below shows the incremental
cost distribution according to Project component.

  The Baseline Scenario included all the costs of WCP and only the costs of Water Reuse and Institutional
Development components of TUDEPII.

                            Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Seven project villages from Beijing and Tianin Municipalities and Hebei Province were examined
using Participatory Impact Assessment methodology at project completion. The surveyed
villages were selected from different project counties and involved, as far as possible, different
conditions such as irrigation infrastructure, irrigation management or project features (such as
community driven development or CDD/WUA pilot, Demonstration WUA, Extension/ordinary
WUA, etc.). The results of the sessions from the surveyed villages are summarized in Table 1.
The results are:

The participatory establishment and development of WUAs. No concrete guidance such as an
operational manual on participatory development of WUAs was provided by the project however,
Beijing and Tianjin PMOs developed some high quality approaches. In Hebei Province, CDD
pilots were mostly promoted through the establishment and operation of WUAs. Relevant
concrete objectives, methodologies and framework were designed and WUA development was
participative. These pilots provided a demonstration of the process and functions for the project
areas of Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities. Participative, WUAs were strongly supported by
local government.

Activities conducted by the project or the duties and responsibilities of WUAs. Project
beneficiaries through WUAs conducted many activities which benefited their livelihoods and
water management. Activities and benefits varied between WUA and there was sharing of
experiences between them. Beneficial activities conducted included:
    Establishment of the WUA organization, and selection of water managers/heads. Women
     were active members of all WUAs surveyed;
    Establishment and use of water use regulations and procedures in the WUA, including water
     allocations, fund raising and collection of water charges and electricity fees, record keeping
     of agricultural and household water use, and, systems of reward for efficient water use and
     penalties for overuse;
    Provision of household, metered supply of good quality water;
    Transformation or improvement of the irrigation infrastructure;
    Formulation and changes of the water saving and cropping patterns including agronomic
     practices, unifying households land holdings to improve productivity and efficiency. In
     Guantao County, wheat was reduced from 2,000 mu in 2001 when the WUA was established
     to 1,100 mu in 2005; while cotton increased from 300 mu up to 1,200 mu during the same
     period. Drought resistant and high-yield wheat varieties were adopted requiring 1 – 2
     irrigations compared to the 4 irrigation required previously;
    Maintenance of the relevant water control equipment;
    Raising villager awareness of water saving and water environment protection.

Outcomes, impacts and changes brought about by the project. Impacts of the project on WUAs
and farmer water users in Beijing and Tianjin include:
     Water use quota‟s have been much reduced for example in Beiguo village it was 570,000
      m3in 1999 and in 2010 1it was adjusted to 350,000 m3. However cropping adjustments and
      water savings have more than compensated for this.



                                                         44
    Farmer‟s demand for irrigation water has been met, their time and labor inputs reduced, costs
     of water and electricity use reduced, cropping patterns adjusted, size of animal raising
     enlarged, the benefit or income from water use increased, etc. Their demand for safe
     drinking water had been met at the same time.
    The time, labor, electricity and water for irrigation have been greatly saved.
    As a result of improved infrastructure and management, the area of irrigated crops and
     proportion of cash crops, use of water saving crops and varieties, yields, water productivity
     and incomes have all increased. For example income has increased from 100 – 110 yuan/day
     plus the meals to more than 80,000 yuan/yr. Labor hours for irrigation have also been
     reduced by around 35%.
    The waste of irrigation and water-for-life has been reduced. For example, Duli Village
     reduced the use of well-pumped groundwater with the construction of a reservoir that
     enabled substitution of the deep drainage from surplus rainfall with storage of the water.
     This reduced the proportion of irrigation water use from 40% to less than 10%. Water usage
     in Zhanglan village was reduced by 20-30% per annum after water supply was piped and
     power costs reduced by 25% by replacing warn out pumps. The replacement of earthen
     channels with pipes has reduced the time for 1 irrigation cycle from 20-30 days to 7 days.
    The problem and difficulty of collecting water charges has been resolved through metering
     in particular, so that now this new system of irrigation management is financially sustainable.
    Accessing funds for large scale infrastructure repairs or replacement became feasible through
     negotiation and making financing arrangements with village collectives.
    Women contribute greatly to family‟s livelihoods and community development. Prior to the
     water management changes, three people were needed for irrigation, including at elat one
     man. Now one woman can manage irrigation so that men can work in non-farm activities to
     earn money. WUA also require that women occupy more than 1/3 of places,
    Elimination of the conflicts and disputes between users and between village leaders and
     villagers. As a result, the relationships have improved and, in particular, the rights and
     demand of the marginalized groups for water use has been satisfied.
    Falling levels of groundwater of the last 30 years have been mostly reversed, ceased or in a
     few cases much reduced.
    The skills development of the people involved in WUAs is having wider and beneficial
     society impacts. It is also resulting in decision makers with water management backgrounds
     who appreciate the importance of water and of its good management. Recent village level
     elections have resulted in many (about 600 of 10,000) water management agents being
     elected to Village Committees.

Remaining problems and the needs or countermeasures proposed by the participants. The
survey results indicated good progress but that WUAs still faced some difficulties from WUA to
WUA. These include a need to:
        Continue to strengthen the WUA approach to water allocation, water planning, metering,
         water fee collection, cropping pattern adjustment, and water saving measures.
        Allow local flexibility and decision making in deciding cropping patterns within the
         overall water allocation so that higher water efficiency varieties of wheat and maize,
         which have low labor requirements, can be used as this would also assist opportunities
         for higher income, off-farm work.



                                                 45
       Involve water bureaus and township governments in ratifying the selection of water
        agents to reduce the negative impacts and loss of continuity that can result when village
        committees are changed.
       Strengthen the management of water pollution by industry so that agricultural water is
        not polluted.

    Recommendations on WUA/CDD Development in the Project Areas
Based on the findings from the beneficiary survey, the following suggestions are proposed:
a) With the design of Phase II GEF project or other relevant project, WUA development should
   have its own objectives, expected outputs, activities and verifiable indicators, to implement
   the IWEM concepts, technologies and plans at the grassroots community level.
b) Strengthen the participatory approach to WUA establishment, operation and development,
   and adopt the more participative CDD approach in key areas, so that farmer water users exert
   their rights of participation and of being informed, having expression, and involvement in
   supervision, etc.
c) CDD/WUA pilots and demonstration project results need to be conducted or further
   improved, and then disseminated. The organizational framework and operation rules/norms
   need to be adapted to the newly revised „Villagers‟ Committee Organization Law‟. This
   would accelerate mainstreaming of the WUA and CDD approach.
d) A follow-up project should further clarify the mechanism and verifiable indicators to
   guarantee the participation and ensuring marginalized groups such as low-income households,
   women, etc. It should also establish a Complaints Handling Mechanism (CHM), advocated
   by the Bank in recent years, and also an important part of social management reform and
   innovation requested by the Central Authority in China.

                          Borrower’s Comments1 on the Bank’s Draft ICR
                GEF Hai Basin Integrated Water and Environment Management Project
                                        (December 23, 2011)


Dear Mr. Paul Kriss,

On November 15, 2011, we were honored to receive the draft ICR prepared by the World Bank
for GEF Hai Basin Integrated Water and Environment Management Project. We are quite pleased
about the positive comments by the Bank on the achievements (project objectives, outputs and
outcomes) made during the project implementation.

During the past about seven years, the project has always committed to improvement of the Hai
Basin integrated water resources and environment planning and management as the goal, and
capacity building of water resources and environment knowledge management and project
implementation, and played a proactive role to ensure sustainable social and economic
development in the Hai Basin. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the related
implementing agencies for their excellent cooperation and our sincere appreciation for the
arduous efforts made by the project staff to make this project a success. We also would like to
express our warmest congratulations on the fruitful outcomes achieved by this project.

Among many important aspects of the project in promoting integrated water and environment
management including inter-departmental cooperation mechanism, advanced concept in
integrated river basin management, knowledge management system, strategic studies, action plan
and demonstration projects, we think that the project has achieved most fruitful outcomes as
follows:

Based on the actual conditions of the Hai Basin, the project has provided an approach for overall
control of total consumptive use of water and of maximum pollution load discharge at the basin
level, which closely links to control of water use and pollution discharge at the water user level.
First, through introduction of remote sensing technology on measuring ET value in Hai Basin and
of the concept of controlling consumptive use of water, the project has developed ET-based water
management tool which actually provided an effective measure to control the water use for
irrigated agriculture. Second, it has provided policy recommendations for industrial and
agricultural pollution control in Hai Basin based on the demonstration and research results on
point and non-point source pollution prevention. To make the approach work, the project has also
developed a knowledge management (KM) system platform. The platform helps the government
departments on water resources development and utilization and environment protection to
achieve the data sharing not only for water quality but also quantity, and effectively carry out the
integrated water resources and water environment management in the Hai Basin.

The project has established a joint decision-making conference system on integrated water
resources and environment management between the water conservancy and environmental
protection departments, signed and implemented a data sharing agreement in Hai River Basin,
and built a cooperation mechanism in all levels of water resources and environmental protection
departments, which are jointly participated in the integrated water resources and water
environment management. With the integrated approach for water resources management of
"bottom-up, top-down" and "horizontal-vertical integration", the water resources management
departments, water pollution control departments and stakeholders jointly participated in the
integrated water resources and environment management as promoted by this project. In addition,
it has developed Water Users Association (WUA) and community-lead Drive Development
(CDD) code to promote the establishing of grassroots water management system.

The successful experiences in implementation of the project has provided new ideas on
improving integrated water resources and environment management and innovating water
resources management mode. It can be an effective reference for many water shortage countries.
Therefore, this project has a great popularizing significance.

We wish to thank the World Bank ICR mission and GEF Hai Basin executive organization
closely cooperation and World Bank staff, related experts, especially task team leader Mr.
Douglas Olson and Mr. Jiang Liping for the great assistance as partners during the 7 years of
project implementation.

We look forward to developing further close cooperation with the World Bank on the following
projects.
