2.      The Project has been performing satisfactorily for the past year. In July 2011, a
chronograph of activities was established in order to allocate vast resources in a short
time-frame allowing for the significant improvement in commitments. The Project has
disbursed to date USD 14,671,066, representing more than 73% of the total loan amount.

3.       The proposed reallocation is necessary to shift proceeds of the Loan across
categories of expenditure as presented in detail in Table No.1. The proposed reallocation
will shift US$400,000 from the unallocated category of Expenditures to Part C.1 of the
Project in order to adequately finance the Justice Services Map implemented under the
Ministry of Justice and Law. The Justice Services Map allows citizens to access, via the
web, a directory of geo-referenced judicial institutions in order to locate the closest
institution to initiate the procedures required to enforce users’ rights. In order to improve
the usefulness of the Justice Services Map, by making the system’s information more
user-friendly and ensuring that the information contained therein is current and addresses
the different queries of citizenship, it is necessary to carry out a process of updating the
portal’s information system (legal and contact), as well as its graphic design to align it
with the image of the Ministry of Justice and Law and the provisions of the “Online
Government?.

4.       The remaining non-assigned amounts totaling US$2,490,000 will be reallocated
to Category 1 in order to finance activities focused on carrying out an “e-justice?
initiative in the civil and commercial courts of Colombia’s six main cities (Barranquilla,
Bogota, Bucaramanga, Cali, Cartagena and Medellin). The goal of this initiative is to
diminish the delay in the resolution of certain types of cases, such as, debt cases where
there is no opposition of the debtor and the plaintiff is a bank or other financial
corporation. The reallocated amounts will also be used for initiatives related to the
creation of the electronic file (“e-file?) in the labor, civil and family courts. Due to their
nature, these activities will require a considerable investment in technological equipment
to allow the Judicial Branch to improve the organization of their archives by improving
the search process of files, as well as to significantly reduce the space required for
archiving facilities. Finally, a minimal amount of the resources reallocated to Category 1
will be used to complete the funding of other activities that are currently under execution.
