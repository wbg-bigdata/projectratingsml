INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION & DEVELOPMENT
REPORT & RECOMMENDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO SOCIETE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT DE L'INFRASTRUCTURE DES CHANTIERS MARITIMES
DU PORT DE DAKAR (DAKARMARINE) WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A SHIP REPAIR ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Societe Pour le Developpement de l'Infrastructure des Chantiers Maritimes
du Port de Dakar (Dakarmarine) with the guarantee of the Republic of Senegal
for the equivalent of US$0.6 million to help finance studies and engineering
for a tanker repair project. The loan would have a term of 10 years, in-
cluding 4 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The
European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC)
would participate in financing the studies and engineering to the extent of
US$2.2 million equivalent. The proposed Bank loan would also be covered
by a reimbursement agreement from Beliard Murdoch, a private Belgian company,
on the terms described in para. 31 below.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.         A report entitled "The Current Economic Situation and Prospects
of Senegal" (R 70-113) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 10,
1970. A Bank economic mission visited Senegal in March 1972, to assess the
current economic situation and prospects. A summary of its findings was
contained in Part I of my report to the Executive Directors concerning the
Second Agriculture Credit (IDA-R73-65) dated June 7, 1973. This material
is contained in Annex I of this Report, which also contains country data
on Senegal.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
3.         The Bank Group has had 14 operations in Senegal to date.   Total
lending amounts to US$ 75 million (net of cancellations), including ten
IDA credits, three Bank loans and one blend of Bank and IDA funds. The
Bank Group is now Senegal's third largest aid donor (after France and the
European Economic Community) providing about 13 percent of Senegal's ex-
ternal capital assistance. IFC has invested US$ 3.25 million in two proj-
ects in Senegal. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of July 31, 1973 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects.
4.         Bank Group lending in Senegal began in 1966 and for the first five
years was limited to the transport and groundnut sectors. The implementation
of a railway project financed in 1966 (Credit 96-SE) was delayed, and there
were shortfalls in the railway's financial performance. However, the project



-2-
eventually succeeded in strengthening the railway authority. A loan for
the Dakar Port (Loan 493-SE) had more immediate success and helped improve
the finances and administration of the Port Authority. The Bank Group's
first operation in the rural sector was an agricultural credit project
(Loan 584-SE and Credit 140-SE) principally to assist groundnut cultiva-
tion. Initially disbursement was slow, and the Loan had to be cancelled.
However, the Government took strong action to rehabilitate the sector, and
the Credit is now almost fully disbursed. The rural sector has also ben-
efited from a 1970 project (Credit 198-SE) for construction and maintenance
of feeder roads in the groundnut basin, which has now been satisfactorily
implemented.
5.         In the following three years, Bank Group lending expanded and
diversified. In addition to follow-up operations for railways (Credit 314-SE
and Loan 835-SE), highways (Credit 366-SE) and groundnuts (Credit 404-SE),
there were several projects aimed at developing new crops and opening up new
agricultural regions - Casamance Rice Project in the South (Credit 252-SE),
Terres Neuves Project in the East (Credit 254-SE) and the River Polders Project
in the North (Credit 350--SE). Other lending comprised an Airport Project
(Loan 867-SE) to facilitate tourism development, a Credit for technical
and agricultural education (Credit 253-SE), a Telecommunications Project
(Loan 866-SE) and the Bank Group's first Site and Services Project (Credit
336-SE).
6.         In general, implementation of the more recent projects is pro-
gressing satisfactorily. In both Casamance Rice and Terres Neuves Projects
(FY71), development targets were met for the first season, though there have
been delays in the infrastructure programs and there remain several institu-
tional problems; the second season is currently under way. The Education
Project (FY71) is about nine months behind schedule, principally on account
of lengthy discussions with the Government and the consulting architects
concerning detailed designs. To avoid this problem in a second education
project, currently being appraised, the Government is planning to appoint
architects and commence work on the designs while appraisal is proceeding,
so that construction can begin shortly after approval of the credit.
7.         In the Second Railway Project (FY72) bidding was completed earlier
this year on schedule, but as only one offer was received, re-tendering is
necessary. The Site and Services Project (FY72) is not yet effective,
mainly owing to the unexpected need to pass a law, rather than a decree, to
reorganize the executing agency. However, technical assistance for the
project has been recruited and detailed engineering is proceeding only
slightly behind schedule. In the Airport Project (FY73), detailed engi-
neering has been completed, bidding documents have been approved and tendering
should be completed by December 1973. In the Telecommunications Project
(FY73), preparation of the bidding documents is proceeding on schedule. In
the River Polders Project (FY73), bidding for the irrigation works and hy-
draulic equipment representing over three quarters of expenditures chargeable
to the credit is currently taking place and contracts will be awarded
shortly.



-3-
8.         Execution of these projects, apart from the railway project, is
thus moving forward without exceptional delays. The proportion of undis-
bursed funds in Senegal is certainly high (73 percent), but this is largely
explained by the fact that over half of total lending was committed in the
last twelve months. With the most recent projects it is too early yet to
review the rate of disbursement. However, projects have generally become
more complicated and longer periods of disbursement are programmed in a
number of cases. Thus the average period of disbursement, projected at the
time of appraisal, for the four projects in FY66-70 was about three years, as
compared to an average of six years for the three agriculture and education
projects approved in FY71.
9.         As to future lending, we are continuing to explore with the
Government other avenues for diversification besides agriculture. Perhaps
the most promising of these is tourism, for which Senegal's pleasant climate
and attractive beaches are important assets. A Bank mission recently re-
vised the prospects for Senegalese tourism within the context of the overall
development of the sector in West Africa and a tourism infrastructure project
is being prepared. Other possibilities for diversification currently being
examined by the Bank include fisheries and manufacturing. In connection
with the development of the manufacturing sector, a project for a develop-
ment finance company is being prepared.
PART III: THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
10.        Modern manufacturing (including groundnut processing, light consumer
goods industries, railways and ship repair facilities) was introduced in
Senegal well before World War II. Before independence in 1960, it served all
of former French West Africa, a market of 20 million people. After indepen-
dence, and in spite of the difficulties of adjusting to a smaller market,
economic growth in Senegal has been largely attributable to the dynamic role
of the industrial sector. In 1972, this sector accounted for about 15 percent
of GDP, as compared to 8 percent in 1960, and employed about 20,000 persons,
or 14 percent of wage earners. Manufacturing accounts for about three quarters
of value added by the industrial sector, while public utilities and mining re-
present 16 and 7 percent of the total respectively. Growth in the manufactur-
ing sector is largely explained by the textile/leather and mechanical/
electrical subsectors, which accounted for almost 60 percent of the increase
in value added in this sector in the past 10 years, while foodstuffs and
chemical industries represented another 25 percent of the total increase.
Whereas industrial production was mainly oriented to import substitution in
the first part of the 1960's, growth of exports largely contributed to the
increase in industrial output in the latter part of the 1960's. These new
markets were found for the most part within former French West Africa, al-
though some firms (textiles) have proved to be competitive in the markets of
developed countries.



- 4 -
11.        This strong performance is due to the combination of a number of
factors which favored industrial growth in Senegal:   first, Senegal has a
long tradition of industrial production, and labor productivity is comparable
to Europe in the case of mechanized or repetitive industrial operations re-
quiring relatively little control; secondly, investments in manufacturing in-
creased considerably in the 1$960s, reflecting the confidence of foreign
entrepreneurs (mostly French) who control 85--90 percent of the modern indus-
trial sector; thirdly, the competitive position of Senegal was helped by a
rather slow increase in wages of about 3 percent per annum; finally, the 7966
Agreement among the countries of the West Africa Customs Union 1/ benefitted
primarily the more industrialized countries of tile Union, i.e. Senegal and
the Ivory Coast.
12.        Given limited further import substittution possibilities, the future
of industrial development in Senegal lies with exports, particularly toward
the developed countries. The development of siiip repair facilities would be
an important step in this direction. Given its favorable industrial environ.-
ment, its experience ir ship repairs and the existence of one of the best
sub-Saharan industrial labor forces in Africa, Dakar qualifies for such an
undertaking. At the same time, such a project could encourage substantial
industrial growth, through the subcontracting possibilities that ship repairs
offer and the important labor training component that would be part of this
project. Ship repair yards in developed countries subcontract 20 to 40 per-
cent of their annual sales. This subcontracting ranges over the whole area
of their work, including painting, furniture making, propeller repair, freight
handling and transport services. The repair yard also buys items such as
power, water, work clothes, fuels and lubricants. In addition to the goods
and services handled by the yard, new demands would be created for hiotel
services and food supplies. Dakar would be able to satisfy many of these
demands. Therefore such an undertaking would not only benefit the 3000 people
employed at the yard but the community as a whole.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
13.        A Loan and Project Stimmary is provided in Annex III.  Additional
information concerning the studies is given in Annex V.
14.        Dakarmarine, a corporation primarily owned by the Government of
Senegal, has requested a Bank loan of US$0.6 million equivalent to help cover
the cost of certain techrnical, miarket, and economic. studies essential to deter-
mining the feasibility of a project for the construction at Dakar of a drydock
and ship repair yard capable of handling very large tankers and bulk carriers
of up to 500,000 dead weight tons (DITr) (hereafter called "the drydock pro-
ject"). The total cost of these studies is estimated at US$3.09 million
1/   Including Dahomey, the Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal,
Upper Volta.

equivalent. In addition to the Bank loan, the financing will include an
equity contribution in Dakarmarine by the Government and the private sponsors,
a participation by Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) of France, and a
participation by the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Description of the Proposed Diydock Project
15.        The drydock project envisages a ship repair yard built around two
drydocks, one capable of handling ships of up to 500,000 DWT and the other,
ships of up to 250,000 DWT. Other facilities would include four quays for
repairs afloat, a deballasting station, breakwaters and space for a future
third dock for one million DWT capacity. The yard would also include a large
plate shop, machine shops and facilities for electrical work, enabling the yard
to handle all complex work involved in repairing VLCC's. 1/ The site to be
studied is at Thiaroye, about 15 km east of Dakar port, near an oil refinery.
The yard woulld be able to repair about 100 of these large vessels per year
and allow lesser repairs on another 400-500 ships per year. This would re-
quire about 3,000 employees, of which about 12 percent initially would be
expatriates. The estimated capital cost of the drydock project is approxi-
mately US$100 million. Further details of the drydock project are included
as Annex IV.
16.        The drydock project is aimed specifically at the repair of vessels
with a dead weight tonnage greater than 100,000 tons, principally VLCC's.
At present, vessels are afloat as large as 500.000 DWT. The growth of
these large vessels has been rapid, the first ones having been put into
service only in 1968, with the number in use today in excess of 200 vessels.
Market studies indicate that growth of VLCC's should continue rapidly wich
an estimated 600 in service by 1975.
Background
17.        In the fall of 1971 the Government of Senegal approached several
financial institutions about possible financial assistance to the drydock
project and asked the Bank to take the lead. During the spring and summer
of 1972, Bank staff carried out an intensive study, assisted by two marine
consulting firms, Shipping Consultants of Oslo, which conducted a market
survey; and Shipping Research Services, also of Oslo, which looked into the
technical and operational aspects of the drydock project. The Bank's
investigation included visits to the major ship repair yards of Europe, the
facilities of the technical sponsor, and the proposed site, as well as
discussions with marine insurance companies and large ship owners.
18.        In September 1972, the Bank advised the Senegalese Government that
the drydock project merited further study and appeared to have reasonable
prospects of success, although it entailed a relatively high degree of risk.
1/   VLCC - Technically very large crude oil carriers, but used herein to
denote all large carriers over 100,000 DWT, whether for crude oil or for
dry bulk commodities.



- 6 -
The Bank also advised that it was essential that tne drydock project have
sound technical and commercial assistance and that the technical and main
private sponsor of the project, Beliard Murdoch of Antwerp, was capable of
providing such assistance. It was recognized, however, that a substantial
increase in capital cost or a significant lowering of revenues could reduce
the project return below acceptable limits for Bank financing. The Bank
also suggested that Senegal consider enlarging the existing repair facilities
by building new facilities to service the smaller boats (up to 1,000-2,000
tons) in order to free the naval dock for ships up to 25,000 tons; this
recommendation is still under study by the Government.
19.        As to the financial arrangements for the drydock project, it had
been proposed in 1971 that a Government-financed company would construct the
drydocks, breakwaters and other infrastructure at a cost of about $80 million
and lease these facilities to a second company, owned and financed largely
by the private partners. Since, under these arrangements, the Government
would bear most of the financial risk, whereas the private partners would
get most of the profits if the project was successful, the Bank advised the
Government that the financial arrangements needed to be reconsidered, and
that the Government should explore the possibility of reducing the financial
risk to Senegal while ensuring the continuing participation of the private
sponsors. In effect, the Bank recommended that the project be set up with
a more equitable sharing of risks and benefits, including guarantees on the
part of the private sponsors for any Bank loan that might be made for the
infrastructure. At the same time, it was recognized that the competitive
nature of the business and the resulting limited financial return could
limit the Government's ability to improve the arrangements and that Senegal
would have to bear some of the risk of financing the project. For this
purpose, the Bank recommended that as much as possible of Senegal's financial
risk should be on soft terms, insofar as such finance could be obtained with-
out excessive diversion of aid from other high priority sectors. The Govern-
ment is currently exploring the availability of soft loan funds from other
aid donors. As indicated below in paragraph 24, discussions with the private
sponsors are continuing on the other financial questions.
Sponsors
1.   Dakarmarine
20.        The studies will be carried out by Dakarmarine, a corporation founded
by the Government of Senegal, to carry out the original feasibility report and
promote the project. The company is at present owned 90 percent by the Gov-
ernment of Senegal with the remaining 10 percent held by Beliard Murdoch and
the other private sponsor, Societe Commerciale d'Affretement et de Combustibles
(SCAC), a French industrial group with a subsidiary (Ateliers et Chantiers de
Dakar) now operating a small ship repair facility in Dakar.



21.        Dakarmarine is currently capitalized at CFAF 100 million (US$0.44
million equivalent), practically all of which funds were used for the original
feasibility work. To assist in financing the studies, Dakarmarine will in-
crease its share capital to CFAF 210 million (US$0.9 million), and the partici-
pation of the Senegalese Government is expected to decrease from 90 percent of
capital to about 51 percent; with the balance to be taken up by Beliard Murdoch,
SCAC, SENEMATEL (a subsidiary of Empain Schneider, a French industrial group)
FINCANTIERI (a subsidiary of the Italian group of IRI), A.G. WESER (a subsi-
diary of a German industrial group), two Senegalese banks (Union Senegalaise de
Banque and Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et l'Industrie au Senegal -
USB and BICIS) and the European Investment Bank. The existing shareholders
of Dakarmarine and the proposed new shareholders, as well as their holdings,
are shown below:

22.        To date, Dakarmarine has conducted no real activities of its own
(the original feasibility report was prepared by Beliard Murdoch and consul-
tants) and therefore has had no operating staff. Its Chairman and Chief
Executive is Mr. Issa Diop, a Senegalese with extensive administrative ex-
perience and the head of several Senegalese corporations. The technical
director responsible for the execution of the studies is an expatriate engi-
neer who has been associated with the project since its inception. The cost
of the project includes funds for the employment of one or two engineers, a
financial and accounting officer, and the necessary secretarial and accounting
staff, as well as offices and communication facilities required for coordi-
nation of the studies.
2.   Technical Advisers
23.        Beliard Murdoch will provide technical assistance for Dakarmarine
under a Technical Assistance Agreement. This firm has been in the drydock
and ship repair business over 100 years and is qualified to provide the



-8-
technical assistance necessary for the studies and the operation of the
drydock project. It will also assist Dakarmarine in the selection of the
firms to carry out the individual studies. In addition to its work in ship
repair, an affiliated company operates a ship building yard in Ostend which
specializes in large deep sea trawlers, ocean tugs and dredgers and does
industrial work for oil, chemical and electrical industries.
24.        Beliard Murdoch has a sound financial position and record;
neverthelesb, as the capital cost of the drydock project will be very substantial
(approximately US$100 million), the Bank has urged Beliard Murdoch to associate
itself with other financial or industrial firms who would be able to help
provide the financial resources and guarantees needed for the ultimate reali-
zation of the drydock project. Beliard Murdoch is currently holding dis-
cussions with several industrial and marine firms about investing in the
drydock project.
Technical and Feasibility Studies
25.        The studies to be carried out are described more fully in Annex V
and consist of two main kinds, technical and economic/commercial. The
technical studies will include borings necessary to determine the geological
and physical characteristics of the soil and the permeability of the geological
layers, a study of the water movements in the area and of the effect of sedi-
mentation on the drydock itself. As a result of these studies, the site and
dimensions of the drydock, repair yard and breakwater will be determined, as
will the navigational approaches to the yard. Preliminary civil engineering
design of the drydock, including the electro-mechanical equipment, dock gates,
haulage system, cranes, and all auxiliary services will also be prepared.
Location of the workshops and the equipment to be installed therein will be
defined and the cost and best sources of equipment determined. Various types
of construction will be reviewed to select the most appropriate and economic
choice and define a suitable construction plan.
26.        The commercial and economic studies will delineate more clearly
the viability of the drydock project so that the sponsors may finalize the
financial arrangements shortly after the studies are completed. A particular
study will be made of repalL costs for VLCC's in Europe and other locations
to determine a realistic price for such services in Dakar. Also planned are
a survey of the manpower available in Senegal to determine the appropriate
training program and training facilities needed, and an updating of the
market study with particular emphasis on coastal traffic which might use the
facilities and on the size and distribution of the world's future merchant
fleet. Finally, a detailed review would be made of other proposed drydocks
which might be competitive with Dakar and have an influence on the market for
the drydock project. If several competing drydock projects were to proceed,
a serious risk of over-capacity could arise which would greatly lessen the
chances for success of the Dakar project (see Annex IV).



- 9 -
27.        The essential geological and physical tests are to be conducted first,
followed by design of the dock and the other studies. Thus, should physical
conditions be discovered early which would render construction of the dock
at Dakar impracticable, Dakarmarine can terminate the studies and save uncom-
mitted funds. In addition, a negative result on the hydrographic and geo-
technical studies is a ground for suspending disbursement under the loan.
Dakarmarine has proposed that an engineering firm with experience in marine
matters and the design of major drydock installations be responsible for
carrying out the technical studies. It has recommended the firm of F.C. de
Weger International of Rotterdam who have experience in design of docks of
comparable size. Dakarmarine has recommended Sema International, a French
consulting firm, for carrying out the other studies which include thie comple-
tion of the feasibility study, and coordination of the market and training
studies. Dakarmarine will obtain the approval of the Bank and the other
lending institutions as to its sflection of the consultants and as to the
terms of the contracts and any subcontracts to be entered into.
Timing
28.        It is expected that the studies can be completed in a period of
about 21 months from the beginning of the technical studies. This is based
on the maximum number of borings required and the preparation of a full sedi-
mentological model. Borings at the proposed site commenced in June 1973, under
de Weger's supervision. It is proposed to permit retroactive financing up to
$25,000.
Costs
29.        Beliard Murdoch has contacted a number of firms engaged in marine
engineering with experience in the design of very large drydocks. It has
also contacted scientific laboratories and other specialized consulting firms.
As a result of these discussions, Beliard Murdoch made a preliminary estimate
of the cost of the studies at approximately CFAF 615 million (US$2.7 million).
While this figure constitutes a reasonable estimate, the lending institutions
have agreed that the financial plan should provide for CFAF 710 million
(US$3.09 million), since the number of borings necessary may need to be in-
creased and to permit some additional work which may be required on particular
studies and allow for adequate contingencies. It is expected that about 15
percent of the cost of the studies will be for local expenses, or approximately
equal to Dakarmarine's equity contribution (para. 21). Detailed information
on the cost of the individual studies is shown in Annex III.
Financial Plan
30.        The financial plan of CFAF 710 million (US$3.09 million), with the
Senegalese Government providing all funds needed over and above this amount,
is as follows:



- 10 -

CFAF      US$
Equity:   Dakarmarine                     110      0.49
Participations:      EIB                  240      1.04

Total                                     710      3.09
It is proposed that the lenders finance 100 percent of the studies and that
Dakarmarine finance, out of its equity, its operating and coordination expenses.
It is a condition of effectiveness that the equity be subscribed before any
funds are disbursed. Thereafter, the lending institutions will disburse
their funds pari passu in the ratio of EIB 40 percent; FAC 40 percent and
the Bank 20 percent.
31.        It is proposed that the Bank loan to Dakarmarine be for a period
of ten years, with repayment in equal semi-annual installments after a
grace period of four years. Ihe loan will bear interest at the standard
rate and be guaranteed by the Government of Senegal. Interest and commitment
charges would be capitalized during the first two years of the studies.
If the drydock project does not go forward, Beliard Murdoch would repay the
Bank loan on the above terms, subject to the qualification set forth in
para. 35 below. If the drydock project proceeds, it is envisaged that the
Bank loan would be refinanced as part-of the construction of the drydock
project.
32.        EIB will participate by way of an equity contribution of CFAF 30
million (US$130,000) to Dakarmarine and a contribution equivalent to
CFAF 240 million (US$1.04 million), the legal nature of which would be fixed
by agreement within 2 years between Senegal, Dakarmarine, EIB, and the European
Economic Community either as a loan on conditions to be determined, or as an
equity contribution or as some other form of participation. FAC will make a
contribution equivalent to CFAF 240 million by way of a participation, on terms
to be defined within a period of 3 years, either as a grant, or as an equity
contribution to Dakarmarine or as a long term loan. Neither EIB nor FAC has
requested a reimbursement commitment from the private sponsors.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Societe pour le
Developpement de l'Infrastructure des Chantiers Maritimes du Port de Dakar
1/   The Bank loan of US$600,000 would cover, in addition, interest and other
charges capitalized during the first two years.



(Dakarmarine), the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Senegal
and the Bank, the draft Reimbursement Agreement between the Bank and Beliard
Murdoch, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the draft Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
34.        The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions normally used for
engineering projects of the Bank. In addition, the draft Loan Agreement
provides that the effectiveness of the Bank Loan is conditional upon con-
ditions precedent to initial disbursement under the EIB and FAC participa-
tions being met.
35.        The draft Reimbursement Agreement provides, inter alia, that
the obligation of Beliard Murdoch to reimburse to the Bank amounts due under
the Loan shall terminate if and from the date that the financing of the
drydock project is contracted or if, as a result of an act or omission of
the Guarantor, it is physically impossible for Beliard Murdoch to perform
its obligations under its Technical Assistance Agreement with Dakarmarine,
or for Dakarmarine to carry out the Project, and each impossibility lasts
for not less than 120 days.
36.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
37.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

ANNEX I
Page 3
THE ECONOMY
(Part I of Report and Recommendation of the President to the Executive
Directors on a Proposed Credit to the Republic of Senegal for a Second
Agricultural Credit Project dated June 7, 1973 Report No. IDA-R73-65)
1.        A report on the current economic position and prospects of Senegal
was distritbuted to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1970 (Report AW-15a).
A Bank economic mission visited Senegal in March 1972, to assess the current
economic situation and prospects. The following paragraphs reflect the
findings of that mission. Country data are given on pages 1 and 2 of this Annex.
Economic Potential
2.        Endowed with few natural resources, Senegal has only limited possi-
bilities for economic development. Agricultural conditions are generally
poor, particularly in the groundnut basin where the bulk of the population
lives. The south and southeast offer better prospects for development of a
variety of agricultural products, but groundnuts still account for the cash
income of most of the rural population and for nearly half the country's
export earnings.
3.        Apart from agriculture, the main possibilities for economic develop-
ment are fisheries, tourism and manufacturing. Thanks to rich resources off
the coast, fish production has been growing rapidly. International tourism
to Senegal has started to develop only in recent years, but prospects for
further expansion of this sector are promising. Senegal developed its
industry earlier than other West African countries and its industrial labor
force is one of the best in Africa. However, although there are certain
definite possibilities for development of new crops and new sectors, diversifi-
cation will take a long time. The economy will continue to be affected by
the vagaries of the weather and by fluctuations in the world market price of
groundnuts.
Past Development
4.        During the early 1960's, Senegal's economy remained stagnant.    The
growth of GDP in real terms was minimal (1 percent a year) and per capita
income may have declined, though at about US$250, it is higher than in most
other African countries. Two factors were primarily responsible for this
slow growth. First, independence caused Senegal to lose its privileged posi-
tion as the center of French West Africa. This resulted in the loss of
export markets for manufactures as domestic industries developed in other
West African countries. At the same time, departure of most of the French
civilian and military personnel resulted in declining demand for services
and locally produced goods. Second, the Government was slow in attacking
the country's difficult adjustment problems. The heavy administrative
apparatus could not respond quickly to the new situation and government
policies stressed administration rather than development. The First
Development Plan (1961-64) concentrated on investments for social and
transport infrastructure, including housing, urban water supply, and admi-
nistrative buildings; investment in rural sectors accounted for less than
20 percent of total development outlays, though it included the initial organi-
zation of the country's agricultural program.



ANNEX I
Page 4
5.        The second half of the 1960's saw more energetic development policies
by the Government. There was a considerable increase in the public investment
program, made possible by substantial improvements in absorptive capacity
of the public sector. The program became more directly development-oriented
with the share of investments in productive sectors increasing from 24 to 45
percent during the Second and Third Plans. Rural investments improved in
quality, and tripled between the First and the Third Plan. Rural diversifi-
cation, mainly for cotton, rice, and tomatoes, was successfully begun.
6.        The change in the Government's development policy, however, came
too late to have a significant impact on the economy until after 1968. Falling
producer prices for groundnuts and exceptionally bad weather in 1968 reduced
groundnut production by 50 percent and even production of millet and other
major food crops remained insufficient to cover local demand. In the modern
sector, though, the Government did succeed in stimulating import substitution,
and this partly offset the loss of export markets for manufactured products.
Manufacturing output grew at 6 to 7 percent annually.
7.        Since 1968, a number of factors combined to bring about an 8 percent
annual growth of GDP (in current prices). Sharp increases in world market
prices for groundnuts after 1968 permitted a 25 percent increase in producer
prices in 1971 and this, combined with other measures designed to stimulate
groundnut output, helped to restore agricultural production. In addition to
these measures the Government's agricultural diversification efforts started
yielding benefits in rice, cotton, and vegetable production. The modern sector
of the economy continued to expand, partly due to a marked increase in exports
of manufactured products averaging 14 percent a year, which reflected Senegal's
improving competitive position. At independence, the country had been plagued
with a high cost structure which seriously hampered economic growth. Since
then, however, Government policies have been aimed at containing price and
salary increases, which then allowed local industries (e.g. textile and shoe
manufacturing) to start competing successfully in export markets, and contrib-
uted to the rapid growth of the tourism sector.
Public Finance and Foreign Aid
8.        These overall economic trends are reflected in the condition of
public finances which deteriorated throughout most of the 1960's. By 1968/69,
public savings had declined slowly but continuously to virtually zero. Rev-
enues stagnated because of the decline in imports, the most important element
of the tax base. Thus, keeping the tax ratio at roughly 20 percent of GDP
was quite an achievement. But current expenditures grew, albeit moderately,
at 3 to 4 percent annually thus eroding the current account surplus.
9.        After 1968/69, a recovery of public savings was made possible
because of better tax collection, increased tax rates, and substantial sur-
pluses of the groundnut stabilization fund following the rise in groundnut
export prices. In 1970/71, public savings represented 7 percent of current
revenues. Yet locally-financed public investment continued to exceed savings
by a wide margin, as it had throughout the 1960's, and this resulted in a
steady decline in Treasury deposits.



ANNEX I
Page 5
10.       Senegal has benefited from a large inflow of foreign aid, mostly on
concessionary terms. Between 1966 and 1970, foreign aid financed about 65
percent of public investment and averaged US$30 million per year. This cor-
responds to US$8.8 per capita annually, mainly financed by the European
Economic Community (40 percent) and France (30 percent). The World Bank Group
and Germany contributed, respectively, 13 and 10 percent of the total. Foreign
aid concentrated on infrastructure and on directly productive projects in the
rural sector. Also important was technical assistance, mainly in education,
which amounted to US$29 million annually, mostly financed by the French
Government.
Prospects
11.       A severe drought in 1972 seriously affected agricultural output.
Groundnut production may have declined by 45 to 50 percent. The impact of
the drought on overall economic growth and public finances cannot yet be
readily assessed.
12.       In coming years, the economy will probably grow faster than in the
past decade, largely as a result of on-going efforts to diversify agricul-
tural output and to expand fisheries, tourism, and industrial exports. Medium
term prospects would be more favorable were it not for the fact that ground-
nut prices are expected to fall from their present level of over EIOO/long
ton to L80/long ton by 1980, thus eliminating the surplus of the groundnut
stabilization fund.
13.       The government is determined to keep the expansion of current
expenditures to a minimum and to improve the financial performance of public
enterprises. However, since tax rates are already relatively high, the
urgently needed revenue increases will have to come from better collection
and overall economic growth.
14.       Considering the need to diversify the economy, it appears essential
that public investment be increased from US$60 million annually during the
Third Plan (1969-73) to US$80 million during the Fourth Plan. However, while
such a program is in line with the recent improvement in the government's
capacity to prepare and implement projects, the slow increase in public
savings, together with the limited possibilities of deficit financing with-
out endangering the difficult foreign exchange situation or restricting
credit to the private sector, make financing of the Fourth Plan difficult.
To offset the expected shortfall in local resources associated with the
deterioration of terms of trade, foreign lenders will have to increase
their share in the financing of the Fourth Plan to about 85 percent of
total development expenditures. Foreign aid is expected to continue to
expand rapidly, based on the programs of the European Communities (Third
FED Program), bilateral aid donors (Canada, Italy, Belgium, and oil produc-
ing countries in the Arab world), and the World Bank Group. In view of Senegal's
improved economic performance and absorptive capacity, increased external
assistance is warranted.



ANNEX I
Page 6
15.       External aid will have to continue to be on relatively soft terms
if it is not to create serious debt service problems. The proportion of
grant aid has declined from 85 percent in 1964-66 to 55 percent in 1969-71
and is likely to drop to about 40 percent of total foreign financial aid
during the period of the Fourth Plan. Although the foreign debt service
ratio is still low at 5 percent, financing of the remainder of foreign
aid on conventional terms would soon lead to unmanageable balance of pay-
ments and budgetary difficulties. Projections indicate that at least half
of non-grant aid should be extended on concessionary terms if an excessive
increase in the debt service ratio is to be avoided. Budget constraints
are even more serious, as debt service charges are already projected to
absorb one-half of gross public savings by 1980. Any substantial harden-
ing of the blend could result in negative public savings.

be withdrawn by the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 140     First Agricultural Credit Project; US$6.0 Million and
Ln. No. 584     US$3.5 Million
Credit of February 10, 1969 and Loan of same date (cancelled);
Closing Date: March 31, 1974
The objective of the First Agricultural Credit Project was to bring
about increases in farmers' income and Government's revenues by an increase in
production and yields of groundnut and millet in Senegal's "Groundnut Basin".
The project financed 75% of the cost of animal drawn equipment purchased by
farmers and varying percentages of the costs of management assistance to

marketing, extension and credit institutions.   A sharp fall in groundnut out-
put due to low prices and poor weather caused a drop in demand for credit and
led to a cancellation of the Bank Loan. In 1971 a combination of better
financial incentives and normal weather conditions permitted the recovery of
groundnut production, but as a result of drought conditions in 1972 the crop
for that year was the smallest of the last 25 years, as a result, actual
production levels have stayed well behind expectations at the outset. It is
felt, however, that the essential component under the first project, the
distribution of animal drawn equipment on credit, has benefitted the farmer
even under adverse weather conditions and that without equipment availability
overall production would have been even lower.
Cr. No. 198     First Highway Project; US$2.1 Million
Credit of June 19, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The first highway project provided for construction of feeder roads,
purchase of highway maintenance equipment, and a study of road improvement and
maintenance. Execution of the project has been satisfactory. Actual costs
are within appraisal estimates and surplus funds available are being used
to provide additional maintenance equipment.
Cr. No. 252     Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The rice production program is progressing well. The number of
farmers participating during the first year of the project was satisfactory,
and the rice yields achieved were slightly above expectations despite mediocre
weather conditions. However, participating farmers marketed a smaller propor-
tion of their crop than was expected. Preparations for the second crop season
are well advanced. It is expected that during this second year of the project
the area under rice will reach about 2,000 ha., which is equivalent to 20
percent of the ultimate target to be achieved over 7 years. Procurement
procedures are well underway; but administrative clearances are, on occasion,
a cause of delay. Feeder road construction will commence by the end of 1973
on force account. Arrangements for better channeling funds to the project
are presently under review with the Government.
Cr. No. 253     Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: October 1, 1976
Due to the unacceptability of the preliminary design for the tech-
nology institute and to delays in initiating the procurement procedures for
the furniture and equipment, the project implementation is about 9 months
behind schedule. No further delay is expected in selecting the fisheries
specialist related to Section 4.02 of the Credit Agreement. No extension at
the closing date of October 1, 1976, is actually forecast.

Cr. No. 254     Terres Neuves Settlement Project; US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Physical execution of the project is progressing satisfactorily
and first year's results (1972) are in line with the appraisal report estimates.
Administrative difficulties in making STN (the State Corporation in charge of
the project) operational has created financial difficulties and caused delays
in implementation of the project's infrastructure program. The situation is
being regularized. The preparation of a second phase project is under way
and the feasibility study should be ready by mid 1974.
Cr. No. 314
Ln. No. 835      Second Railway Project; US$3.2 Million and US$6.4 Million
Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project involves continuation of track renewal towards the
Mali border, modernization of workshops to increase efficiency and thus
improve availability of rolling stock, purchase of locomotives, and
modernization of freight cars to reduce maintenance costs, technical services
and training. Tenders have already been invited for freight car modernization,
machine-tools for the Thies workshops and track renewal material. Retendering
for part of this last item is necessary as only one offer was received.
Operating and workshops experts are in the field. Transport coordination
experts are being selected. Overall progress is satisfactory.
In order to achieve full potential benefits of the Investment
Program and to allow the Regie to reach financial viability by 1975/76 a
Plan of Action has been agreed upon with Government and the Regie. This
Plan outlines measures to be adopted by the Regie to improve operations,
reduce staff, and study certain branch lines which appear to be unprofitable.
There has, however, been a deterioration in the first half of 1972173 in
the Regie's financial position and the need for additional remedial measures
is currently being reviewed.
Cr. No. 336     Site and Services Project; US$8.0 Million
Credit of September 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The Credit is not yet effective principally as the result of the
unexpected need to pass a law, rather than a decree, to reorganize the executing
agency. However, the executing agency, Office des Hlabitations a Loyers Moderes
is carrying out its reorganization and has begun the detailed engineering for
the first phase of the project, with the help of technical assistance recruited
under the project.
Ln. No. 866     Telecommunications Project;   US$6.25 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the 1973-1976 telecommunications rehabil-
Ltation and development program of OPTS (Senegalese postal organization).

It provides for the expansion and modernization of local and long distance
facilities, in particular the installation of a modern microwqage link between
Dakar and the northern region of Senegal and a VHF/I,11F link along the line
of the Senegal River from Richard Toll to Bakel. The loan was made effective
on June 5, 1973. Financial measures have been adopted, and project implementa-
tion is proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 867    Airport Project; US$3.0 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date:   June 3n , 1975

effective on May 22, 1973. Bidding documents have just been approved.
Cr. No. 350     River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million
Credit of January 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project is the implementation of a series of measures designed
to improve and expand irrigation in order to increase the production of rice
and other crops in the Senegal River polders area. The credit was made
effective on June 8, 1973, and implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.

SENEGAL-DAKAR DRYDOCK AND SHIP REPAIR PROJECT
PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS OF PRE-APPRAISAL
A.    Description
1.         The yard would be built around two drydocks, one capable of handling
ships of up to 500,000 DWT and the other ships of up to 250,000 DWT. Other
dock facilities would include four quays for repairs afloat, a deballasting
station, space for a future third dock of 1 million DWT capacity, as well as
necessary breakwaters. The docks and quays would be served by a number of
cranes, including one with a lifting capacity of 200 tons. The workshops
would include a large plate-shop, a well-equipped machine shop, as well as
facilities for electrical work. The yard is planned to be able to handle
all the complex work involved in repairing VLCC's and large ore carriers.
2.         The site favored by the sponsors is at Thiaroye about 15 km east
of the port, near the Dakar oil refinery. This site has the advantages of
providing easy docking for large ships, being close to the refinery, where
slops can be handled, and of being in an undeveloped area near the
town. Its disadvantage is that it is far from the harbor where an existing
yard would repair smaller ships.
3.         The yard would be able to dock about 100 VLCC's per year.    The
necessary work force to provide full service for these ships would be about
3,000 men of whom about 370 would be expatriates to start with. The planned
facilities and work force would allow lesser repairs on up to 500 ships per
year, either in the harbor, at anchor, or in dry conditions using existing
facilities (slipways and the naval dock).
4.         No social infrastructure facilities would be required as Dakar
has adequate capacity for housing, water supplies, power supplies, trans-
portation and telecommunication.
B.    Capital Cost
5.         The estimated capital cost of the project is as follows:
Investment Cost*
(US$ Million)
Drydocks                                      48.0
Breakwaters                                    5.5
Dredging and Other Civil Works                21.4
Workshops                                      5.2
Machinery and Equipment                       16.0
Unforeseen and unspecified                     3.0
Training Facilities                            4.0
Total                                   103.1
* No attempt has been made to revise these figures
following the currency adjustments in early 1973.



ANNEX IV

These costs assume that the engineering studies will prove up a suitable
soil structure for the support of the dock and also permeable layers to
permit water discharge. Provisions for engineering and supervision (7 percent)
as well as contingencies and pre-operating expenses (15 percent) are included
in each item.
C.    Market Study
6.         The market study carried out by the Bank and its consultants con-
firmed the main findings of the sponsors: that Dakar is well-located with
regard to main trade routes, primarily with respect to Middle East-Europe
traffic, but also including traffic from Europe-South America as well as
traffic from other West African countries to Europe and America.
7.         That study also contained a preliminary analysis of supply and
demand. It indicates that at present and over the next few years, there is
an oversupply of drydocking space for vessels of up to 100,000 DWT. But the
supply of dry-docking space for larger ships cannot keep pace with the grow-
ing demand resulting from the trend to larger ships. Thus it is expected
that after 1975 supply will fall short of expected demand. Dakar is well
situated to cater for this demand and even has a good chance to get into the
small vessel market as there is little competition in West Africa for vessel
repair work.
8.         Nevertheless there may be a danger of over-capacity in drydocking
space for large vessels at the end of the decade, as several projects in
various stages of consideration are under way throughout the world. The
market will have to be followed continuously, as new projects are proposed
or as some of those already proposed either proceed or drop out, to determine
the commercial feasibility of the project. The engineering studies entail
further work on the market and the sponsors of the project are continuing
investigations of the progress of other projects. Since these studies were
carried out, there have been recurrent reports that a South African project
may proceed with a drydock and repair yard for VLCC's, perhaps at Saldanha
Bay. Such a project would have a direct effect on the success of the Senegal
project and will have to be watched closely. Even now, in dock sizes where
over-supply exists, some yards are successful. The two main reasons of
success being the "reputation" of the yard, i.e. its capability to deliver
on time the needed services, and - especially for tanker repair yards - its
location along trade routes allowing for gas-freeing without deviation.
Dakar is well located in this respect and its sponsors are well-known and
well-established repair firms.
D.    Revenues
9.         Unlike other industrial projects whose output is a product with
a rather well-defined and predictable market and price patterns, ship re-
pair yards sell services at prices defined basically by what the market
will bear.



ANNEX IV
Page 3
10.        The services to be provided consist of:
(a) The renting of installations (docks, quays, cranes);
(b) The sale of materials either as part of the repair job or
as ordered by the clients;
(c) The invoicing of manhours spent on the different jobs on
ships, in drydocks, alongside quays or at anchor (produc-
tive manhours).
11.        Prices fluctuate with demand and locality, and it is impossible
to precisely determine exact revenues. The Bank's study has led to the
conclusion that initial productivity per manhour will be lower than in
comparable European yards. To offset this, more hours will be required per
vessel. The overall labor revenue per ship will be lower than in established
European yards to entice shipowners to entrust complicated work to this new
yard. Similarly dock charges assumed for Dakar are slightly below the ones
used in Europe for the same size ships.
12.        The Bank's investigation has assumed that the yard would only
receive a minimal income from the passing on of materials. Most of the
materials are produced outside Africa and transport charges would increase
their prices to Dakar yards over the level which European yards would have
to pay. In order not to discourage shipowners to use Dakar's facilities,
materials are assumed to be passed on to customers at levels similar to
European yard's charges.
13.        The yard would also do industrial work, i.e. heavy mechanical work
to make full use of its sophisticated manpower and equipment. The Dakar
project would take advantage of the present market for repair of small
ships in order to build a sizeable business.
E.    Operating Expenses
14.        The main item of the operating expenses is the labor cost which
in turn depends on the directly productive manpower and of the proportion of
expatriate to total manpower. The Bank's study has tentatively determined
the labor costs by a survey of current skilled labor costs in Senegal, as
well as the availability of labor with the particular skills required.
15.        Overhead expenses have been derived from figures from European
yards. To cover maintenance and renewal, appropriate amounts have been
included each year. Operating costs of training have also been taken into
account.
F.    Rates of Return
16.        The financial rate of return for the proposed Dakar yards has been
computed based on the assumptions and preliminary study of the Bank as
indicated above. The basic financial return of 10.5 percent, while marginal,
is acceptable and is likely to be exceeded. The base case's assumptions



ANNEX IV
Page 4
have been very conservative and assume no reduction in the discount over
European prices over the life of the project. In actual fact, as Dakar
services prove to be satisfactory in quality and are completed within the
required time frame, projected prices should gradually increase to a level
only slightly below that of charges in Europe. The results of the sentivity
tests are as follows:
Sensitivity Tests of Financial Rate of Return
Financial
Capital Cost   Operating Cost    Benefits     Rate of Return (%)

/1    Complete replacement of expatriate labor over 20 years.
X2    Including benefit slip corresponding to cost overrun.
73    Approximate benefits, if charges by Dakar approach European
charges.
17.        The economic return of the project should at least equal, and in
some cases exceed, the financial return, depending on the assumptions used.
As set up, however, the project was to be carried out by two corporations,
an infrastructure company, Dakarmarine, which would own the drydock and repair
facilities and lease them to a superstructure company owned by the private
sponsors to operate. Inasmuch as the lease payments were fixed at a relatively
low level, this resulted in an increased return to the sponsors through the
superstructure company at the expense of Dakarmarine. Thus the basic economic
and financial returns to Senegal, as conceived, were lower than the overall
financial return of the project itself. The Government was advised that it
should attempt to establish financial arrangements which would provide for
a more equitable split of benefits between the Government and the private
sponsors.
18.        Above results are, of course, based on the preliminary studies and
assumptions of the Bank and its consultants. The proposed technical and
economic studies are to confirm our tentative conclusions by giving more
reliable information on technical feasibility, expected markets, costs and
revenues.



ANNEX IV
Page 5
G.    Basic Recommendations
19.        The Bank recommended that the Senegalese Government rationalize
the existing repair facilities at Dakar by better organization and by better
use of the naval yard drydock. It was also proposed to build a new slipway
in order to free the naval dock for ships up to 25,000 DWT. Carrying out
this small project while the necessary technical studies were being carried
out would inject the private sponsors' managerial expertise into actual
conditions at Dakar, thereby enabling it to improve its knowledge of local
conditions, to study the Dakar harbor arrangements to make them more service-
oriented and more attractive to ship owners, and to plan the training for
the drydock project. This recommendation is still under study by the
Senegalese Government.
25.        It would be preferable for the project to be carried out within one
corporation so that the risks and benefits of the project would be more equit-
ably shared by the Senegalese Government and the private sponsors. Nevertheless,
it was concluded that two corporations would be acceptable provided the
arrangements were such that a larger portion of the financial risk would be
met by the sponsors. As a result, Beliard Murdoch has been urged to associate
itself with other ship repair or financial firms in order to give it the
financial strength needed for the satisfactory implementation of the project.
