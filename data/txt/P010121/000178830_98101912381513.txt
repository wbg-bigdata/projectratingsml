PAKISTAN
PUNJAB EXTENSION AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Agriculture in Pakistan
1.01      Pakistan extends over about 197 M ac of which only about 47 M ac
or 24% are cultivable. About 33 M ac is irrigated from the Indus River
system, the biggest single irrigation system in the world. Since rainfall
over most of the Indus Plain is inadequate for crop production, and is barely
sufficient even in the wettest northern agricultural areas, irrigation and
prosperous agriculture have gone hand-in-hand since about 2500 B.C. Invest-
ment in controlled surface irrigation started about 100 years ago. Recent
major investments include the World Bank-supported Indus Basin and Tarbela
projects, consisting of a system of canals interconnecting the major rivers
and the construction of two of the world's largest rockfill storage dams at
Mangla and Tarbela. Some 150,000 private and 10,000 public tubewells augment
surface irrigation supplies and some also partially control the water table
and spread of soil salinization that would interfere with crop production.
1.02      Growth in agricultural production averaged almost 6% per year during
the 1960s. Recent progress has been much slower, less than 2% per year since
1970. Since about 1972, production of some crops, notably cotton, has actually
declined. One contributing factor has been a series of adverse seasons when
either river flows were exceptionally low or untimely rains and floods have
depressed yields. However, even in normal years, yields are low due to poor
cultural practices. While there is a need to improve both irrigation water
supplies and drainage, full benefits from these heavy investments will not be
realized unless day-to-day farm practices are improved. The means of doing
this is through an effective agricultural extension service.
B. Features of the Punjab
1.03      The Punjab, which occupies about 25% of the land area of Pakistan,
is its easternmost province, and agriculturally the most productive. It is
the most populous, with 41 M people (56% of the national total), 75% of whom
live in rural areas. The Indus River and its tributaries provide the water
for its predominantly irrigated agriculture. It has a land area of almost
42 M ac of which 27.7 M ac are cultivated, and 23.6 M ac (85%) are irrigated.
About 5.5 M ac are double cropped.
1.04      Annual rainfall varies from a low of about ifour inches in the south
to more than 60 inches in the northern submontane area. Yearly variations are
wide but most of the rainfall occurs during the monsoon season, June through



- 2 -
August. In the north, significant amounts of rain also occur from January
through March. For the most part, the climate is suitable for year round
cropping. In the north, there are between 200 and 225 rainless, sunny days;
in the south, over 300. Thus, given adequate water supply, climatic con-
ditions are ideal for attaining good crop yields.
1.05      Soils are diverse with a predominance of silt and sandy loam soils
in the flood plains of the rivers, and predominantly clay in the submontane
region. In the foothills, the soil is sandy and easily eroded. Topography
is relatively flat except for a small area in the north, making it possible
to irrigate 85% of the cultivated lands or about 56% of the total land area.
Agricultural Production and Yields
1.06      There are two principal cropping seasons:  kharif (mid-April to mid-
October) and rabi (mid-October to mid-April). The most important crops in
kharif are cotton, rice, sugarcane, and millets; in rabi, wheat and gram pre-
dominate. Average yields, cropping pattern, production, and yields obtained
now by the better farmers, are shown below for the major crops:

1.07      There are two main agricultural systems; irrigated farming, using
canal and/or groundwater, and rainfed farming or barani. A relatively minor
sailaba system uses residual moisture and rainwater to grow crops after flood
waters from the main rivers have receded.
The Pattern and Size of Land Holdings
1.08      The prominent features of land holdings and farm operation patterns
are shown below:

According to the 1972 census of agriculture, there were about 2.4 M farms in
the Punjab, of which 57% were 12.5 ac or smaller, but made up only 28% of the
cultivated area. The predominant tenure pattern is individual farm ownership
(42%). The remainder is about equally divided between owner-tenants (farmers
who own some land but rent additional land) and tenants; (who own no land).
C. Agricultural Administration and Infrastructure
The Extension Service
1.09      Organization and Staffing.  The Punjab Department of Agriculture
(Fig. 1.1) is one of the departments of the Ministry ofE Agriculture, and
is responsible, through the Directorate of Agricultura:L Extension, for pro-
viding basic extension services throughout the province. The Directorate is
organized on four levels (region, division, district and tehsil), correspond-
ing to the administrative units of the Province. With the recent introduction
of a Cotton Maximization Scheme (CMS), a newly appointed Director of Agricul-
ture (DA-CMS) is in charge of the seven districts where cotton is a major
crop. In the districts covered by CMS, the senior officers in the districts
have been upgraded to Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA), and an Assistant
Director of Agriculture (ADA) has been posted to each tehsil. The Director-
ate of Agricultural Extension is therefore organized as follows:
Divisions not in CMS (3)       Divisions in CMS (2)
Province             Director of Agriculture        D)irector of Agriculture
(cMs)
Division             Deputy Director of
Agriculture (3)
District             Assistant Director             Deputy Director
of Agriculture (14)            Agriculture (7)
Tehsil               Agricultural Officers          Assistant Directors
(3-4 per tehsil)               of Agriculture
(1 per tehsil)
Field Assistants               Agricultural Officers
(30-40 per tehsil)              (4-5 per tehsil)
Field Assistants
(40-50 per tehsil)
Thus, in the Divisions under CMS, the number of subordinate staff has been
increased.
1.10      Each Field Assistant (FA) is usually responsible for over 1,000
farmers. Typically, the FAs live on the farms of larger landlords, to whom



- 4 -
they tend to become obligated to provide various services. They are also
responsible for non-extension activities including supply and application
of pesticides and collection of statistical data.
1.11      Each FA is supported by one or two trained laborers or beldars, who
are recruited from the local farming community and normally live on the family's
farm or in the villages. Ihe beldars' duties involve practical teaching and
demonstration work under the supervision of the FAs. Both the FAs and the
beldars are also involved in the spraying of pesticides, mainly for cotton.
The FAs spend about two-thirds of their time in the cotton season (kharif),
and one-third in the rabi, on pest control. In rabi, they mainly work on
orchards and, to a limited extent, on Brassica oilseeds. When not involved
in supervising cotton spraying, they operate stores selling pesticides and
sprayers, and are also expected to complete various statistical returns for
the ADAs. Therefore, time available for advice to farmers on other aspects
of crop husbandry is limited and irregular.
1.12      Since the FAs are busy with other work, it is left to the Agricul-
tural Officers (AOs) to advise farmers on crop husbandry. The AOs, who are
graduates in agriculture, tend to work almost exclusively with the larger
farmers; the small farmers learn of any innovation from neighbors, from the
radio or from seeing the new techniques in demonstration plots on the large
farmers' land. Field days, which would make good demonstrations an effective
teaching tool, are infrequent and poorly conducted.
1.13      A further failing of the extension organization is a lack of clear
understanding of the functions of the various levels of officials. Detailed,
day-by-day work schedules are not identified and staff activities are not
controlled and supervised in an organized manner. Furthermore, achievement
is increasingly being measured by the crop acreages sprayed and pesticides
and sprayers sold.
Agricultural Research
1.14      Agricultural Research is controlled by the Director-General (DG)
Research. Its main arm is the Punjab Agricultural Research Institute (PARI)
in Faisalabad, under its own Director. The Institute was established in
1908. It owns 2,600 ac of land; it has 22 research sections, dealing with
the individual crops and subjects extending over several crops, like plant
protection, agricultural engineering, soil fertility, etc. Most of the re-
search sections operate on PARI's farm, but some, for agro-climatic reasons,
are in areas where the crops on which they work are of major importance. The
staffing pattern and the quality of the research is variable but generally
adequate. Lack of operating funds, however, is a real constraint and severely
curtails work outside the stations.
1.15      The Pakistan Cotton Control Committee, a Federal organization,
established a Cotton Research Institute in Multan in 1970, close to PARI's
own cotton research institute. Though under Federal control, the institute
deals with cotton production problems of particular relevance to the Punjab.



- 5 -
At present, a UNDP technical assistance project supports it with outside
experts and equipment.
1.16      The Agricultural University at Faisalabad has 325 faculty members,
divided into six faculties (para 1.19). Besides teaching, most are doing
research work, maintaining close but mainly informal links with the nearby
PARI staff. MSc and PhD students also contribute to agricultural research
activities. By 1976-77, some 1,900 research projects had been completed.
1.17      Linkage between the three organizations is not satisfactory and
communication between extension workers and the research establishments
leaves much to be desired. Consequently, research workers frequently address
problems that are not of immediate importance to the majority of the farmers,
and extension workers, especially at the lower levels, are out of touch with
the activities of the research stations. The budgetary constraints that limit
PARI's activities outside its principal stations result in their recommenda-
tions being unsuitable for some agro-climatic environments in the Province
and frequently the farmers themselves must do the final adaptive trials at
their own risk.
Staff Training
1.18      Field Assistants are trained in the Agricultural Training Institute
at Rahimyar Khan. A similar Institute in Sarghoda, after a shutdown of about
six years, once again started training FAs in 1977. The entrants are matri-
culates (after 12 years' schooling) and mostly come from a rural background.
The course takes two years, including practical work on the Institute's farm
and, in the second year, with farmers, mainly on pest control. The annual
out-turn is approximately 100 from Rahimyar Khan and about 50 from Sarghoda.
On the average, 75-80% of the graduates are absorbed by the Department of Agri-
culture. Both institutions are being upgraded through the IDA-supported Third
Education Project (1056-PAK) which, after 1980, will boost output to around
300 potential FAs per annum.
1.19      Agricultural Officers and Research Officers are trained at the
Faisalabad Agricultural University. The University has six faculties:
Agriculture, Agricultural Economics, Rural Sociology, Agricultural Engineer-
ing and Technology, Veterinary Science, and Animal Husbandry. The University
graduates 250 BSc students, many of whom stay on for MSc and PhD courses.
Recently the University has been accepting FSc (First Science Degree) grad-
uates from other colleges, thereby substantially increasing the number of
students obtaining BSc degrees in Agriculture.
Agricultural Inputs
1.20      Fertilizer consumption has increased rapidly since 1966, when it
was about 7 lb of nutrients per cultivated acre. By 1977 it rose to over
25 lb/ac on the average and to approximately 30 lb/ac in the Punjab. The
ratio of N to P205, while still wider than generally recommended, is narrow-
ing. Potash is only used on tobacco, bananas and orchard crops. At present
most of the phosphate, all the potash and approximately half the nitrogen



used is imported. However, two large plants are under construction, one
with IDA's support (Multan Fertilizer Project, Loan 988-PAK). One more
plant, Fauji Fertilizer Project, is in the advanced planning stage. When
completed, Pakistan will have nitrogen manufacturing capacity in excess
of domestic needs, and is expected to meet its phosphate requirements for
all crops except rice, although phosphate rock will continue to be imported.
1.21      Fertilizer distribution is in the hands of two private companies,
Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Co. Ltd. and Dawood-Hercules Chemicals Ltd., and two
public corporations, National Fertilizer Corporation Ltd. and Punjab Agricul-
tural Development and Supply Corporation (PADSC). With the exception of PADSC,
they are also manufacturers. The distributors supply through approximately
800 privately owned retail outlets in the Punjab. Prices, approximately
Rs 1.30 per lb nutrient, are such as to make fertilizer use remunerative for
all the major crops.
1.22      On the whole, the fertilizer marketing and distribution organiza-
tion works efficiently, and in the irrigated areas supplies are readily
available at reasonable distarLces from intending buyers. In the more
sparsely populated unirrigatedi tracts the distance between villages, the
scarcity of draft animals (para 2.16) and the lower overall demand makes
it less easy for the farmer to obtain supplies.
1.23      Pesticides are almost all imported.  Since they are generally
purchased as part of barter deals or provided under bilateral aid, there are
some 35 different brands available, making it very difficult and confusing
for farmers and extension workers to determine correct use and dosages.
Most pesticides are sold by the Department of Agriculture through its FAs
(para 1.11) although the importers also use some village fertilizer dealers.
Storage conditions are generally poor and little control is maintained on the
quality of the chemicals once they leave Karachi. Consequently, a great deal
of managerial skill is required to ensure that farmers and extension workers
are properly advised on how to use these chemicals.
1.24      Sprayers are both imported and manufactured locally.  The latter
are copies of machines imported previously. However, the local fabricators
do not have access to the original performance specifications, nor do they
have the means and equipment to carry out proper performance tests. PARI's
Plant Protection Institute (PPI) tests and evaluates samples of sprayers but
also without measuring such vital factors as droplet size, angle of spread,
nozzle pressure and discharge rates.
1.25      Seed supplies are oif poor quality, and therefore farmers tend to
keep their own from year to year. The nationalization of cotton ginning
in 1976 removed the incentive of the major cotton trading firms to select
seed for their customers' use. Denationalization in 1977 came too late to
affect the quality of seed likely to be available in 1978, but there would
appear to be every likelihood that by the 1979 planting season at least the
pre-nationalization situation will once again prevail. The IDA-sponsored
seeds project (Cr. 620-PAK) is expected to make certified seeds of cotton,
wheat and rice available in the next few years.



-7-
Agricultural Credit
1.26      Short and medium-term agricultural credit is provided by the Agri-
cultural Development Bank, a GOP agency, and by the five nationalized commer-
cial banks: the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), Habib Bank Ltd. (HBL), United
Bank Ltd. (UBL), Muslim Commercial Bank Ltd. (MCB), and Allied PTank Ltd. (ABL).
They began agricultural lending in 1972 under the GOP--sponsored agricultural
small loans scheme, and now have 1,820 rural branches in the Punjab and over
450 in the five project districts. The total volume of credit to agriculture
is currently around Rs 1,300 M/yr. Nevertheless, the majority of farmers still
either have no access to credit at all, or obtain it from non-institutional
sources, such as relatives or money lenders.
Storage
1.27      The Punjab produces a surplus of agricultural products.  Surplus
wheat and rice are bought by GOP. In the last two years, wheat production
was high and storage facilities for the surplus were inadequate. Therefore,
GOP was obliged to store in unsuitable buildings and even in the open, under
tarpaulins. At the end of 1977, the total Government storage capacity in
Punjab was estimated to be 0.94 M tons to which 0.50 M tons was estimated to
be added in 1978. Since it is estimated that the provincial government will
have to provide and store 2.0 M tons, there will stil'L be a capacity gap of
0.56 M tons. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), is at
present reviewing the grain storage situation in the entire country. The
terms of reference of the study have been reviewed by IDA (para 5.03).
Irrigation
1.28      The Indus River and its tributaries provide irrigation for 23.6 M ac
or 85% of the cultivated area. About 46% of the irrigated area (both peren-
nial and non-perennial) is supplied by canals only, about 31% by canals and
tubewells and about 17% by tubewells alone. The remaining 6% is supplied by
other sources, such as dug wells.
D. Strategy for Agricultural Development
1.29      Production increases in the past have come Largely from investment
in irrigation and from the introduction of HYVs. Less emphasis has been given
to cultural practices and the effective utilization by farmers of these
Government-provided resources. Consequently, production is much lower than
it should be. To raise production, priority needs to be given to raising
yields with the presently available land and water reisources, largely through
better cultural and management practices, such as better land preparation,
optimal plant population, better weeding and insect and disease control, all
of which can be adopted by a large number of farmers. To close the gap between
the agricultural practices used by the relatively few innovative farmers and
the majority of traditional farmers, a massive transfer of technology regarding
already proven but simple improvements has to take place. This can be largely



- 8 -
achieved by improvements in the organization of the agricultural extension
service and the extension methods it employs. A close link between extension
services and the adaptive research program is vital because success in exten-
sion will quickly generate demand for more sophisticated advice from research.
The proposed project, through its adaptive research component, and in colla-
boration with the existing agricultural research stations, is expected to
provide the new technologies which farmers would soon demand as a result of
an improved extension service.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01      Five administrative districts have been chosen by GOPunjab as the
project area. They are Rahimyar Khan, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Sarghoda and
Jhelum. They are representative of the range of agricultural conditions
of the province.
2.02      Rainfall is erratic in all five districts.  Jhelum has the most
rain, averaging 27.2 in per year; Sheikhupura, 16.9 in; Sarghoda, 16.3 in;
Vehari, 4.0 in; and Rahimyar Khan, 3.9 in. Rahimyar Khan also has more
extreme weather than the other four districts. The climatic data are sum-
marized in the Table below:

District Details
2.03      Rahimyar Khan District is in the former princely state of Bahawalpur
and is the southernmost part of Punjab. It has an area of 2.8 M ac of which
1.5 M ac is irrigated and under cultivation, and the rest is desert. The
IDA-assisted Scainity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) VI is located
in this district. The cultivated area is served by a canal irrigation system.
About half the area receives year-round irrigation; the other half is irri-
gated only during the kharif season (May-October). In the latter area, there
are about 5,000 small tubewells (mostly 1 cusec) and some 9,000 Persian wheels
to provide water for rabi (winter) crops. The principal cash crops are wheat,
cotton, and sugarcane (Table 2.1). Other crops are rice, sorghum, pulses and
fodder. There are two sugar mills in the district.
2.04      The district consists of four tehsils.  The tehsil headquarters
are the industrial centers of Sadiqabad, (population 25,000); Rahimyar Khan
(66,000); Khanpur (48,000) and Liaquatpur (6,000); there are about 1,150 vil-
lages. The main Karachi - Peshawar road and double-track railway line traverse
the district; there is a branch line to a river port on the Indus. The road
network is good and well maintained.
2.05      Vehari District was established only recently; before 1976 it was
part of Multan district.  It extends over 1.3 M ac, 1.1 M ac of which are
under cultivation. The whole cultivated area is irrigated by perennial canals
and an increasing number of tubewells (6,000 at present). Major crops grown
are wheat and cotton, with some sugarcane and rice (Table 2.1).
2.06      There are three tehsils in the district.  Their headquarters, Mailsi
(population 20,000), Vehari (pop 25,000), which is also the new district head-
quarters and Burewala (pop. 52,000) are major towns and important cotton gin-
ning and processing centers, with many small agricult:ural engineering workshops.
There are also some 750 villages. A major road and the former Multan--Delhi
railway line traverse the district; the secondary road network, while not very
extensive, is well maintained.
2.07      Sheikhupura District is near Lahore, and has an area of 1.5 M ac of
which 1.1 M ac is cultivated. Kharif irrigation is provided by canals, and
rabi irrigation by about 2,300 large public tubewells under SCARP I, and about
3,500 small private tubewells. The principal crops are wheat and rice, account-
ing for over 90% of the cultivated area (Table 2.1). Fodder, vegetables and
fruits are also grown, especially in areas near Lahore and Sheikhupura town.
2.08      There are three tehsils in the district and some 1,100 villages.
Two of the tehsil headquarters, Sheikhupura (pop. 65,000) and Nankana Sahib
(pop. 27,000) are major towns of historic and religious importance. Sheikhu-
pura is a major industrial town, with Pakistan's largest operating fertilizer
plant on its outskirts. Shahdrah is across the Ravi River from the city
of Lahore and in all respects is its industrial suburb. Kala Shah Kaku, an
industrial town in Ferozewela tehsil, has Pakistan's major petrochemical



- 10 -
complex. There is an extensive road and rail network in the district link-
ing Lahore to the north and to the two major industrial cities of Sarghoda
and Faisalabad.
2.09      Sarghoda District lies west of the Chenab River and stretches
across the hilly areas on the west bank of the Jhelum River. The district
covers to 3.2 M ac of which 1.3 M is irrigated, 0.9 M rainfed and the rest
(1 M ac) is forest, range lands and sand dunes. All the unirrigated area
is on the west bank of the Jhe:Lum. Rainfall is only about 8 in, most of
which falls in the hot summer months.
2.10      The cropping pattern in this district is the most diversified.
Wheat, chickpeas, sugarcane, cotton and fodder crops predominate (Table 2.1).
Citrus orchards, though small in area, are economically important. Waterlog-
ging, despite the 2,600 tubewells (1,000 of them Government owned and operated),
is an increasing menace to agriculture.
2.11      There are 1,160 villages and four tehsils:  Sarghoda, Bhalwal and
Shahpur are irrigated and flat; Khushab is hilly, broken country where soil
and water conservation works are most likely to influence agricultural pro-
duction. Sarghoda is the major city, with an important commercial and
industrial base, and a population of over 160,000. Bhalwal, Shahpur and
Khushab are much smaller, with populations of about 13,000, 8,000 and 30,000,
respectively. Communications are good with an extensive road and rail network.
2.12      Jhelum District is oni the right bank of the Jhelum River in rolling,
hilly and partly broken country. It has an area of 1.5 M ac of which 1.1 M ac
is cultivated. Except for a narrow strip of land near the Jhelum River where
there is irrigation from about 500 tubewells, the entire district is rainfed.
Though the annual rainfall averages 27 in, most of it falls during the kharif
season and is erratic. The district has two distinct topographic features,
representing different problems of water conservation: the rolling uplands
with sandy loam soils and the valleys in the broken hilly country with silty
clay or clay loam soils.  Major crops are wheat, sorghum, millets and ground-
nuts. Yields are low, due largely to poor cultural practices.
2.13      There are three tehsils in the district.  Jhelum (pop. 80,000) is
a garrison town and a market center; it lies on the main trunk road to Peshawar,
Lahore and the south. Pin Dadan Khan (pop. 12,500) lies in the hilly country
and serves as a market town for the area. Chakwal (pop. 25,000) is in the
rolling uplands. It is also a busy market town with thriving secondary agri-
cultural engineering and motor repair enterprises. The road network in the
district is not extensive but iis well maintained. A branch railway line
traverses the district, as does the main Karachi-Peshawar line.
Land Holdings and Land Tenure in the Project Area
2.14      About 25% of the farmaers operate farms of 5 ac or less.  They ope-
rate about 5% of the total cultivated area. About 40% of the farmers operate
farms between 5-12.5 ac, representing about 25% of the total cultivated area.
The remaining 35% of the farms are over 12.5 ac, with a combined area of
about 70% of the total cultivated land.



- 11 -
2.15      In Vehari and Sheikhupura districts, about 38% of the cultivated
land is operated by the owners, 24% is operated by owners/tenants (farmers
who operate their own as well as rented land) and 38% by tenant farmers. In
Rahimyar Khan district, 43% is operated by owners, 24% by owner/tenant, and
33% by tenants, while in Jhelum district the comparable figures are 54%, 40%
and 6%, respectively. Details of farm sizes and land tenure are shown in
Table 2.2.
2.16      In Jhelum district, there is a shortage of fodder, and therefore
of animal power. Draft cattle are generally small and weak. It is the only
region of Pakistan where donkeys and horses are occasionally used for tillage.
2.17      In 1974, there were about 6,300 farm tractors in the five districts.
About 1,800 were in Sheikhupura, about the same number in Sarghoda, and, as
expected on account of its less intensive, unirrigated agriculture, only about
360 in Jhelum. On the average, however, each tractor has served about 14
farms, implying a considerable contracting operation in all areas (Table 2.3).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Objectives
3.01      In the Punjab, conditions are suitable for highly productive farming;
irrigation water of good quality is available from surface systems and from
tubewells, soils are generally good, and the climate is suitable for year
round crop production. The opportunities presented by this environment remain
largely unexploited by farmers, and yields are low. This situation prevails
mainly because appropriate technical information has not been imparted to
farmers; and such information as is provided by a weak extension service
often focuses on recommendations which are not practicable for the majority
of farmers, such as substantially increased use of cash inputs.
3.02      The project would entail the reorganization and strengthening of the
extension service in five of the 21 districts of Punjab. Assurances have been
obtained from GOPunjab thalt it would reorganize its extension and in-service
staff training in the project area in accordance with a program and procedures
acceptable to IDA; and that a draft plan for this would be submitted to IDA by
October 31, 1978 and implementation would begin by December 31, 1978.
3.03      Following successful similar projects in other nearby countries, the
reorganized service would use the Training and Visit (T&V) extension system 1/.
This method is based on regular fortnightly visits by FAs to groups of farmers
(para 3.06). Each FA would receive training and instruction from his super-
visors and Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) on one day each fortnight at a
convenient location near his work area. He would be given simple and timely
messages to convey to farmers, and would report back on problems encountered.
The messages would be provided by the staff of Adaptive Research Farms (ARFs)
which would be established under the project to provide technical backstopping
for the extension service.
3.04      The project would extend over five years and include:
-    provision of an additional 582 positions in the extension
service;
-    construction of 1,330 houses and service buildings for
extension and research personnel;
-    provision of 700 bicycles, 450 motorcycles; and 81 motor
vehicles for extension and research staff;
-    construction of buildings and provision of equipment for
the ARFs.
1/   This method is presented in the Bank document "Agricultural Extension:
the Training and Visit System" by Daniel Benor and James Q. Harrison
(May 1977).



- 13 -
-    provision of 30 wheeled tractors of approximately
80 hp for soil and water conservation works.
B. Detailed Features
3.05      Field Staff.  The number of FAs in the project area would be in-
creased from about 560 at present to about 980 (Table 3.1). Ultimately,
additional FAs would be recruited mainly from the graduates of the Sarghoda
and Rahimyar Khan training institutes which are being expanded and strength-
ened under the IDA-supported Third Education Project (1056-PAK) (para 1.18).
These two institutions will train 350 FAs per year from July 1980 onward. Of
these, based on past experience, 75% or about 260 would be available to the
extension service to increase the establishment and make up for normal staff
wastage. Before 1980, additional FAs would be recruited from the present
Crop Recording FAs who have the same basic training as the others, but now
work in the Statistical Section, gathering information in the sample villages.
GOPunjab intends to replace them with matriculates (school leavers), thus
making the Crop Recording FAs available, after refresher training, for general
extension work. Some of the more experienced beldars would also be suitable
to be trained as FAs.
3.06      Each FA would serve approximately 500 farm families.  This group of
farmers would be divided into eight 1/ sub-groups of about 60 families. Out
of each subgroup 10 to 15 contact farmers would be clhosen as the principal
channel for conveying extension messages to the other farmers. The messages
would focus on the most important local crops and on practices of immediate
relevance; their content would be related to farm size and farmer ability to
invest and take risk. The FAs would also carry out demonstrations and under-
take field trials on farmers' fields. They would make no formal reports, but
would keep a daily diary to record farm visits, major recommendations made
and problems to be discussed with supervisors. At present, FAs and their bel-
dars are heavily involved in the sale and application of pesticides. As the
involvement of extension staff in this work would be incompatible with the
philosophy of the T&V system in the project area, a separate organization
would be established to provide this service. Qualified officers would be
appointed to operate stores provided under the project for the sale of pesti-
cides (para 4.06). Assurances have been obtained from GOPunjab that upon the
introduction of the T&V extension system in any part of the project area,
Field Assistants in that area would be released from all non-extension activ-
ities, including the sale and application of pesticides.
3.07      The number of AOs would be increased by 50 from about 80 to about
130. These officers would be available from the 200 to 250 BSc and MSc stud-
ents who graduate from the Faisalabad Agricultural University each year (para
1.19). Each AO would supervise about eight FAs, help them in carrying out
their demonstrations and in other technical matters. They would participate
1/   Except in Jhelum District where a FA would look after seven sub-groups.



- 14 -
in the FAs' training programs, and would continuously check that the FAs
adhere to their schedule and convey appropriate messages to farmers.
3.08      At the tehsil level, seven additional ADAs 1/ would be appointed.
ADAs would be responsible for all extension activity in the tehsil and would
report at the district level to the DDA 1/ who would have overall responsi-
bility for all agricultural extension and related research activities within
his district. At present, there are only two DDAs in the project area and,
therefore, three more would be appointed under the project.
3.09      Training and Research Staff.  Each tehsil would have three Subject
Matter Specialists (SMS); their disciplines would be plant protection, agronomy,
and training. Staff would be appointed to these positions on merit. Many of
the serving AOs have the necessary experience and qualifications to be further
trained as SMS. Only two SMSs would be required for Jhelum district: training
and agronomy.
3.10      The SMSs would be the principal teachers at the training courses
held fortnightly for the FAs. They would spend at least half of their time
in the field, accompanying the FAs and AOs on their farm visits and advising
and assisting them in selecting and managing their demonstration plots.
3.11      A Senior Training Officer (STO) would be attached to the DDA's
office, at each district headquarters. He would direct the SMS training in
the tehsils. The tehsil training specialist would have charge of the execu-
tion of the entire staff training program, the production of the necessary
training material and handouts, and the maintenance and operation of the
tehsil's visual aid equipment.
3.12       Specialists, who would be available from the Senior Research
Officers at present working with PARI, would be posted to the district
Adaptive Research Farms (para 3.16) as Senior Subject Matter Specialists
(SSMSs). They would spend about half their time on their adaptive research
work and the other half in providing technical support for the tehsil SMSs and
AOs. Part of their regular duties would be to review the technical contents
of the training program for the FAs. It is expected that the proposed team
of SSMSs and SMSs would be able to develop and provide the appropriate advice
for the great majority of problems that would arise. The SMSs would maintain
close contacts with PARI and be able to consult with its staff as necessary.
1/   No additional posts are required in Rahimyar Khan and Vehari districts
since they have been already established under the Cotton Maximization
Scheme (para 1.09).

3.14      The present level of staffing and the future requirements for field,
training and research staff are summarized in Table 3.1. Table 3.2 summarizes
additional staff requirements and shows the year when they are required. The
proposed organization chart is shown in Figs. 3.1 andl 3.2. These increased
staff numbers would be essential for the introduction of the T&V system.
Therefore a condition of project effectiveness would be the authorization of
all staff positions required for project implementation. Assurances have
been obtained from GOPunjab that these positions wou:Ld be filled according to
a schedule acceptable to IDA and that after December 31, 1983, staff numbers
would be maintained at a level satisfactory to IDA.
3.15      The speedy start of project implementation depends to a large extent
on having an officer in charge of the extension service who has no duties other
than agricultural extension, to reorganize the Department of Agriculture on the
lines shown in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2 as soon as possible. Since the key position
to the reorganization is the Director-General (Extension), a condition of credit
effectiveness would be the appointment of a D-G (Extension) whose experience
and qualifications are acceptable to IDA.
3.16      Adaptive Research Farms (ARF).  To ensure ithat the findings and
recommendations of PARI are adapted to the soils, climate and level of farm-
ing technology in each district, the project would expand or acquire and
equip sites on which this work will be done. Four olut of five of the project
districts already have farms: Rahimyar Khan (farm area 682 ac), Vehari (490
ac) Sargodha (360 ac) and Vehari (60 ac). The Vehari farm would be expanded
by about 100 ac, and land would be acquired in Jhelumn. This is where the
SSMSs would be based. On each farm, an AO, with the duties of a Farm Manager,
would be in charge of all the equipment and overall Dperations. Each of the
senior SMSs would have a junior scientist to assist him. Each station would
have two FAs and four beldars; they would act as supervisors and foremen for
labor on the adaptive research plots. They would also work with farmers on
whose fields the off-station plots would be situated.



- 16 -
3.17      The SSMSs and the Junior Scientists would be on the establishment
of the DG (Research) and would be on secondment to the ARFS for about five
years. The most senior SSMS would be in charge. Apart from their work on
the ARFs, they would be able to conduct some 25-30 trials per annum (12-15 in
each season) on farmers' fields, and still devote about half of their time to
training and supporting the generalist staff (para 3.12).  The farms would be
equipped with suitable farm machinery and transport to sustain such a program.
Total staff of the adaptive research farms is shown below:
SSMSs          21        Junior Scientists    21
FAs            10        Beldars               20
Farm Manager    5        Tractor Drivers        5
Total establishment:  82
3.18      The Director of Agriculture (Adaptive Research) would coordinate
the work program of each ARF. The exact nature of the work, and the details of
the trials to be conducted, would be developed jointly with the D-G (Research),
the DA (Adaptive Research), the DDA of the district where the farm is situated
and the SSMS in charge of the farm. It would be one of the functions of the
Project Review Committee, as well as of the District Advisory Committees con-
cerned (para 4.15), to advise on the investigations deemed necessary.
3.19      Staff Quarters and Other Buildings.  One of the principal limita-
tions of the present extension service is the virtual absence of housing for
all staff, including ADAs and DDAs. The very few who are housed live on
Government farms or in the larger townships. In tehsil headquarters, where
most of the routine training activities will be carried out, suitable build-
ings would be provided, as would housing and farm buildings on the ARFs and
stores for the sale of pesticides. The project would provide about 1,240
houses, including those on the ARFs, five sets of farm buildings and offices,
and 75 offices, stores and training centres. Details and phasing of con-
struction are in Annex 3.1. An assurance has been obtained from GOPunjab
that all buildings provided under the project would be adequately maintained.
3.20      Staff transport.  The lack of transport, and shortage of operating
funds for staff travel would be remedied under the project. It is proposed
to provide FAs with bicycles, except in Jhelum district and Khushab tehsil of
Sarghoda district where, owing to the greater distances and the nature of the
terrain, motor scooters would be provided. The AOs and SMSs would have motor-
cycles, except the SMS (training) who would need a half-ton pick-up truck.
The numbers required would be approximately as follows:
Bicycles:           700        Inspection vehicles:  38
Motorscooters:      244        Pickups:               27
Motorcycles:        208        Sedan Cars:            16
3.21      The bicycles, motorscooters and motorcycles would be purchased by
their users. Provisions would be made for cash advances to eligible staff
members, which would be repayable according to guidelines set by the Public
Service Commission. An operating allowance would be given which would be



- 17 -
based on the estimated monthly distances to be travelled on duty and would be
sufficient to compensate the owner for fuel and normal maintenance and repair
costs, as well as amortization. An assurance has been obtained from GOPunjab
that it would provide necessary funds to compensate staff for duty travel.
3.22      The ADAs and Senior SMSs would travel by inspection vehicles.  The
Senior Training Officer and the DDA who would normally only go to the field
with the ADA or a Senior SMS, and would otherwise travel on highways, would be
provided with saloon cars which are cheaper to buy and operate. In addition,
each DDA's office would have a 1.5 ton truck for rapid delivery of equipment
and pesticides.
3.23      Equipment for ARFs.  The farms would need adequate farm power to
enable them to perform all operations in good time, and also to have the means
to till, plant and harvest research plots on farmers' fields. Accordingly,
each station requires suitable trailers for their 4 WD vehicles, capable of
transporting a four-wheel tractor and its equipment, or two-wheel tractors,
which would be used for light work on research plots in farmers' fields. The
Junior Scientific Officers would have their own motorcycles, under arrangements
similar to that of the Agricultural Officers and SMSs. Scales, sprayers and
simple testing and sampling tools, and sundry other equipment would also be
provided.
3.24      Tractor Units in Jheluum District.  The execution of water conserva-
tion practices is the single most important factor in increasing crop yields
under the rainfall conditions of Jhelum district. The exact practices to be
followed under local conditions would be determined by the ARF. However,
based on limited experience in Pakistan, and on much wider experience in the
US, Australia and the savannah regions of Africa, it is likely to be either
deep plowing, chisel plowing (ripping) and/or listing (ridging) on the contour.
Whichever operation is found suitable would have to be done before the rains,
when the soil is hard and only tractors in the 80 hp range with suitable heavy
tillage equipment are likely to be adequate. After the rains have started,
rapid, shallow cultivations are required to prevent weed growth and thereby
moisture loss by evapo-transpiration, and to create a dust mulch to slow down
evaporation from the soil. For this operation, wide toolbars are required,
for which the larger tractors required for the heavy tillage are better
suited than the commonly used 40 hp models.
3.25      To provide an extensive demonstration of the benefits of the recom-
mended tillage practices, the ARF in Jhelum district would provide a pilot
contract service, controlled by the Farm Manager.
3.26      It is therefore proposed under the project to provide 30 tractors
of 75-80 hp and suitable implements. The tractors would be owned and operated
by the Agricultural Machinery Section of the Department of Agriculture in
Jhelum district and would be available for hire to farmers. Ten units would
be provided during the second year of the project, after the ARF has determined
the suitable tillage operations required; 20 more would be bought during the
fourth year if the demand for their services appears to justify the purchase.

3.27       Sprayers.  Sprayers are used for applying pesticides to orchards,
rice nurseries and, overwhelmingly, to cotton. The spraying of rice fields
is gradually giving place to the application of granular systemic insect-
icides. The effectiveness of any spray chemical depends largely on the
method and efficiency of application, which, in turn, is a function of the
quality and specifications of the sprayer. Since at present and almost cer-
tainly for the next several years, chemical pest control is a pre-requisite
to successful cotton production, the project would finance up to 21,800
sprayers that meet the standards and specifications required for efficient
pesticide application in the project area.
3.28       Consulting Service and Training.  Technical assistance would be
required by GOPunjab to assist in project execution, including planning and
revising of work schedules before effective redeployment of staff according
to the T&V system (para 4.11). The initial work program of the Jhelum ARF,
on which the appropriate mechanization package depends, would also need out-
side assistance, Accordingly, assurances have been obtained from GOP that
consultants, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and according
to a timetable agreed with GOP, will be appointed. The agreed timetable is
shown in Annex 4.1. Provisions would also be made to enable key staff of
all grades to visit nearby countries where the T&V system of agricultural
extension operates.
Project Implementation Schedule
3.29       The project would be executed over five years, at present estimated
to be between January 1, 1979 and December 31, 1983. The proposed implementa-
tion schedule is shown in Fig. 3.3.
Cost Estimates
3.30      Details of the project costs are presented in Annex 3.2.  The sum-
mary is shown in the table on the next page. The project is expected to cost
US$20.8 M equivalent (including taxes and duties of US$0.5 M), of which the
foreign exchange component iis US$8.1 M equivalent. The research component of
the project would amount for about 15% of total project costs. An overall
physical contingency of 7% is included, varying from 5% on salaries to 15% on
extension equipment. In estimating price escalations, it was assumed that the
project implementation will begin in January 1979. Inflation for local ex-
penditures is assumed to be 10% for 1978 and 9% thereafter; the corresponding
figures for foreign expenditures are 8% and 7%. The resulting price escala-
tion amounts to 28% of totaL project costs.
Financing
3.31      Finance to cover total project costs of US$20.8 M would be provided
by IDA (US$12.5 M) and GOP/GOPunjab (US$8.3 M). The distribution is summarized
on page 20.

The proposed IDA credit of US$12.5 M equivalent would be to GOP on standard
terms and would finance 60% of project costs exclusive of import taxes and
duties. This would cover the foreign exchange costs of US$8.1 M and 35% of
local costs of US$12.7 M. The proceeds of the credit would be on-lent by GOP
to GOPunjab under the same terms. An assurance has been obtained from GOPunjab
that they would at all times make adequate and timely budgetary allocations for
executing the project according to an agreed implementation schedule and there-
after provide the necessary funds to continue operating it in accordance with
the agreed procedures.
Procurement
3.32      The 1,330 buildings and the ARF complexes (cost US$4 M) which are
scattered over the five districts would be constructed after local competi-
tive bidding (LCB) in accordance with procedures which are satisfactory to
IDA. Bicycles, motorscooters, motorcycles and sprayers (US$1.9 M) would be
purchased according to procedures acceptable to the Association. In case of
participation in the bidding by Pakistani manufacturers, a margin of prefer-
ence of 15% of the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing duty, if lower, would be
applicable. Tractors and equipment for the ARFs and for Jhelum district
(US$0.6 M) would be provided through the State Tractor Corporation; motorcars,
pickups and inspection vehicles, through the Pakistan Automobile Corporation.
The procurement procedures followed by both these organizations are satisfac-
tory to IDA. Vehicles and equipment to the total value of about US$350,000,
which would be required within six months of starting the project, to enable
its early effective operation would be procured off-the-shelf according to
established GOPunjab procurement rules which are satisfactory to IDA. So
that funds would be readily available for this purpose and for other project
expenditures, a condition of credit effectiveness would be the establishment,
and funding to an initial level of Rs 1.0 M, of a revolving fund to be admin-
istered by the Director General (Extension). An assurance has been obtained
from GOPunjab that this fund would be replenished monthly to a level suffi-
cient to cover expected expenditures for the next two months.
Disbursements
3.33      Disbursements under the credit would be as follows:



- 21 -
(a) 50% of expenditures for the construction of housing, stores
and training and research facilities;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported vehicles
and equipment; or 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for
locally manufactured vehicles and equipment procured through
ICB; or 70% of local expenditures for vehicles and equipment
procured locally other than through ICB;
(c) 30% of total salaries and travel allowances for all staff
involved in the project; and
(d) 100% of expenditures for consultant services and overseas
training.
Disbursements against all categories would be fully documented. The expected
schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex 3.2.
IV. RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION
4.01      Overall responsibility for project implementation would rest with
the Department of Agriculture. The Director General (DG) Extension would be
specifically responsible for its extension component and the DG Research for
setting up and staffing the Adaptive Research Farms. To ensure the neces-
sary close coordination of extension and research activities, however, linkages
would be maintained at all levels of the two directorates and the work pro-
grams of the ARFs would be under the supervision of district DDAs (para 3.18).
Buildings
4.02      Design and construction of buildings required under the project
would be the responsibility of the Building Department of GOPunjab's Ministry
of Irrigation and Public Works. This organization is not at present engaged
in construction of the type of simple, low-cost housing required for field
staff; consequently, new designs and specifications would have to be prepared.
Since the Building Department, under existing regulations, does not carry out
maintenance on buildings constructed to lower standards than its own, a cell
would be set up within the Department of Agriculture for this purpose, headed
by an Executive Engineer and supported by Assistant Engineers in each district.
The large number of low cost buildings required under this project and the
still larger number which would be required as extension reorganization is
extended to the rest of the Province, would justify such an organization.
4.03      The exact location of buildings and facil-ities has not yet been
determined, except for the ARFs in Rahimyar Khan, Vehari and Sheikhupura
districts. Therefore, an assurance has been obtained from GOP that suitable
sites for all buildings to be constructed according to the Project Implemen-
tation Schedule would be acquired.



- 22 -
Vehicles and Equipment
4.04      Under the proposed reorganization of the Department of Agriculture,
the DG Field would have responsibility for the procurement and maintenance
of all mechanized equipment including vehicles. Consequently, he would be
responsible for procurement of vehicles and equipment required for project
staff and the ARFs. He would consult with DG Extension on designs and
specifications.
Sprayers and Pesticides
4.05      The Plant Protection Institute (PPI), which is part of PARI, has a
responsibility for licensing the sale of sprayers. Licenses to sell sprayers
in the Punjab are issued following satisfactory performance tests carried out
by PPI on samples submitted to them by manufacturers and suppliers. However,
no attempt is made to spot clheck quality and performance of the sprayers
actually sold. Under the project, only sprayers of specifications that are
suitable for conditions in Pakistan would be supplied. To meet this require-
ment, an assurance has been obtained from GOPunjab that sprayers meeting
appropriate performance standards set by PPI and satisfactory to IDA would
be provided in the project area.
4.06      Under the project, FAs would no longer be involved in the sale and
application of pesticides. However, FAs would continue, as part of their
extension duties, to advise farmers on the use of pesticides. A network of
stores would be established during the second year of the project and staffed
by suitably qualified officers for the sale of pesticides and other farm inputs.
Tractor Units for Jhelum District
4.07      The project would provide up to 30 tractors of 75-80 hp for Jhelum
district, together with a selection of implements suitable for soil moisture
conservation and other local needs. The units would be operated by the
Agricultural Machinery Section of the Department of Agriculture, primarily
to perform the kind of soil and water conservation operations, secondary
tillage and dry-farming planting methods for which the local contractors
(Table 2.4) are not equipped.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.08      An essential component of the project is to monitor its impact and
evaluate the results achieve!d. The former relates to the number of farmers
exposed to the advice of the extension service, the latter to the yields
achieved by the farmers in close contact with extension officers compared to
those who are not. The proper collection and evaluation of such information
would assist in determining any changes that may be needed in the ongoing
proj,2ct, and whether the project should be extended to the whole of the Punjab
and replicated in the other three provinces of Pakistan. Guidelines on the
proposed methodology which has proved successful in evaluating other similar
projects are described in "A System for Monitoring and Evaluating Agricultural
Extension Projects" (World Bank Staff Paper No. 272) which has been adapted
for this project to reflect conditions in Pakistan.



- 23 -
4.09      Monitoring and evaluation would be conducted by the Planning and
Policy Framing Cell (PPFC) whose chief reports directly to the Secretary of
Agriculture. The PPFC would require some additional facilities, principally
vehicles, which would be provided under the project. The University of
Faisalabad would conduct an independent evaluation, and would also be provided
with two vehicles and operating expenses to give them the necessary mobility.
Neither organization would require extra manpower for work required under this
project.
4.10      To ensure effective project monitorings and evaluation, assurances
have been obtained from GOPunjab that:
(a)  the progress of the T&V system of extension would be
fully monitored and evaluated by the Department of
Agriculture's Planning and Policy Framing Cell (PPFC);
(b)  the Faculty of Agricultural Economics of the Faisalabad
Agricultural University would conduct an independent
investigation and evaluation.
Technical Assistance
4.11      To assist the Department of Agriculture in efficiently executing
the project, they would require outside technical expertise as follows:
(a)  An Extension and Training Consultant, experienced in the
T&V system of agricultural extension, during the first
four years of project execution. His functions would
be to:
(i) advise and assist in the design and implementation
of staff training programs;
(ii)  advise and assist in organizing the service
according to the T&V system.
(b)  A Dry Farming and Soil Conservation Consultant, for
three years, to develop the appropriate soiL and water
conservation technology for the project area, to iden-
tify the cultural practices best suited to the prevailing
conditions and to compile the list of suitable primary
and secondary tillage implements recommended for the
tractor units.
(c)  A Farm Management and Farm Planning Consultant would
develop the data and methodology to prepare integrated
plans for individual farm types with a view to maximizing
income from the entire enterprise. He would be required
for two years.



- 24 -
(d) A Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant would be required
for approximately six months to assist with all aspects
of the monitoring and evaluation of the project. His
assignment would consist of several short visits.
Eight man-months would be allocated to short-term consultancies, making a total
of 122 man-months. Overall consultants' costs including salary, travel, reim-
bursable expenses, overhead and fee are estimated at US$9,000 per man-month.
Details of technical services to be rendered are in Annex 4.1.
4.12      To enable staff at all levels to observe the operation of exten-
sion services in nearby countries, funds would be provided to enable visits
to be paid to such places.
Coordination with Other Projects
4.13      The Punjab Livestock Project (PLP) has been operating since 1977
in the Sheikhupura district. This district is also part of the present
project. The PLP's principal objective is to increase milk production and
improve the availability of draft power; therefore, it includes components
aimed at improvement of fodder production. It is proposed that extension
related to fodder production should become the responsibility of the agricul-
tural extension service set up under this project. It would be able to take
over this work by about May 1979. There would be consultations by the staff
of the two projects at the village and tehsil levels on the amount and kind
of fodder to be grown. Assurances have been obtained from GOPunjab that by
May 1979, PLP staff would cease to give direct crop production advice to
farmers in the project area.
4.14      The Mona Reclamation Project.  In parts of Bhalwal tehsil of
Sarghoda district, the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) operate
a reclamation and water management project. As part of the project, WAPDA
has strengthened the agricultural extension service in its project area. Its
personnel are advising farmers not only on matters of watercourse construction
and operation, but also on crop husbandry. Once the T&V system under the
proposed project becomes fully operational it would be able to take over ex-
tension work on crops. Therefore, an assurance has been obtained from GOP
that upon the start of implementation of the proposed project in Bhalwal tehsil
of Sarghoda district, WAPDA's extension staff would cease to give direct crop
production advice to farmers in their project area. Discussions would be held
between the DDA, Sarghoda and ADA Bhalwal to establish any necessary special
liaison arrangements that might be needed between the WAPDA and the proposed
project.
Project Coordination
4.15      The project would be coordinated by two committees:



- 25 -
(a) The Project Review Committee would review achievements
in the previous season and set the general guidelines
for the extension service for its future operation.
It would meet before each of the main crop seasons
(kharif and rabi). It would have the following members:
Secretary Agriculture                          Chairman
DG Extension - Convener and Secretary          Member
DG Field                                         "
DG Research
Managing Director, Punjab Seeds Corporation
Director of Regulation; Irrigation
Department
Divisional Commissioner (Bahawalpur,
Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi, Sarghoda)
Registrar, Cooperative Societies
Chairman, PAD & SC
Chief, PPFC                                      "
Representative of Commercial Banks
(in rotation)
(b)  District Advisory Committees would be established in each
of the project districts.  They would review operations,
bring to the DDA's attention problems they wish resolved
and advise him on any action they consider would improve
the effectiveness of the service and help the farmers.
Membership would be as follows:
DDA - Convenor                                Chairman
Deputy Commissioner or nominee                Member
ADAs (HQ tehsil ADA is Secretary)               "
District Manager, PAD & SC                      "
Executive Engineer, Irrigation
Department
Ass't Registrar, Cooperative Societies
Manager, Commercial Bank (in rotation)
One Contact farmer from each tehsil
The district head of private inputs marketing organizations may be coopted
as members.
4.16      Since it is considered essential that the dlepartments most directly
concerned with crop production (agriculture, irrigation, administration,
supplies and banking) should be involved in the project from the outset,
the appointment of the Project Review Committee, with membership and terms
of reference acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
4.17      Further, an assurance has been obtained from GOPunjab that by
December 31, 1978 it will appoint District Advisory Committees in each of
the five project districts with membership and terms of reference accept-
able to IDA.



- 26 -
Project Completion
4.18      Assurances have bieen obtained from GOPunjab that promptly after
completion of the project, but in any event not later than six months after
the closing date, it would prepare and furnish to the Association a report
on the execution and initiaL operation of the project, its cost and the bene-
fits dervied, and to be derived, from it.

5.02      Without the project, assuming the trends of the last few years
would continue, production in the project area would increase very slowly,
at about 1% per year.
5.03      Marketing.  Extension messages in each of the project districts
would be focused on important crops in those districts. For these crops,
the local marketing systems are well developed. As production would increase
gradually due to the project, the increased production should be easily ab-
sorbed by the marketing system. The only crop likely to suffer any marketing
difficulties would be wheat, and this would result from procurement and dis-
tribution problems rather than lack of demand. A study of the national dis-
tribution system funded by the Canadian International Development Agency, is
currently underway. Agreements reached under the SCARP VI project (CR 754-PAK)
provide for discussion of the results of this study with IDA, as well as
implementation of the recommendations in the Rahimyar Khan District.

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Budgetary Impact
6.01      The capital cost of the project, excluding all operating costs but
including contingencies, would amount to US$12.3 M or about US$24.00 per farm
family (US$1.66 per acre) in the project area. Incremental annual operating
costs at full development would amount to US$1.4 M, or US$2.8 per farm family
(US$0.18 per acre) at present prices compared to present expenditures of about
US$6.4 per farm family in the project area. The capital cost of the project,
which would be spread over five years, would absorb about 5% of the Agricul-
ture Department's development budget during project imlplementation. Incre-
mental operating costs at full development would amount to about 10% of the
current annual operating budget for the department; however the reduction in
involvement in pesticide application, which presently absorbs some 20% of the
annual budget, would substantially offset this increase.
B. Farm Impact
6.02      The messages conveyed by the extension workers would be simple and
concentrate on practices producing a quick and profitable response. Such
practices would include land preparation (improved seetd beds); time of plant-
ing; plant population; treatment and selection of seed; weeding, use of HYVs
and fertilizers, and protection against pests. Depending on the level of
husbandry and financial capacity of each farmer, different technical packages
would be recommended. Three levels of packages have been identified for each
crop (Table 5.1), and would be further refined in the Adaptive Research Farms.
The simplest packages concentrate on the use of improved cultural practices,
and involve little or no additional cash inputs. The other packages would
include the same basic cultural practices together with added levels of fer-
tilizers and pesticides.
6.03      The financial impact from employing the packages has been esti-
mated in two ways -- firstly, the benefit:cost ratio, and secondly the return
per man day for the extra labor involved in using each package. The results
show that the proposed packages would typically have benefit:cost ratios in
the range of 3 to 6, and therefore be quite attractive to farmers. The returns
to labor from the packages vary widely, but all are substantially in excess of
current wage rates, indicating that, where necessary, farmers would be pre-
pared to hire labor to carry out the recommended pract:ices.
6.04      Economic.  The design of the project, its timing, scope, relative
size of project components and organizational arrangements are based on past
experience with similar successful agricultural extension and research re-
organization in neighboring countries. Attributing a precise level of benefits
to this type of project is difficult since the expected benefits of improved
agricultural practices, which also require additional inputs, cannot be



- 28 -
attributed solely to extension and research. Moreover, there is no experience
in Pakistan to estimate accetptance rates with any degree of accuracy. How-
ever, there is no doubt that: the substantial improvement in the efficiency
of utilization of resources which would be brought about by the project would
generate a high rate of return. The principal economic benefit of the project
would be an increase in agricultural production, particularly foodgrains.
Given the present cropping pattern, if, after Year 5, crop yields would in-
crease by about 3% over the "without project" situation, the economic rate
of return of the project would exceed 50%. Given the performance of the new
extension service elsewhere, there is little risk these yield increases would
not be attained by 1984, since the better farmers in Punjab already obtain
nearly twice the average yields and, on research stations much higher yield
levels than these are achieved. This high rate of return should, however,
be treated with caution since, as improved agricultural practices spread,
further investments in infrastructure and services would become necessary.
6.05      Social.  In the past, the agricultural development strategy has
been aimed at achieving production increases mainly through investment in
irrigation and through use of 'optimal' package of practices, involving HYV
with substantial doses of fertilizer and pesticides. Adoption of these im-
provements usually requires credit which, more often than not, is not avail-
able to small farmers; consequently larger farmer have benefited most from
past programs. The reorganized extension service would focus first on im-
proved cultural practices and better farm management and use of low cost
inputs; adoption of these recommendations would primarily involve more
labor -- an asset most smalL farmers have in abundance. Thus, the project
provides a unique opportunity for small and marginal farmers to benefit and
therefore, aside from generating high economic benefits, the project would
have a beneficial impact on marginal and small farmers, now living close to
or below the poverty line.
6.06      Project Risks.  The most significant risk lies in the fact that
the effectiveness of the new extension methodology is highly dependent on
an efficient organization and management of extension and research services
as well as on farmers' response. Experience with ongoing projects in neigh-
boring countries has already demonstrated, however, that the new system can
work efficiently in formulation and delivery of messages, and in motivating
farmers. The proposed project deals with rainfed as well as irrigated areas,
and in rainfed areas there is a somewhat higher degree of risk concerning
the achievement of yield increases. However, there are a significant number
of improved practices and research findings suitable for dissemination which
can substantially improve yields, even under rainfed conditions. Further-
more, farmers in rainfed areas tend to be less affluent and in greater need
of technical advice. Thus, even though benefits may be lower in rainfed
than in irrigated areas, these would still be considerable, both in economic
and social terms.

PUNJAB EXTENSION AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Building Program
Introduction
1.        Under the project, housing and service buildings would be provided
for:
(a) the extension staff, to enable them to live within a
convenient distance from their work site;
(b) service buildings in the districts:
(i) for staff training;
(ii) offices for staff with administrative duties;
(iii) to provide a base where to store and sell inputs
that the Department of Agriculture would market;
(c) housing and service buildings for the adaptive research
farms.
Present Situation
2.        At present, the Department of Agriculture owns very few dwelling
houses. Most of them are on the District Seed or Demonstration farms. Any
of these allocated to extension personnel deprive the staff of the farms from
accommodation near their work. There is little or no staff housing at the
tehsil level, and Field Assistants who are not posted to the district farms
have no Government-owned accommodation.
3.        According to Civil Service regulations, up to 10% may be deducted
from the gross salary for house rent. However, this sum does not pay for
the rental of a privately-owned house and therefore staff living in rented
houses are financially worse off than colleagues who are provided with Gov-
ernment quarters.
4.        The FAs and their supervising AOs live, in most cases, away from
tehsil headquarters and therefore their chances of finding houses to rent,
be it at a high price, are remote. Consequently, they are forced to seek
accommodation with the bigger landlords. This necessarily obligates them
to give first attention to the host, whether for technical assistance or
the loan of equipment.

ANNEX 3.1
Page 2
5.        The situation regarding service buildings is similar.  The storing
and subsequent marketing of pesticides and sprayers takes place in rented
premises, which are difficult to find and are rarely satisfactory either
for product safety, or security. The problem is compounded by the fact that
the FA, who is at present responsible for the store and the marketing of the
goods, often does not reside near the store. Consequently, access by farmers
to the supplies is sporadic, unreliable, gives cause to frequent complaints
and reduces the potential uptake of pesticides.
Proposed Development Under the Project
Housing Standards
6.        Government-owned buildings have been traditionally constructed to a
high standard by the Building Department of the Punjab Ministry of Irrigation
and Public Works. The specifications have been most rigid and expensive.
These unnecessary restrictions, and the fact that the use of modern materials
and techniques has not been encouraged, has precluded the adoption of cheaper,
less exacting but perhaps equally satisfactory housing. It also meant that
fewer houses could be built with available funds than would have been the
case otherwise.
7.        Since under the project most of the housing would be in the villages,
present standards carry with them the additional disadvantage of being far
higher than that of almost every other building in the village. They would
not blend into their surroundings and would, in a village setting, make their
occupants less acceptable to the community. Therefore, consistent with other
economic considerations, any housing provided must blend into its surroundings
and while it may be better and more durable than the average village house,
the outward difference must not make it too conspicuous.
8.        From a construction angle, the building should be designed to
last for 25 years and provide the space and comfort that is laid down in
Civil Service rules. Failing to meet the latter condition would seem to
put the Department of Agriculture at a lower level than the other civil
servants; this would affect staff morale.
9.        To meet the criteria defined in paras 7 and 8, it is proposed under
the project, to develop further, and standardize, techniques that Coopera-
tives for American Relief Everywhere (CARE) have been developing in Pakistan.
Based on their work, there are strong grounds to believe that housing gf a
satisfactory standard can be built for Rs 55 per square foot (Rs 55/ft )  2
roofed area, instead of the Building Department's current rate of Rs 85/ft
The Building Department has the in-house expertise to finalize the exact
design and specifications. The final expected housing costs for each type of
staff house are detailed in Table 1.



46
ANNEX 3.1
Page 3
10.       The criteria developed for foundations, walls and roofing would
be equally applicable to the service buildings: many of the components
would be of a standard design which would further contribute to reducing
costs.
Extension Staff Housing
11.       To overcome the housing shortage, to free the staff from any direct
or implied obligation to the big landlords with whom they reside at present
and to provide them with the incentive of good housing commensurate with
their family obligations, it is proposed to provide accommodation to all
staff, under the terms set for such accommodation in the Public Service
rules. Numbers required, and proposed construction phasing, is in Table 2.
Service Buildings in the Districts
12.       Staff Training Centers.  The fortnightly, one-day FA training
meetings are expected to be conducted mostly in the field, to enable it to
be a demonstration and practical training session and not one of pure lectur-
ing; nevertheless an assembly point is needed, and a place where visual aid
material and literature for distribution can be stored. Also, the preseason
training sessions for all staff, that are likely to be of longer duration,
need a base. Therefore, under the project, it is proposed to provide suit-
able buildings in the following numbers:
Rahimyar Khan        6     Sheikhupura        6
Vehari               4     Jhelum             6
Sarghoda             6
Total 28
13.       The agricultural administration of the project area is at present
centered on the district. Although in Rahimyar Khan and Vehari there is,
nominally, a tehsil-based organization, it lacks offices and other facilities.
It is proposed to provide this under the project. Accordingly, 17 sets of
tehsil office buildings would be built. The office at present used by the
senior officer in the district: (DDA in Rahimyar Khan and Vehari; ADA in
Sheikhupura, Sarghoda and Jhelum) would remain the office for the district
DDA and his staff and therefore none is provided under the project.
14.       Stores.  The extension service is at present deeply involved in
the marketing of pesticides, sprayers and occasionally also seeds. This
function is incompatible with the proposed T&V system of extension and will
no longer be performed, or supervised, by agricultural extension officers.
However, since the Department wishes to retain this function, the project
would provide stores in areas away from the market towns. These stores
would be permanently manned and provide a place from where the farmer can
always purchase plant protection chemicals in small quantities, to avoid the
risk of storing these in his house.



47
ANNEX 3.1
Page 4
15.       It is estimated that 30 stores would be required.  None would be
needed in Jhelum; there would be eight each in Vehari and Rahimyar Khan and
seven in Sarghoda and Sheikhupura. The construction sclhedule for service
buildings is shown in Table 3.
Adaptive Research Farms (ARF)
16.       There would be an ARF in each of the project districts.  There
would be housing on the farm for all staff based there; laborers would be
recruited from the nearby areas and therefore would not require housing.
Farm buildings, offices and stores are also required. The expected building
schedule is shown in Table 4. Dimensions for farm buildings and offices
are shown in Table 1.
Summary and Costs
17.       Tables 5 - 10 show the detailed costs, numbers and phasing of the
entire building program by district and according to class of building. The
tables are based on the unit costs in Table 1 and on the phasing derived
from expected staff availability based on training facilities, and implementa-
tion capacity of the Building Department, paying due regard to their limited
experience to supervise the construction of buildings that differ from their
present specifications. The cost of the building program is summarized in
Table 11.
Maintenance
18.       Under existing regulations, the Building Department may not get in-
volved in the maintenance of buildings that have not been constructed accord-
ing to their present standards. As practically all the buildings to be
erected under the present project would be below these standards, the assump-
tion for the purposes of the project must be that maintenance would be carried
out by the Department of Agriculture. The cost is taken at 2-1/2% of the
value of the building and the project cost tables have been calculated on
the basis that all buildings completed before the current year would require
this sum spent on them. Whether the money is used to imaintain and operate
the organization described below or whether, through a subsequent change in
GOPunjab procedures, the Building Department would be called upon to perform
the task, the allocation is expected to be sufficient.
19.       Should, therefore, the Department of Agriculture be called upon
to oversee the maintenance of their buildings, they would be expected to
appoint an officer of Executive Engineer (Xen) rank and experience, to be
based in Lahore in the office of the Director-General, (Extension). He
would have, eventually, Assistant Engineers (AE) attached to each of the
DDAs in the five districts. The AEs would, on a regular routine basis,
inspect the buildings and would arrange with local contractors to carry out
the necessary maintenance tasks. The contracts would be awarded according
to the same rules that apply to such works in the Building Department. The
AE would supervise the work and would be responsible for its quality and
scheduling.

ANNEX 3.1
Page 5
20.       Perusal of the building completion schedule would indicate that
the appointment of the Xen and the AEs can be phased over three or four
years. The Xen and two AEs would be required in the second year. The Xen
would, apart from supervising the AEs, at the beginning also take charge
of the Sheikhupura buildings. One AE could supervise Rahimyar Khan and Vehari
Districts and another, Sarghoda and Jhelum. The full complement of five AEs
need not be appointed until the third or fourth year.

PUNJAB EXTENSION AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Technical Assistance
I. Consulting Services
Purpose of Consultant Assistance
1.        Consultant assistance would be required:
(a) to assist in imparting the principle and practice of the
T&V system of agricultural extension to staff of the
Department of Agriculture;
(b) to provide additional expertise in fields not previously
covered by the Department which are material to success-
ful project implementation;
(c) to assist the PPFC of the Department of Agriculture in
initiating a monitoring and evaluation program for the
extension project, and to help start its operation.
2.        The T&V system of agricultural extension represents a fundamental
departure from the present system in that its sole objective is to advise
and teach the farmer, mostly through showing the recommended practices, and
not to perform services for them. To ensure that this basic change of approach
is thoroughly and convincingly instilled at all staff levels, the consultant
group would be headed by a Training and Extension Planning Consultant who
would work principally with the newly appointed DG (Extension) to ensure that
all aspects of the project, but in particular organizational and training
matters, are implemented according to the principles and practice of the T&V
system.
Specialist Discipline Requirements
3.        The assistance of a Dry Farming/Soil and Water Conservation expert
is required because of proposed intensified extension work in the purely
rainfed areas of Jhelum district and Khushab tehsil of Sarghoda district.
In the past, Pakistan has concentrated its research efforts on the problems
of irrigated agriculture and consequently needs outside expertise to assist
in identifying the techniques required for rainfed agriculture in the project
area. The consultant would be expected to coordinate his work with experts
of a US AID-sponsored project, which works on an investigational and demon-
stration basis in all the rainfed areas of Pakistan.

ANNEX 4.1
Page 2
4.        A Farm Planning and Management Consultant would serve to integrate
the current crop-by-crop approach to production planning into that of plan-
ning the farm business rather than its components.
5.        The Monitoring and Evaluation consultant would be required to train
and advise the staff of PPFC in the extension of its evaluation studies and
in analyzing and interpreting the data collected.
6.        There would be provision for eight man-months of short-term and
contingency consultancies, bringing the total allocation to 122 man/months.
Terms of reference and expected length of assignment are given in Appendix 1.
Appendix 2 shows the time each would be in Pakistan; Annex 3.2, Table 12
lists the costs, including that of their necessary transport.
7.        The consultants would preferably belong to a single firm, to assure
continuity and central direction. However, suitable staff from Government
organizations would be acceptable, provided they have the necessary qualifica-
tions and would be able to devote their full time and attention to their
assignment.
II. Training
8.        To support and supplement the work of the consultants, selected
key personnel from the extension and adaptive research staff would benefit
from seeing the T&V system in operation in areas where it was introduced
several years earlier. While the technical details of the extension message
are necessarily specific to the country and even the narrower locality, the
operating style of the staff and the organization of the training sessions
and farmer meetings would be largely similar. Thus, staff at all levels would
benefit from observing the system in operation; the only constraint would be
linguistic.
9.        Under the project, there would be provision to finance such study
tours either for individuals or, especially for FAs, in small groups. The
countries where conditions are sufficiently alike to Pakistan are India, Sri
Lanka, Thailand and Turkey. Trips to international research stations like
CIMMYT, IRRI and ICRISAT would be confined to SSMSs, the DG (Extension), the
Director of Adaptive Research and other senior extension staff.
