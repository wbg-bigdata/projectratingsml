LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Republic of Portugal (ROP)
Beneficiaries:       Eight thousand farm families engaged in the production of
Port wine, commercial crops and livestock and in farm
forestry and park development. About 70 agroindustrial
concerns producing mainly wine, olive oil, fruits and
vegetables.
Amount:              US$90 million equivalent.
Terms:               Fifteen years, including five years of grace at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
On-Lending Terms:   ROP would make available to IFADAP the Bank loan proceeds
for the credit component which will be onlent through
financial intermediaries (CCAMs and PBIs) at a variable
onlending interest rate which would be 2% below the
medium-term market interest rate but in any case positive
in real terms. The medium-term market rate would be
determined by adding 3.52 to the Central Bank
rediscounting rate which at present is 13.5%, and
therefore the present onlending rate to the sub-borrowers
would be 15%. IFADAP will earn a fee of 1% and the
financial intermediaries a spread of 1.5? on the
outstanding principal amount of each subloan. These
provisions would be reviewed by the Government and the
Bank annually to ensure that onlending rates remain
positive in real terms. The foreign exchange risk on all
sub-loans would be borne by ROP.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PORTUGAL
FOR THE TRAS-OS-MONTES REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
l.           The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Portugal (ROP) for US$90 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years, including five
years grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help
finance a regional development project in the Tras-os-Montes region of the
country, benefitting about 8,000 farm families engaged in production of Port
wine, commercial crops and livestock and in farm-forestry production and
agretourism, and about 70 agroindustrial concerns.
2.           Background.  The project originates from a review by the
Portuguese authorities and Bank staff of the results achieved under the
ongoing, Bank-financed Tras-Os-Montes (TOM) Rural Development Project (Loan
2175-PO) and of possible Bank assistance for restructuring the agricultural
sector, so as to enable it to compete successfully within the larger European
Econoiic Community (EEC), that Portugal joined in January 1986. The lessons
from the experience of the TOM project have been taken into consideration in
appraising the present project. The TOM project has indicated that
institutional capacity was available within the region to manage and supervise
efficiently a complex project such as the Regional Development Project,
involving a multi-sectoral combination of components. Civil works for
irrigation schemes, roads and other public infrastructure have been
satisfactorily completed mainly with local expertise, and positive results in
agricultural production have been achieved. At present Portuguese agriculture
is characterized by high output prices, well above world prices, low
productivity, inadequate agricultural services and a large trade deficit. The
Grovernment's strategy in this period of transition, before Portugal's full
accession to the EEC in 1996, is to transform agriculture into an efficient
and export-oriented sector which would provide higher incomes and living
standards to those depending on it. The Government is implementing this
strategy through a policy of price and trade liberalization, reduction of
subsidies, improvement of production efficiency, and promotion of regional
development by creating opportunities for employment and income in agriculture
and outside it, particularly in the poorer regions such as TOM. This is a
sustainable medium-term program that the Bank is well placed to support
through the proposed project because of the knowledge and experience it has
gained through the ongoing project in the region. Further, in formulating and
appraising the project, the Bank has assisted the Government in placing
special emphasis on privatization of the sector, on the reduction of poverty
in one of the few regions of Europe where it still exists, and on increasing
income and standards of living of women, who make up a lar6e proportion of the
working population in the sector in the project area, and account for a
substantial part of the family income. The Government and the Bank have also
kept environmental concerns in view, seeking to maintain the region's
ecological balance, and included in the proposed project a component for the
development of natural parks. Because of its regional focus and of its
broad-based approach to development, this project is considered by Government
and EEC as the bas'9 framework for a larger integrated regional development
program including .ndustry, infrastructure and services to be undertaken with
EEC support.



- 2 -
3.           Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has the opportunity to
assist Portugal in formulating and implementing its agricultural development
strategy and increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of the sector
within the larger EZC market. This is in line with the role of advisor in
policy-making and project formulation which the Government wants the Bank to
play in Portugal. By preparing the project in close consultation with EEC and
the ROP, the Bank has helped define the agricultural and infrastructural
framework to be financed under the project as an essential part of a larger
EEC regional investment program. The project directly supports the major ROP
agricultural modernization strategy which is to maximize the impact of EEC
grant money to secure the increases in efficiency that will allow the sector
to flourish in the face of lower prices. The formulation of the proposed
project in a relatively short period of time would have been difficult without
Bank involvement. The Bank is also well equipped, in the light of its
experience in the field of regional development and its familiarity with the
project area, to assist in the requisite institution building, e.g. in credit,
extension and research.
4.           Project Objectives.  A major ROP objective underlying the project
strategy and design is to transform the agricultural production structure of
TOM, with progressively fewer people depending on it, by focussing on the most
productive areas of Chavez, Terra Quente and the Douro Valley. The people
leaving the sector would find employment opportunities locally in industry,
services, and agrotourism, or be retired through an ongoing EEC compensation
scheme. Privatization is an important policy objective and is to be achieved
through the provision of investment credit for commercial agriculture, mainly
to support the cultivation of vineyards for the production of Port wine, and
an expansion of the agroindustrial sector to improve processing and marketing
facilities and research, to strengthen entrepreneurial skills and to support
the privatization of agricultural services. Another project objective is to
increase regional family incomes, especially those of women, who account for
about 55% of the working force in the sector and 30% of income, and thus to
reduce poverty and intra-regional income disparities. Steady and balanced
economic growth is to be achieved with due concern for the environment.
5.           Project Description.  The proposed project would include
(a) rehabilitation of traditional irrigation schemes and the establishment of
new irrigation schemes in the most productive zones of TOM; (b) strengthening
of the agricultural support services by ensuring sufficient trained research
and extension staff and specialists to assist farmers and cooperatives in
these zones and transfer of extensionists to major production cooperatives in
the private sector; (c) strengthening of the links between research and
extension especially by carrying out the research activities for applied
research through a series of studies for new marketable crops taking into
account feedback from extensionists; (d) provision of credit for
agroindustries and Port wine production; and (e) strengthening of rural
infrastructure especially agriculture and municipal roads, water supply and
sewerage and rural electrification. The project, to be carried out over a
period slightly exceeding 7 years, provides funds for civil works, vehicles,
machinery and equipment, research, training and technical assistance, and
incremental operating costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$415.8 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$116.6 M
(28X). Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Portugal are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7538-PO, dated March 16, 1989, is also attached.

6.           Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to take the following
actions: (a) Agricultural Research: (i) the establishment and staffing of a
demand driven research organization, managed by the regional office of the
Ministry of Agriculture (DRATM) with the scientific support of the
Agricultural Research Center of the North (DARN); (ii) preparation by
December 31, 1989 of the list of research priorities, for crop development in
the productive zones of TOM, with designation of the research institutions
responsible for carrying out the studies. (b) Extension Services: (i) as a
condition of loan effectiveness, freeing 56 extensionists in the project area
from administrative duties so that they would apply themselves exclusively to
the function of extension; (ii) employment of 13 additional extensionists and
10 district extension coordinators at DRATM by December 31, 1989 and 20 more
extensionists by December 31, 1990; (iii) as a condition of project
effectiveness, transfer of 6 DRATM extensionists to 2 major private production
cooperatives, as a step towards privatization of agricultural services;
(iv) building and equipment of 3 training centers for extensionists and
farmers, and preparation by September 30, 1989 of a detailed training program
for extensionists. (c) Institutional Strengthening: (i) deployment of 7
additional staff and provision of technical assistance to strengthen planning
and research services in CCRN and DRATM; (ii) completion of a study by
December 31, 1990 to strengthen the cooperative credit system (CCAMs) with
special emphasis on the consolidation of accounts, medium and long-term
planning, banking activities and capital market operations. (d) Economic
Viability: ensure that new irrigation schemes would cost less than US$13,000
per ha and found to be economically viable applying Bank methodology and that
all sub-projects under the credit component yield ERRs of 13% or more; and
(e) Environmental Impact: assurance that all the investment under the project
would be in accordance with safety, health and environmental standards and
regulations of the country, which are acceptable to the Bank.
7.           Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (i) increased exports due to improved quality of production and
diversification of the production mix along lines of comparative advantage;
(ii) larger employment opportunities, especially in agroindustry and services;
(iii) improved opportunities for private initiative; and (iv) reduced poverty.
8.           The Environment.  Particular emphasis would be given under the
project to the preservation of the environment. The most evident aspects
would be: (i) control of downstream floods and drainage to prevent salinity
in irrigated areas; (ii) avoidance of an adverse impact on wild life and
preservation of birds; (iii) preservation of historical and archeological
sites; (iv) erosion control under road construction and terracing of
vineyards; and (v) treatment of solid and liquid wastes from agroindustries.
9.           Risks.  The principal risk facing the project is the possibility
that the executing agency, CCRN, will not strengthen its organization to the
extent required for supervising effectively project implementation according
to the agreed schedule. However, CCRN's satisfactory record under the ongoing
project, and its commitment to strengthen the Project Administration Unit
suggest that this risk is acceptable. Second, delay in project implementation
could reduce project economic benefits. This risk is offset by efficient
planning underlying the project and improved ROP commitment to it in view of
its importance in helping the region restructure its agriculture before 1996.
Third, progress may be slow in strengthening research and extension services



- 4 -
and in coordinating EEC/Bank financial programs for accelerating regional
development. This risk is being reduced by close working relations between
the Bank and the EEC and by the commitment of the Portuguese authorities to
assure progress in these areas, based on technical and financial support
provided for under the project. All the above risks will be further reduced
by project supervision by the Bank.
10.          Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the IBRD and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
