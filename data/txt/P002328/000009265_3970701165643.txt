SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMUMRY
Borrower:            The Republic of Senegal.
Beneficiary:         SociStE Nationale des Thl6communications du S&ingal
(SONATEL).
Amount:              $22-0 million equivalent.
Terms:               Standard IDA terms.
Onlending Terms:     The credit would be onlent to SONATEL for 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, at the standard Bank
interest rate prevailing at the date of the Credit
Agreement. SONATEL will bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Project Description: The proposed preject consists of SONATEL's 1986-1993
investment program, excluding ongoing and future
works. The program aims at improving operational
efficiency and maintenance, and increasing system
utilization through rehabilitation of existing
equipment and network expansion.
The project comprises:
(a) installation of about 34,600 lines of witching
equipment, with associated cable networks,
buildings and subscriber facilities;
(b) expansion and rehabilitation of long-distance
transmission links;
(c) establishment of a national maintenance
organization; and
(d) technical assistance.
Project Benefits
and Risks:           The improved telecommunications services to be
provided by the project will benefit all sectors of
Senegal's economy, promote more efficient use of



capital and energy resources, and facilitate
agricultural and comercial/industrial development,
and the extension of health, educational, and other
services to rural areas. Environmental pollution will
be reduced due to more efficient transportation use.
Substantial resource mobilization and net transfers to
Government will occur.
The project faces no unusual risks. The recent sector
restructuring appears to bave been implemented
smoothly. The technical assistance component of the
project will assist management in critical areas.
There could be delays in physical implementation;
however, a number of project components will be
executed on a turn-key basis and some are already well
underway, se that this risk is considered minimal.

SENEGAL
SECOND TELECOHIWNICATIONS PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of Senegal has requested IDA assistance in
financing a high priority telecommunications project. The proposed IDA
credit of $22.0 million equivalent will support rehabilitation and
increased utilization of existing installations, as well as construction of
new installations in various parts of the country. The project provides an
opportunity to plan construction of a balanced national network on a
least-cost basis and to achieve long-term institutional improvements.
Major emphasis will be on improvements in maintenance and quality of
service. Government recognizes that investment in the domestic
teleconnmnications network has been at undesirably low levels during the
past seven years, averaging 0.2Z of GNP. Investments during FY86-93 will
average about 0.9% of GNP.
1.02     The estimated cost of the project is $156.9 zillion equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of $90.8 million. The $66.1 million
local cost component includes $35.5 million in customs duties and taxes
(54% of total local costs). About 202 of the project cost is for
rehabilitation, 152 for maintenance and 65Z for expansion. The
implementing agency, SONATEL, is expected to finance from net cash flow all
local costs and up to 28Z of foreign costs. Contributions from Government
will not be necessary and there will be substantial net transfers from
SONATEL to Government. IDA will finance $22.0 million in foreign costs;
other colenders are the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE),
the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Banque Ouest Africaine de
Developpement (BOAD). Comercial loans will be provided in conjunction
with the CCCE loan as private credits guaranteed by the French Government
(Guaranteed Private Credits - GPC's).
1.03     The basic objectives of the project are to improve the
telecomuunications sector in: (a) service quality; (b) access to service;
(c) organization and management; (d) operational efficiency; and (e)
resource mobilization. The project aims to meet 782 of expressed demand by
mid-1993, compared to 70% at present; exchange capacity will be increased
from about 31,600 to 55,000 lines, and the number of connected subscribers
from 21,200 to 42,800. The project will take seven years to complete, with
some retention payments falling due in the eighth year. This is in line
with the Bank/IDA's disbursement profile for projects in Senegal.
1.04      IDA and CCCE have played a significant role in designing a
project that focuses on sector rehabilitation and management improvements.
Rehabilitation is underway with a first phase program in the Dakar region.
Management improvements are expected to result from broad sector
restructuring, introduced by the Government effective October 1, 1985.

II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
A. Background
General
2.01      The telecomnunications sector in Senegal is under the general
responsibility of the Minister of Information, Telecommunications, and
Relations with the Assemblies. Until recently, sector responsibilities
were divided between the Office des Postes et Telecommuinications du Senegal
(OPTS), which handled domestic telecommunications services, and the Societe
Nationale des Telecommunications Internationales du Senegal (TELESENEGAL),
which was responsible for international telecommunications. Government
merged the two entities into the Societe Nationale des Telecommunications
(SONATEL), effective October 1, 1985 (para 2.09).
Access to Service
2.02      As of January 1, 1985, the average telephone density was only
about 0.32 telephone lines (DELs) per 100 inhabitants, which is only about
65Z of the average for Africa (excluding the Republic of South Africa).
For example, the average telephone density in the Republic of Cote
d'Ivoire, already low in comparison with other countries with similar GNP
per capita, was 0.56 per 100 inhabitants in 1985. The low average density
in Senegal is the result of underinvestment in the domestic network during
the last seven years (para 1.01). The number of telephone subscribers has
only been growing at about 4.2% per annum in recent years, half the African
average of 8.7Z. Access to service is concentrated in the major cities, as
shown in Table 2.1:
Table 2.1:  TELEPHONE DENSITY BY REGION

Rest of Senegal            67        12          .06
Total:      100        100          .32
1/ Kaolack, Thies, St. Louis, Diourbel, Ziguinchor
There are about 150 public telephones in the country, about one-third of
which are in Dakar. Telex service is available to about 780 subscribers,
of which 690 are in Dakar.



-3-
Usage of Service
2.03      The distribution of telephone subscribers by category as of
January 1, 1985 is shown in Table 2.2:
Table 2.2: DISTRIBUTION OF TELEPHONE SUBSCRIBERS BY CATEGORY
Average
Number of   Private     Government   Public
Lines Per  Subscribers  Subscribers  Telephones
City/Town  (Percent)    (Percent)    (Percent)
Greater Dakar              14,635        82           14             4
Five major cities 11          678        72            19            9
Other cities/towns:.
- automatic service        106        65           24            11
- manual service            15        51           35            14
11 Kaolack, Thies, St. Louis, Diourbel, Ziguinchor
The table shows that there is a lower percentage of private subscribers in
small towns and rural areas than in Dakar and in other cities. Sample
studies also indicate that many private lines are used for business
purposes to a greater extent in small towns than in the bigger cities.
This is consistent with the analysis of telecommunications usage in other
developing countries. About 26% of telephone operating revenues are
derived from domestic calls, 67% from international calls (due to the-large
number of Senegalese living abroad and substantial transit traffic
revenues) and 7% from rentals and other services. The average revenue per
DEL in 1985 was approximately $1,750; this is high by international
standards, reflecting the relatively high call charges (para 4.12) and the
multiple and intensive use of many telephone lines.
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
2.04      The quality of service is generally poor. About 15% of the
national network is out of service at any given time. An acceptable figure
would be 22. Delays in reestablishing service are usually more than a
week, often more than a month (50% should be reestablished in one day).
The main causes of the outages are unsuitable or obsolete cable networks
and lack of coordinated and systematic maintenance. Inadequate maintenance
on domestic long distance connections has resulted in poor service and
congestion as measured by the number of faults (5) per line per year (1 per
year), the duration of such faults (50% last more than seven days, versus
an acceptable figure of 50% lasting less than one day), and the average
call completion rate during peak hours (generally less than 50%).
International facilities (one type A satellite earth station and four
submarine cables with terminal switching equipment) are well maintained and
have low fault rates, but full utilization is inhibited by the poor local
network.



-4-
2.05      As of January 1, 1985, total telephone switching capacity was
31,599 lines and telex exchange capacity 807 lines (Annex 1). About 94% of
telephone subscribers and all telex subscribers are connected to automatic
exchanges. About 96% of international telephone calls and 99% of telex
comiunications are direct dialed.  However, the capacity of much installed
equipment is exhausted in some areas, underutilized in others, or is
obsolete. Three of the ten regional capitals and 14 of the 30 departmental
capitals n4ve only manual service. Local distribution networks are
generally poo.- and have inadequate capacity.
Demand for Service
2.06      As of January 1, 1985, connected telephone lines met about 70% of
expressed demand (working lines plus registered applicants). However,
there is significant suppressed demand which is not accounted for since
potential subscribers are discouraged from registering by long waiting
times. Expressed demand over 1980-85 grew at about 7.0% per annum, while
connected DELs increased at only 4.3Z per annum. Expressed demand is
expected to grow by at least 8.1% per annum over 1985-1993, as service and
connection prospects improve.  Present planning aims to meet about 78% of
expressed demand by mid-1993 through an average 10% per annum growth in the
number of lines. In addition to the demand for new connections, there is a
large unsatisfied demand for domestic and international call services,
illustrated by the heavy usage of available lines. Only about 63% of
demand for telex connections is satisfied due to saturation of the
available switching equipment. Additional capacity will be available from
end 1987 on.
Manufacturing
2.07      A telecommunications manufacturing industry does not exist in
Senegal; all equipment and materials, except raw materials for civil works,
are imported. A study by CEDEAO in 1981 concluded that, due to the
relatively small quantities of equipment required and the diversity of
technical specifications, domestic telecommunications manufacturing would
not be economically viable in individual countries or groups of countries
in West Africa.
B. Sector Organization
Restructuring
2.08      The need for sector restructuring became evident around 1980.
Poor plamning and execution of investments in the domestic
telecommunications network combined with inadequate maintenance and
operating inefficiencies, led to increased customer dissatisfaction and
aggravated the discrepancy between domestic and international services. In
addition, the domestic service was part of OPTS and thus tightly controlled
by Government and burdened with the problems relating to the postal/

financial services. Initial Bank assistance to the sector (First
Telecommunications Project, Loan 866-SE of $6.25 million), which was
completed in 1980, focused on network expansion and did not achieve lasting
institutional improvements (para 2.23). Further technical assistance,
particularly in financial maLlagement and accounting, was provided to the
sector for three years under the First Parapublic Technical Assistance
Project (Credit 764-SE) starting in 1979. Based in part on the conclusions
of the PCR of the first telecommunications project (December 31, 1981) and
given the continuing problems in the sector, the Bank and Government
subsequently agreed on the need to refocus investments on sector
rehabilitation, and to reorganize the sector.
2.09      A 1983/84 study financed under the Second Parapublic Technical
Assistance Project (Credit 1398-SE) made specific sector reorganization
proposals. The following recommendations were adopted by Government in
July 1985: (a) OPTS' postal/financial services would be reorganized into
the Office des Postes et de la Caisse d'Epargne (OPCE); and (b) the
telecommunications branch of OPTS would be merged with TELESENEGAL, forming
SONATEL. The reorganization became effective on October 1, 1985.
The Entity - SONATEL
2.10      Ownership - SONATEL is a Societe Nationale (State Corporation)
with Government as the sole shareholder. Up to 49% of its shares can be
sold to local governments. Shares cannot be sold to the private sector.
2.11      Organization - The status of Societe Nationale gives SONATEL's
management wide ranging operating autonomy, subject to policy review and
approval by its Board of Directors. Currently, only Government ministries
are represented on the Board. The Board's composition can be broadened as
local gojernments purchase part of the share capital. The Board is
supervised by a Conseil de Surveillance (Supervisory Board) consisting of:
(a) the Board; (b) four other Government representatives; and (c) a
representative of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Matters such as
private sector representation on the Boards and eventual abolition of the
Conseils de Surveillance are being reviewed with Government in the
framework of the Second Parapublic Technical Assistance Project. SONATEL's
organizational structure is satisfactory (Annex 11).
2.12      Management - SONATEL was created through absorption by
TELESENEGAL of the domestic telecommunications service of OPTS. All
managers have been appointed, and the new entity is functioning
satisfactorily. Initial problems with employee labor unions appear to have
been resolved. Although SONATEL's ability to sucessfully manage and
develop both the domestic and the international network remains to be
tested, the overall impression is that the current management team is
strong and highly motivated. The former general manager of TELESENEGAL is
in overall charge of the new entity. SONATEL's senior staff consists of



- 6 -
the most able managers of the two merged entities. They are qualified to
implement the proposed project; in addition, technical assistance will be
provided under the project to assist management in selected areas during
the current transition period and thereafter (para 3.06).
2.13      Staff - SONATEL took over existing telecommunications staff from
OPTS (1,740) and TELESENEGAL (290).  This initial staffing of 2,030 results
in a ratio of 93 staff per 1,000 DELs in service, which is high. Under the
terms of its Performance Contract (para. 2.19), SONATEL will control
recruitment and improve its personnel structure primarily through
attrition, highly selective recruitment, and staff training. In addition,
strict adherence to job descriptions and staff participation in management
committees to improve productivity, as practiced by TELESENEGAL prior to
sector restructuring, will be continued by SONATEL. These measures, and
the expected increase in the number of connected lines, will result in a
decrease of the staff ratio from 93 in 1986 to 50 in 1993. The staff ratio
is one of the principal performance indicators to be monitored during
project implementation (para 3.15).
2.14      Training - Two multinational telecommunications schools exist in
Senegal, one in Rufisque (lower level technical staff) and one in Dakar
(higher level staff). They were established with assistance from the
International Telecommmnication Union (ITU). During the project period,
the two multinational schools will be merged and located in Dakar, and
SONAIEL will take over the Rufisque facilities. ITU is expected to provide
technical assistance to implement this plan. The schools will provide most
of the technical staff training needed by SONATEL. Highly specialized and
University level training will continue to take place abroad. Training
needs will be established through evaluations against job descriptions and
on the basis of recommendations by ITU experts. In addition, training to
update technical staff will be provided by equipment suppliers. SONATEL
will continue in-house training programs for financial and administrative
staff previously provided by TELESENEGAL, and has committed itself under
its Performance Contract to spend the equivalent of 5% of its salary budget
on staff training. These arrangements are satisfactory.
2.15.     Billing and Collection - Prior to sector restructuring, OPTS was
responsible for billing and collection of domestic and international.
charges. Bills were prepared on a bi-monthly basis through the
Government's data processing department, but were frequently delayed by two
to three months. To minimize delays, SONATEL will in the future process
bills on its own computer system. An expert provided by the French Fond
d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) is assisting in this. SONAIEL's Performance
Contract epecifies that billing delays should be reduced from the current
average of 50 days to 20 days by the end of FY89; progress will be checked
through the performance monitoring system (para 3.15).
2.16      As of March 25, 1986, telecommunications accounts receivable were
CFAF 14.3 billion, equivalent to about nine months of billing. Of this,



Gr iernment owes an estimated CFAF 5.3 billion (equivalent to 24 months of
1- ling to Government); the exact amount of Government arrears will be
confirmed by May 31, 1986 and the private sector CFAF 9.0 billion
(equivalent to seven months of billing). Actual arrears are less, in view
of existing billing delays and a two-month period during which subscribers
may pay their bills. Given improved application of disconnection
procedures, as per SONATEL's Performance Contract, private sector arrears
should be manageable. Clearance of Government arrears has long been a
problem. However, under the terms of SONATEL's draft Performance Contract,
Government commits itself to repay CFAF 2.4 billion in FY86 and FY87 each
and the remaining CFAF 0.5 billion in FY88. The CFAF 4.4 billion in
cross-debt from SONATEL, mostly due to previous debt rescheduling, would
offset most of this. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
Government that it will: (a) settle its arrears in accordance with the
schedule stipulated in the Performance Contract; (b) ensure that adequate
annual budget provisions for payment of arrears and consumption are made;
and (c) settle future telecommunications bills within 90 days of the
billing date starting immediately and within 45 days by June 30, 1988 [para
5.01 (a)|. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit, SONAIEL
will present an accounts receivable aging schedule to IDA [para 5.02 (a)].
DurinLg negotiations, assurances were obtained that SONATEL will write off,
by December 31, 1986, receivables that are uncollectable [para 5.01 (b)3.
2.17      Accounting - SONATEL will keep accounts on an accrual basis and
in accordance with the Senegalese accounting plan. TELESENEGAL produced
its annual accounts within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In
recent years, OPTS has produced them within six months of the end of each
fiscal year. With the simplification of accounts resulting from the
separation of postal/financial services (para 2.09), SONATEL's unaudited
accounts are expected to be ready within four months after the end of each
fiscal year, which is satisfactory.
2.18      External Audits - During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that SONATEL will: (a) have its accounts audited annually by external
auditors acceptable to IDA; (b) present its unaudited financial statements
to IDA within four months after the end of each fiscal year; and (c)
present the external auditor's report to IDA within six months after the
end of each fiscal year [para 5.01 (c)l. This schedule is realistic.
C. Development
Sector Goals
2.19      The Seventh Senegalese Plan (FY86-FY89) contains the following
general objectives affecting the sector: (a) state enterprises should
improve their management and generate funds sufficient to finance an
adequate share of investments; (b) government subsidies to state



- 8 -
enterprises should be reduced or eliminated to save public funds and to
encourage increased efficiency; (c) the regions should be given increased
participation in the national economy; and (d) as a matter of high
priority, the telecommunications sector should be rehabilitated and
expanded. The emphasis is on self-sufficiency, efficiency, and agreed
operating policy frameworks in the form of Performance Contracts. A final
draft of SONATEL's Performance Contract, acceptable to SONATEL, Government
and IDA, was agreed upon during negotiations. Signature of this
performance Contract is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit
[para 5.02 (b)].
2.20      In accordance with the Plan's overall objectives, SONATEL's
objectives are to:
(a) rehabilitate existing installations, conduct systematic
maintenance, and make additional investments to bring
system utilization to a satisfactory level;
(b) expand sector facilities to meet expressed demand;
(c) increase operational efficiency and quality of service
through improved management, staff training and
maintenance;
(d) generate a strong cash flow to finance a major share of
investments, primarily through improved efficiency; and
Ce) make substantial net transfers to Government, directly
through income taxes and indirectly through custom duties
on imported equipment.
Sector Constraints
2.21      The recent sector restructuring should be instrumental in
overcoming some major past institutional problems. Firstly, the sector
organization was not suited to highly commercial telecommunications
activities. OPTS was directly supervised by Government and was burdened
with problems relating to the postal/financial services.  TELESENEGAL had
adequate autonomy, but was hampered by dependence on OPTS for subscriber
connections, maintenance of the domestic network, and bill collection.
Secondly, job descriptions for most OPTS staff were rarely applied and
there was inadequate delegation of authority and responsibility.
Recruitment policy frequently did not match needs with qualifications.
Thirdly, most investment planning for the domestic network was done by
consultants or by equipment suppliers; overall programing was merely a
listing of separate investments. This led to significant network



-9 -
imbalances, creating congestion in some areas and underutilization in
others.  And fourthly, maintenance of the domestic network was not
adequately organized. This led to neglect of equipment, increased
maintenance costs, and reduced the useful life of existing equipment.
2.22      Management was in the past the principal operative constraint on
development of the domestic telecommunications network. It was unable to
provide the necessary leadership for system development, both vis-a-vis
Government as well as its own staff. This resulted notably in stagnation
of investments even though financing was available, inability to connect
subscribers, and a lack of operating efficiency stemming from the absence
of financial management and of adequate recruitment policies. With the
creation of SONATEL and its stronger, more purposeful management team, this
constraint appears to have been substantially alleviated. Similarly, the
absence in the past of an agreed operating policy framework is a constraint
that will be eliminated upon signature of SONATEL's Performance Contract
(para 2.19).
Bank/IDA's Role and Strategy
2.23      Experience with Past Lending.  The Bank became involved in the
sector through the first telecommunications project (Loan 866-SE) of $6.25
million, approved in November 1972. The project, completed in December
1980, comprised two principal components: (a) rehabilitation,
modernization and expansion of local telephone facilities in Dakar and in
other cities and towns in the northern provinces; and (b) construction of
long distance radio links from Dakar to the north and from there eastwards
along the Senegal river, to support agricultural development. Technical
assistance was provided to improve staff training and financial
management. However, contrary to expectations, OPTS' management did not
take full advantage of training provided, neglected financial management
and maintenance, and was unable to introduce systematic overall planning
and programing. This caused delays, cost overruns, inadequately balanced
investments and a lack of operating efficiency. Under the First Parapublic
Sector Technical Assistance Project (Credit 764-SE) approved in 1979, IDA
provided further support to OPTS in accounting and financial management;
some improvement occurred (para 2.17). However, realizing the magnitude of
the restrictions imposed on sector development by the fragmentation of the
sector, Government decided to reorganize the sector (para 2.09).
2.24      Proposed Project.  IDA's role through this project is to address
the principal constraints facing the sector (paras 2.21 and 2.22). The
primary emphasisis on institutional development. Through prior sector
restructuring and agreement on a Performance Contract (paras 2.09 and
2.19), significant obstacles to improved sector management have already
been removed. The technical assistance component of this project aims to
provide added impetus to this process and provide management with valuable
support in critical areas.- IDA has been instrumental in bringing program



- 10 -
size down to levels that are feasible, both from the point of view of
physical implementation as well as availability of external financing at
concessionary terms. Finally, IDA focuses through this project on
rehabilitation, increased capacity utilization and improved maintenance as
the primary means of optimizing the contribution of the sector to the
economy.
III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. Description
The Y mam
3.01      SONATEL's investment program covers July 1, 1986 - June 30,
1993 and comprises ongoing works (15%), the proposed project (69%), and
future investments (16%). Ongoing works are being cofinanced by CCCE,
BOAD, CEDEAO, and by SONATEL. They consist predominantly of equipment
rehabilitation and will increase utilization of existing equipment in the
Cap Vert (Greater Dakar) region. IDA had a major impact in the formulation
of the proposed investment program by insisting on: (a) rehabilitation and
maintenance; (b) achieving a balanced network; and (c) network expansion if
of high priority and economically justified. Future investments consist
mostly of investments for the international network, commencing around
FY89.
The Project
3.02      The project will be implemented during FY87-93.  It comprises
the following components:
(a)  about 24,000 lines of (mainly) electronic switching
equipment and associated cable networks and
intra-regional junction, switching and transmission
facilities in the Cap Vert Region;
(b)  about 3,400 lines of electronic switching equipment and
associated buildings and cable networks for eight cities
in the Ziguinchor, Kolda, and Tambacounda regions, plus
interurban transmission facilities;
(c)  about 7,200 lines of electronic switching equipment,
associated buildings and cable networks for ten stations
in the Thies, Kaolack, and Fatick regions, plus
interurban transmission facilities;
(d)  facilities for linking Cap Skiring and Boucote to the
national telecommunications network;



- 11 -
(e) rehabilitation of various existing installations and
cable networks, and establishment of a national
maiutenance organization;
(f) various works in all regions (feeder links, multiplex
equipment, conventional and solar power installations,
etc.); and
(g) staff training, engineering and other technical
assistance.
Targets for the projected growth of telecomunmications facilities and
improvements in service quality during the project period are shown in
Annex 6. The resulting network configuration is shown in Map IBRD 19284 -
Senegal.
Project Description
(a) Physical Components
3.03      Under the first telecommunications project (para 2.23), the
capacity of switching installations and arteries in the cable network in
Dakar was increased. However, OPTS did not install sufficient additional
distribution cables. As a result, installed switching capacity is
underutilized. This situation is being corrected with ongoing works (para
3.01). Under the proposed project, switching and interconnection capacity
would be further expanded to meet part of the unsatisfied demand in the Cap
Vert region.
3.04      The 'Axe Nord' microwave li.nk, which functions unreliably, will
be rehabilitated under the project; the new maintenance organization (para
3.05) will ensure future proper functioning. In the South and Southeast,
existing microwave links cannot be fully utilized. Multiplex equipment
will be provided to increase utilization at a marginal investment cost.
Some economically or administratively important towns, located at or near
existing microwave links, will be connected at relatively low cost by
branch links.
3.05      Maintenance of domestic facilities (ex-OPTS) is inadequate with
about 15% of DELs out of order at any given time. This is due to poor
coordination of testing and repair; inadequately trained staff; and limited
availability of vehicles, spare parts, tools and testing equipments. The
proposed project will establish a national maintenance organization within
SONATEL with well defined tasks, responsibilities and equipment. Based on
a proposal prepared with ITU assistance, maintenance will be coordinated
centrally from Dakar and regionally through provincial centers. Under the
proposed project, these cenLters will be provided with trained staff,
vehicles and equipment.



- 12 -
(b) Technical Assistance
3.06      Technical assistance is currently being provided to SONATEL from
a variety of sources: (i) engineering and rehabilitation of installations
(FAC); (ii) computerized billing system (FAC); (iii) introduction of data
processing in accounting and administration (CIDA); (iv) management and
operation of power supply and transmission equipment (CIDA); (v)
preparation of a Master Plan (UNDP/ITU); and (vi) personnel management
(IDA-Second Parapublic Technical Assistance Project, Credit 1398-SE).
Total assistance from these sources during the project implementation
period is about 270 manmonths. In addition, SONAIEL has engaged, under its
own financing, experts in the operation of hightly specialized
telecommunications installations and a general management expert for a
total of about 36 manmonths. During project appraisal (June, 1985) IDA
identified the following broad areas where expert support is considered
necessary: planning, data processing, management information, and supply
logistics. SONATEL expects to be able to obtain grant financing from
sources other than IDA for experts in these areas, with terms of reference
(Annex 14) and qualifications acceptable to the Association. Appointment
of these consultants is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit
[para 5.02-(c)]. Due to the phasing of the tariff study (para 4.12), a
tariff expert will not need to be recruited until the beginning of 1987.
During project implementation other areas may be identified where expert
assistance is required to ease transition and project implementation
problems. An amount of US$0.5 million (36 manmonths) has been allocated
within the credit to meet additional technical assistance requirements as
necessary. Terms of reference for these additional experts would be agreed
to during project supervision.
B. Costs and Financing
Project Cost
3.07      Total project costs are estimated at CFAF 56.5 billion ($156.9
million), including foreign costs of CFAF 32.7 billion ($90.8 million) and
local costs of CFAF 23.8 billion ($66.1 million). Local costs include CFAF
12.8 billion ($35.5 million) in customs duties and taxes, equivalent to 40%
of the c.i.f. value of imported goods. Project base cost estimates are
based on mid-1984 prices experienced by Senegal and other francophone
countries in Western Africa, and adjusted to mid-1986 level. Detailed
project costs are presented in Annex 2 and summarized in Table 3.1 below:

Contingencies
3.08      Physical contingencies have been calculated at 5Z for imported
equipment and 10% for services and local cost items. Price contingencies
for local costs have been computed at 7% annually. The standard rates have
been used for price contingencies for foreign costs, i.e., 7.0% (1986);
7.0% (1987); 7.5Z (1988); 7.7Z (1989); 7.6% (1990); and 4.5% per annum
thereafter.
ProJect Financing
3.09      The project's foreign costs ($90.8 million) will be financed by a
number of cofinanciers and SONATEL (para 3.10). CCCE, together with
guaranteed private credits, will provide foreign cost financing for
switching and intraregional transmission in the Cap Vert region. AfDB will
finance investments under the national maintenance plan. BOAD intends to
finance switching and transmission in the Ziguinchor, Kolda and Tambacounda
regions. IDA would finance the remaining project components. The above
financing arrangements were confirmed during negotiations. Fullfillment of
the conditions of effectiveness of the CCCE and AfDB loans, which have
already been appraised, is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit [para 5.02 (d)]. Appraisal of the BOAD-financed component is
expected in the beginning of FY87.
3.10      SONATEL will finance all local costs ($66.1 million) and the
foreign exchange gap of $25.6 million from net internal cash generation
(para 4.07). Efforts are continuing to find additional cofinancing for the
foreign cost portion the project. The current financing plan is summarized
in Table 3.2 below:

During negotiations, assurances were obtained from SONATEL that it will
seek prior agreement with IDA on any proposed changes in the investment
program that would increase its cost by more than 10% in any one year or
that would substantially alter network balance [para 5.01 Cd)].

3.12      Equipment for $19.1 million to be financed by IDA will be
procured through ICB in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Some spares
and equipment to be financed by IDA ($2.1 million), required to remove
physical bottlenecks, would be procured on the basis of negotiated
contracts with existing suppliers. IDA's approval will be required for the
negotiated contracts to ensure that the prices are comparable to those
likely under ICB. Limited international bidding (LIB) would be used to
procure $0.3 million of test instruments, tools and specialized vehicles,
for which there is a limited number of suppliers. Consulting services for
$0.5 million will be procured according to Bank guidelines for the use of
consultants. IDA financed contracts of over $100,000 each will be subject
to prior review covering about 70% of all contracts for equipment. Other
IDA financed contracts will be subject to post-award review. Procurement



- 16 -
under cofinancing will be in accordance with the guidelines of the
respective institutions. Project preparation is well underway;
specifications for major project items are either already prepared or are
nearing completion. To minimize implementation delays, the issuance of
invitations to bid for goods and services to be financed by IDA for an
amount equivalent to 50% of the credit amount is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit [para 5.02 (e)].
Disbursements
3.13      The proposed IDA credit of $22.J million would be disbursed
against full standard documentation for: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures
for goods, including the foreign exchange component of equipment
installation; and (b) 100% of total expenditures for technical assistance.
A Special Account of $1.5 million, to be maintained in US dollars in a bank
acceptable to IDA, will be established. This $1.5 million is equivalent to
about four months' estimated expenditure during the peak disbursement
period of 1987-1990. The Special Account would be used for disbursement
against all expenditures. Applications for replenishment will be submitted
on a bimonthly basis. Disbursements for amounts of less than US$50,000
would be made against Statements of Expenditure. The estimated
disbursement schedule (Annex 5) is in line with standard Bank disbursement
profiles for the country. The Credit closing date is expected to be
June 30, 1993. The allocation of the credit by category of disbursement is
shown in Table 3.4.

TOTAL:                    22.0
Project Implementation
3.14      Project implementation will be coordinated by the technical
department of SONATEL. Installation of equipment will be done by suppliers
under supervision from SONATEL. Local contractors would be hired for civil
wores and other suitable tasks. The transfer of knowledge to SONATEL staff
would be achieved through staff participation in installation and testing
work, training provided by suppliers and institutions abroad, as well as in



- 17 -
local training centers (para. 2.14). The project implementation schedule
is at Annex 3 and Annex 14, page 4. SONATEL will submit quarterly progress
reports on the physical implementation of the project to IDA. The project
is expected to be substantially completed by June 30, 1992, with final
acceptance testing and guarantee payments by June 30, 1993.
PLrformance Monitoring
3.15      Improvement of SONATEL's management systems will be monitored
through selected performance indicators on service quality, financial
performance, operating efficiency and program implementation (Annex 6).
This will enable SONATEL to take the required corrective actions in a
timely manner.  While the targets for later years are indicative, those for
fiscal years 1987 and 1988 were agreed upon with SONATEL during
negotiations, as representing desirable and feasible levels of attainment.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from SONATEL that: (i) the
targets for each of the subsequent fiscal years will be agreed to with IDA
by March 31 of the preceeding fiscal year; and (ii) SONATEL will furnish
semiannually, for IDA review, a report on its performance against these
indicators [para 5.01 (e)].
IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Financial Analysis
Past Financial Performance
4.01      In the recent past, the financial performance of OPTS and
TELESENEGAL was satisfactory.
4.02      OPTS' financial statements for FY81-85 are at Annex 7.  OPTS did
not keep separate accounts for telecommunications and postal/financial
services, although this was a covenanted requirement under the first
prcject (Loan 866-SE). Pro-forma separation of accounts was obtained
during project preparation.
4.03      The telecommunications branch produced a rate of return of about
15% per year on the book value of average net fixed assets in operation,
with an operating ratio of about 60%. Given the low level of investments
over the past four years, debt remained low at about 18% of debt plus
equity, net internal cash generation averaged the equivalent of 190% of
investments, and the debt service coverage ratio averaged 3.8 times. The
current ratio, however, was inadequate at about 0.9, particularly because
accounts receivable were very high (para 2.16).
4.04      TELESENEGAL's financial statements (Annex 8) indicate a strong
financial performance, as should be expected from an entity dealing solely
with international telecommunications. Net income, after payment of a 33%



- 18 -
income tax, doubled over 1981-85. The operating ratio remained low at
about 35%. The after tax rate of return on average net fixed assets in
operation was around 43% and net internal cash generation averaged the
equivalent of 253Z of investment expenditures. Debt service coverage was
over five times and debt was reduced to only 13% of debt plus equity. The
current ratio was inadequate at about 1.6, because accounts receivable
(mostly due from OPTS) were very high (para 2.16).
Present Financial Position
4.05      The preliminary opening balance sheet of SONATEL as of October 1,
1985, is given below.
Table 4.1: SONATEL - OPENING BALANCE SHEET
CFAF Million
Assets
Net fixed assets                     18,971
Work in progress                      1,967
Other long-Term assets                1,689
Current assets                      21,800
TOTAL             44,427
Liabilities
Equity                              21,425
Long-term debt                        6,828
Current liabilities                  16,174
TOTAL             44,427
The current ratio of 1.3 is unsatisfactory because of the high level of
accounts receivable. Mearures to reduce receivables are being taken (para
2.16). The debt/debt plus equity ratio is strong at 24%. Accounting firms
are currently finalizing SONATEL's opening balance sheet; their work is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1986. Agreement between Government
and SONATEL on the latter's definitive opening balance sheet is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit [para 5.02 (f)l.
Future Financial Performance
4.06      Forecast financial statements for FY1986-1993 are in Annex 9.
Notes and assumptions are in Annex 10. Assuming a 10% average tariff
increase in FY1989, SONATEL's financial performance and position are
expected to be satisfactory.  Key financial indicators projected for
FY1986-1993 are shown below:

b/ As a percentage of construction requirements.
4.07      Despite substantial investments during the project period, the
financial indicators would remain satisfactory. The operating ratio would
range from 59 in FY86 to 74 by FY93. The after tax rate of return on
average net fixed assets in service would decrease from the abnormally high
levels achieved in the past (as a result of high tariffs and limited
investments), but would remain satisfactory through 1993, at 10% or above.
Debt service coverage would be adequate at over 2.5 times and the debt
level would remain low around 30% of debt plus equity, despite the increase
in borrowings (para 4.08). The current ratio would be adequate at 1.5.
Net internal cash generation would finance on average 62% of investment
expenditures. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that SONATEL
will finance from net internal cash generation not less than 50% of
investment expenditures, on a moving three year average basis, in any one
year during the project implementation period [?ara 5.01 (f)].
4.08      Sources and applications of funds during the project
implementation period are summarized in Table 4.3 below:

*1 Financing for ongoing works.
The financing plan was confirmed during negotiations (para 3.09). Interest
rates, grace and amortization periods for the CCCE, AfDB, and BOAD loans
are assumed to be the standard terms and condit.1ons of the respective
institutions. The interest rate on private guaranteed credits is assumed
to be 9.5Z interest, zero grace and a five-year repayment period. The IDA
credit would be onlent by Government to SONATEL at the standard Bank
interest r_te prevailing at the date of the Credit Agreement, with
repayment over fifteen years following five years of grace. SONATEL will
bear the foreign exchange risk. Conclusion of a subsidary loan agreement,
acceptable to IDA, between Government and SONATEL is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit [para 5.02 (g)3.
Transfers to OPCE
4.09      OPCE (para 2.09) will need financial support during a transition
period of about five years, after which it is expected to break even on
operations. In the past, the telecommunications sector subsidized the
postal/financial services through OPTS. Government would have prefered
continuation of a direct financial link between SONATEL and OPCE; however,



- 21 -
this would not enhance the autonomy and efficiency of OPCE. Under the
terms of the Performance Contract (para 2.19), SONATEL will transfer
to Government gradually decreasing amounts starting at CFAF 1.7 billion in
FY86; Government, in turn, will transfer these funds to OPCE. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that: (a) any
services rendered by SONATEL to OPCE will be paid in full by the latter;
and (b) the level of the annual subsidy from SONATEL to OPCE will decline
each year and end by June 30, 1989 [para 5.01 (g)].
B.   Economic Analysis
4.10      The economic analysis covers ongoing and new works under
SONATEL's FY86-93 investment program, except those components which will
not start until FY89, and whose benefits are unlikely to accrue until the
mid 1990's (para 3.01). Given the interdependencies between program
components, it is not possible to evaluate separately the project
components proposed for IDA financing.
Benefits
4.11      Telecommunications services benefit all sectors of Senegal's
economy and promote more efficient use of capital and energy resources.
They are likely to play a particularly significant role in Senegal in:
(a) promoting industrial and commercial development in the Cap-Vert
region and in the regions around Diourbel, Thies, Tambacounda,
Kaolack, Ziguinchor and Kolda;
(b) developing tourism;
(c) stimulating agricultural development through better access to
market information and more efficient management;
(d) improving the services offered by regional development agencies;
(e) facilitating the improvement and extension of health, education,
government administration and other services to rural areas;
(f) substituting for transport and facilitating vehicle coordination;
and
(g) mobilizing domestic savings by transfering part of SONATEL's net
income to Government (para 4.15).
Tariff Policy
4.12      A summary of tariffs as of July 1, 1985 is shown in Annex 15.
Telecommunications tariffs were increased regularly in the past. The most
recent increase effective FY84 averaged 10%, bringing the base call charge



- 22 -
to CFAF 55. Senegal's tariff level and structure are comparable to those
of neighboring West-African countries; tariff levels are relatively high by
iuternational standards. Current tariff levels are expected to be adequate
through FY88, with a 10% average revenue increase required in FY89 to
ensure adequate cash flow (para 4.07). However, the tariff structure
should be reviewed to ensure economic efficiency in the use of existing
plant and new investments. For example, the connection charge and monthly
rental in Dakar are relatively modest but the base call charge is
relatively high. This could encourage a high demand for new connections
from customers with low prospective usage, resulting in underutilized
networks. There is no peak/off peak pricing, and local calls are not
metered. Under the proposed project a tariff study would be carried out by
SONATEL, with the assistance of an IDA financed expert. (para 3.06). During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from SONATEL that it will carry out,
and furnish to IDA, the tariff study by January 1, 1988 and implement its
recommendations, as appropriate, by July 1, 1988 [para 5.01 (h)].
Return on Investment
4.13      The internal financial rate of return on the investment program
is estimated at about 13% (Annex 13). The quantifiable economic rate of
return is about 19%. This estimate understates total program benefits,
since it does not take into account the total consumer surplus or the
secondary benefits derived from telecommunications, such as more efficient
use of development, responsiveness to market forces, more effective health
services, etc.
Risks
4.14      The program faces no unusual risks.  The merger of TELESENEGAL
and OPTS into SONATEL appears to have proceeded smoothly. The project's
technical assistance component will provide management with expert
assistance, should problems develop in specific areas. The principal risks.
are that the new entity will not be able to implement the investment
program as rapidly as scheduled; and that it will not be able to achieve
prompt recovery of arrears and future billings. Protection against the
first risk is provided by the fact that implementation of the first phase
of network rehabilitation is well underway and that many contracts will be
on a turn-key basis, and by the technical assistance provided by IDA and
other donors. Protection against the risk of low recovery of receivables
is provided by Government's assurances concerning arrears settlement and
payment of future bills as well as the improved billing and collection
procedures to be implemented under the project. A sensitivity test on the
rate of return (Annex 13) indicates that a combination of a 20% increase in
capital expenditures and operating costs combined with a 20Z reduction in
revenues, which is extremely unlikely, would reduce the estimated economic
rate of return from 19% to about 10%. A two-year delay in all benefits
without postponement of costs would reduce the economic rate of return to
about 13%.



- 23 -
Fiscal Impact
4.15      Government will get substantial revenues from the
telecommunications sector without having to provide budgetary support for
operations or investments. During the project implementation period, the
33% income tax is expected to generate CFAF 17.7 billion in revenues for
Government. Amounts transferred to Government to subsidize OPCE (para
4.09) are estimated at CFAF 5.8 billion. In addition, SONATEL would pay
duties and taxes equivalent to 40% of the c.i.f. value of imported
equipment (about CFAF 12.8 billion) during the project implementation
period, plus an additional CFAF 2.5 billion on imported operating equipment
items and services. Thus, total transfers from SONATEL to Government would
be CFAF 38.8 billion ($107.8 million) during the project period.
Least Cost Solution
4.16      The investment program (para 3.01) is the least cost solution for
providing the planned service levels, within the constraints imposed by the
configuration and technology of the existing telecommunications network.
The timing and dimensioning of various elements in the system are based on
accepted engineering practice with regard to selection of techniques and
equipment.
Environmental and Health Aspects
4.17      The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or
health impacts. On the contrary, increased use of telecommunications
services produces more efficient use of the transportation system, reduces
environmental pollution, and promotes energy conservation. In addition,
improved telecommunications services improve the delivery system for
routine and emergency health services.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, the following assurances were obtained:
(a)  government will:  (i) settle its arrears in accordance
with the schedule stipulated in SONATEL's Performance
Contract; (ii) make adequate annual budget provsions for
payment of arrears and consumption; and (iii) settle
future telecommunications bills within 90 days of billing
starting immediately and within 45 days by the end of
FY88 (para 2.16);
(b) SONATEL will by December 31, 1986, write off receivables
that are uncollectable (para 2.16);



- 24 -
(c) SONATEL will: (i) have its accounts audited annually by
external auditors acceptable to IDA; (ii) present its
unaudited statements to IDA within four months after the
end of each fiscal year; and (iii) present the external
auditor's report within six months after the end of each
fiscal year (para 2.18);
(d) SONATEL will seek prior agreement with IDA on any
proposed changes in its investment program that would
increase its cost by more than 10% in any one year or
that would substantially alter network balance (para
3.10);
(e) (i) performance targets for 1987 and 1988; (ii) the
targets for each of the subsequent fiscal years will be
agreed to with -IDA by March 31 of the preceeding fiscal
year; and (iii) SONATEL will furnish semiannually, for
IDA review, a report on its performance against these
indicators (para 3.15);
Cf) SONATEL will finance from net internal cash generation
not less than 50% of investment expenditures on a moving
three year average basis in any one year during the
project implementation period (para 4.07);
(g) (i) any services rendered by SONATEL to OPCE will be paid
in full by the latter; and (1i) the level of the annual
subsidy from SONATEL to OPCE wiln decline each year and
end by June 30, 1989 (para 4.09); and
(h) SONATEL will carry out, and furnish to IDA, the tariff
study by January 1, 1988, and Implement its
recommendations, as appropriate, by July 1, 1988 (para
4.12).
5.02      The following are conditions of effectiveness:
(a) presentation of an accounts receivable aging schedule by
SONATEL (para 2.16).
(b)  signature of the Performance Contract between Government
and SONATEL (para 2.19);
(c) appointment of consultants with terms of reference and
qualifications acceptable to IDA (para 3.06);
(d) conditions of effectiveness of the CCCE and AfDB loan
agreements have been met (para 3.09);



- 25 -
(e) the issuance of invitations to bid for goods and services
to be financed by IDA for an amount equivalent to 50X of
the credit amount (para 3.12);
(f) agreement on the definitive opening balance sheet of
SONATEL between Government and SONATEL (para 4.05); and
(g) conclusion of a subsidary loan agreement acceptable to
IDA between Government and SONAIEL (para 4.08);
5.03      Subject to agreement on the above, the project is suitable for an
IDA credit of $22.0 million equivalent at standard terms.

B. DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING INSTALLATIONS
1. Automatic Telephone Exchanges
All automatic telephone exchanges in Senegal are
electromechanical. The principal exchange for Dakar, Medina, has a
capacity of 18,000 lines and a 68Z exchange fill. Tbree 1,000 line



- 27 -                          ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 3
exchanges in Cap-Vert are filled to an average of 62%. One 500 line
exchange is filled to 91%. This ROTARY R6 exchange was installed in 1956;
all other exchanges in Cap-Vert are of the cross-bar Pentaconta type,
installed in 1978 or later.
Of the 18 provincial exchanges, seven are of the Pentaconta type,
installed in 1968 and 1969. Their capacity varies between 50 and 1,040
lines, filled between 39% and 95%. The remaining exchanges are of crossbar
Janus type, installed in 1974 and 1978. Their capacity varies between 96
and 1,000 lines and on average they are 87% filled.
The national interurban switching center is of the Pentaconta
type, installed in 1978. Four regional interurban centers, two of
Pentaconta and two of Janus type, were installed between 1969 and 1982.
Some expansion is overdue. The international exchange is also of the
Pentaconta type, installed in 1977. Its capacity of 414 circuits is
adequate until the end of the decade.
2. Manual Telephone Exchanges
All 78 manual exchanges in provincial cities and towns were
installed in the 1960s or earlier. They are mostly worn.
3. Local Cable Network
The network consists of about 20,546 pairs of primary cable in
Cap-Vert and 1,205 pairs in provincial cities, and about 16,000 pairs of
distribution cables in Cap-Vert and 8,826 pairs in the province. These
figures, esve .ially when compared with the number of DELs, reflect the
existing Lmbalance in the capital region network, preventing the connection
of new customers. Moreover, more than 50% of the distribution cables are
of very poor quality due to age and improper maintenance.
4. Microwave Links
About 91% of the 71,680 interurban circuit-kilometers are
conveyed over line-of-sight radio links. The attached map, IBRD
19284-Senegal, shows the extension of these links. Most of them operate in
microwave bands. Quality is good but operation is marred by inadequate and
unreliable power supply systems and poor caintenance.
5. Other Transmission
Open wire lines and multi-circuit carrier systems on such lines
are widely used. These transmission facilities require a larger operation
and maintenance effort than the organization has been able to provide

Page 3 of 3
resulting in poor service quality. Within the program, some facilities
will be replaced with more modern equipment, others will be rehabilitated.
The limited number of HF-circuits will also be rehabilitated.
6. Telex
There are two telex exchanges in Dakar:
(i) an electromechanical exchange, type TW K9/39, to which
all subscribers and two 50-number remote units (Kaolack,
Zinguinchor) are connected. It was installed in 1968 and
extended in 1979. Its capacity is now exhausted and the
type is no longer manufactured; and
(ii) an electronic exchange, type ELTEX, used for
international traffic. It has some spare capacity to
accomodate future traffic increases.
7. International Service Facilities
A 'Standard A' earth station, operating within the INTELSAT
system, was commissioned in 1972. Senegal has direct circuits to ten
countries through this. To expand connections, SONATEL is studying the
feasibility of a second antenna at the same station.
Four trarsatlantic cables terminate in the Dakar area:
i) ANTINEA to Morocco and France;
(ii) FRATERNITE to Ivory Coast and Nigeria;
(iii) ATLANTIS to Brasil; and
(iv) ATLANTIS II to Portugal.
They are used for both direct and transit traffic.
Microwave radio relay links provide connections to Mali,
Mauitania, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. They are extensions of the general
radio relay network (see item 4 above) and have similar shortcomings.
An HF-Receiving station and an HF-transmitting station for
international traffic exist. However, most of the circuits have been
replaced by liaisons of better quality and reliability, carried via the
satellite and submarine cable systems.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investments
1.        -he project is an integral part of SONATEL's investment program
for the period FY86-FY93, which includes ongoing works and other items not
included in the project. The close relationship between project and
nonproject items makes any attempt at separation arbitrary. Therefore, the
rates of return are calculated on the basis of SONATEL's entire investment
program, with the exception of those investments that will not get started
until FY89 and the benefits of which will not accrue until the mid-1990s.
The program components thus excludee r ,- grouped tmder the heading 'Future
Works" in Annex 2.
2.        The net benefit period runs from 1986 to 2009 when, on average,
facilities provided under the project will have reached the end of their
useful life. Maintenance and replacements during their life are included
in operating costs. No residual values have been taken into account as
their discounted value would be minimal. Costs exclude depreciation and
interest. Incremental operating revenues and expenses relate to expected
additional telephone and telex subscribers and to additional traffic
brought about by the progam. From 1993 on, operating costs and revenues
related to the program are assumed to remain constant.
3.        A summary of the cost and benefit streams is given below in CFAF
billion. All revenues and costs have been deflated to bring them to their
comparable 1986 price levels.

4.        The internal rate of return of the above financial streams is
13%. However, this calculation understates the benefits to be derived from
SONAIEL's investment program. It does not take into account consumer
surplus and indirect and external benefits received by non users of the
telecommunications services. A portion of the consumer surplus was
estimated by assuming (a) that new consumers are similar to the average
existing consumer and (b) that existing and new subscribers will be willing
to pay for telecommunications services the same prices in real terms as
they pay today. Based on these assumptions, adjusting for taxes and
duties, the minimum estimate of the economic rate of return for the program
is 19Z.
5.        A sensitivity analysis was made on the economic rate of return
with the following results:
20% increase in capital expenditures      -          15%
20% increase in operating expenditures    -          18%
20% decrease in operating revenues        -          14%
Combination of above                      -          10%
2 year delay in benefits                  -          13%

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Consultants' Terms of Reference
The principal objective of the technical assistance component of
the proposed project is to provide expert guidance in areas of perceived
weakness in SONATEL and to provide specific support in areas where the
merger of domestic and international telecommunications services poses
special problems during the transition period. The experts would lay down
the framework for the tasks to be performed and make periodic visits to
Senegal to check on progress made and provide further guidance to SONATEL
staff, who would perform most of the work.
1. Planning
Objective: To introduce systematic and integrated planning and
programming of a nationwide telecomminications network.
Main Tasks:
Ca) recommend procedures for application of the ITU master plan and
for its periodic revision and updating;
(b) review the planning department's tasks and responsibilities
within SONATEL. The focus should be on improving coordination
between planning on the one hand and finance, engineering and
supplies on the other hand;
(c) review the responsibilities and internal organization of the
planning units responsible for: (i) corporate planning; (ii)
network utilization and expansion; and (iii) major changes of
equipment and of customer services; and
(d) design a job order system covering all items of work that will
eventually be c. irged to the fixed assets account. The system
should cover utilization of all financial, personnel and material
resources.
2. Data Processing
Objective: To introduce a comprehensive data processing system
in SONATEL.



- 54 -
ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 4
Main Tasks:
(a) review capacity of SONATEL's data processing facilities and staff
and recommend improvements, including training programs, where
necessary;
(b)  identify all areas where data processing needs to be introduced
immediately in order to arrive at a basic comprehensive data
processing system. As a minimum, applications should include
billing, collection and customer accounts, payroll, and such
major accounting applications as inventories, work in progress,
assets in service, and long and short term debt:
(c) supervise selection and modification of computer programs and
their satisfactory functioning; and
Cd) liaise with the management information expert.
3. Management Information
Objective: Introduce a management information system that
selectively produces information needed at different levels of management.
Main tasks:
(a) determine information requirements at different levels within
SONATEL (top management, department directors, section chiefs);
(b) set up report formats, including formats necessary to produce the
quarterly progress reports and reports on performance monitoring
to be submitted to IDA; and
(c) liaise with the data processing expert.
4. Tariffs
Objective: Review the existing tariff structure and recommend
necessary changes based primarily on economic criteria but also taking into
account national policy and social considerations and SONATEL's financial
performance targets.
Nain tasks:
Ca) review demand characteristics for each of the services offered
and demand elasticity;
(b) review all usage data including usage patterns by group of
subscribers, traffic, call rate and revenue analyses, with each
set of analyses subgrouped as appropriate;



- 55 -
ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 4
(c) determine desirable tariff structure based on the foregoing
analyses and long run marginal cost pricing;
(d) modify the economic tariff structure as necessary by taking into
account SONATEL's financial performance targets and national
policy considerations; ;and
(e) prepare a manual on the methodology, timing and organizational
issues necessary to obtain periodical reviews of SONATEL's tariff
structure.
5. Supply logistics
Objective: Set up an efficient inventory management system under
which materials and spare parts will be available on time and in the
necessary quantities where needed.
Main Tasks:
Ca) set up a system to determine projected needs in materials and
spare parts by regional center, and determine lowest priced
sources of supply;
(b) establish procedures for: (i) periodic review and updating of the
store catalogue and the maximum and minimum quantities to be
ordered for all items; (ii) distribution of materials to regional
stores; (iii) procurement; and (iv) disposal of items that are no
longer useful;
Cc) prepare: (i) specifications for the various kinds of vehicles to
be purchased; (ii) criteria for vechicle in-house servicing and
subcontracting the work; and (iii) performance indicators for
operation and servicing of these vehicles; and
(d) set out the tasks to be performed by SONATEL's work shop. The
system should ensure that detailed shop-orders are prepared for
each item of work to be undertaken and should provide for
follow-up action after completion of each item; and
(e) liaise with the data processing expert for items (a) and (b)
above.
