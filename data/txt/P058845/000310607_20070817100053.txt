F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project aimed to provide more efficient, safe and effective transport infrastructure in
support of social and economic development in Jiangxi Province. To meet the above
development objective, the project was to produce the following outputs: (a) traffic
congestion relieved and mobility increased in the Nanchang-Shenzhen transport corridor;
(b) accessibility to low-income areas in the province improved; (c) safety of road
transport improved; and (d) institutional capacity of the Jiangxi Provincial
Communications Department (JPCD) and related sector institutions strengthened.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO and Key Indicators were not revised.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At appraisal, China was growing at 8 to 10% p.a. and continues to do so now. This strong
economic growth generated high growth in transport demand and also a rapid shift
towards highway transport. Due to its historical underinvestment in transport, China's
road network ranked, and still is, among the sparsest in the world relative to land area or
population. This created a need to significantly enhance the road infrastructure to support
the economic growth.

During the period of the 8th, 9th and 10th Five-Year Plans (FYP), covering the years
1990 through 2005, China completed nearly 41,000 km of high-grade tolled expressways
comprising the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS), or as it is now called, the
National Expressway Network (NEN). The second Jiangxi Highway Project formed a key
part of the NEN, as a section of the Beijing-Nanchang-Shenzhen corridor. During this
period approximately 400,000 km of local and township roads were also improved. This
was done by investing upwards of US$40 billion per year, the bulk of which was on the
NEN. At the same time, the Government intensified policy and regulatory reforms1.

Sector work carried out in years prior to the project, together with several highway policy
seminars, identified five main challenges in the sector, as follows:

    · building sector institutions (including for the critical issue of road safety);
    · strengthening resource mobilization;
    · enhancing access to remote/low income areas;
    · sustaining road maintenance; and
    · improving construction quality.

The sector issues to be addressed by the project were: expansion of highway capacity,
relieving poverty, improving highway safety, developing institutional capacity, and
improving highway maintenance.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project's development objective was to provide more efficient, safe and effective
transport infrastructure in support of social and economic development in Jiangxi
Province.

The project was to help stimulate social and economic development, reduce poverty and
thus decrease disparities within the region. This would be done through the following



1See "China's Expressways: Connecting People and Markets for Equitable Development". EASTR
Working Paper No. 7, August 2006 for further details on the NEN development.


                                                1

outputs: (i) traffic congestion relieved and mobility increased in the Nanchang-Shenzhen
transport corridor; (ii) accessibility to low-income areas in the province improved; (iii)
safety of road transport improved; and (iv) institutional capacity of the Jiangxi Provincial
Communications Department (JPCD) and related sector institutions strengthened.

A number of key indicators for the project were established and are in the Data Sheet,
Section F. The main indicators were: (i) travel time reduction in the Taihe-Ganzhou
corridor; (ii) average daily traffic on new expressway and existing national road (NH105);
(iii) average daily traffic on rural roads in affected areas; (iv) number of days that rural
roads in low-income areas were closed to traffic; (v) number of traffic accidents on
NH105 (fatalities and serious injuries) reduced; and (vi) increase in the Gross Output
Value of Industry and Agriculture (GOVIA) in the project area.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification

The PDO and Key Indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The major beneficiaries of the project were:

    · The communities along the expressway corridor and the local communities and
        road users in the areas of the local road improvement program. Out of the seven
        counties in the project influence area, four were designated as poor counties. The
        population of the seven counties was 3.3 million, or 7.8% of Jiangxi's total. Most
        of the province's poor live in the region.
    · The intercity traffic between cities in the corridor and beyond through reduced
        distances, travel time savings, vehicle operating costs, and reduced traffic
        accidents.
    · The JPCD and related institutions from institutional strengthening and training
        activities covered by the project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

A. Highway Capacity Expansion: (US$447.2 million including contingencies)

Construction of Taihe-Ganzhou Expressway (TGE): (US$396.8 million including
contingencies)

The Taihe-Ganzhou Expressway (TGE) was the project's main investment. The 128 km
expressway formed part of the Beijing-Nanchang-Shenzhen expressway. It serves
Ganzhou, the second largest city in Jiangxi. The TGE was designed according to the
Ministry of Communications (MOC) standards, with 2 x 2 lanes, a design speed of 100
km/h, and a subgrade width of 26 m. It included two long tunnels totaling 3,320 m, four
interchanges, four toll stations, two service areas and two rest areas. It includes one
management and maintenance centre near Ganzhou and two monitoring centers. The cost
above includes all civil works, buildings, and electrical and mechanical (E&M)
equipment.

Construction of Interconnecting Roads: (US$33.2 million including contingencies)

Three Class 2 interconnecting roads totaling 49 km linking the TGE to Wan'an, Suichuan
and Ganzhou, and thus to the local highway network in southern Jiangxi.

Construction Supervision: (US$9.6 million including contingencies)

A combined team of local engineers, technicians and other personnel, supported by
international engineers integrated into the supervisory organization.

Equipment: (US$7.6 million including contingencies)

Procurement of equipment to: (i) maintain national and provincial highways; (ii) support
laboratories and quality control work; and (iii) strengthen the JPCD and its relevant
agencies and institutions.

B. Road Improvement in the Poor Counties (RIPC): (US$39.4 million including
    contingencies)

This component was designed to help people in poor counties increase their incomes by
improving road access to product markets, employment opportunities, social services and
facilities. The program included roads totaling about 180 km in length, of which 81 km
will be upgraded to Class II and 99 km to Class III.

C. Highway Safety: (US$2.3 million including contingencies)

The highway safety component was designed to help reduce Jiangxi's accident rate. The
component included several activities: (i) road safety at roadwork sites; (ii) road safety
audit checklists; (iii) a pilot project on the identification and remedy of hazardous
locations (i.e. black spots); and (iv) highway safety seminars.


                                               3

D. Institutional Development: (US$2.5 million including contingencies)

The strategic objectives of the institutional development were to restructure the
institutional framework of the JPCD so that it would be able to respond rapidly to the
changing economic and competitive environment in China. This was done through: (i)
domestic and international training; (ii) organizational changes to improve traffic safety
activities; (iii) executing a pilot study to establish `maintenance centers' to undertake
maintenance on a commercial basis; and (iv) procuring equipment for institutional
strengthening, environmental protection, and road maintenance.

E. Land Acquisition and Resettlement: (US$31.7 million)

This consisted of establishing the framework for resettlement and undertaking all
resettlement activities for the TGE, the interconnecting roads, and the 182 km of local
roads. This component was financed by the borrower.

1.6 Revised Components

There were three revisions made to the project components:

    · The Ganzhou interconnecting road was cancelled. It was replaced by a new
        expressway section, locally financed. It was considered that an 11 km expressway
        section would serve Ganzhou better than the original Class II road since it would
        also ultimately form part of the Xiamen-Chengdu expressway.
    · Two additional interchanges were added to the project at the request of county
        authorities to improve the access of local people to the expressway: Wan'an and
        Hengshi. These were financed entirely with domestic funds; and
    · One rest area was not completed because it was interfering with the new Wan'an
        interchange. It was also not needed because without it there were still reasonable
        distances between the other rest and annex areas along the expressway.

1.7 Other significant changes

In 2004 the JPCD cancelled US$54.77 from Part A.1 (a) of the loan as the main civil
works on the expressway were complete and it was considered that the funds were not
required.

In 2006 after a final reconciliation of the accounts for the project there was an unpaid
sum of US$18.75 m on the civil works component. The financing percentage for civil
works under Part A.1 (a) was increased from 44% to 91% to use the remaining loan funds.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

A. Project Preparation

The project objectives were fully consistent with the Government's priorities and the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The major objectives of the CAS were to support
growth and assist in poverty reduction and better governance (see Section 3.1). These
objectives were clearly supported by the project (see Section 1). The project also had
strong support from central as well as provincial agencies. The local governments and
people met by Bank preparation missions also expressed their full support and
emphasized the need for the project to accelerate development of the area. A remaining
section to the Guangdong border, south of the project, which was the last gap in the
Nanchang-Shenzhen corridor, was programmed for implementation in the 10th FYP and
subsequently completed. The JPCD also showed strong ownership of the poverty
alleviation objective through their commitment to the RIPC.

The technical analyses undertaken during project identification and preparation were
sound. The project was designed taking into account the relevant economic, financial,
technical and institutional factors. Detailed expressway traffic forecasts were developed
on the basis of origin-destination surveys and the expected tolls that would be charged on
the expressway, although there are inconsistencies in the traffic figures in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) between Annexes 1-1 and 4, which should have been
corrected as part of the quality review. The actual traffic diversion rate is higher than
anticipated; although the traffic flows are lower (see Annex 3).

The Bank's comments and recommendations during preparation were taken into account
by the JPCD. Engineering designs prepared by Jiangxi province were reviewed by a
domestic design institute in Wuhan and also by a foreign consultant financed by a
Spanish Trust Fund. Sufficient geological investigations were done to avoid major
problems during construction, which had been experienced in other expressway projects
in China. This was particularly important because the mountainous areas traversed by the
proposed road required long tunnels and bridges.

Safeguard Policies. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental
Action Plan (EAP) were prepared for the expressway and the other roads included in the
project. They were found satisfactory to the Bank. The major impacts of the project
expected during the construction period were noise, soil erosion and dust. Lesser impacts
included interference with local people, traffic, and irrigation systems. Proper mitigation
measures were included in the EAP. Regarding resettlement, the project design paid
particular attention to minimize the impact on agricultural land and on communities along
the alignment. To achieve these goals, the resettlement and environment teams of the
project carried out public consultation and held public participation meetings at various
locations in cooperation with the Social Assessment Unit of the JPCD. These
consultations resulted in modifications to the project alignment in several places to


                                            5

reduce the impact of relocation and adverse environmental effect on the communities
along the route. Socioeconomic surveys of the people and communities were conducted
together with census of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and their assets. Satisfactory
Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) were prepared. Local people were intensively informed
through radio and television about the availability of documents related to their
resettlement rights.

B. Project Design

The project design was sound and reflected lessons learned on other projects in China.
The following key issues were addressed: (i) the selection of an optimal alignment, to
avoid and minimize impacts on villages and communities along the alignment; (ii)
minimization of the use of agricultural land; (iii) avoidance of cultural relic sites and
unstable geological terrain; (iv) adequate public consultation; and (v) integration of the
proposed environmental mitigation measures in the Environmental Action Plan (EAP)
into the design.

The importance of selecting the optimal alignment cannot be overemphasized. The
selected alignment will govern the impact on the environment and resettlement and the
preparation team worked closely with the project designers to establish an appropriate
alignment. The final selected alignment minimized the loss of agriculture land and loss of
residences; minimized the impacts and disruptions to the livelihood and day-to-day
activities of the affected people and communities, and decreased the potential risks of
landslides and erosion in the mountain areas. It also avoided disturbing cultural heritage
sites.

C. Quality at Entry

There was no Quality at Entry rating by QAG for the project.

D. Project Risks

All risks in the PAD were identified as negligible (N) or modest (M) and the overall risk
was modest. This was based on the previous experience in the province and the
commitment to implementing similar projects in China. The key risks, and how they were
addressed in the design, were as follows:

    · Inaccurate engineering designs (N): Review by international experts at an early
        stage of the project.
    · Selection of incompetent contractors (M): Minimized through careful pre-
        qualification of contractors; and
    · Inadequate quality of construction (M): The design called for this to be
        minimized through careful contractor selection and adequate supervision
        arrangements.




                                           6

However, as described in Section 2.5, problems found when the expressway became
operational with both the designs and construction quality show that the risks were: (i)
underestimated and/or, (ii) the mitigation measures adopted were inadequate.

2.2 Implementation

The project was successful in that it met the project development objective of providing
more efficient, safe and effective transport infrastructure in support of the social and
economic development of Jiangxi Province. The TGE carries significant volumes of
long-distance truck traffic with markedly reduced travel times, there have been diversions
from the existing roads thereby improving safety, local roads are closed less often, and
the TGE and RIPC areas of influence have experienced an increase economic
development as evidenced by significant increases in the GOVIA. The JPCD have
benefited from the institutional development program.

However, these achievements were made in spite of a number of issues which arose
during implementation:

    · Speed of Construction: The expressway component completed almost one year
       ahead of schedule. This undoubtedly contributed towards some of the quality
       problems encountered after the expressway became operational (see Section 2.5).
       The MOC has now instituted regulations prohibiting reductions in the
       construction schedule.
    · Additional Interchanges: Two additional interchanges were implemented during
       construction, financed domestically. These, and the associated interconnecting
       roads, did not have the same reviews (see comments below on supervision) and
       quality issues arose with the design and construction.
    · Domestic and Foreign Supervision: During implementation the domestic and
       foreign supervision consultant's work was sub-standard. For example, designs
       were not modified when it was found that the site conditions did not match those
       upon which the designs were based (eg when the embankment was higher than
       the design the slope protection should be extended). Design changes were not
       properly checked (eg a dangerous interchange was constructed at Hengshi which
       had to be retrofitted with a roundabout to resolve traffic conflicts after the
       expressway opened).
    · Bank Supervision: The Bank supervision was lacking during implementation.
       The Bank team did not carefully review all the designs being implemented. Bank
       missions did not regularly visit the site for extended periods of time. During
       SARS missions were cancelled as opposed to being postponed which led to an
       excessive interval between missions during the key construction period.
    · Equipment Procurement: The Bank recommended certain packaging for the
       equipment procurement. This unfortunately proved to be difficult since it called
       for different types of equipment from a number of different suppliers, sometimes
       competitors, to be in a single package.




                                           7

These implementation issues meant that significant efforts were required during the post-
completion/operating phases (see Section 2.5).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project design adopted a series of physical targets for measuring progress. The M&E
indicators were selected where the data was available or could be reasonably collected. In
hindsight, better indicators could have been selected. Baseline, intermediate and end of
project indicators were collected during the project by the JPCD and provided to the
Bank. Unfortunately, differences in the traffic figures in the PAD between Annexes 1-1
and 4 made it impossible to confirm the correct target values for the TGE and NH105.
Consensus values were agreed with the JPCD based on their original work and these have
been used in this ICR. In spite of the above issue with traffic data, the M&E indicators
have allowed for the project's success to be confirmed.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Protection

Monitoring of air, water and noise pollution found levels within the contractual limits.
Some environmental problems were noted during construction. These deficiencies were
pointed out repeatedly by the Bank's missions and there were gradual improvements,
particularly in the sanitation and cleanliness of the worker's camps. Areas of disposed
material were eventually landscaped, although some contractors demobilized without
properly reinstating all borrow areas. After opening the JPCD showed a strong
commitment towards ensuring environmental issues were rectified. After making the
improvements agreed to with the Bank (Section 5.1), the finished product shows a
pleasant overall environment and all critical issues have been satisfactorily resolved.

Land Acquisition and Resettlement

As shown in the table below, the total land area acquired was 1,077.1 ha, 7% higher than
estimated in the RAP. The area of houses was 246,071 m2, only 2.5% higher than the
RAP estimate. It should be noted that a reduction in the house area associated with the
refinement of the expressway alignment was offset by an increase in house area due to
the decision to widen the RIPC road.

Given their previous experience with Bank requirements, the province was well prepared
and resettlement activities proceeded relatively smoothly. There was full information



                                            8

disclosure and transparency. The compensation rates, quantities and compensation costs
were made public. The compensation was paid through bank accounts to every impacted
household in order to guarantee the PAPs received the funds promptly and in full
accordance with the compensation rates stipulated in RAP. The work was audited by both
the government and an independent consultant.

There were 11,882 PAPs (see below). During the project only 17 complaints were
received due to issues with: (i) design and location of structures; (ii) delays in payments;
(iii) temporary traffic disruptions; (iv) damage to local roads; and (iv) land use for works
outside of right-of-way. All were addressed by the JPCD and resolved in a satisfactory
manner.

Note:   1/ The PAD and the legal agreements have an estimate of US$42.3 m. However, this was from
            an earlier version of the PAD. The correct value should have been US$31.7 m.

Financial Management

The Financial Management for the project was conducted in accordance with the
arrangements agreed upon in the legal agreements. The project found it most effective
when the Financial Management and Procurement specialists conducted joint missions as
these helped detect issues and mitigate fiduciary risk. The client showed a good grasp of
financial management by canceling part of the loan when it became apparent that the
funds would not be required, and then modifying the loan agreement prior to the loan
closing so as to use remaining undisbursed funds.

Procurement

The full range of procurement methods were used on the project (see Annex 6 of the
PAD). The civil works, E&M and equipment components were procured using ICB, and
this constituted the bulk of the procurements. The JPCD used tendering agencies to
prepare the bidding documents and undertake the bidding.

An issue arose with the procurement of bitumen for the expressway component.
Irregularities were found with the way in which the bitumen was procured, although it
was done using common practice in China and on Bank projects in other provinces. A
review was done in 2006 of how bitumen was procured on the Bank's transport projects
in China and all clients informed of the appropriate approach to use.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Since its opening in 2004 the expressway and the local roads have been successfully
carrying traffic. The High Class Highway Administration Bureau under the JPCD is
responsible for the day-to-day management, operations and maintenance of the
expressway.

A number of post-construction quality issues arose with the expressway component
which required additional works to be undertaken. Some of these were likely due to the
accelerated construction schedule. The Bank and the JPCD agreed on an action plan
which addressed the issues including: (i) construction of a roundabout at the Hengshi
interchange to remedy a dangerous design; (ii) resurfacing of the pavement to eliminate
water intrusion--a problem caused by the asphalt specification used in the project which
has since been withdrawn by the MOC; (iii) traffic safety improvements such as
improved guardrails and protection for drains; (iv) repairs to, and extension of, noise
barriers; (v) improvements to side slope protection; and (vi) restoration of borrow areas.

The JPCD withheld funds from the contractors to cover the costs of remedial actions. An
action plan was agreed upon with the Bank and implemented by the JPCD. By 2006 the
problems had largely been rectified and the expressway was of an appropriate standard in
all areas.

The JPCD have used the equipment procured on the project to maintain the expressway
and are maintaining the pavement and roadside areas to a high standard.

The JPCD have indicated that the revenue from the tolls collected in the province is
sufficient to cover the ongoing maintenance costs for the expressways. The recent
adoption of higher weight based tolls will partially address the problem, but they are
unlikely to fully recover the damage done to the pavement from overloading. Jiangxi--
and China as a whole--needs to implement rigorous overloading enforcement policies.

The training received on the project was put to good use in the preparation of the Jiangxi
III highway project in 2005/6. The time from identification to appraisal was less than 11
months which was very fast for an expressway project in China.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Government of China has continued to place importance on the development of the
National Expressway Network (NEN). During the current 11th Five-Year Program (FYP)
and upcoming 12th and 13th FYPs, a further 45,000 km of the NEN are planned to be


                                          10

constructed. Central provinces such as Jiangxi are considered to be particularly important
since road investments here provides both a push and a pull effect on the adjacent
western and eastern provinces which results in the best overall net economic effect.
While investment in the eastern and western provinces tends to stay local, investment in
the central provinces benefits all regions. The focus is now on completing network
connectivity--which the TGE is an important contributor to as part of the Beijing-
Nanchang-Shenzhen corridor.

The development objectives are in line with the Bank's FY06-10 Country Partnership
Strategies (CPS), in particular in its recommendations to: (i) reduce internal and external
barriers to trade and investment; (ii) reduce poverty, inequality and social exclusion
through expanding access to basic social and infrastructure services; and (iii) manage
resource scarcity and environmental challenges. These were addressed by the following
goals of the project:

    · contribution to growth through removal of highway bottlenecks to facilitate inter-
       provincial trade and commerce and improve regional and national integration;
    · contribution to poverty reduction through improved accessibility in low income
       counties in southern Jiangxi;
    · better governance through improved highway maintenance management; and
    · social improvement through improved traffic safety, minimized environmental
       impact of construction, and adequate resettlement program.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project aimed to provide more efficient, safe and effective transport infrastructure in
support of social and economic development of Jiangxi Province. The project outcome is
rated as satisfactory based on its having achieved satisfactory outcomes on most
components of the project. The completion of the TGE provided a high-speed, reliable
link between Nanchang and Shenzhen. This reduced both the distances and travel times
for road transport traveling in the Beijing-Nanchang-Shenzhen corridor. Since
expressways are generally safer than local roads, this improved the traffic safety by
diverting traffic from local roads, thereby lowering the accident rates on local roads, and
by increasing travel on safer roads. Road closures were reduced on local roads. The areas
served by the TGE and the RIPC component saw a reduction in poverty and an increase
in social and economic development but, as described below, these are likely not entirely
due to the project's investments.

A. Traffic congestion relieved and mobility increased in the Nanchang-Shenzhen transport
    corridor

The TGE was opened in January 2004, about one year early, together with the
interconnecting roads. The E&M equipment was fully functional within six months of the
expressway opening.




                                            11

The objective of reducing congestion on the parallel national road was met. In 2005 the
TGE was carrying 5% of the total corridor traffic; compared with 69% using traffic data
from the PAD (see ICR Annex 3)2. Travel time in the corridor was also considerably
reduced. With completion of this link, the land-locked province of Jiangxi now has rapid
access to the southern port of Shenzhen.

The economic benefits of the project are considered sustainable, without any appreciable
risk, as traffic has been growing steadily since opening.


B. Accessibility to low-income areas in the province improved and poverty reduced

About 182 km of roads were improved in poor counties in the south of the province. The
roads were paved and road closures due to bad weather have been virtually eliminated,
except in exceptional cases of flooding and landslides. Accessibility to services has been
enhanced and the income of the people increased. The proxy measure used for poverty
reduction in the key performance indicators of the PAD is the Gross Output Value of
Industry and Agriculture (GOVIA). In the two poor counties (Wan'an and Suichuan)
covered by the indicators (see ICR Data Sheet, Section F), the GOVIA increased by 5.8
times and 2.6 times respectively from 2000 to 2006. This was much faster than for the
province as a whole, for which GOVIA about doubled in the same period. It should be
noted that during this time the province had very high rates of economic development--
the GDP increased by 16% (2002/3); 23% (2003/4) and 16% (2004/5) so it is very
difficult to isolate the economic benefits due to the road investments from the overall
economic development.

C. Safety of road transport improved

The province has made significant progress in this area.

The accident rate on the national road adjacent to the TGE has fallen below the target set
in the performance indicators of the PAD (see ICR Data Sheet, Section F).

All the manuals listed in the PAD were prepared and widely distributed, together with
training of staff and workers at construction and maintenance sites. A safety audit
checklist was also prepared and distributed. The pilot black spot program on an existing
section of expressway was completed. As the province is in the process of upgrading
many roads to deal with the increasing traffic through widening, pavement improvement
and realignment, many existing black spots are being eliminated.




2 As described in ICR Annex 5, anomalies and inconsistencies in the PAD traffic data make it impossible
to compare the forecast versus actual traffic with any certainty. Assuming the 2000 corridor traffic was
6,723 veh/day, the assumptions in the PAD suggest the 2005 corridor traffic would be 10,276 veh/day. This
compares with 8,773 veh/day observed in the corridor, suggesting that the existing traffic is 15% lower
than expected.



                                                   12

Two road safety seminars were organized in 2002 and 2004. The first one lasted two days
and was attended by about 100 persons from the JPCD, the Jiangxi Traffic Police Bureau
and the private sector in the transport field. It is clear that safety awareness has greatly
increased over the project period among highway personnel as well as in the public at
large. As a result of these and other efforts, the number and severity of accidents in the
province have decreased substantially since 2000, despite the rapid growth in vehicle
registration and traffic, as shown in the following table.

2004-5/2000


D. Institutional capacity of the JPCD and related sector institutions strengthened

The project focused on improving institutional capacity in four main areas: training,
improving traffic safety, establishing competitive maintenance, and procurement of
equipment. Progress was achieved in all four areas.

Training program. The training program was carried out in line with the PAD from 2004
to 2006. Staff was trained in the fields of highway management, highway design and
planning, financial management, highway construction and maintenance. The overseas
training program ran from 2004 and 2006. Training was found by the JPCD to be very
useful and trainees are applying what they learned.

Traffic Safety Organization. The project office was provided with traffic safety specialists
who worked on the project, in particular participating in and managing the `Highway
Safety' component. The successful completion of this component as well as the increased
awareness of traffic safety issues in the JPCD shows that this activity was successful.

Establishment of competitive maintenance. After completing a study, two pilot
maintenance companies were established in Nanchang and Yichun cities. These
companies are basically independent and perform maintenance work under unit rate
contracts. The experience in terms of cost and quality of work will be monitored over the
next few years, before a final decision is made as to whether or not to expand the
program. There is a preference in China to begin reforms with pilot experiments and to
evaluate the results before broader application, rather than adopting the findings of a
study to make wholesale changes up-front.




                                            13

Procurement of equipment. The project procured US$5.5 m of equipment to help improve
the quality and effectiveness of construction and maintenance. The equipment was
employed by the maintenance bureaus to maintain the expressway and was implemented
by June 2006.


E. Land acquisition and resettlement

The project land acquisition and resettlement program successfully restored the incomes
of the PAPs. The post-project resettlement assessment report found that the PAPs were
generally satisfied with the process and compensation they received. The PAPs incomes
kept pace with the average incomes of the area, showing that they were not
disadvantaged by the project.

After rehabilitation, irrigation facilities were generally improved. For those re-housed,
the new dwellings were typically of higher quality than their previous homes. For
instance, reconstructed brick and concrete houses constituted 50% of the total versus
27.5% of the houses demolished for the project. The PAPs have improved access to
drinking water with 71% having tap water, compared to 1% before the project. The
access to power is also improved with 86% having sufficient power, compared to 82%
prior to the project.

Vulnerable groups received special treatment including: (i) subsidy aid during the course
of house relocation; (ii) provision of free labor to build and move to the new houses; (iii)
exemption from obligation of labor services for a year; (iv) priority in choosing the place
for new houses and location of readjusted land. Because of the above preferential policies,
the farming activity and living standards of the vulnerable families were completely
rehabilitated completely in a short time.

The project also adopted specific activities which benefited the PAPs, including:

    · Village Investment Plans were developed for villages receiving over RMB
        200,000 (US$25,000) in compensation. These set up small-sized processing
        enterprises and aqua-culture enterprises.

    · PAPs were given priority to provide construction materials and labor services to
        the construction works. This led to a large number of PAPs having well-paid jobs.

3.3 Efficiency

Net Present Value and Economic Rate of Return

The economic evaluation covers the expressway section, the interconnecting roads and
the RIPC. The results are summarized in the following table and the details are in Annex
3. The EIRR and ENPV are higher than estimated, despite the 2005 traffic being lower
than the PAD estimate. This is due to the expressway construction cost being 22% lower
than estimated.

Financial rate of return

The expressway opened in January 2004 and the High Class Highway Administration
Bureau under the JPCD assumed the day-to-day management, operations and
maintenance of the expressway. As shown in Annex 3, the main income is from tolls
charges to the road users. The toll rates are set by the province and are uniform for all the
expressways in the province, regardless to the form of management (public, joint-venture
or private). Based on current toll rates, the expressway section is generating enough
revenues to finance operation and maintenance and to service the Bank loan, which
amounts to about 40% of the fixed assets.

The detailed financial analysis is presented in Annex 3 and summarized as follows:

                                           PAD/1                                   ICR/1

Notes: 1/ The Financial Cost of Capital which was used to calculate the FNPV was 4.61% for the ICR
            against 6% in the PAD.
        2/ In the PAD, the FNPV is inconsistent with the FIRR. The latter is considered by the ICR team
            to be of the correct magnitude.


Cost effectiveness

At appraisal, the total project cost, including contingencies and land acquisition, was
estimated at US$536 m, of which US$200 m (37%) was to be financed by the Bank loan.
The total actual project cost of US$371 m is 69% of the estimate. Detailed cost tables are
in Annex 1.

The civil works for the construction of the expressway, accounting for 82% of the final
total project costs, were only 68% of the estimated costs. As shown in the following table,
the estimated cost per km was higher than for projects done at the same time in
neighboring provinces. This higher estimate was due in part to the more mountainous
topography in Jiangxi. However, the actual cost per km is similar to that of Hubei and

Hunan, clearly illustrating the highly competitive nature of the construction industry in
China.

Note:   1/ This is the expressway cost only, without the costs of interconnecting roads, construction
            supervision and equipment. The estimated cost includes contingencies.

The costs of interconnecting roads and RIPC were also lower than estimated (-21%). In
the case of interconnecting roads, the large cost reduction was due to dropping the
connection to the town of Ganzhou from the TGE. Access to Ganzhou is provided by a
local expressway constructed at the same time as the project, financed using local funds.
It connects with the start of the Jiangxi III highway project and is part of the Xiamen-
Chengdu expressway.

Given the lower cost of the expressway and interconnecting roads, the province cancelled
excess loan funds in 2004, upon opening of the expressway to traffic. In 2006 once the
final costs could be reliably estimated, the JPCD requested an increase of disbursement
percentage for the rest of the project, showing good financial management.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall achievement of the project objectives is rated as satisfactory. The project is
providing efficient, safe and effective transport infrastructure to Jiangxi and it has also
helped with Jiangxi's social and economic development. This assessment is based on a
review of achievements of the five components given in Section 3.2 and the economic
and financial returns and the cost management efficiency presented in Section 3.3:

    · Key performance indicators benchmarks have generally been met or exceeded.
    · Traffic diversion to the expressway is greater than anticipated and has relieved
        congestion on the parallel national road while also reducing accidents.
    · Growth in economic output and income in the poor counties served by the RIPC
        has been much faster than predicted, but as noted earlier, it is not possible to
        isolate the growth due to the project investments from the overall economic
        development.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As described in Section 3.2, the project had a major impact in reducing poverty in the
poor counties served by the project roads. The GOVIA in the project influence area
increased much more than anticipated, especially for Wan'an and Suichuan counties
where it more than doubled. However, as noted earlier, during this time the province had
very high rates of economic development so it is not possible to isolate economic benefits
due to the roads from the overall economic development.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional strengthening impact, defined as the extent to which it has improved the
JPCD's ability to make use of its human and financial resources, is rated as satisfactory.
As described in Section 3.2, there were four main areas of focus: organizational change,
establishing competitive maintenance, supporting training programs, and procurement of
equipment. Lasting progress was achieved in all four areas.

Decentralization of responsibility for funding roads has been achieved in the province.
The JPCD is interested in competitive maintenance, and in 2006 participated in a project
to investigate the viability of performance based maintenance contracts for expressways
in Jiangxi (and Hubei). Skills developed in the training program are being used by staff,
especially in the area of traffic safety where the JPCD is continuing to advance their
efforts. The procured equipment is in use.

Another example of the increased skills in the JPCD came during the preparation of the
Jiangxi III highway project in 2005/6. The elapsed time between identification mission
and appraisal was less than 11 months, a record for an expressway in China. This was due
in no small measure to the high quality of the Jiangxi preparation team and, with two
projects prepared, their familiarity with the Bank's procedures and requirements.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The various issues identified in the Jiangxi II highway project were taken into
consideration during the preparation of the Jiangxi III highway project and have been
applied to other projects (eg Hubei Shiman). This will enhance the overall quality of
other projects. For example: (i) standard designs of septic tanks shall be included in the
bid documents thereby ensuring that the contractor's work camps will have proper
sanitary systems; (ii) all construction drawings will be reviewed by the Bank prior to
bidding for all ICB contracts and certain NCB contracts (eg Annex areas); (iii) better co-
ordination between the designers of different components to ensure consistency and no
conflicts (eg signs placed at the same location as noise barriers); and (iv) improved
designs for interconnecting roads.




                                            17

One outcome--which is viewed as very positive by China's Ministry of Finance--is the
recognition that the time is past when the use of foreign consultants for general
supervision activities is mandatory on all World Bank financed highway projects. With
China having successfully constructed over the overwhelming majority of its 41,000 km
NEN using local consultants, the role of foreign consultants should be limited to
specialist areas where they can make significant contributions. This is the approach being
adopted for the proposed Hubei Yiba highway project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

None.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible to Low

The project has met its objective of providing more efficient, safe and effective transport
infrastructure in support of social and economic development in Jiangxi Province.

The physical investments have resulted in good transport infrastructure, both for the
expressway and the local roads. Traffic in the corridor continues to grow, confirming that
there was demand for the investments. Congestion on the existing road has been relieved
and will likely stay low given the diversion rate to the expressway. The local roads have
had major improvements in terms of reduced closures, and the increase in GOVIA is
expected to be sustained.

Jiangxi has seen a reduction in traffic accidents, and is committed to further improving
the situation, possibly through a stand-alone traffic safety project. The institutional
strengthening activities have enhanced the JPCD's ability to fulfill their responsibility to
plan and manage road investments. The manuals and the training provided in the areas of
quality control and road safety and their application to date are good indications that the
improvements in these matters are durable.

The only identifiable risk to the investment is inadequate financing to maintain and
operate the TGE in light of increasing maintenance costs due to overloading (see Section
5.2). The recent adoption of higher weight based tolls will partially address the problem,
but they are unlikely to fully recover the damage done to the pavement from overloading.
Jiangxi--and China as a whole--needs to implement rigorous overloading enforcement
policies.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry


Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance during identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was
satisfactory. The Bank team was led by an experienced highway engineer and included
specialists covering environment, social/resettlement, economics, rural roads, expressway
engineering, institutional strengthening and highway safety. Potential risks were
identified, although in hindsight underestimated given the problems subsequently
encountered. The Bank's Safeguard Policies were adequately addressed. A financial
management review was undertaken to ensure compliance with the Bank's financial
management procedures. To improve the overall quality, during preparation the
engineering designs and technical bidding documents, including cost estimates for the
proposed expressway and related roads, including their E&M facilities, were reviewed by
international engineering consultants under grant funding from Spain. The greatest
weakness was in the cost estimates, which although reviewed by an international
consultant, were significantly higher than the actual costs. This is likely due at least in
part to the use of standard values issued by the MOC which do not adequately reflect
competitive bidding on projects.

The PAD and the legal agreements would have benefited from a more intense quality
review insofar as there were inconsistencies within both documents. As mentioned
elsewhere, the PAD had different traffic volumes in different annexes which made it
difficult to confirm the end of project indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision


Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

There was good continuity of staff during implementation. The task manager who
appraised the project also supervised it until early 2005, after the major construction was
completed. Attention was paid to all components of the project.

The resettlement activities were closely supervised which helped ensure that the objective
of restoring the livelihood and productivity of the PAPs was achieved.

The financial management of the project was supervised in an effective manner, and the
JPCD were provided financial management training by the Bank to improve their
efficiency. Timely advice was provided the client on treating undisbursed funds so as to
use the loan funds efficiently.




                                            19

The project would have benefited from spending more time in the field to check technical
aspects of the project--especially given the poor performance of the foreign supervision
consultants which contributed to the problems described in Section 2.5. Not every
supervision mission had time to visit the construction sites which were some distance
from Nanchang. Missions in 2003, during the peak of construction, also had to be
cancelled, as opposed to postponed, because of SARS. This resulted in a significant
elapsed time between field visits.

As described in Section 2.5, in 2005 a new Bank supervision team identified deficiencies
with: the incorrectly designed Hengshi interchange which was dangerous; traffic safety
deficiencies; incorrect noise barrier implementations; inadequate side slope protection;
and improperly restored borrow areas. Some of these issues would likely have been
identified had there been better design reviews and more in depth field inspections by the
Bank supervision team during construction.

The quality of supervision is therefore rated as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance


Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating for overall Bank performance as moderately satisfactory is based on the
satisfactory quality at entry and the moderately unsatisfactory quality of supervision. The
supervision team paid adequate attention to compliance with the Bank policies on
environment and resettlement, however it appears that insufficient time was spent in the
field resulting in a number of post-construction problems.


5.2 Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance


Rating: Satisfactory

This was a repeater project in Jiangxi so the familiarity with Bank requirements and
procedures helped project preparation. All land for the project was acquired in good time
so that construction was not delayed--in fact the expressway was completed about one
year early. The performance of the central and provincial government during the project
implementation was satisfactory. The Government was fully committed to the project
which was contributing to the completion of the Beijing-Nanchang-Shenzhen corridor.

Internal clearance of bidding documents remained cumbersome, particularly for
equipment. Documents prepared by the provinces have to go through a number of
different national agencies, each with its own requirement and peculiarities and the
process is too long.




                                           20

Overloading of trucks remains a serious problem in China. This is a national problem
which cannot be addressed separately by each province. The expressway companies have
no right to force overloaded trucks to stop and unload. The police do that for grossly
overloaded trucks, which they spot while on patrol and divert to a weighing station.
However, these stations are too few and far between to have a serious impact. They are
also too small to impound more than a sample of the culprits. Some provinces, including
Jiangxi, have started levying higher tolls on overloaded trucks, but even a doubling or
tripling of the toll rate does not come near matching the amount of damage done to the
road by the extra heavy vehicle, since damage increases with the fourth power of the axle
load.



(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

    Implementing
        Agency                                      Performance

                         The performance of the implementing agency was satisfactory. The
                         JPCD demonstrated commitment to achieving the project
                         objectives, including not only construction, but also institutional
                         development through project financed studies, workshops and
                         training programs. For instance, two road safety workshops were
Jiangxi Provincial       conducted in 2002 and 2004, the one scheduled for 2003 having
Communications           been postponed due to SARS. Construction of the expressway was
Department               completed ahead of schedule, extra loan funds cancelled and
                         revenues generated promptly, thus making a very efficient use of
                         borrowed funds. When the post-construction problems were
                         identified the government showed full commitment towards
                         resolving them. They mobilized appropriate resources and funds to
                         correct the issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance


Rating: Satisfactory

The project objectives were achieved and all loan conditions were complied with. The
cooperation between the borrower and the Bank was good throughout preparation and
implementation of the project.

6. Lessons Learned

Closer review of designs and technical specifications are required

There is a common problem on expressways in China wherein different elements of the
designs are done by different individuals and/or institutions. This fragmented approach
leads to conflicts and inconsistencies such as signs being installed in the same location as
noise barriers (creating a break in the noise barrier); noise barriers not being placed in the
appropriate location; obstacles such as bridge piers not being adequately protected, etc. It
is important to review the designs from a holistic perspective to ensure that these types of
problems are eliminated. To achieve this, it is necessary that: (i) the different design
teams have collaborative meetings where they jointly review the documents and resolve
inconsistencies; and (ii) all bidding documents be thoroughly reviewed prior to bidding
by experienced engineers.

Design changes during construction need to be checked more rigorously to make sure
they reflect the same standards as were applied to the original design. Importantly, when
the field conditions are different to those indicated in the designs, the designs should be
updated to reflect reality (eg when the embankment is higher than the design indicates the
slope protection should be extended).

Among the details that need to be considered, it is also important to ensure: obstacles are
avoided and, if that is impractical, they are properly protected; crossroads for
interconnecting roads are properly designed with good sight distances; all road signs must
be properly sited and visible; lane markings and transitions are properly designed and
painted; annex areas have proper lane marking and channelization; noise barriers are built
without gaps, extending an appropriate distance before/after the buildings to be protected,
and are built with suitable materials; borrow areas must be carefully selected, preferably
in areas without hills, and excavated in an appropriate manner which will allow for
eventual reinstatement; slope protections need to be designed to reflect the actual field
conditions, and use appropriate techniques.

It is important to ensure that the Bank teams regularly visit the site

Supervision missions in 2005 identified a number of problems with the expressway: the
incorrectly designed Hengshi interchange which was dangerous; traffic safety
deficiencies; incorrect noise barrier implementations; inadequate side slope protection;
and improperly restored borrow areas. In hindsight, some of these would have been
avoided by frequent and longer visits to the project site by Bank supervision missions.

Improve the planning and design of interchanges and interconnecting roads

The original project included only four interchanges over a distance of 130 km, i.e. an
average distance of over 30 km between interchanges. Realizing that this was not
providing sufficient service in the corridor, two interchanges were added during
construction. The design of one of them was unsatisfactory from a safety point of view
(subsequently rectified by the JPCD). There were also design problems in the new roads


                                            22

connecting the interchanges to the highway network: intersections with existing highways
were not properly designed and signaled; in some cases, the standards of the connecting
roads were set too low in the original designs, and the roads were upgraded during
construction without due planning; and the transition from high speed expressway travel
to mixed traffic local roads was too abrupt.

More attention should be paid to the advanced planning of interchanges and connecting
roads at the time of preparing designs for the expressway. Design modifications by local
governments should be more closely reviewed prior to implementation.

The activities of foreign supervision consultants needs to be carefully designed so as to
ensure they add value to the project

The performance of the foreign supervision consultants fell short of what was envisaged
in their Terms of Reference. For example, they did not fulfill their contractual obligation
to review all designs for the project. This resulted in the construction of an incorrectly
designed interchange, which had to be retrofitted with a roundabout at the Bank's
insistence, and inadequate slope protection works. They did not ensure that the safety
deficiencies in design and implementation were properly addressed.

The JPCD commented that foreign consultants for supervision were expensive and did
not provide value for money. This comment has been made in other provinces as well.

Given these difficulties, for the new project (Jiangxi III), it was agreed that the JPCD
would hire foreign expertise as needed in specific areas, such as tunneling, rather than
have a consulting firm providing a team for all aspects of the construction, as was
previously the case. For the proposed Hubei Yiba Highway Project domestic supervision
consultants will be used for earthworks and structures while foreign supervision
consultants for tunneling and pavements. This approach of using foreign consultants for
specialist activities was endorsed by the Ministry of Finance in Beijing.

Need to continue pressing solutions to the overloading problem

As mentioned earlier, truck overloading remains a problem throughout China--studies
typically find that over 75% of trucks are overloaded with the average overload
sometimes exceeding 100%. A few years after opening, the right hand lane of many
expressways already show signs of rutting due to the high number of overloaded trucks.
On other roads there have been catastrophic failures of bridges due to overloading.

To keep transport costs low, the Government has been reluctant to take strong measures
to enforce legal axle loads. The measures presently in place seem to do little to persuade
truckers to reduce overloading. They include spot checking and fining by the police, and
higher tolls based on weight (see Section 5.2). Another aspect of the solution, which may
not have been considered sufficiently, would be to increase the design axle load.
Designing stronger pavements, while more costly initially, may lower the total cost of
transport by allowing heavier trucks. Higher permissible axle loads may also make
enforcement more acceptable to the transporters. Axle loads were increased in the


                                            23

European Union after studies showed that they would result in lower overall transport
costs, including infrastructure and vehicle operating costs.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The question of value for money of foreign consultants for civil works construction was
raised by the borrower. The Bank agreed to delete this requirement from the new project
(Jiangxi III) and replace it by hiring foreign specialists if and when needed to address
specific problems, rather then being on the ground for the entire duration of the works.

The JPCD and the Bank should have addressed the potential loan saving issues earlier by
increasing the disbursement percentage or adding financed items in order to utilize the
loan fully.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A. Construction of Expressway, Interconnecting Roads, Construction Supervision and
    Equipment (PAD estimate US$447.3 million ICR actual US$303.4 million ­ costs include
    contingencies)

Works were completed some nine months ahead of the contractual deadline and the
expressway opened about one year early. Sufficient geological surveys were conducted
prior to completing the engineering design and no surprises were encountered in the
tunnels, enabling rapid completion of the works. Procurement and installation of the
E&M system also proceeded smoothly and in a timely fashion, so that all equipment was
operational within six months of the opening of the expressway. Preparation of
documents started early for the two stage bidding method which was used satisfactorily.

As noted in Section 3.3, the total expressway costs were only 68% of the estimated costs.
This is partially ascribed to a too high estimate being used during preparation (US$3.1
m/km). The actual cost of US$2.1 m/km is similar to costs in other provinces.

In 2005, a Bank supervision mission noticed some signs of pavement damage due to the
permeability of the pavement--arising from the use of a pavement standard that MOC
has since withdrawn. The matter was discussed with the borrower and agreement was
reached to apply a thin layer of sealant on the entire length of the expressway. The result
of this treatment has been satisfactory. An improperly designed interchange had been
constructed which was remedied by installing a roundabout. The same mission also
suggested to extend slope protection works against erosion in a few locations and to
correct some safety hazards created by guardrails and drainage ditches. The contractors
agreed to pay about US$1.25 m for the corrections to be done by the TGE maintenance
unit.

Supervision of works was carried out by domestic consultants supported by a small team
of foreign consultants. The issues identified above suggested that the construction
supervision had not been as effective as it should have been. The foreign supervision
consultant's work was particularly unsatisfactory since in spite of having a safety
engineer, an unsafe interchange was constructed.

Equipment for maintenance of the TGE and other roads in Jiangxi was purchased under
the project together with laboratory and quality control equipment for supervision of civil
works.


B. Road Improvement in the Poor Counties (RIPC) (PAD estimate US$39.6 million, ICR
    actual US$26.8 million ­ costs include contingencies)

The project included improvements to four roads in poor areas of southern Jiangxi.
Approximately 78 km were upgraded to Class II highways, and 104 km to Class III
highways. Works were completed in 2004. Bank inspection in 2005 identified some
minor improvements needed in terms of traffic safety measures, slope protection and


                                            26

flood repairs. The authorities agreed to have them carried out by the contractors while the
works were still in the one year guarantee period. This work was subsequently completed.

C. Highway Safety (PAD estimate US$2.3 million including contingencies, ICR actual
    US$0.4 million)

Safety Manual for the Highway Construction & Maintenance Worksites: The
manual was completed in December 2002 and distributed to the contractors, supervisors
and consultants at the project's construction sites. Seminars were held in 2002 and 2004
to discuss the safety at construction sites, along with other elements of traffic safety
including highway safety audits, identification and improvement of black spots and black
segments, and the role and requirements of highway safety facilities.

Safety Audit Procedures: The safety audit procedures were completed in September
2003 two training sessions on safety audits were held. The May 2004 training focused on
safety audits for expressway design and operation. The May 2005 training focused on
safety audits for rural road design and maintenance. After the training, a pilot safety audit
program was conducted on one section of NH 320.

Black Spot Identification: The black spot identification study was completed by the end
of 2003 for a 100 km section of the Nanchang-Jiujiang Expressway. After completing
detailed design for remedial works and bidding, implementation started in 2004 and was
completed in 2005. It is too early to have meaningful accident statistics following these
recently completed works to gauge their overall impact.

Safety Seminars: Two road safety seminars were organized in 2002 and 2004 to increase
the understanding of traffic safety among government officials, road designers,
contractors, construction units, maintenance units, and the public security bureau.

D. Institutional Development (PAD estimate US$2.2 million, ICR actual US$1.0 million)

The four areas of institutional development were successfully executed: (i) the domestic
and international training program was undertaken and met the goals of the PAD; (ii)
traffic safety specialists were provided to the project office and assisted with traffic safety
activities as well as managing the Highway Safety Component; (iii) two pilot
maintenance centers were established to undertake maintenance on a commercial basis;
and (iv) the project procured US$5.5 m of equipment to help improve the quality and
effectiveness of construction and maintenance.

E. Land Acquisition and Resettlement (PAD estimate US$31.7 million, ICR actual US$37.6
    million)

The land acquisition and resettlement program was successfully executed. The 11,882
PAPs received their agreed compensation. They were provided with improved facilities
in terms of improved irrigation, improved access to drinking water (71% with access to
tap water compared to 1% before the project); improved quality of houses (50% brick or
concrete houses compared to 27.5% before the project); and improved access to power.

 Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

 Table A3.1 summarizes the results of the economic and financial evaluation. The project
 has an EIRR of 23.8%, and an NPV of RMB 3,624 m. Both of these values are higher
 than the estimates in the PAD.

 The PAD contained two sets of traffic data: Annex 1-1 as `Key Performance and
 Development Indicators' and Annex 4 as `Cost Benefit Analysis Summary'. The 2000
 corridor baseline values differ by 28% (6,723 vs. 8,633 veh/day), with the PAD Annex
 4 baseline being only 1.6% lower than the 2005 corridor traffic of 8,744 veh/day. The
 PAD Annex 1-1 2005 forecast traffic for the corridor of 18,497 veh/day suggests an
 annual growth rate of 23%/yr from 2000, more than double the rate of 11%/yr observed
 from 1990-1998. The PAD Annex 4 2005 forecast of 13,205 veh/day suggests an
 increase of 4,571 veh/day over the 2000 baseline data, or an 8.9%/yr increase.

 After consultation with the JPCD it was confirmed that the PAD Annex 1-1 baseline
 data were correct. To obtain a revised estimate of the 2005 data, the PAD 8.9%/yr
 growth rate was used in conjunction with the same diversion ratio. This resulted in the
 `Modified PAD' data shown in Table A3.2. These modified data have been used in this
 ICR.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The main objectives of Jiangxi II were achieved through the successful implementation
of various components of the project. The TGE (about 128 km), interconnecting roads
(about 26 km) and rural roads (about 182 km) were all completed. The completion and
operation of TGE relieves the traffic congestion and reduces the high traffic accident rate
on National Highway 105.

Component A: Highway Capacity Expansion

The nine contract sections of the TGE civil works commenced on December 28, 2001
and were completed on January 16, 2004. The one E&M contract commenced October 30,
2003, and was completed July 2004. Nine contract sections of building works
commenced August 2003 and were completed March 31, 2004. Three contract sections of
civil works for two interconnecting roads commenced in July 2003 and were completed
on May 28, 2004.

Design Experience

The project was designed by Jiangxi Provincial Communication Design Institute (JPCDI).
During the course of construction, design representatives from JPCDI were assigned to
the sites to be in charge of design variations and update drawings. We believe that the
design needs to be guided by advanced concepts, based on the creative techniques,
guaranteed by the scientific management and improved during the construction.

Implementation Experience

Application of World Bank's Policies

The managerial staff of the Project Management Office (PMO) was trained through
implementation of the project in the application of the World Bank's policies. The civil
works were procured through ICB, and the contracts were awarded to the bidders of the
lowest price, thus the construction cost was reduced. FIDIC was adopted for the project
which helped with supervision. The Bank's policies were used in the areas of
environmental protection and resettlement. Consequently, the environment along the
expressway was preserved well, and the displaced persons were not disadvantaged by the
project.

Implementation of the Contract, Timely Communication

The TGE was the first expressway which entered the mountainous area of Jiangxi. It
therefore has many tunnels, viaducts, high side slopes and complicated geology and
landforms. At the beginning of the project, the PMO paid great attention to the
preparation for construction in terms of the access for the equipment and personnel to the
sites. By communicating regularly and in a timely manner with the leaders of the
contracting companies, the PMO created a positive construction environment.


                                            39

Strengthening Quality Control

The project adopted several measures to strengthen quality control:

    · `Quality Responsibility Agreements' were signed between the PMO, contractors,
        designer and supervisors;
    · The procurement of the raw materials was controlled by strict testing in order to
        ensure the quality of the works;
    · Quality Assurance Systems were established by each contractor to ensure the
        quality of the works; and
    · The supervision consultants were assigned to the construction sites to fully
        control the construction through site supervision and site testing.

Any quality problems identified at the construction sites were solved through issuing
instructions to the contractors. It was subsequently confirmed that the problems had been
resolved.

Operational Experience

The TGE was opened to the traffic on January 16, 2004. The JPCD established the
`Ganzhou Administration Division' to be in charge of the operation, management and
maintenance of the TGE. The TGE is in good condition.

The TGE is creating major economic and social benefits not only for the areas along the
TGE, but for Jiangxi province as a whole. It has greatly contributed to the industrial and
agricultural development in Jiangxi.

The traffic volume and toll revenue of TGE are rapidly increasing. The annual toll
revenue collected from the TGE increased from US$33.3 m in 2004 to US$53.5 m in
2006 (+61%). Since the TGE is a major north-south route, meaning that the vast majority
of vehicles do not pass through these stations, the actual income generated by the TGE is
much higher.

The diversion of traffic from NH105 to the TGE has greatly reduced the traffic
congestion on NH105 as well as improving the traffic safety.

Until 1 July 2006 the JPCD charged the toll by the rated tonnage of the truck and type of
vehicles (exceptionally heavy, heavy, medium and small vehicles). However, a new
system has been adopted which charges the toll by the actual weight of the cargo vehicles.
This is helping to reduce the extent of overloading.

Maintenance of the TGE is done by the `Independent Taigan Maintenance Center'. This
center is able to timely treat the defects and damages. Maintenance planning is supported
by the Nationwide Road Database System (HDBS) and Pavement Management System
(CPMS).

Environmental Experience

The State Environmental Protection Administration and Environmental Division of MOC
organized the Jiangxi Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, JPCD, Environmental
Protection Bureau of Ji'an City, Environmental Protection Bureau of Ganzhou City and
others to conduct an environmental acceptance inspection on the completion of
environmental protection for TGE. After inspection, it was found qualified. A copy of the
completion acceptance report had sent to the Bank in March 2005.

Local roads damaged during construction of TGE were rehabilitated from September
2003 to March 2004.

Procurement of Equipment

The project procured 15 items (23 units) of equipment with a total contract price of
US$5.5 m. The equipments were divided into six packages and procured using ICB
procedures. This equipment was to be used for road maintenance. Currently, it is in
operation and has proved to be of use to the client.

Component B: Road Improvement in Poor Counties (RIPC)

The RIPC component consisted of improving about 182 km of rural roads. There were
four roads, divided into eight different contract sections, in this component. The works
started in August 2003 and were completed in November 2004.

The RIPC investments have promoted local economic development, greatly alleviated
local poverty, and provided the opportunity for local tourism development. The good
transportation links have particularly contributed to local resource exploitation and
utilization.

Component C: Highway Safety

This component consisted of four activities: Safety at Highway Construction Sites, Study
and Implementation of Highway Safety Audits, Identification of Black Segments and
Black Spots on the Nanchang-Jiujiang Expressway and Highway Safety Seminars.

This was the first time to a highway safety program was conducted in Jiangxi Province.
The implementation of the highway safety program laid a solid foundation for Jiangxi
Province to carry out further highway safety activities. Many staff gained experience
from the implementation of the highway safety program and became highway safety
specialists. More and more people such as government officials, road designers, staff of
road construction units, management and maintenance have become more aware of traffic
safety. Under the influence of the highway safety program, some traffic safety studies
such as Research on Expressway Pavement Management, Safety Audit of Newly-built
Expressway, Research on Expressway Traffic Safety Evaluation System and others are



                                           41

being conducted in Jiangxi Province. In recent years, the traffic accident rate has begun to
decrease so it is a good start.

Component D: Institutional Development

The Jiangxi Provincial Highway Administration Bureau (JPHAB) was the implementing
agency for the establishment of Independent Maintenance Centers (IMC). Wenzhen IMC
and Yuanxiantai IMC were established in Nanchang city and Yichun city respectively.
Both centers continue to operate very well.

The domestic training saw 537 persons with 315 person-months in total trained in the
areas of resettlement, environmental protection, procurement, financial disbursement,
construction supervision and other key areas.

Seven overseas study tours were completed with 45 persons for a total of 22.5 person-
months. A further four overseas training courses were completed with 46 persons
covering 46 person-months. These tours and courses covered quality management
procedure and methods, application of FIDIC, measurement and construction supervision,
construction supervision procedures and quality control methods, project financial
evaluation methods, disbursement of project loan, fund raising for project construction ,
the World Bank's procurement policy, procedure and methods, highway, tunnel and
bridge design, planning and implementation of road safety, and maintenance management.

The outcome of the training was staff trained in the fields of highway management,
highway design and planning, financial management, highway maintenance, traffic works
and other key areas. The trained professional staff played an active role in the
implementation of the project by using what they learned from the training.

Component E: Land Acquisition and Resettlement

Land acquisition and resettlement for the TGE was completed in January 2004, and for
the interconnecting roads and RIPCs in July 2003. The land area needed for the TGE
amounted to 1,077 ha, and the area of the relocated houses reached 246,071 m2. The
Resettlement Completion Report was submitted to the WB on September 8, 2004 and the
Bank found it to be satisfactory.


Performance of the Bank

The World Bank embarked on the preparation of the Second Jiangxi Highway Project in
2000. The Bank Mission reviewed the Feasibility Study Report prepared by the JPCD.
The World Bank sent several missions to review the technical, organizational and
economic aspects of the project and prepared the PAD. The PAD described the scope of
the project, economic benefit and organization arrangement.

During the implementation of the project, the World Bank Supervision Missions provided
practical and helpful recommendations on quality, financial management, project


                                          42

organization and other areas. There was good cooperation between the World Bank and
the PMO. The officials of the World Bank understood the high demands for traffic
infrastructure in Jiangxi and provided help and advice. The People's Government of
Jiangxi Province and the JPCD appreciated the cooperation and assistance of the World
Bank, and look forward to even better cooperation and assistance during the
implementation of the Jiangxi III highway project.

Lessons Learned

As a World Bank financed project, the project cycle included project identification,
preparation, project appraisal, negotiation and approval of the Board, all of which took
nearly two years. The officials involved in the project from Jiangxi were an economist,
financial analysis expert, resettlement and environmental experts and various types of
engineers. The team learned from the World Bank how to identify the project, compare
and select the alternatives, establish the project organization, prepare Project
Implementation and Project Procurement Plans, identify and manage the risks etc.
Although the preparation of a project was long relative to the construction time, it was a
vital major long-term investment. It helped identify the best methods to solve the
technical problems, to set up an appropriate organization, and to forecast and pre-treat
relevant issues. The time spent was well invested.

The expressway civil works were procured through ICB and the contracts were awarded
to the bidders of lowest price, thus the total price of the contracts was comparatively low.
This meant that the World Bank's loan could not be completely utilized. This meant that
the PMO had a higher commitment fee and the financing cost was increased. The JPCD
and the Bank should have addressed the potential loan saving issue by increasing the
disbursement percentage earlier, or adding financed items in order to utilize the loan
fully.

We suggest simplifying the procedure for loan withdrawals and disbursement in order to
avoid the money shortage of special account, which always influences the financing of
the project.

The World Bank financed projects have a great influence on the local resettlement
policies and play an active role in formulating the resettlement activities. It would be
better for the Bank not to request the Client to prepare the RAP in too much detail at the
stages of pre-preparation and pre-appraisal. The living standard base survey should be
done when conducting layout of right-of-way and after the construction drawing design.
The World Bank actively urges China's resettlement policy to be compatible with the
international practices, but this takes time because China has its own special land
ownership system and administration characteristics. For this reason the World Bank
should properly takes into account of China's land ownership system, administration
characteristics and traditional conventions in order to implement the resettlement policy
smoothly.
