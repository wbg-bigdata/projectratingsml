1. Foreword
The EAP of Rural Roads Improvement Program (RRIP) of the World Bank-Financed
Jiangxi No.2 Highway Project is compiled on the basis of the EIA reports of the four RRIP
components namely (1) Suichuan-Chezhiao Road (RRIP I ); (2) Yutian-Xinjiang Road
(RRIP2); (3) Shashibu-Wangmudu Road (RRIP3); and.Tangjiang-Dongshan Road (RRIP4).
The mitigation measures, monitoring and training plans have been discussed and have
gained consensus among the departments of design, resettlement and environment,
approved by both the Project Office and Jiangxi Provincial Expressways Administration
Bureau.

2. Major Environmental Impacts
(I) Ecological Environment (Including Water Environment and Soil Erosion)
The road construction will take up a total land area of 2435.49 mu, of which the land
occupancy for the construction of RRIPI will be 765.97mu, that of RRIP2 will be
606.26mu, that of RRIP3 being 601.5mu and that of RR1P4 will be 461.76mu.The
acquisitioned land includes paddy land, dry land, pond, woodland, and wasteland.
Construction of the four RRIP roads will cause some economic loss for agricultural fields
and production, but will not produce significant impact on the pattern of land distribution.
Cutting of subgrade and filling of earth/stonework will damage the vegetation to some
extent, threatening some small animals who live and habitat in it. But planting measures
can restore or compensate for a part of the vegetation and can make the original animals to
return.
Investigation shows that there is no wild life reservation area along the proposed highway,
nor is there any precious and endangered species of animals and plants.
The road does not have large or medium-sized bridges, only will build 4 small bridges with
a total length of 98m. The works quantity for bridges is small and with short construction
period, so it can only exert a very slight impact on the water bodies along the road. Sewage
produced from construction camps, if discharged carelessly, will cause adverse impact on
the nearby water bodies.
The forecast shows that the soil erosion caused by the earth-borrowing and dumping in the
construction of the road project will reach 2239.17t/a if there is no protection measures at
all; but because the protection works and the main works will be simultaneously designed,
constructed, completed and accepted, therefore the actual soil erosion will be far less than
the forecasted value. In addition, implementation of road planting works will recover a part
of the vegetation and reduce the soil erosion in slopes.
(2) Acoustic Environment
General construction noise such as that produced by hauling vehicles and construction
machineries will have relatively large impact on people nearby the construction site (50m),
particularly the construction noise at the night will impact the people's rest and sleep.
RR1P 1: According to the forecasting, excess of standard limits will occur  at the
sensitive spots of Zhutian Hospital, Shanghai Yudian Hope Primary School, Nanjiang
Hospital and Zuoan Middle School in the near term of operation. Simple noise isolation
barriers( in combination with existing encirclement) and installation of noise isolation
2



windows will be adopted to mitigate the impact.
RRIP2:. According to the forecasting, excess of standard limits will occur  at the
sensitive spots of Hengling Central School, Shangwu Primary School and Xinjiang Middle
School in the near term of operation. Simple noise isolation barriers( in combination with
existing encirclement) will be adopted to mitigate the impact.
RRIP3: According to the forecasting, excess of standard limits will occur  at the
sensitive spots of Bushang and Wangmudu in the near term of operation. Simple noise
isolation barriers( in combination with existing encirclement) and installation of noise
isolation windows will be adopted to mitigate the impact.
RRIP4: According to the forecasting, excess of standard limits will occur  at the
sensitive spots of Tangjiangzhen, Laowuchang, Shangping, Tiantou, Laoshuzhui, Huangsha
Middle School and Beitian Middle School in the near term of operation. Simple noise
isolation barriers( in combination with existing encirclement) and installation of noise
isolation windows will be adopted to mitigate the impact.
(3) Ambient Air Environment
According to forecasting and analysis, under stability D, NOx concentration in all sensitive
locations can meet the standard limits.
(4) Water Environment
The main water pollution source is the sewage from the labor camp.
RRIPI-RRIP4: Through analyses, the road runoff will have no significant impact on water
bodies.
(5) Excavation and Transportation of Construction Materials
Excavation and transportation of construction materials will exert negative impacts on the
ecology, people's living quality and traffic safety along the road. But such impacts can be
effectively controlled by enhancing environmental management during construction.
(6) Social Environment
Road construction will take up some lands and agricultural fields, its impact on agricultural
economy can be reduced through adjusting the land rationalization and transforming the
land utilization value.
3. Environmental Impact Mitigation Measures
3.1 Design Stage
3. 1. I Reasonable Alignment
In selecting the alignment, the designers, environmental assessment unit and the project
owner have consulted and discussed, on the premise of reasonable alignment and low cost,
have fully considered various environmental factors such as protection of farmland, school
and residence, flood prevention, flood discharging, removal volume, urban development,
source of building materials and location of quarry, and also have extensively solicited
opinions from related experts, local governments, concerned departments and people from
every circle. Based on these, the current alignment is formed.
3.1.2 Ecological recovery
Planting works were designed synchronically with the main body works. Plant species were
optimized so to restore and compensate for the vegetation during design.
3



3.1.3 Water and Soil Conservation
Drainage and protection works were designed for subgrade, including intercepting ditch,
side ditch, and slope, which can not only stabilize the subgrade, but also prevent soil
erosion.
3.1.4 Water Pollution
(1) Drainage works were designed so to make the pavement runoff not enter into water
body directly;
(2) Design of bridges and culverts and drainage ditches have considered the requirements
for flood discharging and prevention, and will not damage local irrigation pattern.
(3) Canals and ponds that are occupied or separated by the subgrade have been rebuilt or
newly built.
3.1.5 Noise Impact
According to the forecasting, mitigation measures such as installation of noise isolation
windows and encirclement heightening will be adopted to mitigate the impact of noise on
the sensitive spots in construction stage.
3.1.6 Ambient Air Pollution
Quarries , earth borrowing/dumping sites and mixing plants will be located 300m beyond
residence, and the material hauling route will be reasonably designed so to avoid residences
as far as possible and to avoid flying dust's impact on residents.
3.1.7 Cultural relics protection
Jiangxi Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau and Jiangxi Provincial Cultural Relics Protection
Institute are entrusted to make surveillance along the road and submit the report ( see the
Investigation Report of Cultural Relics for the RRIP Components).
3.1.8 Resettlement
The design for this project has always emphasized to avoid towns, to avoid removal and
land occupation. A hierarchy of resettlement offices will be set up to formulate the
Resettlement Action Plan( RAP). The Institute of City and Population of Jiangxi Normal
University is employed as an independent supervisor. Details refer to the RAP.
3.1.9 Public participation
In the alignment of the road, setting of interchanges, environmental protection, resettlement,
we have consulted with along-the-road governments, concerned departments,
non-governmental organizations, rural committees, collectives and even individuals to
solicit their opinions so as to gain support from the public.
3.2 Construction stage
3.2.1 Ecological impact
(1) To enhance workers' awareness of environmental protection of natural resources and not
to damage wild life and not to cut trees.
(2) Contractors should reasonably arrange occupied land, reduce temporary land occupation,
shorten the use time, and reclaim the land timely.
(3) Earth borrowing and waste disposal shall be conducted in strict accordance with design
requirements so to well protect and restore the surrounding environment. The top soil
(30cm) of the acquired land shall be kept for reclaiming and compensation.
(4) Construction vehicles shall run in access roads, not in agricultural fields and woodlands.
4



3.2.2 Water and soil conservation
(1) Earth and stone works will avoid rainy season; reduce the area and number of
construction sites as much as possible; construction should be made in designed site and the
earth borrowing and waste area should not be made in designed site and the earth
borrowing and waste area should not be enlarged casually so to reduce the. exposed area of
cutting.
(2)The various protection engineering works should be built concurrently with the major
works, and cutting should be avoided in rainy season.
(3)Water drainage ditch and intercepting ditch should be built for the earth borrowing sites
to reduce rainfall eroding force; the surface of the earth borrowing site should be flat as
much as possible after the borrowing. In the process of dumping, the dumped earth
should be arranged and compressed tightly layer by layer according to the height of the
retaining wall to decrease the slope of earth surface
(4) Planting should be carried out in accordance with the design requirements.
To get the best effect, the side slope plantation should be completed one month in advance
to the rainy season.
(5)Reclaiming and planting measures should be taken after completion of the borrowing
and disposal sites. For the waste bank nearby the farmland, agricultural reclaiming should
be considered
3.2.3 Water Pollution
(1) Wasted are prohibited to throw into water body so to prevent water pollution, riverbed
compression and blocking;
(2) Waste oil of hauling vehicles and construction niachines and solid waste with oil dirties
should be collectively land-filled.
(3) Septic tank and garbage tank should be provided at temporary construction camps,
which should be cleared timely. Construction materials shall be stored in places with
rainfall prevention measures.
(4) Waste dregs arising out of the bridge pier construction should be transported to places
designated jointly by the contractor, environmental and water conservancy departments,
disposed of under the supervision of designated persons.
3.2.4 Noise pollution
(I) When the construction site is close to school, no construction work with heavy noise
machines should be arranged at school time; when the construction site is close to densely
populated residence, construction work with strong noise machines should not be arranged
at nighttime. In case that the above construction work has to be proceeded, consultation
must be made with the residents who may be impacted, or proper compensation must be
paid. To reduce the noise pollution of construction machineries, mobile noise isolation can
be used.
(2) To use construction machines with low noise level as much as possible. For construction
machines with high noise level, temporary sound barrier should be adopted to mitigate the
noise impact. The construction materials storage site and the mixing plant should be set at
places over300m away from the acoustic sensitive locations.
(3) The construction operator's work time should be arranged in accordance with the labor
hygiene standard, and personal protection measures such as wearing ear-plugs and helmets,
5



etc. should be provided to the operators.
(4) The access roads for the highway construction should be selected away from such
sensitive locations as schools, residences and hospitals. When dense residences exist 50m
within access road, night transportation of building materials is forbidden. For lorries
transporting construction materials by the existing roads, the contractor should pay
attention to the maintenance of the lorries and keep the noise produced at a minimum level.
3.2.5 Ambient Air Pollution
(1) The stabilized soil and bitumen mixing plants should be set up at the leeward side and
300m away from the sensitive locations of residences, hospitals and schools.
(2) Bulk construction materials transported by truck should be covered to prevent spillage
as much as possible. The storage of the bulk construction materials should be covered and
kept over 300m away from the school and village sensitive locations.
(3) Hauling roads and construction site, particularly the stabilized soil mixing plant, should
be sprayed from time to time to prevent secondary dust flying.
3.2.6 Cultural relics protection
During construction, if underground cultural relics are found, then construction should stop
and the supervisory engineer will protect the site, and concerned department will be
notified to handle it.
3.2.7 Public participation
Complaint telephone number for environmental complain should be conspicuously marked
at the construction camp. For complaint problems, the local environmental department shall
be contacted and such problem should be settled within 48 hours.
3.2.8 Worker's health
(1) Septic tank and garbage tank shall be set up at construction camp, which are to be
cleared by the contractor periodically so to prevent outbreak of disease. Drinking water that
complies with hygiene standard shall be provided at the site.
(2) Contractors must adhere to labor protection regulations to provide helmets, earplugs and
periodic physical examination to workers.
(3) Full-time health worker should be arranged by the contractor to provide medical
guaranteeing for the construction workers, free condom should be available in each labour
camp. the health worker should periodically deliver hygienic knowledge and education to
the construction workers.
3.2.9 Traffic and transportation
(1) The construction of road sections should be reasonably organized. On duty system
should be established to guarantee the smooth operation of traffic and traffic safety.
Transportation of construction materials at rush hours should be avoided, the contractor is
required to make a reasonable transportation plan.
(2) Access road should have proper width and quality, so as to ensure that both pedestrians
and vehicles can travel safely even in bad climate conditions. Local public security and
transportation management departments shall be well coordinated with to mobilize traffic
jam and to handle traffic accident so as to ensure a smooth running.
The above measures to be taken during construction stage have been defined in the
contracts signed with the contractors.
6



3.3 Operation stage
3.3.1 Ecological impact
(1) In order to maintain the dynamic balance of cultivated land, the project proponent
should reclaim waste lands coordinating with the local administration departments for
national land to compensate the lost cultivated land .
(2) To recover the damaged vegetation and ecology in time so to prevent denuded surface.
A greening belt of some width should be set up at the two sides of the road.
(3) The culverts should be cleared in time to ensure a smooth running of water in the
irrigation system.
3.3.2 Soil erosion
Further improve the soil & water conservation works, planting works, and land reclaiming
works according to design requirements.
3.3.3 Noise pollution
It is suggested that no new schools, hospitals be built within 50m from the proposed road,
no new residential districts be built within 20m from the road.
(1) Strengthen the road traffic management and road maintenance. Motor vehicles with
high noise level exceeding standard limit should be banned to drive onf the road.
No-Tooting sign should be arranged in concentrated residential districts.
(2) Implementation of noise monitoring plan: supplementary noise mitigation measures will
be adopted according to the monitored data and listed in the contractor's contract.
(3) Sensitive location protection
Before the implementation of noise mitigation measures, the acoustic design should be
based on the road project design, and proper adjustment should made to the mitigation
measures and technical indexes. Besides, the opinion of protection objectives should be
solicited before the implementation, and if the mitigation measures are rejected by them,
other measures should be considered. The mitigation measures for each noise-sensitive spot
along the four roads are listed in Table 3.3-1.

3.3.4 Ambient air pollution
7



(1) Greening and planting should be set up at both sides of the road, which is good to
absorb the flying dust and to protect the ambient air quality.
(2) Ambient air monitoring plan should be implemented to decide supplementary
environmental protection measures according to the monitored results.
3.3.5 Water pollution
The dust and sand on the side slope of subgrade and pavement, when rushed by rain water,
will be carried into the drainage system and deposited , leading to blocking up of the
drainage system. Therefore, periodical clearing of drainage system and side ditches will be
quite necessary to ensure the smooth running .
After implementation of the above measures, the adverse impacts on this project can be
reduced to an acceptable degree.

5 Environmental Monitoring Plan
5.1 Objective
The objective of formulating environmental monitoring plan is to supervise the
implementation of all mitigation measures, to modity the EAP appropriately according to
monitored results, to justify the implementation time and implementation proposal of
environmental protection measures. The formulating philosophy is that monitoring is
conducted according to predicted major environmental impacts at different periods.
5,2 Monitoring Implementer
According to the jurisdiction zoning of the area along the highway, it is suggested that Jian
Municipal Environmental Monitoring Station; Ganzhou Municipal Environmental
Monitoring Station be entrusted the monitoring task of RRIP3 and RRIP4.
5.3 Monitoring Items Based on the analyses and prediction, the monitoring items are:
determined as follows:
I) The monitoring items during construction stage
OAir monitoring item: TSP
()Acoustic environment monitoring item: Construction noise
( Water environmental monitoring item: Ph, COD,E, SS, oil
2) The monitoring items during operation stage
(DAir monitoring item: NOx
(2)Acoustic environment monitoring item: traffic noise;
