1. Foreword
1.1 Background
At the beginning of 1994, the Jiangxi Provincial Government made a major
decision of "Building Nanchang-Zhangshu-Jian-Ganzhou-Gan-Yue Border Special
Motorway . This road project will play very important role in the opening of the
Jiangxi province to the outside world, improvement of the investment environment,
further adjustment of the industry structure and the local people' s living standards.
As requested by the Jiangxi Provincial Communications Department (JPCD), the
Jiangxi Provincial Communications Design Institute (JPCDI) started the preparation
work of the road project in September 1994, and completed the i Feasibility Study
Report for Gan-Yue Expressway (Taihe-Ganzhou Section)", in December 1999. In
May 2000, JPCDI compiled the supplementary report to the " Feasibility Study
Report for Gan-Yue Expressway (Taihe-Ganzhou Section)", ,and completed the two-
stage preliminary design in July, 2000.
In December 1999 JPCD and Jiangxi Provincial Expressway Administration
(JPEA) entrusted the Research Institute of Highway (RIOH) of the MOC to undertake
the EIA work for the road project of Gan-Yue Expressway (Taihe-Ganzhou Section),
From December 1999 to August 2000, with the assistance from the JPCDI and the
local governments and the relevant departments the EIA team from the RIOH studied
the feasibility study report and primarily design in details, conducted several times
of the site reconnaissance along the proposed highway area for the environmental
conditions and the major environmental protection targets and collection of related
materials and data.
In December 1999, the RIOH of MOC completed the TOR of EIA for this project.
In March 2000, the RIOH compiled the EIA report (first version) of Gan-Yue
Expressway (Taihe-Ganzhou Section). On April 14, 2000, the NEPA approved by the
TOR in Document 58# [2000]. In June 2000, in accordance with the aide-memoire of
the World Bank environmental experts at the first preparation mission. the RIOH
completed the EIA report (second version) of Gan-Yue Expressway (Taihe-Ganzhou
Section). On June 27, the EIA report of this project (including linking roads) passed
the examination by the environmental experts at the meeting held by the
Environmental Protection Office of MOC in Beijing. In accordance with the aide-
memoire requiremenst of the World Bank environmental experts at the second
preparation mission. we completed the EIA report (third version) of Gan-Yue
Expressway (Taihe-Ganzhou Section). In December 2000, the EIA team completed
the EIA report (fourth version) of Gan-Yue Expressway (Taihe-Ganzhou Section) in
accordance with the aide-memoire requirements of the World Bank environmental
experts at the pre-evaluation mission.

Chapter 2. Project Overview
2.1 Significance of the Project
(1) To meet the need of connection of the mid and lower reach areas of the
Yangtze river and the special economic zones of southern China
To connect the Yangtze river- the golden water channel in China and the
Shanghai-Chengdu expressways along the Yangtze river with those in Guangdong,
Hong Kong and Macao region, to strengthen the economic relations between the
economic zones in the Yangtze river delta area and the Pear river delta area, to
increase the radiant influence of the southern China coastal area, Hong Kong and
Macao region on the eastern and central China, and to further develop the economic
and cultural exchanges between Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hainan and  the regions
mentioned above, it is necessary to construct the Gan-Yue expressway.
(2) To integrate the national trunk road network system
As parts of the north-south corridor within Jiangxi province. the sections of
Jiujiang-Nanchang (Houtian), Nanchang (Houtian)-Zhangshu have been completed.
with Zhangshu-Changfu section still under construction. The road section of the
proposed highway will be the "bottle neck" of the north-south corridor if it is not to
be built right away.
(3) To meet the increasing traffic demand
The existing national highway 105 is characteristic of large traffic volume.
passing through many townships. with frequent traffic accident. The average annual
growth rate of the traffic volume on the national highway 105 is high up to 15%. with
that of some sections saturated or over saturated. To meet with the increasing traffic
demand, it is necessary to speed up the highway construction.
(4) To meet the needs of the provincial economic development
The proposed highway area is the old revolutionary base area. economically
underdeveloped. The proposed highway project will provide important infrastructure
conditions for the area to get the support from the economically developed areas in the
northern part of the Jiangxi province and the Guangdong coastal areas and will greatly
help the area' s economic development.
(5) The relations with "Jing-Jiu" railway and national highway 105
The proposed highway is located on the western bank of the Ganjiang river, and
the "Jing-Jiu" railway is located on the eastern bank of the Ganjiang river. which
forms the north-south transport network where highway transport is an important
mode between Jiangxi and Guangdong.
(6) In conformity with the overall transport development program of the Jiangxi
province
The proposed highway is an essential part of the backbone transport system in a



shape of "great cross (+)", as planned by the Jiangxi province.
(7) To meet the needs of speeding up the development of provincial tourism
resources
The proposed highway area is rich in tourism resources, with pleasant weather;
and there are not only revolutionary historical sites but also beautiful landscape and
cultural relics. Construction of the proposed highway will speed up and promote the
development of the six tourism areas of Lushan, Boyanghu, Nanchang, Jinggangshan,
Ganzhou, and Sanbaishan along the "Jing-Jiu" route area.
2.2 The Alignment Programs
2.2.1 Recommended program
The proposed expressway starts from the end point of the Changfu-Taihe section
- Mashi township (the intersection point with the national highway 105). and ends at
the Longling Town of Nankang city intersected with highway 105 (or 323). The
alignment bypasses Mashi of Taihe, Shaokou of Wan' an, Lutian, Luotang, guijiang,
Liangbizhou of Suichuan county. Qingshi, Taiping of Nankang city, Hengshi,
Mashuang, Shibatang. Neichaoyu and Longling, etc.
Figure 2-2-1 and 2-2-2 show the geographical location and the alignment of the
highway.
2.2.2 The partial alternative schemes
In addition to the recommended scheme for the proposed expresswav. there are
other six alternative schemes.
(1) Taihe Alternative I: starts from Nanyuanlong of Taihe, bypassing the northern
Wushan, via Taihe to Changwan, Dongtang, Changxi, and meets with the
recommended alignment scheme ( Scheme II ) at Xiaoshantang of Wan' an.
(2) Wan' an Alternative Il: starts from K172+500, alignment strike smoothly
along the river, bypassing Caoxia and Dutang.
(3) Suichuan Alternative Il: starts from Mantian of Suichuan county. via Tankou,
Hongshan. Xiatiandong. Xiaokan. and meets with the Alternative I at Yejiapai.
(4) Fuziling Alternative 1: located at west of Fuziling, starts from K204+638.
occupying Jinshi-Maji old road, goes around the mountain through the valley.
bypasses on the way Maji. Daopeng. Maoxia, Jiezhi, Xizhai, Zhangfang. Paiboshan of
Jinshi township of Suichuan county. via Xiaoshanheng- Fuziling vallev area. meets
with Alternative II at Leigongheng.
(5) Mashuang Alternative I: starts from Hexikou of Mashuang township of
Nankang city. via Xiagongqian, Chenkengli. Futou, along the valley area.

The width of the subgrade is 26.0m, with cross-section being composed of 0.75m
(earth  shoulder) +  2.25m  (hard  shoulder) +  0.75  (marginal strip) +  2 X 3.75m
(carriageway) + 0.75m (marginal strip) + 2.Om (median) + 0.75m (marginal strip) + 2
X 3.75m (carriageway) +0.75m (marginal strip) + 2.25m (hard shoulder) + 0.75m
(earth shoulder). The cross fall of the carriageway and the hard shoulder shall be 2%
and that of the earth shoulder shall be 4%. The standard cross-section of the subgrade
is shown in Figure 2-4-1.
(2) Subgrade side slope
The filling side slope will be 1:1.5. When it is higher than 8m, the side slope
below the height of 8m shall be 1:1.75. with l.5m side slope lane to be set in the
middle. For cutting section. the side slope shall be based on the geological
information, with such protection measures as grass planting, geo-grid side slope
protection, guard wall, earth retaining wall and etc. to be selected.
(3) Drainage and protection
0( Pavement drainage
(a) the cutting section: pavement run-off will be discharged into the side ditch.
(b) the filling section: if the subgrade slope grade large than 6m. concentrated
drainage shall be taken for pavement run-off by setting gully at the road strip;
while the slope grade is less than 6m. pavement run-off will be discharged
by the slope.
(c) Super-elevation section: a drainage system consisting of cutoff basin,
horizontal drainage pipe and gully
(d) Central separation belt: it consisting of bitumen cloth water sealing at the
bottom, vertical drainage pipes and cutoff basin

will be set for cutting and filling sections with bottom width of 0.6m and depth of
0.8m.
(b) Intercepting ditch and platform ditch: for cut sections where runoff goes to
the subgrade slop, 0.5 X 0.5m intercepting ditch with mortar pitching shall be set at
place over 5m from the outstretched area.
(c) Drainage ditch: drainage ditches will be set along the rainy road area for flood
discharge as well as for irrigation.
(Æ Protection engineering
10cm thick of unsifted crushed stone layer will be used to strengthen the earth
shoulder. For some cutting sections with soft rock or weathered stone areas mortar
pitching will be used for protection. When there are ponds, reservoir and flood area
close to the filling slope section, for subgrade slope which is 0.5m below the design
water level, then concrete pre-structure or mortar pitching will be used for subgrade
slope protection; the common subgrade are to be protected by grass planting. For
higher subgrade, mortar pitching grid stone slop protection will be adopted. To protect
subgrade slope from occupying river pass, foot slope contraction, shoulder or
embankment retaining wall will be built as restrained by the landform and land
produce, etc.
2.4.2 Bridge and culverts
The medium and large bridges are evenly distributed along the route with proper
increased number of bridge spans to improve flood discharge capacity of the bridges
and culverts. Underpasses and grade separation will be provided for sections close to
villages, with some having dual functions of drainage and passageway The bridge
scheme recommended is shown in Table 2-4-1. Based on the ground base, the bridge
will adopt spread foundation and pile foundation, which adopts cast-in-place pile.

(2) Grade separation
Grade separation are built to overpass railway. classified highways or township
roads. Some grade separations are also built at some village roads (farming roads)
considering the long-term development. There are 53 grade separation in total along
the expressway and a total of 328 passageways at village /township roads and some
important field farming roads.
2.4.5 Connection road
There are three connecting roads as Wan' an . Suichuan and Ganzhou, of which.
Ganzhou road connecting the main line and Ganzhou region is very large in traffic
volume, thus adopting 1 7m wide subgrade; the subgrade width for the rest two adopt
1 2m. To put into the play of the expressway as soon as possible. the connecting roads
will be designed. constructed and completed simultaneously with the main line.
2.4.6 Road construction material along the line
(1) Quarry site
The area is rich in road construction materials with about 20 quarries for option.
The stone materials dominated by sand stone, granite stone and lime stone are of good
and hard quality. Transportation is very convenient. The main quarry sites along the
proposed road area include Wangjiaping and Majiagang in Taihe county;
Taigongshan in Wan' an county; Zhongtuan, Huangkeng and Zhuping in Suichuan
county; Zengkeng, Bazai. Dongpai. Huanglong. Tianzidi in Nankang city.
(2) Sand and gravel sites
I.?



There are about 12 sand and gravel sites for choice. The major sites include
Dukou of Shaokou township in Wan' an county, Yangcuba of Quanjiang in Suichuan
county, Shatian of Jinshi township, Luowen, Zhuping, Saxi, Shangyoujiang,
Zhangjiang, etc.
(3) Quick lime
The proposed expressway area is short of quick lime material, with only one lime
kiln each at Huanggang in Taihe county and at Kengkou in Suichuan county
respectively. It is far away from the proposed expressway and the output is low.
(4) Earth borrowing (waste) sites
Though priority has given to vertical hauling and balanced earth and stone work
in the preliminary design, but some earth borrowing and waste sites will still have to
be selected. Based on the principle of max utilization, least wastes, rational and
economical use of land, the borrowing sites are identified at some non-economic areas
as waste slope and high banks; while waste bank are defined at waste valley and lower
ground. About 11 earth borrowing and 23 waste sites are selected. for which design
has been done in respects of drainage, protection and planting.
2.4.7 Resettlement plan
RAP is required for this project and now the draft RAP has been completed.

Chapter 3. Overview of Environment Condition
and Current Status Assessment
3.1 Natural environment
3.1.1 Geographical position
The Taihe-Ganzhou section of the Gan-Yue expressway passes by the four
counties of Taihe, Wan' an, Suichuan, Ganxian, and two cities of Ganzhou and
Nankang, all the way through the southern hinterland of the Jiangxi province in north-
south direction. It is located at 25040, -26∞50, N and 114050,   115000,
3.1.2 Landform
The alignment of the proposed expressway is from the north to the south, along
the Ganjiang river towards the upper-stream direction. The landform of the whole area
is characteristic of high in the north and low in the south. The route starts from the
Jietai basin area, going through Suichuan, Nankang hilly lands, and ends at the river
valley area of Shangyoujiang river and Zhangjiang river in Lishan of Nankang.
The road section of Mashi (Taihe)-Luomukeng (Nankang) at the start point is in
a hilly area. where the landform has great topographical relief with steep mountains
and widespread gullies and with elevation over 250 - 550; and the section of
Luomukeng-Lijiashan at the end point (Nankang) is in a light hilly area, with
alluvial plain in the valley of Shangyoujiang river and Zhangjiang river. where the
landform has gentle undulation widely developed with class II river terrace with
elevation over 90--150m.
3.1.3 Geological condition and earthquake
(1) Lithological character and geological structure
Great differences exist in terms of lithological character along the highway route
area with outcropped strata.
The geological structure is dominated by old strata developed with broken ground
in north-east direction from the southern Suichuan to the northern Nankang. with
locally outcropped direct folding.
(2) Hydrological geology
There are four types of underground water classified by its source, storage
manner and hydraulic features, i.e. carbonate fissured cavern water, carbonate tramp
detrital cavern fissure flow, detrital rock fissure flow, and detrital rock fissure pore



w ater.
(3) Poor geological condition
The route covers various geological and landform areas. The in-situ investigation
shows that the poor geological conditions possibly encountered in the construction
process mainly including karst, cave, and intermontane liman soft ground.
(4) Neotectonic movement and earthquake
The neotectonic movement in this area is developed continuously based on the
previous tectonic movement. characteristic of succession and intermittency, with great
areas intermittent uplift activities. The differential mobility between fracture tectonic
and block fault is not conspicuous with less earthquake activity.
The earthquake intensity in the area is less than six degree, according to the
",Seismic Zoning Map of the People' s Republic of China" (Jiangxi Province,
1990); therefore earthquake resistant may not be considered for the bridge. tunnel and
other structure design.
3.1.4 Hydrology
The route is along the west bank of the Ganjiang river from the north to the south
in upper stream direction. crossing over Suichuanjiang river, Zhangjiang river and its
branches. The rivers passed through bv the route include Shushuihe, Suichuanjiang,
Shangyoujiang and Zhangjiang. which belong to the Ganjiang river system, flowing
into the Boyang lake. The main source of their run-off flow comes from rainfall,
mostly concentrated through April and June with great fluctuation of the flow volume
from season to season. Floods usually happen over April-July with peak flood in
Mav and June and duration of the flood over 15-20 days.
The frequencies of calculated water levels for each of the hydrological stations
are shown in Table 3-1-1. Suichuanjiang and Shangyoujiang are navigable with
planned navigation channel of Class VI: with no navigation requirement for other
rivers.

3.1.5 Meteorological condition
The area passed by the proposed expressway is belong to subtropical monsoon
climate, characteristic of cold winter and spring, hot summer and dry autumn. more
rainfall in summer, dry and cloudy in Autumn with less sunshine and long period of
frost-free. It is rich in thermal resources and abundant rainfall unevenly distributed
across the year.
(1) Temperature
The annual average temperature in the whole area is over 17.7C - 19.20C; with
the highest in summer through July and August, monthly average temperature over
26.6∞C -29.8∞C; the lowest in winter through January and February, monthly average
over 3.50C-6.60C; the annual extreme highest up to 400C -40.47C and the annual
extreme lowest down to -6.640C - -9.9640C; annual average frost-free period over
281 -286 days, the longest of 335 days and shortest of 249 days.
(2) Rainfall
The annual precipitation of the area is over 1.372- 1.595 mm. with the maximum
over 1,877-2.102 mm and the minimum of 823 mm. The rainfall over March -
June is 762 mm, accounting for 50% of the year; that over July-October 396 mm.
accounting for 27% of the year; that from November to the next February 396 mm.
accounting for 27% of the year. There are average of 157 rainy days, with the
maximum of 202 days and the minimum of 111 days and the longest continuous rainy
period is 26 days.
Owing to the unevenly distributed rainfall across the year. usually flood first
followed by dry season in the growing period of double-cropping paddy. The annual
precipitation usually tends to increase with the increase of the altitude.
(3) Wind direction and speed
In summer. the subtropic high pressure dominates with most wind coming from
the south; in the other seasons of spring, autumn and winter, it is dominated by
continent high pressure with most wind coming from the north, owing to the north-
south direction of the Ganjiang river valley.
Annual average wind speed is 1.9m/s. with monthly average over 1.6-2.3m/s.

3.2.4 Current status of soil erosion
3.2.4.1 Factors to cause the soil erosion
The soil erosion in the area along the proposed expressway is higher than the
provincial average except for Suichuan county. The main factors to cause the soil
erosion are rainfall. landform, parent soil quality. cover plants, and human activities.
The landform in the proposed expressway area is of various type dominated by
hillv land accounting for over 70% of the total, which is vulnerable to soil erosion.
The annual rainfall is unevenly distributed in terms of season, March-June rainfall in
form of heavy rain or storm accounts for 55 percent of the whole year. in which the
big rain erosion leads to the heavy wash of the surface soil which takes up 75 percent
of the whole year, thus resulting in heavy soil erosion.
The red soil accounting for 60 percent of the soil in this area is weak in anti-
t4

erosion.
Cover vegetation is the critical factor in defending soil erosion. Due to long-time
irrational artificial cutting resulted in big damage to vegetation, the naked earth is
vulnerable to heavy soil erosion.
Table 3-2-3 shows the soil erosion distribution in the proposed expressway area.
In recent years comprehensive measures of mountain, water, farmland and forest were
taken to mitigate the soil erosion. Other measures as ecological, engineering and
agricultural means are actively used to improve the ecological condition. Soil erosion
has been mitigated to some extend. From Table 3-2-3, the most sections along the
route are medium and below soil erosion area, only the places closing to destination
are heavy soil erosion areas.

belong to the Yangtze river system, with its east source Gongjiang river, west source
Zhangjiang river, it meets at north suburb of Ganzhou. known as Ganjiang river.
Suichuan river is the fourth branch of the Ganjiang river located at the main stream of
Ji' an section with catchment area of 3,045 square kilometers. the main stream length
is 162 km and the perennial average runoff is 2.894 million cubic meters.
There is sound irrigation systems composed of channels, reservoir and ponds with
effective irrigation areas of 296,400 ha. and 290,100 ha., accounting for 77.8% and
81.1% of the total farmland area in Ganzhou and Ji' an respectively.
The investigation showed that there is no water intake from drinking water
resource for the river sections within the assessment area. The main drinking water
sources come from underground water.
3.3.2 Monitoring and assessment of the water quality status
To understand the water quality of the main rivers. some river sections are
selected for water quality monitoring. One cross section monitoring is set at the bridge
site for each river section, surface water is taken once a day for two days running at
10m from both riverbanks where a vertical line is set at the river center. The sample
analysis method will follow   " Environmental Monitoring Analysis Method, . The
monitoring and assessment results are presented in Table-3-3-2.

It can be seen from Table 3-3-2 that the water quality is up to the standard in
terms of all the monitoring results without exceedance .The confornity rate for each
indicator is 100 percent, indicating good water quality and meeting the functional
requirements. In addition, according to the relevant materials which shows that there

is no industrial pollution source in the rural areas along the proposed expressway,
except for some pollution of agricultural chemicals and chemical fertilizer.
3.4 Assessment of Acoustic environment
3.4.1 Current acoustic status and sensitive location survey
Most sections of the proposed expressway are located in mountain and rural areas,
where the current environmental is rather quiet without any large noise source. Since
some of the resident areas are beside the existing road and its intersection, there are
some noises affecting the resident areas. The main noise in the village comes from
living and fowls, cries. After consulting the preliminary design documents and site
reconnaissance. the sensitive spots of resident quarters and schools in the assessment
areas of the proposed expressway are presented in Table 3-4-1-lTable 3-4-3 .

3.4.2 Current status monitoring and assessment
Acoustic environment status monitoring shall be carried out for the representative
sensitive spots defined in the TOR ( as shown in Table 3-4-5 and Figure 3-4-1). The
monitoring instruments, method and frequency are in accordance with the
specifications  set  forth  in   GB   /  T14623-93    "Urban   Area  Ambient  Noise
Measurement Methods" . The monitoring results are presented in Table 3-4-5 which
shows that:
(1) The current status of noise level measured at the resident spots along the
proposed expressway area are: daytime Leq 41.6"-55.7 dB; nighttime Leq 34.3'-49.7
dB. most of the resident areas meet the Class I or even Class 0 standard. except for a
few  village exceeding the Class I limit but still up to the Class II standard, which
indicate a good acoustic environment.
(2) The current status of noise level measured at the sensitive spots of school and
clinics are: daytime Leq 41.2-53.9 dB; nighttime Leq 40.9-45.1 dB. meet the Class
I standard.
(3) The monitoring results show that the current status as a whole of the acoustic
environment along the proposed expressway area is good.

3.5 Assessment of ambient air
3.5.1 Current status
The alignment of the proposed expressway has been arranged away from the
large sensitive spots of urban and township areas, with most areas passed through by
the highway are rural and wild areas, where the air quality is kept in natural conditions.
There is no large fixed pollution source along the proposed expressway area. The
existing air pollutants mainly come from the emissions from highway traffic,
secondary flying dust. CO and TSP from daily life: but the discharged volume is
small. Therefore the current status of the air quality along the proposed expressway is
good.
27



3.5.2 Monitoring of current status
Following the principle of "points representing the line" , some typical
sensitive spots have been selected for monitoring the status of the ambient air quality.
(  The items to be monitored are TSP, and NOx.
02  For NOx, a continuous 24 hours for 3 days running monitoring shall be
carried out as to ensure 18-hour valid data; for TSP, 12 hours/day (6:00-
18:00), filter paper once in the morning and once in the afternoon;
(E) The sampling analysis method shall be in accordance with the specifications
set forth by the NEPA. The current status monitoring and results are
presented in Table 3-5-1

It can be seen from table 3-5-1 that: the one hour average concentration of NOx is
over 0.003 -0.0 -1mg/m3. the daily average concentration is over 0.004-0.01O0mg/m-;
the daily average concentration of TSP is 0.103-0.270mg/m3. both of NOx and TSP
daily average are below that stated in the national Class 11 standard. indicating there
is still much leeway and the overall ambient air quality is good.

I> Current status of railway
In Jiangxi province there are six trunkl railways of Zhe-Gan. Ying-Xia, Wan-Gan,
Jing-Jiu. Xiang-Jiu and Wu-Jiu and eleven branches inside or passing through Jiangxi
province. with railway mileage in operation of 2,175km.
Jing-Jiu (Beijing-Jiulong) railway is an important part of the Gan-Yue transport
corridor. The Gan-Yue railway section starts from north Shahejie of JiuJiang city,
passing through Nanchang, Ji' an, Taihe., Ganzhou, Dingnan, and the Guangdong
province' s Longchuan, Huizhou, Shenzhen, and end at Jiulong, with total length of
1,070km. of which 700km are in Jiangxi province and 370km are in Guangdong
province.
According to the statistics, the passenger transport volume by Jing-Jiu railway
reached 4.3 million in 1998. increasing by 32.3% over the previous year; the freight
volume dispatched reached 4.489 million in 1998 an crease of 31.7% over the
previous year. Rapid increase of passenger traffic and the large capacity of the trunk
railway put great pressures on the provincial railway sections. The Xiangtangxi-
Ji' an section' s availability ratio has reached 93.3%; that of the Ganzhoueast-
Longchuan section reached 109%. which is over loaded.
, Current status of highway
The Gan-Yue highway is an important part of Jiangyxi-Guangdong corridor. and
also the important component of the backbone highwav system in the shape of
,-cross f '-J . also one of the economic trunk lines in Jiangxi province. At present.
most of the 243km expressway have completed and open to traffic beyond the north
of Changfu: and the traffic on the section beyond the south of Changfu is over the
capacity. with some sections very serious. As the result. the highway is congested
w ith service level decreasing and with frequent traffic accident. Therefore more
highway capacitv and higher service level are needed for Jiangxi province.
t%3 Current status of Ganjiang waterway
Ganjiang river is the second large branch river of the Yangtze river and the
number one large river in Jiangxi province from south to north. an important
component of the north south transport corridor in parallel with Jing-Jiu railway and
the national highwvay 105. Owing to a number factors the navigation conditions of
Ganjiang river was deteriorating, with great amount of cargo turned to highway and
railwvay since the Jin(g-Jiu railway starting operation in 1996. The waterwav transport
is in a difficult time for further development.

Chapter 4 Forecasted Environmental Impact
and Mitigation Measures
4.1 Assessment of Ecological Environmental Impact
4.1.1 Land occupation' s impact on land utilization
The proposed highway (main line) intends to take up a land surface of 11,218.8 mu,
of which paddy field accounting for 37.9%, followed by wood lands accounting for
30.4%. In terms of the jurisdictional composition of the land occupied. Nankang has the
largest proportion accounting for 52.7%. followed by Wan' an accounting for 22.0%.
The land occupation is illustrated in Table 4-1 -1.

In  addition  to  the permanent land  occupation. there will be some temporary  land
occupation of 445.5 mu (as shown in Table 4-1-2) in the construction stage, including
paddy fields, dry land and woodland. of which most are woodland followed by paddy
fields. The cultivated land for temporary use accounts for 33.0% of the total. Nankang
city has the most land being rented, accounting for 54.20/0 of the total temporary land use.

Large-size  occupation of agricultural fields. esp. the paddy  fields. will sharpen the
35



acute contradiction of less land and large population. and will aggravate the pressure on
the remaining agricultural fields, thus exerting some impact on agricultural production
and land utilization. Although the land size being occupied by the road only accounts for
a tiny part among the total land of the directly influenced area, but in terms of the local
land contractors, it will exert relatively great impact on them. Highway land occupation
will exert a short-term impact on the income of the farmners along the road whose land has
been occupied.
Similarly, the temporary land occupation during the construction stage will also
produce some negative impact on local agricultural cultivation. But compared to
permanent land occupation, the size of temporary land occupation is relatively small and
they can be virtually restored by clearing and reclaiming. So the adverse impact of
temporary land occupation during construction stage on land utilization and economy is
temporary.
This project intends to compensate for the trees and young crops to be occupied, as
shown in Table 4-1-3.

To sum up. the land occupation by this project will exert some impact on the local
land utilization and agricultural ecology. But the construction of this expressway will
u reatly improve the transportation infrastructure required by agricultural cultivation and
processing. thus promoting the rural economy of the Ganzhou prefecture into a higher
level by materializing the value of land resources in utilization.
4.1.2 Impact on fauna and flora along the expressway
Most of the flora to be damaged by the expressway construction is agricultural crops.
planted woods and wild bush. of which the expressway w-ill take up a total of paddy fields.
drv lands and woodlands with a size of 8.512.2 mu.
As there is neither primitive forest nor endangered tree species along the road. the
expresswvay construction will not produce long-terrm destructive impact on vegetation.
36



The employer as well as the proposed construction unit will strictly follow the
planting design specifications and requirements issued by the Ministry of
Communications. This will not only compensate for and restore partial original
vegetation damaged by construction to some degree, but also protect the subgrade, reduce
soil erosion, flying dust and mitigate the traffic noise.
Most of the animals living in the assessment area are domesticated animals, fowls
and a few common wild animals that are not particular with their habitat environment. but
are relatively adaptable to human activity. In this case the proposed highway will not
cause significant change to their habitat environment nor interfere with their normal life.
They can still survive in the area along the road.
4.1.3 Impact on ecology caused by earth borrowing/disposal and tunnel construction
Table 4-1-4 shows the cut/fill relation and the estimated stone and earth works for the
main line. The whole line still needs to dispose of a total waste volume of 2,081,1710 m3
after the longitudinal transition of earth and stonework.

After the longitudinal transition of earth and stonework, a total of 26 earth
borrowing pits and 20 waste disposal pits are designed. as shown in Table 4-1-5 and
Table 4-1-6.
The recommended alignment will set up two tunnels: Yanggongshan tunnel and
Fuzilino, tunnel. The Yanggongshan tunnel is 1560m in length for both left and right
routes with a longitudinal gradient of 2.30/0. Its north exit is seriously short of earth while
its south exit is rich with large volumes of waste earth. The total volume for the cut stone
worLs for this tunnel is 307.211.7 rn'. The fuziling tunnel is 1700m long for left route and
1 720rn long for right with a longitudinal gradient of 1.5%. The total volume of stone cut
\Xorks is 336.968m-.

Aote souircefrom the constriction design for the main line in .\ovenmber 2000,
The location for earth borrowing and waste areas will be selected locally from the
nearest location and restore the fields. The earth borrowing pits will be mainly located
in non-commercial areas as waste hills. waste slopes. desolate valley and low-productive
farmlands. The earth borrowing and waste areas. after being leveling and clearing. can be
used for agricultural infrastructure construction. the deep-cut section can be developed
into paddy fields or fish ponds so as to increase the utilitv of land value. Therefore the
selection of the pits is relatively reasonable. During the construction stage. the earth
borrowing pits should be leveled, reclaimed and replanted from time to time so as to
restore one pit after it is finished so as to restore its ecological condition. This work and
responsibilities shall be specifies and implemented in the contract between the employer
and the contractors. When the borrowing and waste areas are to be used for farming. the
top cultivate soil taken from the farmland occupied by subgrade can be used to cover the
pits.
Environmental protection engineering has been designed for the borrowing and
v, aste areas for this project, including drainage ditch. mortar pitching slope. planting trees
and grass. etc. The adverse impact can be controlled so long as the earth borrowing and
waste disposal are conducted strictly in accordance with the design and the environmental
protection works.
4.1.4 Forecast and analysis of soil erosion impact
39



(1) Forecast of soil erosion intensity during construction
The intensity of soil erosion depends on the rainfall, the condition of covering plants,
gradient, etc. The soil erosion intensity is forecasted based on the soil erosion equation by
taking into considerations and quantifying the differences before and after the
construction work. The forecasting model is as follows.
E=R *K  Ls *C *P
wihere: E;-Erosion intensity (t/km2 *a);
R - Erosive factor of rainfall,
K - Soilfactor, 0.42 -0.46for loose soil in road engineering:
Ls - Terrain factor, a function of surface run-off length and gradient,
calculated by the follows:
A
Ls =(  -m* -(65 Jsin2 O + 4.56sinO + 0. 065}
22.1
where.  A - Length of eroded slope (m):
9- Gradient of eroded slope;
m - Experience index:
C - Surface coverage factor;
P - Soil r etention measures factor.
It can be seen from the above equation. that the soil erosion intensity is mainly
related with such factors as rainfall (R factor), soil quality (K factor). terrain (Ls factor).
cover plants (C factor) and management (P factor).
R: represents dynamic factor of water erosion. related with rainfall volume and
intensity. constant before and after construction.
K: is the sensitivity of soil to the erosion, related with granularity and organic content
in soil. Farmland soil usually has fine granular structure and medium permeability. with
K < 0.4. For soil underneath the cutting areas' surface. the soil structure is most likely
of block or laminated structure. with medium/slow permeability and with K over 0.42-
0.46: in construction staoe K = 0.45. depending on engineering geological conditions.
Ls- A is the lenoth of slope: before construction. A = 50m; after construction the
average subgrade filling depth is 3.5m. the length of slope from pavement to water
drainage ditch is A=6.31m. 0 is the gradient of the slope: before construction. 0=10'; after
construction the 0=340. m is experience factor. before construction when 0=10∞. m=0.5:
and after construction. when 0=34'. m=0.8.
The results of the calculation show that before construction Ls = 4.253; during
40



construction stage. Ls = 8.454.
C: is the coverage factor, depending on the type and coverage rate of cover plant;
usually depending on land use, Table 4-1-7 and 4-1-8 show the C values under different
conditions; before construction work, average value of C=0.5; during the construction
stage, the cover plants being denuded, C=1.0.
P: is the soil retention measures factor, taking into account of the effects of such
measures as leveling, compacting, building check dam or sediment dam; the P values
under different conditions are shown in Table 4-1-9. Before construction, most area along
the road are farm land and wood land, which can be seen as smooth ground through
leveling and tamping, the P=0.7; during construction stage. the construction site is rough
irregular ground caused by bulldozers, the P=1.0.

To simplify the calculation. it is assumed that before construction. the soil erosion
intensitv is E. during the construction stage. the soil erosion intensity  is Ex. according to
the forecast model. when R,=RP. the following equation can be derived:

The calculation results show that the soil erosion in construction stage is 6.39 times
as much as that before the construction, which indicate that the soil erosion in the
highway construction stage would be intensified, especially the new soil erosion
produced from cutting, earth borrowing and waste disposal in building the subgrade
should not be neglected.
According the current status soil erosion and the above mentioned forecast model. the
soil erosion forecast is made with the summary shown in Table 4-1-10 , which lists the
eroded section length and erosion intensity during construction stage. It can be seen from
the table that once in the construction stage, the soil erosion in the slight erosion area will
be increased to medium level and that in the median and intense erosion area will be
increased to extremely intense level.

(i) at the beginning of the construction stage, the subgrade is still in initial shape with
lhe side slope not up to its full length;
(ii) the protection engineering work and the greening plantation for the side slope and
cutting will greatly reduce the soil erosion caused by the rainfall and pavement run-off.
(3) Soil erosion impact analysis in construction stage
Drainage and protection engineering measures will be taken based on the geological
conditions along the road. The protection works volume will be 726650.2 m3 for the main
line, and that for drainage works will be 287586.25 m3, as shown in Table 4-1-12).

Vote data source from the construiiction design for the main line in .ovember 200n
The drainage engineering works for this project includes pavement drainage and
subgrade drainage. The protection works include retaining wall. protection wall, side
slope and grass planting. etc. The purpose of these drainage and protection works is to
protect the stability of the road subgrade and road slope, as well as to reduce rainfall' s
washing of the slope and to reduce soil erosion produced from road construction so as to
conserve water and soil. These protection works will be carried out simultaneously with
or in advance to the subgrade construction (such as the retaining wall) and will be
inspected and accepted simultaneously with the subgrade. Also, in the later period of
construction, the covering vegetation will be recovered on the earth side slope with some
planted turf which will reduce soil erosion of the side slope. Though the soil erosion will
be increased in the initial construction stage (the first or second year). but it will be
gradually reduced later on and be under control in the year of completion and acceptance.
thus the soil erosion will be much less than that in the initial construction year.
From the comprehensive analysis of the protection and plantation engineering. we
can see that as long as the protection measures can be finalized, the soil erosion caused by
the expressway construction can be controlled.
43



(4) Analysis of soil erosion impact during operation stage
At the beginning of the operation stage, the covering plants such as grass and bush on
most of the side slopes may not be fully recovered; and later on, along with further
planting measures to be carried out, the vegetation coverage in the side slope will be
increased year by year. Although soil erosion may still exist, it will be in a small quantity
and under direct control. It is estimated that after 2 -3 years in the operation stage, the
soil erosion caused by the expressway will be under effective control, with soil
conservation for the project related areas up to the level before construction or even
better.
4.2 Water Environmental Impact Assessment
4.2.1 Construction stage
(1) Sewage from large-sized construction camp
Large-sized bridge construction is characterized of long construction time.
concentrated and stable construction work force, the sewage from the construction camp
may easily be discharged into rivers.
The construction work time for bridge is set to be 23 days/month. According to bridge
construction volume and similar bridge' s construction, 80,000 working days are needed
for Shushuihe bridge with an average of 150 workers on site each day: for Suichuanjiang
extra-large bridge. 180,000 working days are needed with an average of 300 workers on
site each day; for Shangyoujiang bridge,130,000 working days are needed with an
averaoe of 250 workers on site each day; for Zhangjiang bridge, 80,000 working days are
needed with an average of 150 workers on site each day. In southern China, given that
each person consumes an average daily water volume of 90 L and that the sewage
discharge factor takes 0.8. the sewage discharged from the construction camp can be
calculated by the following formula, with the calculation results shown in Table 4-2-1.
Q5 = (k -ql - Nj)/1,000
where: Qs - discharged sewage volume (t/d):
k- discharge/fcctor (0. 6 -0. 9) in service area, here it is 0.8:
-    qI - discharged sewage quota (L/person - day);
Nl - number of people.
The sewage discharged from the construction camp may have negative impact on the
surrounding environment: therefore it is recommended that the sewage be treated by
septic tank before it is discharged.

(2) Impact on the downstream river water quality by bridge construction
Due to the construction of bridge pier or cofferdam in the initial construction stage,
there will be silts and sand suspensions excavated from the river bed. In the construction
of pier. boring cast-in-place concrete pile will be adopted by use of cofferdam, which can
separate the water inside the cofferdam from the river water; therefore the silts and
suspensions arising from boring operation will have little impact on the river water
quality. The most likely impact caused by the bridge construction may come from boring
wastes in great amount, which should be discharged into designated place as selected
with consultation with relevant local authorities, such as the EPB and water engineering
bureau. The discharge process of the wastes should be supervised by environrnental
protection supervisor to reduce the negative impact of the wastes on the water quality and
the flood discharge as far as possible.
(3) Impact on water quality caused by construction vessels
The vessels used for bridge construction are usually small in size (no more than
90Kw), the sewage and the waste water discharged would be one ton per day for each
ship. The vessel wastewater is mainly cabin washing water and bilge water which
contains sand mixed with some oil and rust. however they would be sedimented quickly
after sometime. The bilge water is a mixture of leaked water from different valves. oils
and fuel from different machines. with an annual average volume of 10% in the total
loading capacity. The wastes content discharged from the ship mav be complicated and
wili exert negative impact on the water quality of the water body.
4.2.2 Operation stage
- (1) Impact on the surrounding water body from pavement run-off
The pavement run-off flow produced by rainfall may be calculated by the following
formula:
W=AXhxlO-3
where: W  - pavement run-off per unit length (m3/d),;
A  -  subgrade width (m).'
h - rainfall intensity (mm/d).
45



It can be seen from the above equation that, the pavement run-off flow depends on
the rainfall. The proposed highway area' s annual average precipitation is 1,494.8mm;
and the Ji' an region' s annual average precipitation is 1,487mm. The pavement run-off
produced in the rainy season can be calculated and summarized in Table 4-2-2.

Zhangjiang bridge       Ganzhou          227           26.0             8822
The pollutants carried by the run-off in rainy season mainly are SS and oil, mostly
happened in the initial rainfall period. The flow speed of the rivers as Shushuihe.
Suichuanjiang, Shangyoujiang, Zhangjiang, Ganjiang is stable with great dilution
capacity. There is no centralized drinking water intake in the assessment area downstream
the bridge site; therefore the impact of the bridge pavement run-off on the water quality
of the rivers is not significant.
(2) The impact on the existing agricultural irrigation system
There is an integrated agricultural irrigation system in the proposed project area with
relatively good infrastructure. Existing water channels will cross over the proposed
highway by way of small bridges and culverts. The feasibility study report shows that
there are total of 14 small bridges with a total length of 391.53m  and 482 culverts
included in the recommended scheme; in the alternative scheme there are a total of 22
small bridges with a total length of 659.61m and 455 culverts. Flood discharge and
irrigation functions have been taken into full account in the design of the bridges and
culverts. as well as convenience of local people' s production and daily life. Proper
modification. combination and connection have been arranged in the engineering design
for the existing channels and ditches. including restoration of the malfunction ditches and
connection of dead end channels; therefore the highway construction will have little
negative impact on the agricultural irrigation system.

4.2.3 Water pollution estimation for service area
The proposed project intends to service areas in Suichuan (K195+900) and in
.anzhou (K259+500), occupying a size of 51 .870m2 and 40,000m2 respectively.
The wastewater discharged from the service area, mostly living sewage and auto
washing water, can be calculated by the following formula.
Qs = (k -ql -N1)/1 000
Qq = (q2 - A2) / 1, 000
where: Qs -   discharged sewage volume (t/d)
Qq -   discharged auto washing water volume (t/d);
k  -  sewage discharge factor (0. 6 -0. 9) in service area, here it is 0. 9,
ql-   discharged sewage quota per each person (L/person - day);
Nj-  number ofpeople.
N2 -   number of washed vehicle (veh./day):
q2-   wvater volume needed to wash a vehicle (L/veh.)
Based on the experience of the existing expressway service area, given the number of
people in the service area being 200 (including staff member and passengers), the average
water consumption being 90 L/person per day. then the daily sewage volume will be 16.2
tons for the service area.
The number of vehicles to be washed is estimated at 2% of the forecasted traffic
volume, with the water needed per vehicle being 400L/veh.; then the vehicle washing
wastewater produced from the service area in the initial, mid-term and long-term
operation stage can be calculated, as listed in Table 4-2-4.

4.3 Acoustic Environmental Impact Assessment and Mitigation Measures
4.3.1 Noise impact analysis during construction stage
- (1) Construction noise forecast
The construction noise can be regarded as coming from spot sound source. with
attenuation model as the following.
Lp = Lpo - 20 Ig (r/5)
there: Lp - forecasted noise level at a point r m from the sound source. dB:
Lpo- reference noise level at a point 5 m from the noise source, dB.
47



The noise source in the construction stage mainly comes from such construction
:nachines as truck. loader, mixer. and drilling and explosions of the stones. Based on the
above mentioned model, the noise level at places of different distance from the source can
De calculated as shown in Table 4-3-1 .Bored pile is mostly used in bridge construction by
boring machine and winches, with noise level of 75dB at place 1Sm from the noise
source.

(2) Noise impact analysis in construction stage
In the light of the standard GB12523-90 "Construction Worksite Noise Level Limit
Standard" , it can be seen from Table 4-3-1 that:
C  The noise level on the highway construction work site will be high, since more
machines are used in highway construction. However the noise impact in the construction
stage is temporary in local area and of short period.
CZ Construction noise from transportation vehicles and road building machines will
exert a relatively small impact at places I OOm away, and will exert relatively great impact
on people nearby the construction site(within50m), particularly at night time, such noise
will affect their sleep. Schools, hospitals and residences 50m within the center line of the
road will suffer from big impact from construction noise. therefore the construction time
should be properly arranged to avoid construction in school time and people' s sleep
time. If it is impossible to arrange. temporary mitigation measures shall be taken..
X Large construction machine and the electricity generator with high noise level
will have serious impact on the operator' s health. particularly the impact on the
operator' s hearing ability. Statistics shows that noise deafness is not only related with
the sound level. but also with the time exposed to the noise. The danger of noise can
induce other illness. So. these large machines' noise can exert a big impact on operators
and nearby residents. In road section with sensitive locations such as school, clinics, the
use of high noise construction machine should be avoided and the construction work time
48



hould be properly arranged.

ALp1 ---traffic noise attenuation caused by the pavement. (dB),)
The total noise level produced in day or at night at forecast point is calculated by:
(LAeq)t=lOlg[l 0∞ 1 (LAeq)l+ 100. 1 (LAeq&m+  I 1(LAeq)sJ  ALI -AL2

4.3.2.3 Traffic noise forecast and assessment for the main line
Based on the above mentioned calculation formulas and parameters. the traffic noise
forecast for the proposed expressway (main line) in the operation stage can be made as
listed in Table 4-3-3. In the light of the Class IV standard under the GB3096-93. the areas
where the noise level is up to the standard can be derived as shown in Table 4-3-4.
It can be seen from Table 4-3-3 and 4-3-4 that:
(I ) By the standard of Class IV under the GB3096-93 ( i.e. the day time noise level
limit of 70dB and the night time noise level limit of 55dB). the daytime noise at two sides
of the expressway during operation stage can meet the standard; the nighttime noise is
excessive at 60m away from the road in the initial operation stage and it will increase
with traffic volume. and will be excessive at I OOm away in the long term operation stage.
(2) Although traffic noise in daytime is not excessive. and the traffic noise at night
can meet standard I OOm away from the road. the operation of this expressway will lead to
an obvious increase of noise over the current status, so its interference with residents
cannot be neglected.

4.3.3 Ambient noise forecast and assessment for the sensitive locations
The ambient noise forecast for sensitive locations should be modified by taking the
around surface conditions, embankment or cutting height, limited road length into
consideration. The ambient noise should be added with background noise. with iteration
formula as follows.
(LAeq)forecast=1 Olg[]O l (LAe&traffic+10 0. l(L Aebackground]
The forecasted noise value and the excess over the standard limits by the above
formula and by their respective acoustic environment are listed in Table 4-3-5 -Table 4-
1-7.
It can be seen from Table 4-3-5 that:
(1) In the long-term operation stage, the daytime traffic noise excess will be more
than 6.7dB for Wan' an Gongda university. since the university has been moved away
wtith no more teaching activities and habitants in it, therefore. there will be no traffic
noise impact.
(2) The daytime traffic noise excess will be 9.9-13.1dB. 9.3-12.6dB and 10.5-
13.6dB for Zhuhu Primary School. Mashuang High School and Qiubian Primarv School
respectively. which will have serious impact on the school teaching activities. Therefore
environmental protection measures should be taken. Although the nighttime noise level is
high. there is no teaching and residing in the school at night. so the impact is not big.
(3) The daytime traffic noise excess will be 5.7-9.9dB and that of nighttime will be
9. 3  12.8dB for the Kangfucun and the Nankang Skin clinic. which indicates that
effective measures should be taken to mitigate the noise impact in the operation stage.
(4) The daytime traffic noise excess will be 0.8-2.6dB for Wuling High School.
Ho-owever. the teaching building is a bit far away and is perpendicular to the road. the
impact on the school teaching is not great. As for Daping Olds, home. the daytime
traffic noise will be exceeding by 2.7-7.Odb and that at nighttime is 6.8-9.8dB which
shall have great noise impact, but it is very small and could be removed 200m away
from the road.

Note:  (1lThe forecast walue is the ambient noise level at the first rok% building of sensitiv-e location beside the road
(or newly exposed buildine after relocation). Same as follows.
(2) No assessment is made for school at night because of no schooling at night.
13)The variations of the enrineerine factors may affect the accuracy of the forecast. Same as follo"s.
It can be seen from  Table 4-3-6 and 4-3-7 that:
(1) There will be no excess traffic noise in daytime in the initial and mid term
operation stage. there will be very little excess of 1.3dB in the traffic noise in one
sensitive location.
(2) During the initial and long term operation stage. there are 37 locations with
excessive noise at night. accounting for 38.9% of the total villages. There are 12 villages
with large noise excess (more than 7.0dB) at night during the long-tern operation stage.
they are: Huangzhangduan  (K174+600). Qiaotou  (K225+100), Pang, an (K228+880).
Zhangwu (K231+650). Jiezishixia (K250+250). Aoli (K254+250). Fengxingpai
(K255'-200). Tongkengpai (K255+350). Zihecun  (K257+000). Shanzixia (K261+430).
Dalongkeng (Kl53+140) and Laoju(K153+450). There are a total of I such villages.
(3) Although the ambient noise of most sensitive locations are only very slightly
excessive during the operation stage or even are not excessive in long-term operation
stage. it will have an  obvious increase over the current status. so its interference on
residents can not be neglected.
(4) Of the scattered individual households within 30m from the road center. the
55



ambient noise is excessive by 5.0dB or above. Of those within 30-50m from the road
center, the ambient noise is excessive by 3.0-7.0dB; and of those within 50-lOOm from
the road center, the ambient noise is excessive by less than 5.0dB, and the ambient noise
of scattered households beyond 1OOm from the road center can meet the standard; those
beyond 1Sm  , the noise approaches the base level. So for those households within 1OOm
from the road center, their willing shall be solicited to detennine the acoustic
environmental protection measures required. For those individual households beyond
lOOm from the road, noise monitoring during operation stage will be conducted to
determine whether to take complementary measures.

4.4 Ambient air impact forecast and assessment
4.4.1 Construction stage
The air pollution in the construction stage is mainly caused by secondary flying dust
arising from the mixing plant, the vehicles and road construction machine operation on
the construction site. Therefore the assessment factor is the TSP for the construction
stage.
(1) Dust pollution from stabilizer
Stationary mixing plant technology is to be used for the expressway construction.
According to the on-the-spot monitoring at the Bazhou mixing plant for the Jin-Bao
(Tianjin-Baoding) highway project conducted by the MOC Research Institute of Highway.
the TSP concentration at place 50m in the leeward direction away from the mixing plant
was 1 .367mg/m3, which exceeds the Class II Standard limit: while the TSP concentration
at place 100m in the leeward direction away from the mixing plant was 0.61 9mg/m3.
Since the area is located in mid Asia subtropic monsoon climate zone with humid air and
high humidity; the ambient TSP concentration will be less than that at the Bazhou mixing
plant for the Jin-Bao highway.
(2) TSP arising from construction and hauling vehicles
In the construction stage, the transportation and loading/unloading of the building
materials at the construction site will produce TSP pollution. Field monitoring of TSP
produced by vehicle transportation in similar construction site shows that the TSP
concentration at place 1 50m from the roadside usually exceeds the Class II standard limit.
which indicates that the TSP arising from the transportation may cause serious pollution.
(3) The air pollution impact caused by bitumen pavement construction
Bitumen pavement will be constructed for the expressway. Bitumen smoke will be
produced by bitumen melting and mixing, which will have certain impact on the ambient
air quality. According to the on-the-spot monitoring of the bitumen smoke at the
Dayangfang bitumen mixing plant in Beijing by RIOH. if advanced mixing plant such as
the Italy made MV,A is used. the bitumen smoke concentration at place 100m in the
leeward direction away from the mixing plant will meet the standard requirement as
specified in GB 16297-96 ,Comprehensive Air Pollutants Emission Standard" . If
ordinary bitumen melting and mixing equipment were used on the construction site. the
bitumen smoke concentration would greatly exceed the standard limit. Therefore. the
mixing plant shall not be located within 300m in the leeward direction where there are
sensitive locations, such as hospitals. schools and residences.

4.4.2 Operation stage
4.4.2.1 Meteorological analysis
(1) Climate features
The project area belongs to mid Asia sub tropic hilly area and monsoon climate,
characteristic of cold winter and spring, hot summer and dry autumn, rainy season in
beginning of summer, cloudy and dry autumn with less sunshine and long frost-free
period. There are abundant thermal resources with great temperature difference and
plentv of rainfall unevenly distributed. Historical annual average temperature is 17.7-
19.2∞C, annual average precipitation is over 1.434.3mm'-1,457.5mm, with rainy season
from April through June.
(2) Ground wind
D Wind direction: According to the last three years conventional meteorological
statistics provided by the National Meteorological Center, the N wind prevails in Taihe
county with frequency of 11%: ENE wind prevails in Suichuan county with frequency of
12∞%: NNE wind in Ganzhou with frequency of 14%. followed by NE. NNW (9%).
NE(I 1%) and N(9%). Table 4-4-1 -Table 4-4-3 show the statistics of wind direction and
frequency statistics of each county and city. Figure 4-4-1 -4-4-3 show their wind
direction rose maps.
2 Static wind: is the wind with speed less than 1.0rm/s. Under the condition of static
wind it is not good for air pollutants to be dispersed, particularly when the static wind
occurs concurrently with inverse temperature. which is easy to result in serious air
pollution. The static wind frequencies for the three areas are 22%. 23% and 34%
respectively. Summer and autumn have the highest frequency of static wind.
.D3 Wind speed: is an important factor in determining the dispersion and dilution of
the pollutants in the air. Table 4-4-1-4-4-3 show the wind speeds in the three areas. The
annual average wind speed is 2.4m/s in Taihe. I.9m/s in Suichuan and 2.0m/s in Ganzhou.
Suichun has the lowest wind speed with relative poor pollutant dispersion conditions.
AA Pollution coefficient
To estimate the extent of air pollution it is necessary to take into consideration the
v nmd direction frequency and the average wind speed. The pollution co-efficient is
defined as follows:
Cp =fi / Vi
where:    Cp    average pollution coefficient.
fi -frequency of wrind direction;
Vi    average wZind speed in a direction.
63



The calculation results are listed in Table 4-4-1-4-4-3. and illustrated in Figure 4-4-
4 -4-4-6.
The greater the pollution coefficient in a direction, the more serious of the pollution
extent will be in the leeward of the direction. It can be seen from Figure 4-4-4-4-4-6
that the directions with the highest pollution coefficient for Taihe, Suichuan and Ganzhou
are ESE, WSW and NNE respectively.
(3) Determination of the air stability
According to the observation by the meteorological department. the air stability along
the project area is dominated by category D followed by category E-F.

4.4.2.2 Calculation of vehicle emission pollutant source intensity
In the operation stage, the air pollutants will mainly come from vehicle tail gas,
which will be in proportion to the traffic volume and will also be related with vehicle
tvpe and vehicle operation mode.
(1) Traffic volume forecast
The traffic volume forecast and the composition of the vehicles are the same as those
mentioned above.
(2) Pollutant source intensity calculation
The pollutant source intensity can be calculated by the following formula:
3
Qj = 2A i . Eij / 3600-1
,=,
wi,here. 0  -  typej gaseous pollutant source intensity (mg/s a m);
Ai    hourly traffic volume of type i vehicle in forecast year (veh./h):
Eij-  under motorway conditions, individual vehicle emission factor for
pollutant jfrom i type vehicle in forecast year (to adopt the value as recommended by the
"Specifications for Environmental Impact Assessment of Highway Construction
Project - ), mg / veh. * m.
The calculation formula for the peak hour pollutant source intensity is as follows:
QIX. = QL   AG
where: AG -  peak hour traffic volume coefficient, here it is 6.2%.
The calculation formula for daily axverage pollutant source intensity is as follows:
QC,=QL  A,/R
where. Ar -  daytime traffic volume co-efficient, Ar = 84.8%for the expresswvay.
R - day time hour, here it isl 6.
4.4.2.3 Ambient air pollutant dispersion model
(1) When the angle between the wind direction and the linear source is H. and
0 <0 < 900. then the dispersion model would be as follows.
/',R = U J2r Cexp           ) xp  2             + exp
where. CPR-the pollutant concentration produced by the linear source of section
AB to forecast point R. mg/mr3,
U - average wi ind speed at effective height of the pollutant source, m/s.
Qj - intensity of the type j gaseous pollutant source, mg/im3:
a,, c;- horizontal and vertical dispersion parameter, m;
69



z - height from the forecast point to the ground, m;
h  -  effective height of the pollutant source. m:
A. B - start and endpoint of the linear source.
(2) When the wind direction is perpendicular with the linear source (0 = 90∞), the
dispersion model would be as follows.
2   Q,    ~     h 2 
Cverncal    d U    exp
iz~r Uc7~L    ~
(3) When the wind direction is in parallel with the linear source (0 = O∞), the
dispersion model would be as follows.
- (727=T)  0r
r= [y2+(z/e)2]'
e = 6, / 6,
it-here. r - distance from calculating point to road center line (m);
e  -  ratio of conventional dispersion parameter.
(4) Parameters selection
The air stabilitv of the proposed highway area is dominated by category D. The
dispersion parameter is based on the Appendix B of "EIA Technical Guidelines"
HJ/T2.3-93. with the wind speed of 2.4 rn/s to be taken for Taihe, I.9m/s for Suichuan.
2.rOm/s for Ganzhou.
4.4.2.4 Vehicle tail gas dispersion forecast and assessment at road sides
(1) NOx
The forecast of NOx pollutant dispersion in the operation stage along the proposed
highway is listed in Table 4-4-4. It can be seen from the table that the NOx concentration
from vehicle tail gas will increase along with the increase of traffic volume. Under the
conditions of category D type air stability. the NOx concentration will not exceed the
assessment standard limit.
The above-mentioned forecast is made under the conditions of type D air stability
and by the existing and future more stringent vehicle emission standard. If the weather
condition is changed (static wind or E. F air stability). complicated landform cause it
difficult to disperse. or the vehicle emission exceeds the standard limit. then the NOx
concentration may exceed the standard limit.

4.4.2.5 Pollutant compliance in each road section
(1) It can be seen from  Table 4-4-4  that NOx  concentration at place 23m   from  the
road center will meet the Class 11 standard limit under category D air stability even in the
72



long-term operation stage. but Nox could exceed the standard limit at place within 23m.
(2) Under unfavorable weather conditions (static wind, low speed wind, inverse
temperature) or frequent ups and downs in the road with complicated landform, so that
the pollutants are not easy to be dispersed. then the NOx concentration at place 23m from
the road center will exceed the standard limit.
(3) According to the forecast, the CO concentration from the vehicle emission will be
very small in each section. And there is no large-sized stationary CO pollutant sources
along the road, so the CO background concentration is also low. Therefore the CO
concentration along the line will meet the assessment standard required.
(4) Impact analysis on sensitive locations
X  After the resettlement, all the sensitive locations will be all beyond 23m away
from the road center and are beyond NOx and CO concentration excessive scope,
therefore the concentrations of NOx and CO for all the sensitive locations will meet the
Class II standard limit.
1) For the sensitive locations 30m within the road center at the Ganzhou-Tankou
section (with high traffic volume) and Suizhou-Tangcun section (complicated landform).
their NOx concentrations of leeward the perennial prevailing wind direction may exceed
the Class II standard limit under unfavorable weather conditions.
4.4.3 Assessment of air pollution in tunnel
This project has designed two single-direction and dual-hole tunnels in
Yan-gongshan and Fuziling, the former tunnel is 1 560m long in its left route and 1 560m
in its right route. the latter tunnel is 1700m in its left route and 1720m long in its right
route respectively.
The hazardous substances in the tunnel air mainly come from the CO, NOx.
hydrocarbon. S02. aldehyde and carbon particles, which are poisonous to the human
body.
According the energy conservation law of pollutants in the tunnel, the forecasting
mode for the poisonous gas concentration in tunnel is:
.Q   . *A
S*U
W1here  C-polluitant concentration at a certain cross-section in the tunnel. mg/m3;
Q-pollutant discharging souirce intensity, mg/s. in;
X-distanceffrom a certain cross-section to the ent-ance. in.
S-surface of the tunnel cross-section, m2;
U-airflowr speed within the tunnel, m/s.
73



The air flow speed within single-direction tunnel depends on the vehicle, s piston function
:riving in the tunnel. which will not exceed 5m/s according to experience. If ventilation machine is
used. the air speed can be increased. In this circulation, the wind speed is set to be 5 m/s. and the
ross-sectional surface (S)of the tunnel is set to be 5 1 .25m.
The forecasted CO and NOx concentrations within the tunnel are listed in Table 4-4-6.

From Table 4-4-6. we can see that:
WVhen U=5.Om/s, the CO  peak concentration  ISOOm  within the tunnel during the long-term
operation stage is 69.44mg/m3. complying with the requirements of lS0ppm  (187.5mg/ m3) for
normal operation in tunnel. (Refer to Table 1-9)
When U=8.0m/s. the CO peak; concentration 1500m within the tunnel during the long-term
operation stage is 32.37mg/ m3. which shows that when ventilation machine is used. the CO
concentration within the tunnel will be lower. So it can be inferred that the CO concentration in the
t%o tunnels of this project can meet tunnel design requirements when put into operation.
74



When there is traffic jam within the tunnel, the vehicles and the wind speed will greatly reduce,
rhe CO and NOx concentrations will increase by many times and are difficult to disperse. thus causing
narm to human body. In addition, the fume and other particles emitted from diesel engines can greatly
reduce the visibility within the tunnel, affecting the driving safety and human health. So when the
tunnel is over lOOOm long. it is very necessary to install ventilation machine.
4.5 Assessment of Social Environmental Impact
4.5.1 Population distribution
The completion of the proposed expressway will have certain impact on the
population distribution along the project area. The expressway will greatly improve the
road capacity. pavement conditions and reduce traffic accident, and the improved
transport capacity will promote industrial and commercial development along the area,
particularly around the interchange area with newly developed small townships,
business centers as well as the increased people from outside : therefore there will be
certain effect on demography and population density.
Since the resettlement will be arranged locally. the local population will have no
great changes in the townships and villages along the line.
4.5.2 Indirect impact analysis for the proposed project
( I)Indirect benefit analysis
The congestion of the existing national highway 105 is 0.72-1.74. It is estimated that
almost all road sections will be saturated or over saturated by year 2003. meanwhile with
the urbanization of the highway 105 and the increased density of population, traffic
accident happen s frequently. Table 4-5-1 presents the accident statistics of highway 105
within Ji' an and Ganzhou territory as well as that for Chan-Jiu expressway. It can be
seen from the table that though traffic volume on the expressway is obviously higher than
that on the lower-grade highways, yet the accident ratio and the loss arisen is much lower
than that of the lower-grade highways. In addition to this. the expressway brings more
indirect benefits by saving transport cost. time.etc. which is summarized in Table 4-5-2

(2) Energy saving analysis of the project
9 Energy saved from the up-graded highway
The implementation of this project will upgrade the highway into expressway that
'ill save the petrol consumption. According to the survey. the average vehicle speed of
the existing highway 105 is 45kmlh,consuming 42.7 kl/100 vehicle-km (calculated by
PCU). if with the expressway, it can save 12.3kI/I00 vehicle-km. The proposed
.xpressway totaling 128.4454 in length will save 454.000kL fuel daily if calculated at
76



weighted average for normal daily traffic volume of 28706 vehicles within the assessment
time horizon.
C2 Energy saving from shorten mileage
The proposed project will shorten the driving mileage by 38.6156km. Based on the
traffic survey and its forecast results (calculated by transferred traffic), it can save about
331 .OOOkL fuel daily if calculated at weighted average for daily transferred traffic volume
of 20094 vehicles within the assessment time horizon.
03 Energy saving analysis
The proposed project is a full access control, interchange expressway with design
speed of I OOkm/h. The speed-up vehicles will shorten the transport time and reduce the
unit cost. It can save about it can save 12.3kl/100 vehiclekm, based on this, the
recommended scheme will save average fuel of 785,000kl daily.
4.5.3 Economic features, industrial structures and labor force
Completion of the proposed highway will promote the local area, s economic
development with newly emerged industry and labor force, as well as inter-regional
economic exchanges to improve the local area' s investment environment.
It can be expected that after completion of the proposed highway the electronic
industry. medical and chemical industry, metallurgical industry. paper manufacturing.
tobacco industry, food industry and building materials industry will be developing faster.
Meanwhile  the  commerce,  catering,  banking.  building  industry. transport.
telecommunications and information industry will also have conspicuous growth.
The completion of the proposed highway will give impetus to the urban development
along the highway to promote the land use and resource development so to make the
industrial structures more reasonable. Around the expressway and the connection road
there will be developed into an industrial and commercial belt.
The industrial development and the improvement of the investment environment will
create more employment opportunities for people from both the urban and rural areas and
more people will move from rural area into the urban area with more people working in
the tertiary industry.
4.5.4 Transport
The national highway from Tongjiang-Sanya is located in the coastal areas of Fujian
and Zhejiang provinces, and the national highway of Beijing-Zhuhai is located in middle
of China. The Gan-Yue expressway is located between the said two national highways
and is the most convenient corridor to Shenzhen and Hong Kong; therefore the
77



.ompletion of the Gan-Yue expressway will integrate the national highway system.
The proposed highway is part of the Gan-Yue expressway -- the north-south corridor
in Jiangxi province, with its alignment roughly in parallel with the national highway 105.
the Ganjiang river and the Jing-Jiu railway. It connects the golden water of Yangtze river
and the Jiujiang-Jindezhen special motorway in the north; links the Zhe-Gan railway, the
national highway of Shanghai-Ruili, the national highway of Beijing-Fuzhou, the national
highway 308. 316 in the hinterland; and connects the national highway of 319 and 323 in
the south. The proposed highway will attract most of the through traffic from the existing
national highway 105 and part of the intra-province traffic. It will ease the traffic
congestion on the national highway 105 and will play an important role in facilitating
links between the railways and the highways as well as the freight and passenger traffic.
which is essential to the integration of the transport system. The.proposed highway will
connect the existing 11 provincial and local county and rural roads, forming an effective
road network to promote the areas' economic development.
4.5.5 Land acquisition impact analysis
The proposed expressway is located mostly in hilly and mountainous areas. where
cultivated land is very precious. In the alignment selection full consideration has been
Oiven to occupy less farmland as much as possible for the proposed highway. Total land
occupation of the expressway is 11218.8 mu. of which 4.393.33mu are paddy fields.
1.067.20mu are dry land. 4.534.28 mu are wood land. with paddy field area accounting
for over 35.0% in the total. Additionally, the temporary land occupation is 1.194.77mu
for the expressway.
The project land occupation is permanent which will loss its original productivity and
inevitably have certain impact on the area' s agriculture and forestrv. However. the great
economic and social benefits brought about by the project will eventually transform the
land use. greatly increase and materialize the land value. Land use pattern will greatly
change with newly emerged industrial zone and more land for industrial use. To avoid
loss of precious cultivated land resource, it is recommended that the land administration
department should strengthen management over land use along the project area.
The land acquisition for the proposed project will make some of the farmers lose their
land. becoming surplus labor. National land compensation policy will be implemented for
the proposed project. The local village board will develop collectively owned tertiar;
industry to provide employment opportunitv for those who lose their land. They will have
the priority to get employed for the construction of the proposed expressway to solve
their short-term  income shortage. which will mitigate the impact arising fiom  land
78



acquisition.
4.5.6 Living standards (Rational analysis on the convenience, interchange and
passageway provision)
Due to the full access control of expressway. the villages and farmland on both sides
of the road will be separated. which will cause inconvenience to local people' s
production and daily life. A total of 53 separated grade crossing and 328 passageways
have been provided with an average of 2.9 per every kilometer to accommodate the
layout of the existing local roads. Therefore, the convenience of the local people' s life
will not seriously affected.
4.5.7 Removal and Resettlement
A total of 1 29.335.0m2 buildings are to be removed, and a total 51 .330m of power&
telecommunications facilities are to be relocated.
The basic principles of the resettlement policy are as follows.
(1) Compensation shall be made to the resettled households to ensure that the
building area and quality of the resettled house will be up to the original ones: and the
compensation will be carried out before commencement of the road construction so as to
ensure their living and economic rights.
(2) The newly built houses for resettlement will be arranged at one side awa) from
the road for the purpose of convenience for farming and community life.
(3) For villages with large resettlement volume, house-building plan shall be made to
reduce farmland occupation as much as possible; and multi-story building may be built
when it is necessarv.
(4) To solicit individual household' s opinion one by one on resettlement and to
listen to their requests, to make them satisfied as much as possible so as to ensure that
their living standards will not be lowered after the resettlement.
The owner of the highway project attaches great importance to the resettlement and is
formulating the resettlement action plan (RAP) and a supervision agency has been hired
to-supervise the implementation of the RAP. Corresponding coordination agencies have
also been set up at the county. township and village level concerned with the land
acquisition and resettlement to carry out the land acquisition and resettlement policy and
to strictly follow the RAP. Therefore the negative impact caused by the resettlement may
be reduced to the minimum. Meanwhile precautions will be taken not to occupy farmland
and to avoid other environmental impacts caused by the resettlement.
79



4.5.8 Harmony of highway and landscape
The newly built expressway is away from the urban area, with most of the sections in
n'illy and mountainous areas with different terrain and landscape. Planting beautification
is included in the design to be in harmony with the landscape by plantation of suitable
bushes and flowers. Along the highway, some flower and bush shall be planted to show
the elegance and magnificence of the expressway, thus it will not damage the original
natural landscape. but can symbolize the beauty of modem expressways.
Different type of side slope protections such as the diamond shaped and arch type
slope protections may be selected for plantation to make the expressway a green corridor.
Beautification of large expressway structures such as the interchanges and bridges
may restore the damaged natural landscape caused by the construction and can improve
the tour environment to form a new expressway landscape along with the natural scenery
and cultural landscape..
4.5.9 Impact on local community and local infrastructures
With the completion of the proposed expressway and its promotion to the local
economic development, there will be a rapid increase in the demand for post and
communications. power and water supply, education, medical service, etc.. The demand
mav not be met by enough supplv in a short term, but in the long run will stimulate the
supply and promote the improvement of the areas public facilities.
4.5.10. Impact on the cultural relics and historical sites
According to the ,Cultural Relics Survey Report (Third Version) of Gan-Yue
Expressway (Taihe-Ganzhou Section)", provided by the Jiangxi Provincial Cultural
Relics Archaeological Institute (JPCRAI) in December,2000. the cultural relics along the
proposed project area are of protection at county and municipal authority, which are listed
in Table 4-5-3 and Figure 4-5-1
According to the Survey Report. the above mentioned cultural relics and historical
sites are distant away from the proposed expressway with nearest of 0.7 km and the rest
alL distant from the road by more than 1.0-3.0 km. so they will not impacted by the
expressway construction.
However. because ancient relics are deeply buried, most of them are not found and
identified. According to news report. there are Cretaceous period strata widely distributed
in Nankang city area, and it is very likely to find dinosaur eggs fossil and bone fossil in
cutting and earth borrowing. Therefor. the JPCRB and the JPCRARI have selected 10
spots along the Nankang section to excavate for trial. The result of the excavation

4.6. Risk Analysis of Hazardous Substance Transport
4.6.1 Current status investigation
According to the data from transportation administrative departments, the main
dangerous cargo transported in project region are petroleum, natural gas and products,
chemical fertilizer, pesticide, chemical raw materials, light chemicals and medicine.
Table 4-6-1 is the list of Jiangxi province' s traffic accidents in recent years, Table

4.6.2 Probability estimation of dangerous cargo transport pollution risk analysis
The traffic accident probability estimation is based on the existing traffic accident
number. road traffic volume, dangerous cargo transportation volume and the proposed
highway' s sensitive length. The traffic accident number of the proposed highway or its
sensitive sections is estimated by the following formula:
p        .4 * B * C * D * E
F
wthere. Pij-theforecasted accident rate for proposed highu ay or high way bridge sections
involved wsith dangerous cargo. timesyvear:

C- annual traffic volumefor the highwiay in forecast year, million veh..;y.
D- length of the sensitive section.
82



E -possible accident rate reductionfor expresswav comparing to ordinary highway, %;
F- safety co-efficientfor the dangerous cargo.
According to the above formula and related data. Table 4-6-3 lists the estimated
accident number involved with dangerous cargo transport for the proposed expressway
and 9 bridges and 2 tunnels. It can be seen that the probability of the traffic accident
involved with dangerous cargo transport is very small for the proposed expressway in the
operation stage; and that for the bridges is even smaller.
Table 4-6-3 Estimated accidents of hazardous cargo for the proposed expressway
Dangerous cargo transpon accident (time/year)

Whole line             0.524                      0.926                     1.108
9 bridges              0.011                     0.019                     0.023

Although the accident probability of dangerous cargo transportation is very small,
but if happened. the consequence can be very serious. If happened on large bridge, it is
likely to damage the bridge structure and to leak hazardous substances such as cyanide.
pesticide, petroleum, sulfur acid into the river. thus polluting the river water. If happened
within the tunnel. it can cause traffic jam or even fire or explosion, very harmful to the
safety of drivers and passengers.
Therefore, great emphasis should be given to the risk of transporting hazardous
cargo. It is required that road administrative department should make a good emergency
plan and should enhance its accident handling abilitv through training and management
so to minimize the pollution risk (further refer to the contents of counter-Measures).
4.7 Environmental Impact from Building Materials Excavation, Transport and Its
Mitigation Measures
The building materials will be mainly transported by vehicles. The distribution and
transportation conditions of the quarries refer to Table 4-7-1.

(1)   Impact on existing road transportation
The sand and gravel required by this project will be self-excavated along the road or
purchased from outside, generally be transported by rural roads or detour roads to the
construction site, not by major roads such as the National Highway 105. In addition,
cement, timber, steel and bitumen will be transported by the National Highway 105. Due
to the heavy traffic of major roads in this region which already exceeds their design
capacity, the transportation of building materials may lead to traffic jams and affect
traffic safety to existing roads. During construction. traffic management over existing
roads must be enhanced such as to transport the building materials at night and in non-
busy season, to formulate transportation management plan for the project so as to ensure
the transportation requirements of the building materials.
(2)   Ecological damage
Stone is mainly cut by boring and explosion. Large stone mine is exploded, crushed.
classified and finally sent to the construction site. New construction of detour roads and
stone excavation will damage the existing surface vegetation and will change partial
landform, resulting in new soil erosion and disharmony with surrounding landscape.
(3)   Impact on residents' living quality
Excavation and transportation of stone w-ill produce flying dust. noise. shock.
explosive danger and traffic jam, etc.
The stone quarries for this project are all located in waste hills with large stone
reserve and far from towns, villages and schools. The flying dust, noise, shock and
explosive danger produced from stone excavation will not impact residents, living. but
attention must be paid to the health and safety of the operators.
When transporting on existing roads, the building materials may exert some impact
on local residents' living and schooling along the roads. Road flyIing dust and material
spill due to bad covering will have some adverse impact on people' s living environment.
esp. in dry seasons.
In addition. transportation of building materials may aggravate the traffic pressure
on existing roads, resulting in traffic jams. which can make people inconvenient to travel
and increase traffic accidents.
To mitigate these impacts, the following measures can be taken:
(i) Quarry contractors must adhere to the safety regulations concerning outdoors
xplosion. Explosion time should be set to avoid rush hours so as to protect workers'
iafetv. Contractors must adhere to relevant labor protection regulations to provide
84



helmets and earplugs to workers and provide periodic physical examination to them.
(ii) Soil erosion and vegetation loss caused by quarry can be minimized by
enhancing management and by stipulating excavation plan.
(iii)   Transporting vehicles should adhere to local traffic rules, overloading is
forbidden so as not to cause spill of bulky stone or other materials and not to cause traffic
jams.
(iv)   Construction detour roads should be sprayed with water periodically.
Vehicles hauling bulky building materials shall be covered by cloth.
(v) Contractors shall prepare a good transportation plan to avoid peak hours.
(vi)   Routes to transport stones shall be reasonably selected so as to avoid dense
residences and schools as far as possible. If large residence exists 50m within the route,
then the transportation should be not allowed at night (22:00-6:00). Alsomexplosion is
forbidden at night.
(vii)  In daytime. if transportation causes noise interference to schools and
residences near the detour roads. then mobile sound barriers can be used to mitigate the
noise impact.
(viii) Transportation management over the National Highway 105 should be
enhanced. Contractors are required to well maintain their vehicles so to make their noise
level to a minimum.
(ix)   Supervisory engineer is required to enhance noise monitoring. If the
transportation of building materials does make the acoustic environment of residences
along the existing roads (105) deteriorating. the route may be considered for a change or
some economic compensation may be made to local residents.
4.8 Environmental Impact Mitigation Measures
4.8.1 Design stage
4.8.1.1 Ecological impact
(1) To further optimize and adjust the alignrnent. to reduce occupation of cultivated
Cields. to reduce the volume of earth disposal and the quantities of earth borrowing and
w-aste areas.
(2) The construction camp shall be located away from agricultural fields as far as
possible. Construction scheme shall be reasonably arranged so to reduce the time of
temporary land occupation.
(3) The planting works and the main body of the road should be carried out
synchronically. Priority should be given to local species of arbor, bush and grass so as to
restore and compensate for the vegetation.
85



(4) Drainage and protection engineering work should be designed for the subgrade,
ncluding intercepting ditch, side ditch, protection wall, side slope, retaining wall,
Drotection gird. which can not only stabilize subgrade. but also prevent soil erosion.
(5) Mashuang Bridge is located in a geologically complicated section. Geological
-econnaissance should be enhanced in the design of the construction drawing, and side
;lope treatment program will be designed.
(6) The south exit of Yanggongshan tunnel faces a valley between two hills; a viaduct
.vill be built here to avoid high fill and valley realignment.
(7) Environmental protection will be designed for the 26 earth borrowing pits and the
20 waste areas.
4.8.1.2 Water pollution
(1) Drainage engineering will be designed so that the pavement run-off will not be
Airectlv discharged into sensitive water body.
(2) Water canals or ponds occupied or separated by subgrade will be re-built or newly
quilt.
(3) Sewage treatment is designed for service areas so that the sewage can meet
iational standard.
4.8.1.3 Noise impact and ambient air pollution
According to forecasting, during the construction stage. sound barriers, relocation.
nstallation of soundproof windows will be carried out for different sensitive. locations.
.hich will be included into the design and tendering documents.
Stone quarry, earth borrowing and waste area. and mixing plant will be located 300m
tway from residences. The hauling route for building materials will be rationally
lesioned so to avoid residences as far away as possible and to avoid flying dust and
ioise.
l.8.1.4 Cultural protection
We entrusted the Jiangxi Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau and Jiangxi Provincial
ultural Relics Protection Institute to make surveillance along the road. They have
tubrnitted the report. Refer to the Report of Cultural Surveillance for details.
1.8.1.5 Resettlement
The design for this project has always emphasized to avoid towns, less removal and
and occupation. A hierarchy of resettlement offices will be set up to formulate RAP. The
86



Jiangxi Normal University Institute of City and Population is employed as an
independent supervisor. Details refer to the RAP.
4.8.1.6 Public participation
In the alignment of the road, setting of interchanges, environmental protection,
resettlement, we have consulted with along-the-road governments, concerned
departments. non-governmental organizations, rural committees, collectives and even
individuals to solicit their opinions so as to gain support from the public.
4.8.2 Construction stage
4.8.2.1 Ecological impact
(1) To enhance workers' awareness of environmental protection of natural resources
and not to damage wild life and not to cut trees.
(2) Sewage and garbage from construction camp shall be collectively treated or
made into family fertilizers.
(3) Earth borrowing and waste disposal shall be conducted strictly in accordance with
design requirements so to well protect and restore the surrounding environment. The top
soil (30cm) of the acquired land shall be kept for reclaiming and compensation.
(4) Construction vehicles shall run in detour roads, not in agricultural fields nor
woodlands.
4.8.2.2 Water and soil conservation
(1) Engineering measures
< To reduce the area and number of construction sites as much as possible.
Construction should be carried out within designed site: the earth borrowing and waste
area should not be enlarged casually so as to reduce the exposed area of cutting. Don' t
enter to the site so earlier if construction is not ready.
4, For road sections with deep cutting/filling (such as the section of K192+900-
K199-660.547. K221+000 - K260+000). the engineering measures such as earth
retaining wall. protection wall. concrete anchoring should be taken combined with side
slope plantation of grass to make it stable and to prevent sliding. Terrace should be
arranged for deep cutting section: intercepting ditch shall be set 5m away from the top cut
area to discharge the run-off from the top surface of the side slope.
4) The various protection engineering works should be built concurrently with the
major works (as seen in the design drawing of subgrade protection and planting design)
so as to prevent side slope soil erosion caused by pavement run-off.
87



(j)When it is raining, sand bag or straw mat may be used to cover the slope surface to
reduce soil erosion; earth excavation for bridge or culvert should be avoided in rainy
season.
5) In the process of the wastes disposal, stratified compaction should be made based
on the height of earth retaining wall so as to reduce the gradient of slope.
(©)Water drainage ditch and intercepting ditch should be built for the earth borrowing
sites to reduce rainfall eroding force; the earth borrowing site should be flat as much as
possible after the borrowing. If the borrowing is to be made from a site with big slope,
check dam and sediment control dam should be built together with proper drainage
system.
(2) Planting Measures
X Planting should be carried out in accordance with the design requirements.
X The turf selected for the slope when planting and covering in a lump sum should
have the following features: fast growing and fully covering the ground surface; strong
bonding force with the soil to prevent surface soil erosion: perennial plant in harmony
with the environment.
3 To get the best effect. the side slope plantation should be completed one month in
advance to the rainy season.
(3) Land Reclaiming
1) Reclaiming and planting measures should be taken after completion of the
oorrowing and disposal sites to prevent soil erosion by rainfall.
g2 For the waste bank in hilly areas, forestation is the major means. Grass. bush and
irbor with deep and flourishing roots capable of withstand harsh conditions should be
selected for the forestation so to ensure the plantation coverage rate up to 50% in the
second year.
1  For the waste bank nearby the farmland, agricultural reclaiming should be
,onsidered. It may be planted with herb after first being leveled and soil improved; and
awricultural crops may be planted when the soil is fertile.
i The deep cutting areas may be built into reservoir or fish pond: and some waste
;ites may be used as for resettlement building or industrial building area.
4.8.2.3 Water pollution
OCentralized treatment shall be done for machine oil pollutant from construction
machines; solid wastes with machine oil should be stacked at designated place in stead of
88



-hrowing away casually.
Æ2Septic tank and garbage tank should be provided at the construction camp for
:imely cleaning of the wastes; building materials should be stored with rainfall proof
-overing protection.
(Dn the section of cultivated fields and water ponds, the drainage ditches at the two
'ide of subgrade shall be heightened and solidified to prevent mud entering.
(A)Sand sediment tank shall be set up in construction site near river or reservoir to
prevent mud from directly entering into water body.
4.8.2.4 Noise pollution
(1) When the construction site is close to school, no construction work with heavy
noise machines should be arranged at school time: when the construction site is close to
densely populated residence, construction work with strong noise machines should not be
arranged at nighttime.
(2) To use construction machines with low noise level as much as possible. For
-onstruction machines with high noise level, temporary sound barrier should be adopted
Lo mitigate the noise impact. The construction materials storage site and the mixing
plant should be located 300m away from the acoustic sensitive locations.
(3) The construction operator' s work time should be arranged in accordance with
he labor hygiene standard. and personal protection measures such as wearing ear- plugs
and helmets. etc. should be provided to the operators.
(4) The detour roads for the construction should be selected away from such sensitive
ocations as schools. residences and hospitals. When dense residences exist 50m within
detour road. transportation of building materials is forbidden in such detour road at night.
(5)The transportation of building materials may make the acoustic environment of
he residences along the existing roads (105) deteriorating, supervisory engineer is
equired to carry out noise monitoring at six locations: Gaopo (Wang' an county).
Iigongduancun (Shaokou township), Quanjiang (Suichuan county). Luowencun
Suichuan countv). Changshengcun (Fenggang township). Bazicun (Mashuang township).
According to the results. if necessary. the hauling route may be considered for a change:
f it is impossible to avoid. temporary sound barrier or some economic compensation may
*e given into consideration after consulting with the local residents.
4.8.2.5 Ambient Air Pollution
(I) The stabilized soil and bitumen mixing plants should be set up at the leeward side
300m away from the sensitive locations of residences. hospitals and schools. The mixing
89



plant should be equipped with sealing device, shock absorber and dust remover. Labour
protection measures should be provided to the operators of the construction machine such
as eve mask and mouth mask.
(2) Bulk construction materials transported by truck should be covered to prevent
spillage as much as possible.
(3) Hauling roads and construction site, particularly the stabilized soil mixing plant,
should be sprayed from time to time to prevent secondary dust flying.
(4) In the process of subgrade filling, spraying should be made according to the need
of compaction. After the compaction the contractor should spray the compacted ground
from time to time to prevent flying dust.
(5) The storage of the bulk construction materials should be covered and over 300m
away from the sensitive locations as school and village.
4.8.2.6 Traffic and transportation
( ) To ensure a smooth operation. construction detour roads must be set up at the
intersection of the expressway and other existing roads, which should be generally
located at one side of the original road and built into subgrade after the interchange is
completed.
(2) Traffic and transportation management over the National Highway 105 should be
enhanced. Passing time will be limited such as to avoid transporting building materials at
rush hours. Also contractors are required to make a good transportation plan.
(3) Materials will be prepared in advance. Sand and stone will be stored at relatively
less traffic time.
(4) Local public securitv and transportation management departments shall be well
coordinated with to mobilize traffic jam and to handle traffic accident so as to ensure a
smooth running.
(5) Contractors are required to make measures to cover the bulky materials so as to
prevent spill and leakage in transportation.
4.8.2.7 Cultural relics protection
During construction. if underground cultural relics are found. then construction
should stop and the supervisory engineer will protect the site. and concemed department
will be notified to handle it.
4.8.2.8 Worker' s health
(1 ) Septic tank and garbage tank shall be set up at construction camp. which are to be
90



cleared by the contractor periodically so to prevent outbreak of disease. Drinking water
that complies with hygiene standard shall be provided at the site.
(2) Contractors must adhere to labor protection regulations to provide helmets,
earplugs and periodic physical examination to workers.
(3) A full-time healthy work shall be available at construction camp to provide
medical security and give hygiene education to the site workers periodically.
4.8.2.9 Public participation
Complaint telephone number for environmental complain should be conspicuously
marked at the construction camp. For complaint problems, the employer and contractors
shall contact the local environmental department and such problem should be settled
within 48 hours.
4.8.2.10 Implementation of "Three Simultaneousness"
Contractor at the bid section shall implement facilities such as the sound barrier and
sewage treatment simultaneously with the main body engineering according to design
requirements.
4.8.3 Operation stage
4.8.3.1 Ecological impact
(1) Planting shall be continued in accordance with the engineering design for such
areas as side slope, central belt. interchange. service area so as to recover the vegetation.
protect the subgrade, and reduce soil erosion.
(2) To recover the damaged vegetation and ecology in time so to prevent denuded
surface. A greening belt of some width should be set up at the two sides of the road
(3) Major structures such as the extra-large bridge and the service area shall be
planned concurrently with the expressway construction by giving considerations to the
harmonyi of the landscape and the environment.
(4) The water-through culverts should be cleared in time to ensure a smooth running
of wsater in the irrigation system.
è5) The protection and greening engineering should be maintained.
4.8.3.2 Soil erosion
Further improve the soil & water conservation works. planting works. and land
reclaiming works according to design requirements. A combination of grass. flowers.
bushes. and arbors may be used to form a stereo planting pattern. In the later operation
stage. greening should be prompt so as to protect the subgrade stability and to reduce soil
91



erosion.
4.8.3.3 Water pollution
(1) The sewage treatment facility at the service area should be maintained so as to
ensure the sewage meeting discharging standard.
(2) Execute the water- quality- monitoring plan and supplementary environmental
protection measures will be taken according to the monitored results.
4.8.3.4 Noise pollution
(1) Traffic noise control
Adhered to the ,Regulations Concerning Ambient Noise Pollution Prevention and
Control of the People' s Republic of China" , strengthen the road traffic management
and road maintenance. Motor vehicles with high noise level exceeding standard limit

(2) Sensitive location protection
According to the specific environmental features of the sensitive locations along the
road. various measures have been compared and the noise mitigation measures for each
sensitive location are recommended as shown in Table 4-8-2 to Table 4-8-4. These
:neasures should be implemented and completed before the operation of expressway
(3) For households with non-excessive but increasing noise. due to their relatively
ton_ distances to the road (generally over 60m), so the existing noise reduction effect is
lot good. By consulting with and agreed by the households who may be possibly affected.
noise monitoring will be enhanced during operation stage to decide whether to remove, to
nstall sound-proofing windows or to give economic compensation according to the

monitored results.
(4) Noise monitoring plan will be implemented to decide supplementary acoustic
environmental protection measures according to the monitored results.

4.8.4.1 Design phase
(1) A closed and complete drainage system will be designed to lead the bridge
pavement run-off into the subgrade drainage ditch so as to prevent leakage of hazardous
substances into the river water.
(2) At the entrance of the 9 large bridges and the 2 tunnels. "Careful Driving"
warning boards (yellow) and "Max. Speed 60km" boards (red) for dangerous cargo
vehicles will be set up respectively so to remind drivers to pay attention to safety and to
limit the speed.
(3) At lOOm in front of each toll gate entrance. a reminder board (blue) will be set up
to remind the drivers of dangerous cargo to run by side and to declare for inspection.
(4) Tunnel safety design
L To establish tunnel operation management facility and to equip with relevant
facilities
The tunnel operation management facility is composed of 8 system as ventilation.
powver and lighting. firefighting. traffic control. emergency telephone. circus TV
monitor. fire warning. central control. of which the ventilation system is composed of
jet fan. fan motor. CO monitor and visibility monitor. the firefighting system is
composed by fire cock, chemical extinguisher. the fire warning system is composed by
buttons.
The tunnel is longitudinally ventilated by jet fans. Two fans asa group equipped
with one control device. There are a total of 48 fans.
Water for firefighting comes from underground. which is lifted by a pump into a
water tank. Water is supplied by pumps.
9 An emergency parking lot will be built at a good surrounding rock in the middle
place in each of the two tunnels and one transverse gallery is set up at the relevant
position. two interval pedestrian transverse gallery will also be set up.
3, Special mark will be set up to remind drivers to pay attention to safety.

(7)  "Measures Concerning Hazardous Cargo Transport Management . issued by
Jiangxi Provincial Highway Administration Bureau.
According to the above laws and regulations. the current management mode system
over dangerous cargo transport is as follows.
(I) The prefecture and municipal Traffic Administration Bureau (TAB) set up the
local distribution of hazardous chemicals transport and carriage agency network;
(2) To undertake hazardous cargo transport. the carriers and freight forwarders shall
make application to the local TAB to get special certificate subject to examination and
ipproval by the TAB. Those involved with hazardous cargo transport such as the
manufacturer. sale. storage. carrier. freight forwarder should report to the regional and
-municipal TAB the hazardous cargo transport plan and the details of the hazardous cargo:
(3) There  are  special   "driving  permit .   ,driver license" .  "escort"
equiremnents for the chemical hazardous cargo transport. with uniforn special signs for
he vehicles. which have to be inspected periodically: relevant personnel should be
rained and certified.
X4  The route and the parking area of the hazardous cargo transport shall be
Jesignated by the public securitv bureau (PSB) and fire fighting department. Vehicles
ransporting chemical hazardous substances should be parked at designated place
( 5) Special unified route bill is required for long distance hazardous cargo transport to
-e checked the PSB and TAB en-route. which is to be inspected and supervised by each
)LLblic security and transportation departments..
For this project. the following management will be made for hazardous substance
ransportation:
(I) Declaration system is enforced for vehicles transporting hazardous substance.
Driver needs to fill a declaration form. including certificate number of the carrier.
98



code of the hazardous cargo, names of consignor and consignee. loading and
unloading place, characters of the cargo. etc..
(2) At the entrance and exit of tunnel, the driver, s three licenses should be
inspected, and the route bill should be accepted. After safety inspection, the
cargo is allowed to go.
(3) Usually the hazardous cargo transport is arranged at off peak hours
(12:30-15:00). When the weather condition is bad it is not allowed to be on road.
(4) At the entrance of the highway, the "Safe Driving guidelines for Gan-Yue
Expressway" will be distributed to drivers, which, prepared by traffic safety
experts, includes emergency handling methods, safety committee address and
telephone.
I5) The declaration and inspection of vehicles transporting hazardous substance at
the highwa) entrance are to be made by the toll gate charger who will be trained
on the management. declaration. safety inspection. work procedure and fire
fighting. which will be incorporated into the project training plan.
(6) When the vehicles loaded with hazardous cargo as blasting cap. dynamite.etc.
will pass through the tunnel. the toll station staff shall notify in time the staff in
the tunnel who shall send specific person to escort the vehiocle(s) passing
through the tunnel.
4.8.4.3 Probabilitv analysis of security inspection for hazardous substance hauling
vehicles by tollgates
Transportation of hazardous cargo by Chinese vehicles shall adhere to the
Guidelines for Hazardous Cargo Transportation by Vehicles JT3130-88) issued by the
\linistrv of Communications. which specifies in detail the hazardous cargo' s
2 lassification. packaging and marking. vehicles and equipment. checking and
locumentation. consignment and delivery. transportation and unloading, custody and
tirefighting. supervision and management.  Vehicles hauling hazardous cargos shall be
rezlistered  in  transportation  authorities and  be subject to their supervision  and
*nanagement. Entering onto the expressway,. the vehicles shall pay to the tollgate. sign
Doard (blue) shall be set up at lOOm in front of the gate to remind drivers to drive in side
nd to activelv declare for inspection. At the outer side of the tollgate. an extra wide lane
4.2ni) shall be set aside for extra wide vehicles and hazardous cargo vehicles to run. In
iddition. the hazardous cargo v ehicles shall hang a signal flag with characters
-Hazardous Cargo" in yellow background in the front of left side to remind tollgate to
onduct safety inspection of them.
99



4.8.4.4 Probability analysis of accident within tunnel
According to forecasting analysis, the traffic accident probability within tunnel is
far less than that on ordinary road section (see Table 4-6-3). still such probability exists.
The hazardous cargo traffic accidents in tunnels are mainly the fire caused by the
explosion and burning of hazardous cargoes and pollution of tunnel air by hazardous and
poisonous gas, resulting in reduced the visibility. death, injury, traffic jam, traffic halt and
equipment breakdown. Besides, the tunnel structure can also cause some destruction.
4.8.4.5 Risk prevention of tunnel pollution
(1) The tunnel management station is responsible for the daily maintenance and repair
of the Yanggongshan and Fuziling tunnels and responsible for their normal operation and
control of their ventilation, lighting, fire warning, fire fighting. circuit TV. emergency
telephone and signal lamp. Also it is responsible for emergency handling in the tunnels.
(2) Tunnel management personnel should be trained. which will be incorporated into
the training prooram. so as to increase their ability to handle accident and to manage.
(3) Air within the tunnels should be monitored. which will be incorporated into the
environmental monitoring plan. and monitored data shall be reported timely.
(4) Management over hazardous substance transportation should be enhanced.
i, implementation of declaration system
;  implementation of sampling system
3  under bad weather. vehicles transporting hazardous substance are forbidden to
enter the tunnel.
The above K  and (  will be enforced by the tunnel management personnel.
4.8.4.6 Emergency plan for hazardous substance transportation accident
(I ) In case of emergency, any finder shall immediately notify the central monitor
*oom by the tunnel side telephone or other means.
(2) Upon receiving the accident, the central monitor room should immediately notify
he nearby highway patrol who will control the site. Meanwhile. nearby local fire fighting
iepartment should be also notified to help.
(3) If the hazardous substance is of solid form. thev can be cleaned and recorded in
he file.
(4) If the hazardous substance is of gas form and is fatally poisonous. firefighters
;hould wear masks to put out the fire. If the hazardous substance will unavoidably leak.
hen environmental and public security departments should be immediately notified to, if
lecessary. mobilize people within the pollution scope so as to prevent poisonous death.
100



(5) If the hazardous substance is of liquid form and has entered into public water
-odv. then environmental protection department should be immediately notified who will
ell the downstream units (especially the water supply plant) to stop take water, and
meanwhile will send environmental experts and monitors to the site to conduct
monitoring analysis, and to get the vessel from the water.
(6) Treatment measures for hazardous cargo accident in tunnel
In addition to the above treatment measures, for the treatment of hazardous cargo
accidents in tunnel. special emphasis shall be given to the clearing of site and inspection
and repairing of ventilation and alarming devices so as to eliminate the poisonous and
hazardous gases' pollution on environment.
4.8.4.7 Emergencv capability analysis for accident treatment
(1) In order to ensure driving safety under normal and emergency conditions. to
respond quickly to and to handle fire accident or other emergencies. to eliminate or
reduce pollution and damage caused by accidents. the tunnels are not only equipped with
necessary ventilation and lighting devices. but also with TV monitors. fire alarming and
.extinguishing facilities. It is intended to install 48 jet fans, 164 fire hydrants. 2 water feed
2quipment. The supervision and control system of tunnel is comprised of computer
.etwork. closed circuit TV monitor and comprehensive control panel.
2) The tunnel supervision and control program includes three conditions: normal. fire
nd accident. by which ventilation control, lighting and traffic control programs are set up.
Refer to the PreliminarY Design Chapter 8-Traffic Engineering cind Facility (MOC
R.esearch Institute of Highway. July 2000)
(3) The operation of the expressway (including tunnels) is under constant supervision.
\W hen accident happens. it can be known immediately and rescuing. firefighting.
nvironmental protection. traffic police can be notified quickly to handle it. Firefighting
mnd rescuing will be settled locally. Highway management authority shall keep contact
svith firefighting and medical department along the line and shall provide
elecommunication means.
(4) In order to better . strengthen the abilitv to cope with hazardous cargo
ransportation accidents. it is proposed that the World Bank Loan Project Office of JPCD
:onvene meetings. exchange experience. conduct training and study so as to improve
tbilits in coping with similar accidents. Damaged equipment shall be timely repaired.
naintained. installed and calibrate so as to put into use again.
To conclude. it can be thought that the project has a strong emergency handling
ibilitv of traffic accidents.

Chapter 5. Alternatives Analysis
5.1 "Without the Proposed Expressway" Alternative Analysis
National highway 105 is an important trunk road in Jiangxi province. With the
rapid economic development, there is an increasing of trading market, business
network. vehicle maintenance stations, petrol-oil station, even schools along the sides
of the highway 105. In 1997, about 92.37km out of the 257km in Ji' an prefecture
has become business street (accounting for 36%). Data in 1998 shows that the traffic
volume between Zhangshu-Nankang amounts to 4600-7500vehicle/day, mixed traffic
volume amounts to 4800-800vehicle/day, traffic congestion is 0.95-1.6. Due to the
increasing saturation, the average driving speed can only reach 40km/h with heavy
traffic jam and accidents. The increasing traffic also leads to the deterioration of the
surrounding acoustic and ambient air quality. In this regard, the building of the
proposed expressway will not only alleviate the traffic pressure. but at the same time
also improve the environmental quality along the national highway 105 .
5.2 Main Alignment Selection Procedure
The alignment is selected after comparison and optimization in three stages as
preliminary feasibility studv (Pre.F/S). feasibility study (F/S). and preliminary design
(as shown in figure 5-2-1).
5.3 Alternatives Comparison in Preliminary Feasibility Study
5.3.1 Impossibilitv of upgrading national highway 105
An analysis was done to the possibility in the preliminary feasibility study for
upgrading national highwav 105 to high-class highway. This alternative has the
following disadvantages:
(1) The mileage shall be increased a lot in order to avoid township. mines and
industrial areas. the alignment look no good;
(2) To avoid flood . the subgrade elevation shall be heightened as a whole, which
will cause serious environmental problem and waste of the existing resources.
(3) The widening of the subgrade will relocate a lot of buildings, power & tele.
lines. which will cause much negative impact on the industrial and agricultural
production as well as the living of the people along the route:
(4) The construction will further interrupt the traffic on highway 105 which in turn
increase traffic jam and accidents, causing social problems:
(5) Suichuan-Sadi of Ganzhou county is narrow hilly valley striking along the
river. big up and down in landform which gives no way for widening. If to do so,
there would be large excavation of the mountain slope or filling of the river bed which
will cause heavv soil erosion and water pollution , or even the danger of slope sliding
and flood jam:

Fig.5-2-1 Alternative Selection Procedure of Taihe-Ganzhou Expressway
(6) As most sections are plain area where there are high productive farmland,
widening the existing highway will occupy many good farnland which increase the
difficulty of land acquisition and compensation cost, causing big agricultural loss .
(7) Since there is no way to solve the mixed traffic interruption in nature, the
driving speed is still the same. Therefore. the purpose of upgrading the highway 105
to improve the vehicle operation efficiency is not preferable;
(8) Even if completed for operation, the environmental investment will be very
large since there are many sensitive locations as large residential quarters, townships,
schools, hospitals, etc. which need to build many sound barriers. In addition, these
103



sensitive locations will suffer more tail gas than present:
In sum, the upgrading alternative of highway 105 is not preferable from the point
of engineering, environmental protection and social respect.
5.3.2 Refuse to the East Ganjiang alignment alternative
This alternative starts from Taihe county, bypassing Wan' an, Xinguo, Ganxian,
Ganzhou city and ends at Nakang city. Complicated hilly landform gives difficulty to
project works; low class standard, long mileage for the main route; many structures,
two times overpass Ganjiang rive, two extreme large bridges shall be built; the
alignment doesn' t strike properly with Gan-Yue expressway as a whole. The
favorable terrain has been occupied by the  "Jing-Jiu"  railway and it, s very
difficult to line the expressway in addition to the interruption between each other.
Therefore, this alternative is not preferable in respect of engineering.
Looking from the point of social and environmental respect. this alternative has
the following shortcomings:
(I) The alignment goes in hilly area, bypassing a long mileage of heavy soil
erosion areas where the construction will further worsen the situation. As large
quantities of earth & stone works, earth borrowing and waste area are required. there
would be a lot of investment in protection and greening works.
(2) Tow-time overpassing the Ganjiang river, the construction will on the exert
impact on the water quality. What, s more, the transport of hazardous subjects in
operation phase will have high potential risk in polluting the river water. There are
many big or small townships on the banks, the water pollution will cause social
unrest.
(3) The favorable terrain is very narrow with few farmlands. As the "Jing-Jiu
railway construction has already occupied many of the farmland, another
expressway will reduce the farmland even more, resulting in big agricultural loss. In
this regard, it is difficult to get the public support.
(4) The overlapping of the two trunk lines is unfavorable to the play of transport
efficiency, which result in small social benefits.
5.3.3 Comparison of West Ganjiang Alignment Alternative
5.3.3.1 Brief of the alternative
After refuse to the above two alternatives. the preliminary F/S report put forward
the following three alternatives (Refer to Figure 5-3-1):
(I) Alternative I (Recommended Scheme)
The proposed expressway starts from the end point of the Changfu-Taihe section -
- Nlashi township (the intersection point with the national highway 105). and ends at
the Longling Town of Nankang city intersected with highway 105 (or 323). The

The Jiangxi Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau (JPEPB) is the
competent authority under the Provincial People' s Government responsible for
supervision and management of the environmental protection in Jiangxi province.
There are local EPBs at regional, municipal, county levels responsible for the
environmental protection in their administrative jurisdiction areas. In the PEPB there
is Environmental Protection Monitoring Center; and under the regional and municipal
EPB, there is Environmental Monitoring Station (EMS). The environmental
protection work for the proposed expressway will be carried out under the supervision
of the local EPB along the highway areas. The detailed environmental protection
mana-gement plan refers to the environmental supervision plan, as shown in Table 6-

6.2 Environmental Monitoring Plan
(1) Purpose and principles
The purpose of environmental monitoring plan is to implement each of the
environmental protection measures and to adjust envirornmental plan in time
according to the monitored result, to provide evidence and basis for arrangement of
the time schedule of the protection measures. The principle of the environmental
monitoring plan is based on the expected main environmental impact in different
periods (construction or operation period).
(2) Monitoring items
The environmental impacts are mainly in the construction and operation periods.
In the construction period, the impacts mainly are TSP, bitumen smoke, construction
noise and water quality. In the operation period, the impacts mainly are traffic noise,
ambient air and water environment.
According to the forecast and the assessment, the items to be monitored are TSP.
bitumen smoke, construction noise and water quality in the construction period: and in
the operation period, the traffic noise. ambient air and the water quality.
(3) Environmental monitoring organization
In construction period, the supersvision engineer shall undertake the noise
monitoring. The other environmental monitoring work shall be contracted out to the
Ji' an and Ganzhou EMSs. To ensure implementation of the monitoring plan. the
Project owner shall enter into contract before commencement of the construction w ith
the EMS concerning the monitoring in the construction period; and shall enter into
another contract before the hand over of the completed highway with the EMS
concerning the monitoring work in the operation period.
(4) Enxvironmental monitoring plan
The environmental monitoring plan is summarized in Table 6-1-2.
(5) Cost estimation of the environmental monitoring equipment and fee
Five noise monitoring instrument shall be purchased for this project. which costs
about RMB 100.000.
The environmental monitoring fee in the construction period are about
RMB270.000: the environmental monitoring fee in the operation period is about
RMB210.000 (refer to Table 6-2-1 for details).The total monitoring costs about
RMB480.000.

Chapter 8    Public Participation
8.1 Outline of Public Participation and Negotiation
As an important project in Jiangxi province, the proposed Taihe-Ganzhou
highway, after being completed, will play an vital importance in connecting the
Yangtze economic zone and south China economic special zones, in supplementing
the national highway networks, in satisfying traffic increase. It is particularly
important to meet Jiangxi province' s economic growth and to perfect economic
pattern, to expedite the exploration and utilization of the province' s tourism
resources and to promote the whole province, s social and economic development.
The preliminary preparations for this highway have already attracted wide attention
from every circles of the society.
The Jiangxi provincial government strongly supports the project. the Ji' an
prefecture and the Ganzhou city government and their transportation departments
have actively participated in the preliminary preparation works. City and county
governments along the line also expressed their concern and support to the project and
have suggested many helpful ideas to the alignment.
In order to fully comprehend the public opinions and to really protect the interests
of influenced people. the concerned departments of construction. design. resettlement
and environmental assessment unit have made four public participation surveys and
consultation on Dec. 10-15. 1999. April 12-20, 2000. and Mav 18-June 5, 2000 and
Nov. 20-28.2000 respectively. The latest (fourth) public survey was carried out for
those impacted by the optimized alignment in the construction design for the
recommended scheme. The survey places are cities. counties and townships along the
proposed line. In the process of data collection and site visiting, the assessment team.
resettlement office and the design department consulted with relevant departments as
agriculture. statistics. water conservation. forestry. environmental protection and
communications. etc. Through public investigation and consultation, we have
obtained information about the current social and economic conditions along the road.
listened to the opinions and suggestions of the experts and the public concerned. The
team has also informed them the proposed project and its environmental protection
progress. thus increasing the popularity of the project and gaining strong support and
coordination  from   governmental  organizations.  social  organizations.  non-
governmental organizations and the public.
8.1.1 Survey method and respondent
The public participation survey was carried out in three different forms.
(1) Family or individual interview
134



The respondents are those families who may be directly affected by the project
(to be resettled. or involved in land acquisition) and the resident representatives who
are impacted by the hauling vehicles' noise close to the excess road and the national
highway 105 . The major villages being surveyed are: Nitang, Huangzhangduan,
Zhuhu, Kangfu. Yuziqian, Wuche, Mawei, Baijia, Zhangtang,Shaoxi.Xitou, Sheqian.
Gaoshan. Xiawan,Zhongshe, etc. (see Table 8-1 -1).
The surveyer first of all gave them a brief introduction about the alignment of the
proposed expressway and the possible positive effects (improvement in transportation
infrastructure, economic development) and negative effects (possible land acquisition,
removal, resettlement and traffic noise) brought out by the highway. Then the
respondents filled a public opinion form (household) at their will, or orally expressed
their opinion which have been recorded by the questionnaires, then summarized and
analyzed by the investigators.
(2) Group interview
The respondents are mainly village committees and schools that may be affected
along the road. Seminars or filling of form were held in which individual gave free
talks. then summarized into the public opinion representing the unit. The interviwed
units are mainly Sanjiang town, Daping township. Jingshi township. Luogang
township. Wuling High School, Mashuang High School, Nankang dermatopathy
Clinic. Sheshang sholl, Hongshan school, Zhangtang school Shaoxi school. etc.. refer
to Table 8-1 -1 for details
(3) Seminar with governmental and non-governmental organizations
The owner. design. resettlement and environmental assessment units have visited
local agriculture, statistics. hydro, forestry. environmental protection  and
communications departments, gathered opinions and data from each department,
also convened a meeting in Taihe on August 25. 2000 attended by governmental or
non-governmental organizations as influenced people. women representative. teachers,
political  consulters,  people' s  representatives.  transportation  bureau  and
environmental protection bureau. Due to the partial alignment optimization in the
recommended scheme. another meeting was held on November 30. 2000 in Jii an
which was attended by governmental or non-governmental organizations as
influenced people, women representative. teachers. political consulters. people' s
representatives. transportation bureau, environmental protection bureau and the
resident representatives who are impacted by the hauling vehicles' noise close to the
excess road and the national highway 105. The memorandum of the two meetings is
shown in Annex III.
The topics of the meeting include:
135



,  Introduction of the necessity, construction scale and technical standard of the
proposed expressway by the owner;
20 Basic principle in selecting the alignment and coordination with local opinion;
Æ3 Major environmental concerns of the project and possible removal and
resettlement problems.
The attendants have put forward many precious opinions for this project, which
have been reflected in the design documents, EIA report or RAP.
During the previous three public surveys, a total of 420 family questionnaires
were distributed and 367 were returned back, accounting for 87.4% of the total; 32
group questionnaires were distributed with 30 returned back, accounting for 93.8% of
the total. The survey involved 491 persons (based on the family). 55 villages, 12
organizations. (note: some of the places or respondents may be overlapped in the first
three surveys, see Table 8-1-1) . The fourth (latest) public survey distributes 98 family
questionnaires were distributed and 83 were returned back, accounting for 84.7% of
the total; 15 group questionnaires were distributed with 13 returned back. accounting
for 86.7% of the total. The survey involved 83 person (based on the family). 14
villages, refer to Table 8-1-2 for details.
The memorandum for influenced people, governmental and non-governmental

Note the figures in the table are deri ed from the statistics data ot the public participation and questionnair atter the optimized
ah2nment of the recommended program
It can be seen from Tables above that:
(1) Over 90% of the respondents were in favour of construction of the espressway
and most respondents held that it will be beneficial to the State. collectives and the
private persons.
-  (2) Over 69% of the respondents agree to obey land acquisition. resettlement, and
compensation: about one third of the respondents have some understanding the road
land acquisition. resettlement and compensation policies, or only knew a little.
(3) Most of the respondents understand the impacts of noise and dusts caused by
hiohway construction and recommended some mitigation measures.
(4) There were a few respondents who didn' t give their answers to some options
and a lot of people didn' t know their relationships with project construction and
reiated policies, and were not clear about the adverse impacts on environment along
139



the road caused by construction and operation. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance
publicity and information release.
8.2 Public Opinions and Suggestions
8.2.1 From individual persons
(1) To build the proposed expressway as soon as possible and to open to traffic as
early as possible.
(2) To provide enough underpasses and overpasses for the convenience of local
people on both sides of the expressway.
(3) The most directly influenced people along the expressway are farmers, who
hope that after the land acquisition, the land compensation should be carried out as
soon as possible and strictly in accordance with the policy to avoid deduction.
(4) The compensation for the resettlement should be carried out in time in
accordance with policies and family conditions, with the living standard after the
resettlement not lower than before.
(5) Noise. tail gas and dust will have some impact on people' s living, but are
within the acceptable scope. The mitigation measures proposed in the EIA are
acceptable.
The above opinions and suggestions have been reflected in the design.
resettlement and assessment documents.
8.2.2 Opinions and suggestions from organizations
(1) They support the construction of the proposed expressway and believe that it
will be beneficial to promoting the economic development in Jiangxi province and to
improving people' s living standards.
(2) Agree with the alignment of the proposed expressway. The Sanjiang town
government hopes to build an auxiliarv bridge besides the Shangyoujiang bridge to
make people convenient to cross the river and to enter into the expresswav.
(3) The negative impacts caused by the highway such as dust. tail gas. traffic
noise. should be mitigated bv some measures such as greening. diversion from
villages, removal and resettlement and setting of soundproof facilities.
(4) It is recommended that in the design and construction stage. it is important to
make close contact with local in designing culverts. bridges and passagewavs.
Compensation money should be in time and in full amount and local surplus labor
force should be hired as much as possible for construction.
The above opinions and suggestions have been reflected in the design resettlement
and assessment documents.
8.3 Information Disclosures and Feedback
(l) Television. broadcasting. newspaper and bulletin should be used to release
information to the public regarding the significance, alignment. resettlement and
140



environmental protection for this project. The World Bank Loan Project office of
JPCD released the bulletin concerning the environmental and resettlement in
.Nanchang Evening, Jingangshan Dailv and Ganzhou Daily dated Oct. 1 0- 11 (Refer to
Annex IV). Relevant inforrnation will be released in the above-mentioned newspapers
in the future.
(2) All the environmental documents such as the EIA. EAP, and El Summary
have been exposed to the public. The Owner has put all environmental documents in
the Reference Room of Taihe county, Wan' an county, Suichuang county and
Ganzhou city. A complete set of environmental documents have been available in the
resettlement offices, besides, the library place and complaint telephone number has
been released in the newspaper. In this case. the public can have access to the related
information not through governmental organizations.
(3) The Owner will set up EP complaint telephone in each level of the
resettlement office, gathering and recording the public' s complaint on environmental
protection. Upon receiving the complaint, the Owner will come to site to solve it
along with local EP bureaus within 48 hours.
(4) In accordance with the environment protection measures specified in the EIA
reports. Jiangxi Provincial Expressway Administration will carry out tracking survey
in each phase as design. construction and operation in the aspects of impact survey on
the people along line. public opinions on the sound barrier. etc.
A random check will be carried out by Jiangxi Provincial Environmental
Protection Bureau to ensure the measures be in place. such as whether Zhuhu school
has been removed, whether the sound barrier for Mashuang school has been built. etc.
8.4 Summary of Pubic Participation
The Owner and design unit attaches great importance to the public opinion. which
have been taken into account in the road design. such as to build an auxiliarv bridge
on both sides of the Shangyoujiang bridge. to build one interchange for each county.
to compare a number of alternative schemes..
As for the environmental concerns caused by the project. the assessment and
design units have proposed corresponding protection measures such as to remove
Zhuhu primarv school. to build sound barriers in Mashuang school. to install
soundproof windows. which.have been agreed by the influenced people.
During its preliminary preparation and design, full consultation and exchange
have been made with local governments. social associations and the public: and the
public opinions have been fully exemplified in the selection of alignment. setting of
interchange and connecting roads. environmental protection and resettlement.
Therefore this project has received wide support from the public.

Chapter 9 Assessment Conclusions
9.1 Ecological Environment (including soil erosion)
(1) The ecological environment along the proposed highway assessment area is
good. The main line will take up a total land surface of 11,218.8 mu, including paddy
field, dry land, pond, woodland and wasteland. Construction of this highway will
cause some economic loss for agricultural production, but will not produce significant
impact on the pattem of land distribution and vegetation.
(2) There will be some changes in local terrain and landform owing to the
cutting/filling of earth/stone during road subgrade construction, however, by taking
corresponding engineering protection measures in design, construction and operation
stages of the highway, such adverse impacts in vegetation disruption, land utilization
and farmland change can be minimized.
(3) Investigation shows that there is no wild life reservation area along the
proposed highway. nor is there any precious and endangered animals and plants. Due
to the engineering work. some trees. fruit trees. flowers. bush and crops will be cut.
buried and tramped. affecting some small animal who live on plants and reside on it.
But the above negative impact might be mitigated and compensated for to some extent
by greening measures.
(4) During the construction stage and the initial operation stage. certain amount of
soil erosion will happen owing to the cutting/filling of slopes. The forecast shows that
the soil erosion will reach 29985.075-65523.16 ton/vear if there is no protection
measures at all: but because the protection engineering and the main body engineering
will be simultaneously designed. constructed. completed and accepted. therefore the
actual soil erosion will be far less than the forecasted value. In addition,
implementation of greening measures will recover apart of the vegetation and reduce
the soil erosion in slopes.
9.2 Water Environment
(1) Construction and operation of the large and extra-large bridges will have a
relatively small impact on the water body.
(2) If discharged casuallk. the sew-age from construction camp may have negative
impact on the surrounding environment. Septic tank will be set up at the construction
camp to treat the sewage before it is discharged.
(3) The proposed highway will not exert big impact on the water canals, ponds.
and agricultural irrigation system.
(4) Pollutants in the pavement run-off mainlv are SS and a small amount of
petroleum. mostly occurring in the beginning of rainfall. The rivers of Shushuihe.
142



Suichuanjiang. Shangyoujiang, Zhangjiang. Ganjiang crossed over by the road have
stable flow with great capacity to dilute the pollutant concentration. Since there is no
centralized drinking water intake at the downstream of the bridges, the run-off from
the bridge pavement will have a very little impact on the river water quality.
(5) The Suichun and Ganzhou service areas will produce a total daily sewage and
vehicle washing waste water of 204.2-535.2 tons, which will be treated by sewage
treatment facility. After being treated, the sewage can be used to spray plants or
discharged into nearby canals, thus exerting little impact on environment.
9.3 Acoustic Environment
(1) General construction and hauling machines have relatively large impact on
people nearby the construction site (50m), and small impact beyond 100m,
particularly the construction noise at the night will impact the people' s rest and sleep.
For example. schools and hospitals and residences within 50m from the road center
(including connecting road) can have a relatively large impact from construction noise.
Therefore proper construction time schedule shall be made to avoid work at school
time and night time.
(2) In accordance with the Class IV standard limit of GB3096-93 (70dB daytime
and 55dB nighttime). the daytime noise level on both sides of the highway will be in
compliance with the standard limit in the operation period; the nighttime noise
compliant distance is 60m in the initial operation stage. and will be increased with
traffic volume, and will be 10Gm in the long term operation stage. This shows that for
ordinary residences, the daytime noise impact is relatively smaller and the nighttime
noise impact will be greater.
(3) In davtime. the Zhuhu Primary School. Mashuang High School and Qiubian
Primarv School will have a noise excess of more than 9.3dB, and max. up toI3.6dB in
the long-term operation stage, a serious impact on the school teaching. Therefore
protection measures as removal and sound barriers shall be taken. For Wuling High
School. the daytime traffic noise is exceeding by 0.8-2.6dB for Wuling High School.
However. the teaching building is a bit far away and is perpendicular to the road. the
impact on the school teaching is not great. As for Daping Olds' home. the davtime
traffic noise will be exceeding by 2.7-7.Odb and that at nighttime is 6.8-9.8dB which
shall have great noise impact: but it is very small and could be removed 200m away
from the road.
(4) Kangfucun and the Nankang Skin Clinic have an ambient noise excess of
more than 5.7-9.9dB and that at nighttime is exceeding by 9.3-12.8dB. indicating a
high impact by the road operation. Sound barriers will be built.
(5) In the initial and middle termn operation period. all the sensitive locations have
143



no noise exceedance at daytime; in the long-run operation stage. only one sensitive
location has noise excess by 1.3dB
(6) During the initial and long term operation stage, there are 37 locations with
excessive noise at night, accounting for 38.9% of the total villages. There are 12
villages with large noise excess (more than 7.0dB) at night during the long-term
operation stage Of which, Nitangcun(KI59+440), Pang' an (K228+880), Zihecun
(K257+000) will be protected by building sound barriers; the rest (mainly the first row
of houses) will be protected by installing soundproof windows.
(7) Scattered individual household within 30m from the road center will be
excessive in noise by more than 5.0 dB  those within 30-50m from the road center
will be excessive in noise by 3.0-7.0 dB; those within 50-100m from the road
center will be excessive in noise by less than 5.0dB; those beyond lOOm can meet
the standard, those beyond 150m from the road center will be approaching the base
level. Therefore, the individual households within lOOm from the road center will be
solicited to decide whether to install soundproof windows or to remove. For
individual households beyond lOOm from road center. noise monitoring will be
carried out during operation stage to decide whether to take supplementary measures.
(8) For households without noise excess but with increasing noise level, as they
are relatively far away from the road (generally more than 60m). so the existing
measures will not have good effect. Through negotiation and obtaining their agree.
noise monitoring during operation stage will be enhanced to decide whether to remove.
to install soundproof windows or to give some economic compensation.
9.4 Ambient Air
(1) Status-quo survey shows that NOx and TSP pollution are slight. with great
environmental tolerance for NOx. Most areas passed through by the highway are rural
areas. where the air quality is in natural good conditions. without large-sized fixed
pollution source..
(2) The main environmental concerns in the construction stage are pollution of
TSP. bitumen smoke from the construction site. so if the stabilized soil mixing uses
plant mixing method and the mixing plant is set away from sensitive locations and
labor protection is provided to operators: construction road and hauling road are
sprayed water and cleaned: hauling vehicles are covered by cloth. the quarry is far
trom residences. subgrade is sprayed water in filling. then the adverse impacts can be
controlled to some degree
(3) According to forecast. in the lone term operation stage. under the condition of
cateuorv D air stability. the concentrations of NOx and CO 23m from the road center
at each section will meet the Class 1I standards; and those in each sensitive location
144



will be in compliance with the Class 11 standard limit. Under unfavorable
meteorological conditions, the NOx concentration 23m from the road center with high
traffic volume and complicated landform may exceed the standard limit.
(4) CO concentration 23m from the road center meet Class II standard limit.
(5) The two tunnels of the project are all over lOOOm long, ventilation machines
will be used so to ventilate and to relieve tail gas pollution.
9.5 Social Environment
(1) The proposed expressway will play a very important role in the social
economic development in Ji' an, Ganzhou areas and the whole Jiangxi province. The
project will also promote the local areas'  tourism resources and tertiary industry
development and improve the investment environment, promoting the adjustment and
growth of the three industries.
(2) The expressway will greatly ease the traffic pressures on the existing roads
and will improve traffic environment and reduce road traffic accident.
(3) The expressway construction inevitably takes up some land and arable land.
but overall speaking. such impact is not big and can be mitigated by adjustment of
land use pattern.
(4) Proper resettlement will be carried out strictly in accordance with the local
policy concerning land acquisition and resettlement. Since rational overpasses and
underpasses have been designed. so local people' s convenience will not be impacted
much.
(5) According to the report submitted by the cultural relics administration
department, the proposed project will not cause damage to the existing cultural relics
on the ground. The owner will call the public awareness on the protection of cultural
relics: and protective measures will be taken for the underground relics discovered in
the construction stage.
9.6 Risk of Hazardous Substance Transportation
(I) Although the accident probability of Hazardous Substance Transportation is
very small. but once happened. the consequence can be serious. Owner will formulate
emergency plan to enhance its handling ability through training and management so
as to minimize pollution risk.
(2) Analysis shows that the project has a relatively strong ability to handle
accident emergency.
9.7 Public Participation
(I) The owner has taken the public opinions into full consideration in the project
145



design. such as an auxiliary bridge will be set up on both sides of the Shangyoujiang
bridge, and one interchange will be set up for each of the counties, a number of
alternative schemes has be taken for comparison and selection.
(2) As to the possible environmental issues arising from this project, the
assessment and design units have proposed corresponding protection measures such as
to remove Zhuhu primary school, to build sound barriers in Mashuang school, to
install soundproof windows etc., which have been agreed by the influenced people.
(3) Television, broadcasting, newspaper will be used to release information to the
public, and access to environmental documents and complaint telephone will be
provided to them. The World Bank Loan Project office of JPCD released the bulletin
concerning the environmental and resettlement in Nanchang Evening, Jingangshan
Daily and Ganzhou Daily dated Oct.10- 11.
(4) Public complaint shall be handled promptly through the cooperation with the
environmental protection department.
(5) Jiangxi Provincial Expressway Administration will perform an supervision and
check over the environmental protection measures specified in the EIA report for this
project in design. construction and operation stage.
9.8 Environmental Investments and Management Plan
(I) The environmental protection cost for the proposed expressway will be
I 4.96082million RMB yuan. accounting for 0.42% in the total investment.
(2) The owner has set up a resettlement office and a 3-partv coordination group
composed of design. resettlement and environmental personnel; which is responsible
for the environmental management and resettlement issues for the project:
(3) Detailed EAP has been formulated to finalize the implementation of
mitigation measures and environmental monitoring plan.
9.9 Conclusion of the Assessment
To sum up. construction and operation of the proposed project will exert some
negative impacts on ecological environment. on local people, s daily life and
schooling: however so long as the mitigation measures recommended in this EIA have
been seriouslv finalized and implemented, the negative impacts will be under control
and reduced to an acceptable minimum. The alignment design is reasonable with
considerable social economic benefits. Therefore this EIA states that the proposed
expressway is feasible.
