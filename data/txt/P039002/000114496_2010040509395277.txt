withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be
made as follows:
     (a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrowers shall furnish to the Bank a request or
requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On
the basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on
behalf of the Borrowers, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrowers shall have requested.
     (b)   (i) For replenishment of the Special Account,
               the Borrowers shall furnish to the Bank
               requests for deposits into the Special
               Account at such intervals as the Bank
               shall specify.
          (ii) Prior to or at the time of each such
               request, the Borrowers shall furnish to
               the Bank the documents and other evidence
               required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this
               Schedule for the payment or payments in
               respect of which replenishment is
               requested.  On the basis of each such
               request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
               Borrowers, withdraw from the Loan Account
               and deposit into the Special Account such
               amount as the Borrowers shall have
               requested and as shall have been shown by
               said documents and other evidence to have
               been made out of the Special Account for
               eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories,
and in the res- pective equivalent amounts, as shall have
been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.   For each payment made by the Borrowers out of the
Special Account, the Borrowers shall, at such time as the
Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such
documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make
further deposits into the Special Account:
     (a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the
Borrowers directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the General
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Page  16
Agreement; or
     (b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories for Parts A (2), B
and C (1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) of the Project, less the
amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into
by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General
Conditions with respect to Parts A (2), B and C (1), (2),
(3), (5) and (6) of the Project, shall equal the
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories for Parts A (2), B and C (1), (2),
(3), (5) and (6) of the Project shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrowers. Such further withdrawals shall be made only
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in
the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the Special Account:  (i) was
made for an expendi- ture or in an amount not eligible
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not
justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrowers shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request,
or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank
shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to
the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special
Account shall be made until the Borrowers have provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.
     (b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrowers shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.
     (c) The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in the Special Account.
     (d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to
the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions. \1a
