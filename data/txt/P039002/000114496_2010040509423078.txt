Parts A, B, C and D of the Project, shall equal the
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories for Parts A, B, C and D of the
Project shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall
specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent
that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit ln the Special Account as of

that nay payment out of the Special Account:  (i) was
made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; (ii) was not
justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the

Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.
