KOSOVO nEGIOAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2306-YU)
PREFACE
1.          The Kosovo Regional Development Project, for which Loan 2306-YU in
the amount of US$79.0 M was approved on June 24, 1983, was closed as scheduled
on March 31, 1989 with a final disbursement on September 30, 1989. At that time,
the unused balance of US$18.6 million was cancelled. This was preceded by an
earlier cancellation of US$20 million on March 9. 1988. This was the 16th Bank
loan for agriculture to Yugoslavia.
2.          The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office based in part on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 4154a-YU) dated March 30, 1983. the President's Report (No. P-3575-YU) dated
April 22, 1983, the Loan Agrsement of June 24, 1983. correspondence with the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant
Bank files. The Borrower was requested to provide information for Part II. but
none was received.

KOSOVO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2306-YU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1. Proiect Obiectives. The main objective of the project was to promote growth through
financing of infrastructure and credit for the 12 least developed Communes 1 to: (i)
increase agricultural production; (ii) impreve rural income and employment
opportunities; (iii) increase capacity utilization of existing agroindustries; (iv)
increase individual farm sector incomes; and (v) reduce income disparity between less
and more developed Communes and between the individual and social sectors. The main
institution building objectives of the project were to strengthen: (i) Kosovska Banka
Pristina (KBP), the Borrower, and (ii) the Federation of Cooperatives (FC), the main
project implementing E_ency.
2. Implementation  Experience        The  macroeconomic  conditions  during  project
implementation deteriorated substantially compared to appraisal assumptions. High and
accelerating domestic inflation followed by successive Dinar devaluations resulted in
significant changes in the agricultural price structure and a drop in demand for
agricultural  products.    Also,  interest  rates  charged  to  subborrowers  became
increasingly negative in real terms and it became difficult for investors to obtain
local counterpart funds. Although the performance of FC helped considerably in project
implementation, it could not offset the shortage of counterpart funds which was caused
by the Kosovo government placing low priority for this project. The government favored
the social sector in the allocation of heavily subsidized counterpart funds.
3. Proiect Results.    While subprojects to small farmers and some infrastructure
investments had a good development impact, many infrastructure subprojects were either
cancelled or remain incomplete.
4. Proiect Sustainability.  Whether the project could sustain a positive level of
economic benefits in the economic environment that presently exists in Yugoslavia is
open to question.   The future of most subprojects will depend on how government
policies and the Yugoslav economic situation evolve. The sustainability of community
development subprojects would depend on suitable arrangements for funding of their
operations and management.
5. Findings and Lessons Learned.  Although the project was not fully implemented,
project investments generally produced beneficial results.   Experience with this
project shows that Government commitment to the project concept which in this case was
partially lacking is essential for successful implementation. It also shows that the
implementation plan agreed to at appraisal must reflect a realistic assessment of the
capabilities of the participating agencies to reduce the risk of not meeting project
targets.

B. BACKGROUND
Previous Bank Involvement
1.          Although the project was to extend an additional US$79 million of
Bank funds for the development of rural Kosovo, disbursements had been declining
under other Bank loans to the Kosovska Banka Pristina (KBP, the Borrower) at the
time of project preparation. The reasons for slow disbursements and generally
poor performance of other Bank-financed projects included the weaknesses of RBP
management and the worsening macroeconomic situation in Yugoslavia.
2.          Since 1973, Kosovo has received a total of US$189 million for the
development for two multipurpose irrigation schemes (US$99 million) and for on-
farm development and agroindustries (US$90 million) under Ln. 1993-YU, which was
appraised in 1980. In addition, Kosovo had received US$22.9 million under the
First (Ln. 1129-YU), Second (Ln. 1477-YU), and Third (Ln. 1801-YU) Agricultural
Credit Projects.
3.          While all Kosovo projects faced serious implementation problems, as
is reflected in correspondence between RBP and the Bank, the intention of the
proposed new project was to resolve outstanding issues and incorporate the
lessons from accumulated implementation experience.
Rural Development Objectives
4.          One of the main objectives of the Yugoslav Government has been to
reduce the income disparity between less developed and more developed regions of
the country.   Kosovo, like other less developed regions, received special
assistance from the Federal Government, including lo-. interest loans through the
Federal Fund for Less Developed Regions. Until recently such loans carried an
interest rate of 11%.



- 2 -
5.          The main objective of the Kosovo Government was to increase incomes
of the rural population through increased agricultural production in the
individual sector and through improvements in rural infrastructure.   It was
expected that the 1981-1985 Kosovo Development Plan would lead to real annual
agricultural production increases of 5.7% made up of rates of 10.8% and 4.8% in
the social and individual sectors, respectively.   Although such growth rates
appeared optimistic compared to earlier performance of 4.0% and 2.3% in the
social and individual sectors between 1976 and 1980, they were nevertheless
assumed to be attainable.
6.          The major components of the Kosovo rural development strategy focused
on encouraging: (i) the use of modern inputs such as fertilizer and improved
seeds; (ii) livestock production; and (iii) high value added crops such as fruit
and vegetables.   Increased agricultural production was to be supported by
specialized services (e.g., veterinary stations), rural roads and agricultural
cooperative centers for distribution of modern inputt' rnd implements. The Bank
fully supported this strategy.
7.          The agricultural investment demand in Kosovo over the 1981-1985
period of the Development Plan was expected to reach about Dinars 13,650 million
(US$297 million). The project was conceived in a series of Bank/FAO CP missions
and the final design emerged by December 1980.
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
8.          For the first time in Yugoslavia the project strategy was to apply
an integrated regional development approach to: (i) increase individual sector
on-farn investments for livestock, crop, fruit and %iegetable production; (ii)
finance incremental fertilizer purchases by cooperatives for sale to small
farmers; (iii) foster and improve provincial services including marketing
opportunities for individual sector farmers; (iv) upgrade farm access roads and
provide for their improved maintenance; (v) support the Kosovo land consolidation
program by providing additional equipment for the Geodetic Bureau and technical
assistance in land consolidation to two Communes; (vi) improve rural
communications by providing equipment and staff training for the Kosovo radio
stations; and (vii) contribute to institution building within KBP, the Federation
of Cooperatives (FC), the Institute of Economic Development (IED) and other
provincial services including extension, veterinary, and cooperative.
Proiect Description
9.          The project consisted of an investment and agricultura..  credit
program with  several  components  extended  over  five  years.    It  included
reconstructicn and expansion of an antiquated 4,000 ha irrigation scheme.  The
Decane irrigation scheme was to be modernized and equipped with mobile sprinklers
at the cost of US$4,000/ha (1982 prices). The total cost was estimated at US$22
million.   Also, a separate drainage and flood protection development in the
Vitine Commune was to be completed under the project together with land
consolidation at the cost of US$2,120/ha (1982 prices).  Since preparation and



- 3 -
feasibility studies for the irrigation and drainage components revealed poor
maintenance in other Kosovo schemes as well, it was agreed that various measures
would be taken, including hiring more qualified staff, to improve operation and
maintenance in general.
10.         The project extended development credit for individual sector farmers
in parallel to identical investmenits made under Ln. 1801-YU and Ln. 1993-YU
(paras 2 and 16). Also, the project targeted 36,000 tons of fertilizer to be
sold to individual sector farmers.
11.         The project was to extend development credit for a number of farm
service and marketing investments.  It was decided to build 36 agri-service
centers and 60 smaller depots to improve input availability, market access and
the range of services provided in rural areas.  The services provided were to
vary according to local requirements. In about 30 centers milk collection points
were to be established.   The main objective of this component was to reduce
travel time so that over 85X of farmers would travel no more than 5 km to the
nearest  depot.    Also,  thL  project  included  construction  of  5 new  and
rehabilitation of about 20 existing veterinary stations and the construction of
about 20 artificial insemination stations. Further, the project was to support
substantial improvements in the Kosovo agricultural extension service.
12.         The project was to finance technical assistance,  equipment and
vehicles for institutions involved in project implementation.   The proposed
institution building efforts for FC and KBP included mainly measures to improve
management and hiring of additional staff. Also, the project was to finance
technical assistance, equipment and vehicles for the six radio stations in Kosovo
to improve the effectiveness, quantity and quality of agricultu::al radio
programs, especially fo; individual sector farmers.
13.         The project included a program for the improvement of about 700 km
of existing local roads at the cost of US$35,000/km (1982 prices) in twelve
Communes.   Also, it included institutional and organizational provisions for
improved road maintenance.   Finally, the project included financing of land
consolidation on about 30,000 ha of irrigated and 5,000 ha of rain-fed land.
D. ISSUES OF PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
14.         General.  Project issues identified during preparation and appraisal
reflected the perceived needs of agriculture and rural areas.   Some of the
critical issues repeatedly pointed out included: (i) pricing of agricultural
commodities and price discrimination against the individual sector, particularly
with respect to industrial crops; (ii) ineffective Government agricultural
policy; (iii) uncertainty related to frequent Dinar devaluations vis-a-vis
Western currencies and its impact on project cost; (iv) poor KBP performance in
the implementation of other ongoing Bank loans; and (v) low KBP interest rates
compared to tte rate of inflation.
15.         Proiect Institutions.  The roles and responsibilities of KBP, seven
associated Basic Banks (BBs), the Government, the Federation of Cooperatives,
Agrokosovo, subborrowers and other agencies involved in project implementation
were known to all parties involved. Poor KBP performance was noticeable from
the implementation experience of the three agricultural credit projects and four



irndustrial credit projects, in which KBP participated, and from the 1980
appraisal of Ln. 1993-YU.
16.         KBP Credit Absorption Capacitv.   The most important issue raised
repeatedly during project preparation related to the rapidly deteriorating
performance of KBP and the ways to improve it. KBP was the only development
banking institution in Kosovo and was financing over 80X of long-term investments
in agriculture. It was noted that the proposed project would add about US$58
million to about US$150 million of undisbursed Bank loan funds (May 31, 1982)
for other Bank-financed ongoing agriculture projects in Kosovo. Thus KBP was
expected to disburse about US$50-55 million annually once the new project was
approved. This implied a 400% increase compared to the highest disbursement of
US$13 million of Bank funds in FY80.
17.         Proposed Improvements in KBP Performance.  It was agreed that the
KBP and the Kosovo Government would furnish the Bank with a program to
significantly improve KBP performance as a condition for financing the proposed
project. Several actions were proposed to obtain a truly effective program from
KBP. including close involvement of the Bank IDF Division and a proposal to hire
expatriate banking advisory services to bring about improved KBP performance.
KBP was to submit its program to the Bank by October 31, 1982. It should be
noted that KBP had been asked to submit a similar proposal to the Bank in 1980
for improving its performance during the preparation of Ln. 1993-YU, but this
had not led to a.1y perceptible improvement in KBP's performance because of
inadequate follow-up.
18.         KBP submitted  "A Set of Proposed Measures  for Organizational
Improvements in World Bank Related Operations of KBP", as agreed, and Bank staff
noted that the bulk of the KBP problems was addressed adequately. The proposal
contained the following major steps: (i) appoint a chief coordinator for Bank
projects; (ii) appoint a training specialist; (iii) set up a work group to
prepare written operational directives, introduce a system of project appraisal,
to set up a project filing system, to standardize and streamline procedures for
project approval, and to establish a methodology for funds withdrawal from Bank
loan accoAnts; (iv) appoint or designate an officer in each BB to coordinate Bank
subloan app.'cations; (v) set up a separate Division with eleven professionals
to supervise and monitor investments; and (vi) several other appointments, staff
reassignments and additional training.
19.         At the time, KBP was also being appraised as a participating bank
for the Seventh Industrial Credit Project (Ln. 2339/2340-YU). An internal review
of a report prepared by a Bank consultant on the subject noted that KBP
management would be overwhelmed by the comprehensiveness and magnitude of the
report's recommendations and at worst may reject them outright. Although the
review generally agreed with the report's recommendations, it noted that many
of the issues were related to the unique concepts under which the Yugoslav
financial system operated.
20.         Onlending Interest Rates.  The issue of KBP onlending interest rates
further complicated project processing shortly before negotiations. Inflation
accelerated to an annual rate of about 32X toward the end of 1982 and the IMF
recommended that the Government take strong policy measures including a sharp



increase in interest rates both on deposits and on lending. Also, the Bank was
trying to help resolve the issue of increasingly negative on-lending interest
rates during the preparation of its first Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2326-
YU). The Bank decided to proceed with the SAL and seek a "letter of intent" from
the Yugoslav Government confirming its intention to adjust interest rates for
onlending to the agricultural sector to a level which would be positive in real
terms.
21.         Negotiations. The project was negotiated in February 1983, wichout
the issues of poor KBP performance and increasingly negative onlending interest
rates having been resolved. The Agreed Minutes of project negotiations reflected
the two outstanding issues. They expressed general satisfaction with progress
in KBP reorganization, and it was agreed that further progress would be
extensively monitored under the proposed Industrial Credit VII. With respect
to onlending interest rates, the Kosovo delegation indicated that it would be
difficult for farmers to accept a nominal interest rate on Dinar loans of the
order of 18X and noted that it would have to obtain agreement of the Kosovo
Government. Unresolved, the onlending interest rate issue remained controversial
for most of the project implementation period (para 34-35). The appointment of
a development banking advisor was made a condition of Loan effectiveness. Also,
two other conditions of effectiveness were included: (i) the submission of a
Self-Management Agreement (SMA) specifying legal responsibilities of local
participating organiz;tions; and (ii) establishment of a Special Account.
E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Institutional Aspects of Proiect Implementation
22.         The Loan became effective on December 20, 1983 after a two month
delay of KBP in submitting the Self-Management Agreement (SMA) and appointing
the development banking advisor. As reported by the second supervision mission
even prior to project effectiveness in October/November 1983, the physical
progress of the project appeared to proceed as per the appraisal schedule,
especially with respect to rural roads, agri-service center and veterinary
station final designs and construction start-up. However, the final designs and
tendering for the Decane irrigation scheme were delayed further. The consultants
proposed to add a small hydro-electric station and an urban water supply
component to the subproject which increased the US$25 million total cost by US$
3.0 million.
23.         The  second  supervision  mission  also  reported  ':hat  expected
institutional developments had run into serious difficulties, which were to
adversely affect the project later as it progressed.   Dated covenants for
implementing several specific KBP, Kosovo Government, and FC institutional
improvements in the Loan and Project Agreements had not been met.   KBP was
overdue on its organizational improvement program and on hiring additional staff.
Kosovo Government was overdue on establishing a Media Strategy Committee needed
for implementation of the agricultural education programing component for radio
and television.   Feasibility studies on land consolidation schemes were also
overdue. FC was overdue on hiring of additional staff and on evaluation studies
on prices, subsidies and premiums affecting individual sector farmers.



-6-
24.         Weak institutions continued to cause serious implementation problems.
While the FC project management unit made a good start in the identification and
preparation of subprojects costing about US$32 million by 1984, KBP management
was slow in approving most subloan applications.   For example,  it delayed
approval of incremental fertilizer purchases until after the beginning of the
1984 spring planting season. Also, subloan commitments for the same purposes
as this loan continued under Ln. 1801-YU and Ln. 1993-YU, which delayed loans
to individual sector farmers under the project. Further, KBP specified overly
restrictive criteria on lending to individual sector farmers. In particular,
it required that subborrowers sell most of their livestock production (50% of
milk, 80% of meat) to the social sector at controlled prices as a condition of
subloan approval.
25.         The April 1985 supervision mission reiterated a number of unresolved
issues. KBP had not raised the onlending interest rate to the individual sector
farmers as required under the LA in conjunction with the May 6, 1983 Letter of
Development Policy (para 33). The prospects for the Decane irrigation scheme
had become uncertain.    The KBP  loan processing department  had not been
strengthened as agreed. As in 1984 again in 1985, KBP had delayed the approval
of fertilizer loan applications beyond the commencement of the spring planting
season. In light of the accumulating adverse experience, the Bank suggested that
part of the Loan be cancelled and agreed to search, for new ways to reorganize
KBP activities so that project implementation could improve.
26.         Restructuring of KBP Agricultural Credit Department (ACD).   The
review of KBP ACD operations focused primarily on measures needed for
streamlining and speeding-up of subloan applications for the individual sector,
to improve appraisal procedures, to improve supervision and monitoring, and
streamline processing of disbursement  applications.    Several  attempts  to
reorganize KBP under other Kosovo projects preceded this effort without success.
This was the second such exercise under this project (para 17). Other similar
attempts had been undertaken under the Industrial Credit VII Project.
27.         The main recommendations of a review carried out by a consultant
included: Mi) establishment of uniform procedures and methodology for appraisal
and supervision of all loans; (ii) increase of the number of staff; (iii)
realignment of functions and responsibilities in ACD and between ACD and other
KBP departments and Basic Banks; (iv) a number of steps aimed at speeding up
subloan processing, such as increasing approval limit3 and more regular meetings
of the Executive Board and the Credit Board of KBP; and (v) management
improvements and training.
28.         Results  of  KBP  ACD  Reorganization.    Although  KBP  completed
reorganization of its ACD largely in line with these recommendations, the
reorganization came too late to have the desired impact on project
implementation. Moreover, to improve the performance of just one department in
2 bank facing numerous other difficulties could no, solve the overriding
problems.



29.         The reorganization resulted in minor improvemeiL.s in the streamlining
and speeding-up of subloan processing, subloan approval, supervision and
monitoring of subproject implementation, and monitoring cf performance after
subproject completion.   However,  duplication of effort between KBP and BB
continued for a number of reasons. For example, Yugoslav law did not permit BB
to directly approve loans from Federal Funds. Those had to be first approved
by KBP. If a limit of Dinar 15 million for approval by Basic Banks had been
permissible by law, the workload related to loan approval at KBP would bave
declined by about 30% and KBP staff would have been able to focLs more closely
on larger loans. Also, the review emphasized more training of KBP and BB staff
in  investment banking.    Although  operations  manuals  and  guidelines were
available, the vigor of their application had not been adequate, judged for
example from the two latest feasibility reports submitted to the Bank by KBP.
30.         Interest Rate Issue.    The accelerating inflation added to the
project implementation problems by aggravating the issue of KBP's increasingly
negative onlending interest rates. With the signing of the May 6, 1983 Letter
of Development Policy (LDP) of the Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2326-YU),
Yugoslav banks were to align their interest rates with the inflation rate over
a period of three to five years. Like most other Yugoslav banks, KBP did not
fully comply with the provisions of the LDP. However, the loan agreement of this
project had a provision which required KBP to adjust its lending rate on the
basis of the formula stipulated in the LDP. While KBP agreed with the general
principle of adjusting onlending interest rates to positive real levels over time
as specified in the LDP, it nevertheless felt that (i) credit provided through
the Federal Fund for Less Developed Regions (FLDR) was not subject to the LDP
interest rate provisions; and (ii) the interest rate on credit provided from Bank
funds should be determined by the Yugoslav Bankers' Association.
31.         Proiect Costs.    Actual project costs differ substantially from
appraisal estimates (Tables 3,4). The reasons include: (i) the lack o. detailed
engineering at appraisal; (ii) 2-3 year delays in subproject start-up in an
inflationary environment; (iii) Dinar devaluation of about 1,500% between 1981
and 1987; (iv) procurement delays; and (v) price increases between 1981 and 1987
which were five times greater than appraisal price contingencies. For some of
the reasons mentioned, the project was eventually implemented at a lower cost
than  originally  estimated.    Actual  project  costs  were  determined  from
disbursement applications and other documents in project files,  since the
Borrower failed to provide any details to determine the actual project cost.
32.         At appraisal,  the total project cost was estimated at US$144.8
million, with an estimated share of foreign exchange cost of about 48%.  Due to
the rapid devaluations, the vzlue of the local component denominated in US$ was
reduced below appraisal estimates though it had gone up in Dinar terms.
33.         Financing.  Disbursement and Procurement.        Actual financing is
entirely different from the appraisal financing plan (Table 5). Disbursements
lagged behind appraisal estimates and at the Closing Date only US$40.37 million
(51%) was disbursed including US$ 32.51 million for project works and US$7.86
million for interest payments and loan charges (Table 6). Actual disbursements
closely followed the Yugoslav disbursement profile. Procurement was executed
mainly through LCB procedures.



34.         While the Dinar depreciated against the US$ by about 990X since 1983
when the project became effective, wholesale prices increased by about 712X
during the same period.  The cost of the project foreign exchange component,
denominated in US$, decreased in relation to the local component cost.
Consequently, continued Bank financing of the project at the rates specified in
the Loan Agreement imposed increased financing requirements on KBP and in view
of its liquidity situation, contributed to substantial delays in the
implementation schedule.    In order to maintain the Bank's original share of
foreign exchange financing, the Bank agreed in May 1988 to raise its disbursement
percentage for amounts paid on account of local expenditures to 652.
35.         Compliance with Loan Covenants.  Most of the key Loan Covenants were
not complied with by KBP especially during the early years of project
implementation. KBP had been in default on a number of covenants including: (i)
onlending interest rates did not correspond at times to agreements reached with
the Bank; (ii) overdue audited financial statements; (iii) the performance of
the development banking adviser who had been ineffective and, as it turned out,
appears to have been appointed primarily to comply with a loan condition; (iv)
KBP had continued to submit incorrect disbursement forms; and (v) project
monitoring and evaluation requirements were not implemented. The quality of FC
annual progress reports and evaluation reports had been improving throughout
project implementation. Unfortunately, FC failed to submit a draft PCR, although
requested to do so during the last supervision mission and repeatedly reminded
since.
Physical Aspects of Project Implementation
36.         While  subprojects  to  small  farmers  and  some  infrastructure
investments had a good development impact, many infrastructure subprojects were
either cancelled or remain incomplete. The Decane irrigation scheme, the largest
single subproject with a total cost of US$25 million, was cancelled in March 1988
after eight years of preparation efforts since investors could not agree on their
respective shares of local financing in this multipurpose investment.   Also
cancelled was a technical assistance package, equipment and vehicles for the
Kosovo radio and television stations for improving agriculture education
programing. Finally, also cancelled were improvements to the Kosovo agriculture
extension service. Various Kosovo institutions spent considerable time arguing
about how to proceed but had been unable to agree to implement these components.
37.         Primary Production. The individual sector credit component continued
the support extended under the three Yugoslav agricultural credit projects and
overlapped with the Keaovo Agricultural Development Project (Ln.1993-YU), with
similar results. The conclusions of the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR)
for the Third Agricultural Credit Project (Ln. 1801-YU) are directly applicable
to this component. Some of the findings include: (i) shortage of counterpart
funds and investor capital despite the special agreement among implementing
agencies at the time of project preparation; (ii) difficulties in reaching
consensus on priorities; (iii) delays ca.;sed by the need to identify subprojects
and complete feasibility studies; (iv) significant differences between appraisal



- 9 -
projections and actual investments; and (v) need to reappraise some subprojects
due to cost overruns resulting from domestic inflation.
38.         Farmers who successfully completed the lengthy process of subloan
application and obtained KBP financing used the funds much as expected. About
3,700 mini-farms were financed under the project compared to the appraisal
estimate of 5,000, aimed at supporting labor intensive activities for increasing
production of meat, milk, fruit, grapes, honey and vegetables.   Also, they
included improved livestock (sheep, dairy, pigs, beef, bees), animal housing,
pasture improvement, orchards and vineyards establishment, tractors and farm
machinery. However, despite the low real interest rate (59Z in 1988 compared
with a rate of inflation of 2501), farmers' credit demand was restrained by
Government controlled prices (e.g. milk) and limited possibilities of direct
marketing.  The quality of mini-farm construction was satisfactory since work
was supervised by investors, who also contributed their own labor.
39.         Land Improvement and Land Consolidation Works. About 21,500 ha were
consolidated compared to about 35,000 ha expected at appraisal.  The Binacka
Morava Flood Control scheme, about 4,000 ha of pasture improvements in Draggiest
and 600 ha in Decane all were completed.
40.         Other Infrastructure Facilities.   About 660 km of rural roads were
completed, compared to the appraisal target of 700 km. Of the 40 approved agri-
service centers, 34 were completed. The centers have been a great success with
much higher turnover of inputs and outputs than expected at appraisal.   As
compared with 17 approved veterinary stations, the construction of only 12 was
completed. Unfortunately, most stations could not provide services due to the
lack of veterinary equipment. As compared with 11 approved green markets, five
were completed and are in operation.
F. PROJECT RESULTS
41.         The project was quite successful with respect to the investments
which were implemented.   However,  the Borrower failed to provide data to
determine the physical, financial and economic achievements of project
investments. The main problem was that project financing administered by KBP
had been out of control and most corrective actions were taken too late and/or
had little effect on implementation performance.
Agricultural ImRact
42.         The demand for fresh and processed agricultural produce declined as
a result of the worsening economic situation in the country.  Information on
incremental production and yields remains incomplete due to the wide range of
subprojects financed and the limitations of the monitoring and evaluation system.
Also, it is unclear how much of the incremental production is delivered to
agroindustries in Kosovo for further processing.   The appraisal estimates of
incremental production are summarized in Table 7.



- 10
Financial and Economic Impact
43.         Information needed to estimate financial and economic rates of return
is incomplete and PCR estimates of FRR and ERR are based on data from other
similar projects in Yugoslavia (Table 8). The appraisal economic rate of return
for the whole project was 23% and the economic and financial rates for various
components ranged from 12% to over 50%.  The actual FRR of most investors is
l1kely to be higher due to low interest rates relative to the high rate of
inflation (Table 8).
G. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
44.         Whether the project could sustain a positive level of economic
benefits in the environment that presently exists in Yugoslavia is open to
question. The future of most subprojects will depend on how government policies
and the Yugoslav economic situation evolve. Community development subprojects
(e.g. agri-service centers) could be sustainable provided suitable arrangements
are made for funding of their operations and management.
H. BANK PERFORMANCE
45.         While some of the investments under the project were justified and
successful, the project scope was overly ambitious, considering the lack of
experience with such projects in Yug-slavia and in Kosovo in particular.
46.         The Bank had underestimated the systemic distortions of the Yugoslav
economy. Although the severe deterioration of the macroeconomic situation could
not have been anticipated fully at appraisal, the Bank should have been more
effective in analyzing the experience of its earlier involvement in Kosovo and
elsewhere in Yugoslavia and drawn clearer implications for the design of the
project.
47.         The Bank's general acquiescence in Yugoslav agricultural development
policy which relied on subsidized credit diminished the project's chance of
success.  The Bank kept pointing to the need for positive onlending interest
rates from the mid 1970s. While the Bank initiated two interest rate studies
(1976, 1980) stipulating that their results would be applied under ongoing
projects, lending to subprojects at increasingly negative real rates continued
in an environment of accelerating inflation. Agreement on the issue with the
Federal Government was reached only in May 1983 and with KBP more than two years
later.
48.         Important substantive issues such as interest rate policy need to
be resolved by upfront action in a country macroeconomic dialogue even at the
cost of lending deferral or suspension. A postponement of such issues not only
affects project implementation and the achievement of policy objectives in the
long run, but it may also undermine the Bank position in subsequent operations
and phases of policy dialogue.
49.         Local counterpart funds is one substantive issue that received little
attention  and  remained misunderstood.    While  the  loss-making  Agrokosovo



- 11 -
enterprises consumed more than 60% of FLDR (the source of counterpart funds),
farmers had to wait for months and in many cases for over a year for approval
of their subloan applications. The main function of Agrokosovo is to arrange
cooperation among its member enterprises by formal and informal agreements of
protectionist character. Agrokosovo was also the principal reason for permanent
shortage of local funds since it had a priority claim through the KBP board on
the FLDR.
50.         About 300 Bank staff weeks were spent on the project, of which 50%
was spent on preparation/preappraisal, 20% on appraisal, 6% on negotiations, and
24X on supervision (Table 9). It is not clear from project documents why and
how so much of Bank time was used to prepare and appraise the project. Some of
this time might have been used to analyze earlier experience, draw conclusions,
and identify conditionality for subsequent involvement (e.g. interest rate, price
policy, need for detailed engineering designs prior to appraisal, etc.), but
whether this  took place  is not clear froL the written record.    Project
supervision initially focused mainly on institutional issues related to KBP and
FC. Most difficulties known throughout project preparation continued to develop
into ever more serious problems. Moreover, most corrective actions came either
too late or were too weak to have the desired impact.
I. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
51.         KBP performance  deteriorated under the project reflecting  the
weaknesses of the Yugoslav banking system and the distorted macroeconomic
environment.   Although KBP, like other Yugoslav banks, carries out banking
functions with considerable autonomy, its decisions are strongly influenced by
the social sector organizations which are in effect both its owners and major
borrowers. Moreover, about 90% of all government funds for economic development
(e.g. the Federal Fund for Less Developed Regions) were channelled through KBP,
giving an advantage to its major borrowers in obtaining subsidized credit.
These and other weaknesses of the Yugoslav banking system are now being
recognized and addressed as part of the overall economic and financial reform.
52.         The reorganization of the KBP ACD came too late to affect project
implementation.    Various  organizational  improvements  designed  to  improve
implementation did not prove sufficiently effective and deficiencies identified
under earlier projects and recognized at appraisal were not eliminated in the
course of project implementation.
53.         Although the performance of FC helped considerably  in project
implementation, it could not overcome the deteriorating performance of KBP. In
particular, KBP favored the social sector in the allocation of heavily subsidized
counterpart funds.   Although KBP and FC requested extension of the project
Closing Date by a year, they were unable to comply with some critical loan
covenants (e.g. onlending interest rates) and ensure availability of local funds.
Moreover, KBP could not be expected to disburse the remaining US$20 million of
the loan, given the deteriorating macroeconomic situation in Yugoslavia.
Therefore, the Bank decided to close the loan as scheduled on March 31, 1989.



. 12 _
J. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
54.         As already mentioned, the SAR and the Loan Agreement followed the
standards of other Yugoslav agricultural projects. Because of numerous changes
during project implementation, the velue of the SAR for project implementation
was limited.
55.         Most project correspondence between the Bank and KBP deals with
institutional issues,  in particular poor KBP performance.   Data on project
monitoring and evaluation are very limited.   However,  FC progress reports
improved toward the end of project implementation and were becoming useful for
project monitoring.

AGROKOSOVQ
An umbrella AIK for all 18 agrokombinats ln Kosovo. In thls case,
Agrokosovo is a COAL comprised of 18 VOs (the 18 smaller agrokomblnats), 101
BOALs, 75 B,:SC COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATIONS, an Agro Commerce UO, and the
research WO, IED.
Central OrganizatLon of AIK comprLses of (i) Management Board, which
performs the functions of a general manager for AIK; (LL) a VO for common
services to summarize the plans, accounts and business results of AIK.
undertake financial and economic analysLs of AIK's business, and provide
expert advice to BOALs and WOs; (ilL) a WO to dLsseminate information about
AIK's activities; (iv) a VO for research and scientific activities; and (v) an
Internal Bank to assist the BOALs in finding financial resources to the
capital market and to handle transfer of surplus resources with AIPI from one
BOAL to another. The expenses of the central organization are met by
contributions from BOALs.
ASSOCIATED AGRICULTMRALIST
Any INDIVIDUAL SECTOR farmer that has agreed (through a Self-management
agreement) to cooperate ln some manner with the social sector. ThLs includes
membership in ZADRUCAs, long-term production contracts for sale of crops and
livestock to the social sector, and simLlar short-term, ajreements that are
arranged annually.
ASSOCIATION OF LABOR
A Yugoslav term used in tvo overlapping meanings: as a broad, generic
term synonymous with SELF-MANAGEMENT socialism, ln a narrow sense to
characterLze the relations of workers vithin a BOAL.



- 26 -
ANNEXC I
Page 2 of 4
BASIC COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATION (BCO)
The basic production unit vithin large Commune-sized ZADRUGAs A "sub-
cooperative" the BCO is organized on the same principle as the parent
organization: BCOs' delegates represent the organization in Assemblies of the
ZADRUGAS and also in the FEDERATION OF COOPERATIVES.
BASIC ORGANIZATION OF ASSOCIATED LABOR (BOAL)
The BOAL is the basic unit in which the ASSOCIATION OF LABOR takes
place. The locus of all economic decisionmaking. the BOAL. is an autonomous
legal entity having its own income statement and balance sheet. Within an
ENTERPRISE the BOAL is the smallest distinguishable technological entity
producing a marketed or marketable output.
CHAMBER OF THE ECONOMY
All associations of a province, republic, or the federation constitute a
chamber of the economy. It is not only a consultative body; it also has
certain quasi-legislative functions, insofar as it prepare and signs SOCIAL
COMfACTS WITH SOCIOPOLITICAL COMMUNITIES and trade union on behalf of
consenting members (ENTERPRISES).
COMMUNAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE (See PROJECT COORDINATING COMMITTEE)
The basic unit of deeisionmaking in the sociopolitical sphere; its
counterpart in the economic sphere is the BOAL.
CONPOSITE ORGANIZATION OF ASSOCIATED LABOR (COAL)
Sometimes called a Complex Organization of Associated LAbor. The
Yugoslav term for an organization in which several ENTERPRISES have agreed to
collaborate in accord vith a SELF-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. The agreement
generally covers the POOLING OF LABOR AND/OR RESOURCES. An ENTERPRISE can be
a member of several COALs.
COOPEUAN
An INDIVIDUAL SECTOR farmer who chooses to enter into a production
agreement with the social sector on a per annum basis.
DlECNIZRLIZATION
Under the prevailing Yugoslav usage, the term applies to the process of
rearranging political and general economic decisionmaking pover to the lowest
level of SOCIOPOLITICAL COMMUNITY in vhich such decisions can reasonably be
made. The term is also used in a broader sense that encompasses destatization
and is close to the use of the term comon in other socialist countries.

Page 3 of 4
DKLEGATE SYSTEM
The Yugoslav term to denote the particular form of citizen or vorker
participation under SELF-MANAGEMENT.  Delegates ara elected at the level the
smallest unit vithln a COMMUNE or BOAL and in turn elect delegates at the nezt
broader level, and so on.  Delegates have strictly limited terms.  They do not
give up thelr prior status as vorkers; they must sollcit the views of their
constituency on any important issues on which they vill vote; they can be
recalled at any time if the constLtuency decides that lts views or interests
are not being adequately represented.
ENTERPRISE
The direct translation from Serbo-Croatian would be "work organization"
(WO). Most enterprises comprise several BOAL as their prinLciple units; an
enterprise is constituted by a SELF-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT betvean BOAL. The
stronger and more permanent identity of BOALs is evidenced by the right of
BOALs to separate from the enterprise under certain conditions and either
constitute themselves as individual enterprises or join another one.
FEDERATION OF COOP TIVES (FC)
The Federation of Cooperatives in Kosovo is comprlsed of representatives
from 83 cooperatives (Zadrugas), BOALs, and BCOs. (Approximately 30 of the
BOALs re also members of Agrokosova.) A coordinating and planning
organization for these agricultural organizations, the FC has decisionmaking
power on matters crucial to the sector as a whole, FC's main role is to
promote the association of agriculturalists and, through the BCOs, INDIVIDUAL
SECTOR development. The PC is governed by a general assembly comprised of two
delegates from each BCO, BOAL, and Cooperative. The Presidency of the
assembly (which consists of a President and Secretary) is nominated by the
Provincial Government.
NZTN
The Yugoslav term for the process of compromise that is undertaken to
coordinate and achieve consensus on all economic and sociopolitical plans.
INSTITUTE OF ECONOMICe DEVELOPMENT (IED1
A V0 within Agrokosova whose function is ptimarily research, analysis
and planning. Recently, IED has been given responsibilLty for the preparation
of reglonal agricultural development projects within Kosovo.
INDIVIDUAL SECTOR
Agriculture in Yugoslavia is characterized by the parallel existance of
two sectors: the social and individual. The social sector is comprised of
AGROKONBINATS, ZADRUGAS, and other organliatLons such as veterinary and
research stations whLch operate under principles of social ownership of means

ANNEX I
Page 4 of 4
of production. The individual sector refers to the large, private sector that
domlnates prLmary productlon agriculture in Yugoslavia. The indLvidual sector
owns 84X of all arable land in Yugoslavia, but accounts for only 72X of total
agricultural production. Individual sector farms average 2-4 ha. and are
usually fragmented into 7-10 tiny plots. Fragmentation and small farm size
coupled with low, stagnant productivity and employment opportunities have
contributed to making the individual sector the major determinant of overall
low productivity ln Yugoslavia's agricultural sector.
ORgANIZATION OF ASSOCIATED LAOR (OAL)
The Yugoslav generic term for all legal entities that function by the
Association of Labor. This includes such entities as BOALs, ENTERPRISES, and
COALs.
POOLING OF TABOR A   RESOURCES
FinancLal links between BOALs and ENTERPRISES are established by SELF-
MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS on the pooling of resources. Such agreements regulate
the conditions under vhich one organizatLon temporarily makes financial
resources available to another. The arrangement can be a traditional medium-
term or long-term credLt arrangement. It more frequently and increasingly
implies the sharing of lncome and risk under joint pooling.
PRIORITY ACTIVITY
An economic activity singled out in the SOCIAL PLAN of a SOCIOPOLITICAL
COXMUNITY as being of special importance. Through SOCIAL COMPACTS, priority
activities have a higher degree of coordination and stronger commitments for
implementation in the planning of affected ENTERPRISES than nonpriority
activities. They also have the first claim to resources in the financing of
investment programs and projects.
