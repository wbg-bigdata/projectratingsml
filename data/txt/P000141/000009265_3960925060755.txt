PREFACE
Mi)      Loan 1941-BT for Botswana's Fifth Road Project of US$17.0
million was signed on February 6, 1981 and was made effective on May 4,
1981. The Loan was closed October 1, 1984 and the last disbursement was
made in April 1985, six months after the closing date specifitd in the Loan
Agreement. A total of US$12.4 million was disbursed under the Loan and the
undisbursed balance of US$4.6 million was cancelled.
(ii)     The Bank participated in Botswana's 1979-1985 National
Development Plan for Roads by financing: (i) Construction to bituminous
paved standard of the Dumela-Zimbabwe border road (76 km); the Selebi
Phikwe-Sefophe road (25 km); and the access road to the Selebi Phikwe
airport (7 km); (ii) Spot improvement to the Sefophe - Tsetsebjwe road
(56 km) and Sefophe - Dikabeya road (93 km);  (iii) Construction of the
soils and materials laboratory building in Gaborone and nine
centralldistrict road maintenance depots; and (iv) Consulting services
for: construction supervision of roads in (i) and (ii) above; preparation
of a pavement strengthening programi study of road design standards;
technical assistance to the Road Department (RD) and Road Training Center
(RTC).
(iii)    The Bank, since 1964 (Credit 63-BEC) has provided US$51.9
million for projects in the road sector for construction to bitumen paved
standard of mair. roads; selective betterment/spot improvement of minor
roads; construction of road maintenance facilities; purchase of road
maintenance and laboratory equipment; preparation of the district road
maintenance program; preparation of a feeder roads program; improvement and
expansion of road maintenance organization; and strengthening of RD and
RTC.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIFTH ROAD PROJECT
(LOAN 1941-BT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Bank has participated in Botswana's road subsector since 1964
when the First Road Project, Credit 63-BEC (US$3.6 million) was provided.
Since then, a total of rive loans/credits have been provided totalling US$51.9
million, including the Shashe Infrastructure Project, Loan 776-BT (US$3.5
million for roads). All five road projects were closed at the time of this
PCR preparation. The on-going Selebi Phikwe Technical Assistance Project
includes funds for detailed engineering design for a road linking Sefophe to
the South African border and feeder roads for agricultural development in the
Tuli Block area (para. 1.04).
Consistent with the long-standing Government objectives in the road
sector, the Fifth Five-Year (1979-1985) National Development Plan (NDP) had as
its goalst t.he completion to an all-weather paved standard of the North-South
road which links Botswana with its two trading border countries and to
increase the paved road network by 520 kw. by 1985; the establishment of more
effective maintenance organization, facilities and management systems; and the
development of a local construction industry (para. 1.05).
Objectives
The Fifth Road Project's objectives were to support specific goals
of the NDP by financing:
(a) the completion to paved standard of an extension of the North-South
road to link with Zimbabwe;
(b) improved road access in arable portions of the Tuli Block and
adjacent areas; and
(c) strengthening the Roads Department (RD) by financing construction of
facilities for the soils and materials testing laboratory and road
maintenance depots and by providing a variety of consulting services
for RD and instructors for the Road Training Center (RTC) (para.
1.06).
Tna project thus included funds for construction of civil works
comprising roads and buildings and for consultant services for construction
supervision of roads and buildings; preparation of a pavement strengthening



(v)
program and training of Roads Department (RD) staff in pavement evaluation;
study of appropriate design standards for Botswana; and technical assistance
for RD and Roads Training Center (RTC) (paras. 2.06-2.12).
Implementation Exoerience
Road works were started and completed within the implementation
schedule estimated at appraisal, while some delays occurred in the completion
of building works. The quality of work was generally good. The performance
of the consultants was good (paras. 3.02-3.12).
The actual costs of the project in US dollars were significantly
less than appraisal estimates while actual costs in Pula were close to the
appraisal estimates. This resulted in a savings of US$4.6 million (27% of the
loan amount) which was cancelled (paras. 3.13-3.14).
Results
The roads which had marginal benefits at appraisal now show higher
benefits probably due to low estimates from the feasibility studies (e.g., for
Dumela-Zimbabwe border roae 11% ERR at appraisal compared to a 26% ERR of the
economic reevaluation), except for the Selebi Phikwe Airport access road (7
km) where the reevaluated ERR was only 5% because of low actual traffic (-43%
compared with SAR) and a high construction cost (+70% compared with SAR)
(paras. 5.01-5.14).
8ustainability
The roads improved under the project are likely to be maintained at
adequate levels even though additional efforts will be required to provide
skilled maintenance personnel to fully benefit from the investment made (para.
4.02). In addition, axle load limits are fully enforced (para. 6.02). Under
the circumstances the road investments under the project are likely to achieve
more than the average level of sustainability.
Findings and Lessons
An important lesson to be learned from the project is the need for
an adequate advance study of the priorities in the sector prior to appraising
a project. This is evident from the major improvements made in the project
composition at appraisal as compared to project preparation (para. 6.01).
The project included construction of axle-load control stations and
the Loan Agreement provided a covenant requiring enforcement of axle-load
control. Here it is important to note that the weigh stations were completed
on time and axle-load control was fully enforced, which is a rare event in
developing countries. An assessment of Botswana's success in enforcement of
axle-loads would no doubt provide valuable experience for the Bank in assist-
ing other countries to succeed in their effort to enforce axle-load control
(para. 6.02).

FIFTH ROAD PROJECT
LOAN 1941-BT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The transport sector of the Republic of Botswana is served by a
6,900 km gazetted road network; 718 km of railway line; one international
airport, 3 small domestic airports and several small airstrips; and a ferry
operating across the Zambesi River between Botswana and Zambia. The
eastern half of the country, which is more populated and developed than the
rest of the country, is well served by a developed road system and the
718 km railway line linking Botswana with the Republic of South Africa and
Zimbabwe. The western half of the country, which is sparsely populated and
has less potential for development, depends for the most part on earth and
sand tracks and several scattered small air strips. The o,900 km gazetted
road network (430 km paved at independence in 1966) is composed of 1,042 km
of bitumen paved; 1,563 km gravel and 4,295 km earth/sand surfaced tracks.
1.02     The Bank has prticipated in Botswana's road subsector since 1964
when the First Road Project, Credit 63-BEC (US$3.6 million) was provided.
Since then, a total of five Loan/Credits have been provided totalling
US$51.9 million, including the Shashe Infrastructure Project, Loan 776-BT
(US$3.5 million for roads). All five road projects were closed at the time
of this PCR preparation. The on-going Selebi Phikwe Technical Assistance
Project includes funds for detailed engineering design for a road linking
Sefophe to the South African border and feeder roads for agricultural
development in the Tuli Block area.
1.03     Since the Fifth Road Project became effective, the Ministry of
Works and Communication, to which the Roads Department directly reports,
was reorganized (in December 1986) to become the Ministry of Works,
Transport and Communications. The reorganization which now pools together
ander one ministry all the transport modes could have the advantage of
providing a better coerdination for developing an integrated inter-modal
planning and prograwming for the transport sector.
1.04     Since independence in 1966 the emphasis of the National
Development Plans (NDP) in the road sector has been consistent:
(i)      to reduce the high costs of transport in Botswana resulting
from low density of population and the country's landlocked
position in part by developing viable international transport
systems;



-2-
(ii)     to maximize the benefits from providing transport
infrastructure, taking social as well as economic goals into
account, and
(iii)    to reduce, as far as feasible, the vulnerability of the
transport system and hence the economy as a whole, to events
beyond the control of the country.
1.05     Consistent with the long-standing Government objectives in the
road sector, the Fifth Five-Year (1979-1985) National Development Plan
(NDP) had as its goals: the completion to an all-weather paved standard of
the North-South road which links Botswana with its two trading border
countries and to increase the paved road network by 520 km by 1985; the
establishment of more effective maintenance organization, facilities and
management systems; and the development of a local construction industry.
1.06     The Fifth Road Project's objectives were to support specific goals
of the NDP by financing:
(a) the completion to paved standard of an extension of the
North-South road to link with Zimbabwe;
(b) improved road access in arable portions of the Tuli Block and
adjacent areas; and
(c) strengthening the Roads Department (RD) by financing
construction of facilities for the soils and materials
testing laboratory and road maintenance depots and by
providing a variety of consulting services for RD and
instructors for the Road Training Center (RTC).
1.07     The NDP received in addition to support from the World Bank
assistance of about US$30 million from: the European Economic Community
(EEC), the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Germany's
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW), the African Development Bank (AfDB),
the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), the Norwegian Agency
for Development (NORAD) and the Danish International Development Agency
(DANIDA).

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Identification and Preparation
2.01     The Fifth Road Project of Botswana was first discussed in
September 1978 during the Bank's annual meeting. In this meeting the
Botswana delegation explained that Government's priorities for the road
subsector would be specified in the Fifth Five Year (1979-1985) National
Development Plan (NDP) expected to be published in mid-1979. Possible
project components raised by Government officials included the Tuli Block
area roads whose feasibility studies and detailed engineering were financed
under the Third and Fourth Road Projects and the Francistown-Orapa road
which had suffered from rapidly growing traffic levels.
2.02     A Bank mission in September 1979 identified the project components
based on the NDP which at that time was in final review stage. Except for
the Nata-Maung road (306 km), feasibility and/or detailed engineering for
the roads proposed for inclusion in the project were financed under the
Third and Fourth Road Projects.  The preparation mission recommended the
following components for inclusion in the Fifth Road Project.
(a) Civil Works:  (i)  the construction to paved standard of the
Dumels-Ramokgwebana (65 km) scJction of the Dumela-Zimbabwe
Border Road; the Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe (23 km) and Palapye
jct. - Moeng (42 km) roads in the Tuli Block area; and (ii)
Spot improvements of gra;vel/sand surfaced roads of about. 450
km in the Tuli Block area; and
(b) Consultant services for: (i) construction supervision of
(al above; (ii) detailed engineering of the Nata-Maung road
(306 km); and (iii) assistance to implement i Roads
Department training program.
2.03     The Dumela-Ramokgwebana road (65 km), the Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe
road (23 km) and the Palapye jct. - Moeng road (42 km) had ERRs ranging
from 8.5% to 12.3%. The 450 km roads proposed for spot improvement had
high ERR's ranging from 152 to 65%. While Government's proposal was for
inclusion of the entire 76 km of Dumela-Zimbabwe border road, the mission
recommended that the last 11 km to the border be left out because of its
low ERR (about 22). The low ERR for this section was mainly due to
restriction of traffic to eross the border because of the political
situation and security problems which existed at that time.
B. Appraisal
2.04     The Project was appraised in June 1980 as agreed upon during the
project preparation mission and the appraisal report was completed in
November 1980. The composition of the Project included subproject
components which vary significantly from those proposed during project
preparation (Para. 2.02). Because of additional information and data
obtair.ed, it was possible at appraisal to define better the composition of
the project. The project consisted of the following components:



-4-
(a)  Construction to bituminous paved standards;   (i)  Dumela -
Zimbabwe border road (76 km); (ii) Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe
road (25 km) and a 7 km access road to the Selebi Phikwe
Airport serving the Tuli Block area;
(b)  Spot improvement of the Sefophe - Tsetsebjwe (56 km) and
Dikabeya-Sefophe (93 km) roads in the Tuli Block and adjacent
areas;
(c} Construction of RD's soils and materials laboratory building
and nine road maintenance depots;
(d)  Consultant services for:   (i)  Construction supervision of
(a), (b) and (c) above; (ii) Preparation of a pavement
strengthening program for about 80 km of main roads and
training of RD staff in pavement evaluation; (iii)
Determination of appropriate road design standards for
Botswana and preparation of an RD design manual; (iv)
Technical assistance to RD; and
(e) The recruitment of two instructors for strengthening the Road
Training Center (RTC) training staff.
2.05     The underlining reasons for the changes made at appraisal in
project composition compared to that at project preparation are briefly
discussed in the following paragraphs (Paras. 2.06 to 2.12)
(a) Construction of Roads to Bituminous Paved Standards
Dumela-7imbabwe Border Road
2.06     At the time of the project preparation missions (September and
December 1979) the last 11 km section of the Dumela-Zimbabwe border road
(76 km) was not found to be justified (Para. 2.03) because of the low
traffic counts (16 vpd) and the resultant low ERR of 22. However, at
appraisal time, ten months later, the traffic restriction at the border
being lifted, following Zimbabwe's independence, traffic on this section
had increased from 16 vpd to 75 vpd. Moreover, the traffic was forecasted
to increase to 115 vpd by 1983, the time when the construction of the road
t.z paved standard would be completed. Based on the new traffic forecast,
the ERR of the last 11 km increased from 2% prior to September 1979 to 7%
at appraisal time in June 1980 giving an average ERR of 11% for the total
76 km to the Zimbabwe border. Thus the full 76 km length of the road to
Zimbabwe border was included for financing under the project.
Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe Road & 7 km Access Road to Selebi Phikwe Airport
2.07     The Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe road was identified to be 23 km in
length at project preparation time. At appraisal the length was found to
be 25 km and a new component of a 7 km access road to the newly completed
Selebi Phikwe Airport was added. The Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe road (25 km)
had an ERR of 17% and the 7 km access road to the Airport had an ERR of
22%. The above ERRs were to construct these roads to a 6.Om wide pavement



with a single bituminous surface dressing and a structural strength for a
maximum of 8.2 tons single axle-load usi.ng South Africa TRH 4 design
method.
Palapye jct. - Moeng Road
2.08     The Palapye tct. - Moeng (42 km) road identified for financing
during project preparation in September 1979 was left out from the project
at appraisal due to higher priority subprojects and because of its marginal
ERR.
(b) Spot Improvement
2.09     The spot improvement subproject proposed for inclusion under the
project during project preparation was curtailed at appraisal due to higher
priority subprojects and because of a low ERR. The roads included were
Sefophe-Tsetsebjwe (56 km) and the Dikabeya-Sefophe (93 km).  These two
roads had estimated ERRs of 23% and 56% respectively. The high benefits
for these roads were mainly due to the low level of spot improvements
recommended for these roads which were estimated to cost about US$7,000
per km.  The works to be carried out were limited to improveient of
drainage, shaping and grading and the provision of minor structures at the
most seriously affected sections to enable trucks to pass during all but
the heaviest rains.
(c) Construction of Buildings
Road Department's Soils and Materials Testing Laboratory
2.10     The construction of a soils and materials testing laboratory
building not discussed during project preparation was justified because the
existing laboratory space, housed at the Meteorology Department, was
inadequate. Furthermore, the RD had to expand its soils and materials
testing activities to accommodate the need to test bituminous material and
to identify additional sources of road materials required for the spot
improvement program planned for the road network. Moreover, construction
of a new soils and materials laboratory building adjacent to the RD's
training center was considered appropri>e since it would have the
advantage of using the facilities for training of RD's staff in road
material testing. Therefore, the financing of the construction of an
independent soils and materials testing laboratory was considered to have a
major impact on institution building in the roads subsector. Through this
provision RD would be able to carry out required material tests
departmentally thereby reducing the high cost of having such tests carried
out by consulting firms as was the case in the past.



-6-
Road Maintenance Depots
2.11     Even though there was no provision made during project preparation
it was found essential at appraisal to provide funds for construction and
enlargement of nine central/district road maintenance depots to serve RD's
needs for equipment maintenance and repair and for storage of spare parts
and road maintenance materials and tools. Since independence in 1966,
Botswana's road network had expanded from about 430 km to about 6,900 km
thereby necessitating central/district road maintenance depots. A USAID
financed highway maintenance study had also recommended the need of
providing adequate road maintenance depots.
(d)      Consultant Services
2.12     The other two components added during appraisal were the pavement
strengthening program and the preparation of a manual for road design
standards applicable for Botswana. The pavement strengthening program was
to assist the RD in carrying out a road condition survey on existing roads
(about 80 km) constructed to paved standard soon after independence which
had started showing deterioration. Carrying out of pavement condition
investigations before these roads showed serious deterioration was
technically justified to avoid high reconstruction costs if these roads
were left unattended. The preparation of the manual for road design
standards was necessitated by the Goverment's concern about the variety of
design standards recommended by consultants employed for detailed
engineering of roads. In particular, South African and UK pavement design
methods were indifferently selected, without due regard to their
comparative merits in Botswana.



III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.01     The project was approved by the Board on January 6, 1981, was
signed on February 6, 1981 and became effective on May 4, 1981. There were
no special conditions for Loan effectiveness.
A. Implementation
Dumela-Zimbabwe Border Road (76 km)
3.02     The contract for construction of the Dumela-Zimbabwe border road
was awarded in October 1981, five months after Loan effectiveness and the
work was completed at end of November 1983 as compared to the contractual
completion date of October 22, 1983. The contract was awarded on the basis
of International Competitive Bidding (ICB' in accordance with Bank
guidelines; bids were received from nine prequalified firms and the
contract awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder. The time taken from the
daze of Loan effectiveness to contract award and from contract award to
completion of works is considered efficient by any standard and the quality
of finished work was good.
3.03     Variation orders for civil works amounting to Pula 1.9 million
were issued during the construction period. This amount was to cover costs
of additional works carried out on junctions leading to villages, cattle
grids, access roads and gates to telecommunications repeater stations, a
short realignment of the route, construction of an approach road to the
Tati River Bridge and construction of a short section of dual carriageway
and additional surface area for a weigh-bridge station at Ramokgwebana
(Zimbabwe border). The additional works were fully justified.
3.04     The actual construction cost for this road was Pula 12.6 mi:lion
(Table 1) including Pula 1.9 million for variation orders and Pula 1.3
million for payment of claims.
Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe Road (25 km) and 7 km Access Road
to Selebi Phikwe Airport
3.05     The contract for the construction of the two roads was awarded in
September 1981, four months after the date of effectiveness and
construction work was completed in March 1983, three months after th6
contractual completion date of December 1983. The contract was awarded on
the basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with
Bank guidelines; bids were received from five prequalified firms and the
contract was awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder. During the
construction period variation orders were issued to carry out: surfacing
of an access road to the Independence road; short realignment of the route
and removal of black cotton soil over and above what was originally
envisaged. The contractor was given a three-month time extension to
compensate time required for the additional works. Both the time elapsed
from the date of Loan effectiveness to contract award and time taken to
complete the construction is considered efficient.



-8-
3.06     The actual construction cost for the two roads work was Pula 4.01
million (Table 1) including Pula 0.2 million for variation orders for civil
works. There was no claim by the contractor on this contract.
Spot Improvement (149 km)
3.07     The contracts for spot improvement of the two roads were tendered
together with the Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe road and were awarded to the same
contractor for completion within the same contract period. The actual spot
improvement cost was Pula 0.68 million as compared to Pula 0.45 million
estimated at appraisal. The quantities for the spot improvement works were
estimated on experience because quantity estimates using detailed
engineering were not warranted for this type of spot improvement. Thus
unit rates quoted for work activities were the contractual commitments for
this work rather than unit rates for spec0fied quantities.
Soils and Materials TestinR Laboratory Building and Road
Maintenance Depots
3.08     The project provided for the construction of a new soils and
materials laboratory for RD as well as for the construction of one new road
maintenance central depot, one new road maintenance district depot and the
extension of seven existing road maintenance depots. Consultants for the
detailed engineering, preparation of bidding documents and construction
supervision for these components were employed in September 1982, fifteen
months after the date of Loan effectiveness. The prolonged delay in the
start of these components was mainly because there was no advance
preparatory work undertaken prior to appraisal as had been the case for the
road components. Secondly, RD was understaffed and the road components
were given priority. Tenders for the works were received in June 1983.
With the exception of the road maintenance depots in Francistown and Nata,
all contracts were awarded in July 1983. The Francistown road maintenance
depot had to be retendered in December 1983, since only one bid was
received which was much higher than the Government estimate. The work for
the Nata road maintenance depot involved only a loading ramp, and the RD
made arrangements to have the work carried out by force account and the
work was financed by the Government.
Consultant Services
3.09     Consultants were employed for construction supervision of the
Dumela-Zimbabwe Border road, and the Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe road and the
7 km access road to Selebi Phikwe airport. For the Dumela-Zimbabwe border
road three firms submitted proposals and contract was awarded to the lowest
evaluated bidder on October 9, 1981. For the Selebi Paikwe-Sefophe and the
7 km access to the airport roads, five proposals were received and the
contract was awarded to the lowest evaluated firm (joint venture of two
firms) on August 12, 1981.
3.10     A consultant for the preparation of a pavement strengthening
program was selected from proposals received from five firms based on the
evaluation of technical proposals. The contract was awarded in December
1981 and work was completed in October 1983. About 470 km of paved roads
were tested and analyzed and in the final result only 5 km of roads were
recommended for strengthening.



- 9 -
3.11     For the study of Design Standards for Botswana, six proposals were
received and a consortium of four firms was selected And a contract signed
on September 3, 1981. Government subsequently requested, and the Bank
agreed that the consultants also study and revise as necessary the Ministry
of Works' specifications for earthworks with special emphasis on the
unstable calerete soils frequently encountered in Botswana.
3.12     While the above consultant services were financed under the
project, the TA for the RD and RTC was financed by Government. Overall,
the performance of consultants was of good professional standard.
B.  The Prolect Cost
3.13     The comparison between appraisal estimate and the final cost for
the project is shown in Table 1. The total expenditure under the project
amounted to Pula 19.42 million. In US dollars total expenditure was
US$17.85 million which is 28% less than the appraisal estimate. This is
due to changes in the exchange rate between the Pula and US dollar. The
exchange rate used at appraisal was one US$ equivalent to Pula 0.78 while
the average exchange rate over the implementation period was one US$
equivalent to Pula 1.233. Moreover, for road construction works, monthly
certificate payments were composed of 40% in Pula, 45% in South African
RAND and 15% in pounds Sterling at a fixed exchange rate of one pula
equivalent to 1.002 RAND and one Pula equivalent to 0.566 Sterling Pound.
3.14     Disbursements under the project were US$12.4 million which
represents 73% of funds available under the project. The last disbursement
was made in April 1985, six months after the project closing cate of
October 1. 1984. The undisbursed balance of US$4.6 million was cancelled.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01     The project included a component for the construction of a soils
and materials testing laboratory to strengthen RD's institutional
capability to meet its increasing needs to test bituminous materials and
additional sources for road-making materials required for the spot
improvement program planned for the entire gravel/sand surface road network
and for paved road shoulder maintenance. The RD now has adequate and well
laid out laboratory space and sufficient laboratory equipment to carry out
departmentally most of the testing needed. The Transport and Road Research
Laboratory (TRRL) of UK has been closely associated with RD's laboratory
and RD staff have benefited significantly. However, because of shortages
of local staff RD does not seem to have sufficiently benefited from the
transfer of knowledge. For the benefits to accrue from the investments
made for the construction of the laboratory building and purchase of
laboratory equipment, it would be very important for RD to train more
laboratory technicians using its well established training center.
Provided efforts are made to adequately staff the new laboratory the RD
should be able to carry out most of the soils and materials testing
required for road work as well as to assist other sectors such as those in
the building area.
4.02     The construction and/or enlargement of the eight road maintenance
depots financed under the project helped strengthen RD's institutional
capability. These facilities provided adequate working space for servicing
and repair of road maintenance equipment and storage spaces for spare parts
and road maintenance materials and tools. Road maintenance units are now
close to work sites thus avoiding long distance crew mobilization costs as
well as reducing daily travel time to work sites. However, the RD has to
make additional effort to provide the required number of skilled
maintenance personnel to fully benefit from the investment made.
4.03     The consultants engaged for the study of an appropriate design
standards manual completed the work in September 1983. The availability of
design standards applicable to Botswana's needs aided design works both by
consultants and departmental staff. It also helped to reduce the decision
making process on technical issues as well as enabling the standardization
of construction methods. The manual also served as a source document for
training road construction and maintenance supervisory staff.
4.04     The Loan covenants were met by the Government.  Axle-load weigh
stations were constructed and axle-load control was fully enforced. A high
level of performance was achieved in road maintenance and budgetary
allocations have been sufficient. Due to shortage of staff, the RD was not
able to prepare the project completion report as specified in the Loan
Agreement.

V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
Objectives
5.01 The appraisal report (SAR) states that "the project's objectives are
to support specific goals of Botswana's National Development Plan for 1979-
1985 which calls for the upgrading of the basic road network, encouraging
rural development and strengthening road maintenance. Specifically, the
project willt
(a) complete the paving of an extension of the North-South road to
link with newly independent Zimbabwe;
(b) improve road access in arable portions of the Tuli Block and
adjacent areas; and
(c) strengthen the Road Department by constructing facilities for
soils and materials testing and road maintenance depots and by
providing a variety of consulting services and instructors for
the Roads Training Center.
5.02     The subject of the economic reevaluation was the same project
components listed in the SAR, namely:
(a) construction to bituminous paved standards of the following
roads:
(i)  Dumela-Zimbabwe border road (76 km); and
(ii) Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe road (25 km) and a 7 km access road
to the Selebi Phikwe airport serving the Tuli Block area;
and
(b) spot improvements of the Sefophe-Tsetsebjwe (56 km) and
Dikabeya-Sefophe (93 km) roads in the Tuli Block and adjacent
areas.
Overall Assessment
5.03     Most of the reevaluated components (except the access road to the
Selebi Phikwe airport) exceed by far the appraisal expectations. The
combined ERR of the project at appraisal was 13% compared to 262 in the
present reevaluation.
Nethodology
5.04     The economic reevaluation was done comparing the "with" and the
"without" project scenarios. The economic reevaluation was carried out in
1985 prices with necessary conversions of the construction and supervision
costs using appropriate inflator factors to foreign and local costs. No
shadow pricing of foreign exchange was applied since there is no marked
divergence between the official and the market exchange rates between the

5.05     The quantified benefits used in the reevaluation are vehicle
operating cost (VOC) savings and maintenance cost savings, except for spot
improvement works where the latter were not considered (as in the SAR).
5.06     Actual construction costs net of taxes were used for the
recalculation of the ERRs. For spot improvement works on the Dikabeya-
Sefophe and Sefophe-Tsetsebjwe roads, however, actual costs provided were
lumped in one stream; thus, the reevaluation combines the analysis of the
two roads. Supervision costs for the Selebi-Phikwe road, the airp.'rt road,
as well as for spot improvements were provided by the Government under one
umbrella payment since they were performed by the same consultant.
Therefore, supervision costs were assigned to each road at a share of about
62 of total costs.
5.07     Vehicle operating cost' unit savings were broken down according to
the three categories listed in the actual traffic counts: a) cars/vans; b)
commercial vehicles; and c) buses (Annex 1). The economic life of the
components was assumed to be, as in the SAR, 20 years for paved roads and 7
years for the spot improved earth roads. Based on the inputs mentioned
above the ERRs for the individual components are presented below:
Dumela-Zimbabwe Border Road (76 km)
5.08     The actual traffic data (Annex 2) was provided by Government for
the road as a whole, Instead of a breakdown into four sections as in the
appraisal report. Therefore, the present analysis is based on the road as
a whole. A uniform 7% annual growth rate was applied in the SAR. Actual
traffic,2 however, was 492 higher in 1984, and 85% higher for 1985 than
estimated in the SAR. Therefore, in the reevaluation the actual growth
rate was adjusted to 122 annual growth up to 1992, and 7% thereafter.
5.09     The reevaluated ERR for this component is about 26%, as compared
to about 11% at appraisal (Annex 3). The difference between these two ERRs
can be explained by the marked increase in traffic (para. 5.08), which was
underestimated at appraisal time. An unlikely reduction In benefits by 202
would reduce the ERR to 22%.
Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe (25 km)
5.10     The actual traffic count for 1984 was about 23% higher and in 1985
15% higher than the appraisal estimate, therefore a uniform growth rate of

about 8% was used in the reevaluation as opposed to the SAR, which applied
a 7% rate from the opening year of the road up to 1992 and 4% thereaftet.3
As in the SAR the present analysis considers a savings of 5 km in trave'
distance. The reevaluated ERR for this component is about 20%, compared
with the 17% estimated at appraisal (Annex 3). A reduction in benefits by
about 20% would yield an ERR of about 16%, making the construction of this
road economically justified.
Selebi Phikwe Airport Road (7 km)
5.11     The average daily traffic for late 1986 was 128 vehicles, as
compared with 223 vehicles estimated at appraisal, i.e., a 43% shortfall,
due to a decrease in economic activity in the mining area. The reevaluated
ERR for this road, assuming the same traffic growth as in the SAR: 52
until 1990 and 2.5% thereafter, was about 6%. Assuming a lower growth rate
of 2% throughout, the ERR is about 5% compared to the appraisal estimate of
22% (Annex 3). This discrepancy can be explained (in addition to the
traffic decrease) by the 70% increase in construction cost per km. This is
the only road under the project with a reevaluated ERR of less than 10%.
Dikabeva-Sefophe (93 km) and Sefophe-Tsetseblwe (56 km)
5.12     The actual traffic for 1984 was 60 vehicles per day, or about
double the estimate at appraisal. Therefore, in the reevaluation, the
assumed annual growth rate was increased to 4% as opposed to 1.5% - 2% at
appraisal. The reevaluated ERR for this component is about 82% as compared
with a 35% weighted average ERR for the two roads ±n the SAR (Annex 3).
This difference is explained by the fact that actual traffic almost doubled
by 1985 from 32 to 61 vehicles per day. An unlikely reduction in benefits
of 20% would yield an ERR of 70%.
Timing
5.13     Regarding the timing of implementation, the first year returns for
three of the components (a. Dumaela-Zimbabwe; b. Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe; and
c. Dikabeya-Sefophe and Sefophe-Tsetsebjwe) exceed the current estimated
opportunity cost of capital for Botswana of 6%. They range from 14 to 45%,
which indicates that these components were overdue. As for the access road
of the Selebi Phikwe airport, the first year's return (5%) is below the
assumed opportunity cost of capital indicating that the implementation of
this road was premature. To be economically justified, this road should
have been constructed to a lower standard.
3IFor 1987, the average daily traffic reported was 279 vehicles. This
figure seems to be out of line with the trcffic figures for 1984, with an
average daily traffic of 164 vehicles, and for 1985, with an average daily
traffic of 165 vehicles. The present evaluation is based on 198415
figures. If the analysis had been based on the 1987 traffic level, the
ERR would have been higher.

Revised Economic Reevaluation for the Gaborone-Molepolole Road
5.14     Government comments on the Project Completion Report of the Third
and Fourth Road Projects4 reached the Bank after that PCR was issued,
therefore, the comments could not be incorporated at that time. The
Government comments (Annex 3A) indicate that the traffic volume used for
the reevaluation of the Gaborone-Molepolole road in the framework of the
Third Road Project was low and did not conform with the records contained
in the Transport Statistics of the Ministry of Works and CommuU.Lcations and
with counts undertaken by the Road Department. Based on the new data
submitted, a new reevaluation was prepared (Annex 3B).

VI. ROLE OF THE BANK AND LESSONS LEARNED
6.01       In comparison to the project preparation mission report the
appraisal composition of the project was better balanced. Provisions were
mAde to finance high priority road sections and the institutional building
8pect and the RD*s need for road maintenance facilities were adequately
covered in the SAR. An important lesson to be learned from the project is
the need for an adequate advance study of the priorities in the sector prior
to appraising a project. This is evident from the major improvements made
in the project compocition at appraisal as compared to project preparation.
The development of a well-balanced project at appraisal was possible because
of additional data and information made available after the project
preparation mission.
6.02       The project included construction of axle-load control stations
and the Loan Agreement provided a covenant requiring enforcement of axle-
load control. Here it is important to note that the weigh stations were
completed on time und axle-load control was fully enforced which is a rare
event in developing countries. An assessment of Botswana's success in
enforcement of axle-loads would no doubt provide valuable experience for the
Bank in assisting other countries to succeed in their effort to enforce
axle-load control.
6.03       The RD has a critical shortage of local engineering staff. As a
result, the RD at present engages about 22 expatriate staff mostly to fill
permanent line positions. Hence, there is an urgent need for training high
school graduates in engineering courses abroad, while developing a local
training capacity.

Para  3.11      Does  "spot improvements" or "a  higher  level  of
betterment" adequately describe the works performed, which often
,amount to virtual full - scale construction ? A better technical
description of the works is required.
S z ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION_
Para   5.01  :   In  most  feasibility  studies  carried  out  in
Botswana,economic costs of construction and maintenance are
calculated from financial costs by allowing for taxes and duties
and also by the shadow-pricing of unskilled labour, given the
considerable underemployment of labour in the country. This does
not appear to be Bank practice or is this an omission ? Also, no
residual value is attributed to the road structure at the end of
its design life, whilst this is again common practice in
fiasibility studies in the country. Use of the Bank's methodology
is therefore bound to give lower economic returns to projects

than those predicted by the ruling methodology for Botswana.
Para.  5.02  : The  traffic figures quoted do not  conform  with
records contained in the Transport Statistics of the Ministry of
Works and Communications or with special counts undertaken by the
Roads Department. There appears to have been a serious mistake if
the figur-es were provided by the Government side. Tr-affic at the
permanent station S-14 (Molepolole East),  indicative of  traffic
on the Gaborone --Molepolole road east of Molepolole, is 390
v.p.d.   in   1984,   whilst  at  the  permanent   station   S-18
(Metsemotlhaba), representative of the Metsemotlhaba - Molepolole
section west of Metsemotlhaba, it is 462 v.p.d. An average for
the road tection might be estimated at 426 v.p.d. This is
considerably higher than the 324 v.p.d. quoted for the 44 km. of
road constituting the bulk of the Gaborone - Molepolole road in
the PCR.
The practice of comparing traffic on the 8 km. Gaborone -
Metsemotlhaba section in the re-appraisal with that expected at
appraisal for the 5 km. Gaborone - Mogoditshane road is a poor
one.  How was adjustment made for the different size of catchment
area served ? Average daily traffic on the 5 km. section is much
higher than on the 8 km. section as shown by the figures below,
reproduced from the Roads Department's special traffic count in
1984,  which  shows traffic levels varying considerably over  the
road :

Molepolole East (S-14) Molepolole - Gaborone Fork           390
For  the entire length of the Gaborone  - Metsemotlhaba  section,
the  traffic  appears  to be considerably in excess  of  the  522
v.p.d.  quoted  in the PCR's economic re-evaluation.  The traffic
data used in the re-evaluation appear to have been derived from
the permanent station S-18 Metsemotlhaba - Gaborone Fork, which
grossly underestimates total traffic on this road.
Figures contained in the M.W.C. Transport Statistics do not
support the contention that traffic fell by 20 - 33% from 1977-
79.  At  the permanent traffic stations,  growth between 1977 and
1979 was as follows :
Molepolole East - Gaborone Fork (S 14) : 24.6%
Metsemotlhaba - Gaborone Fork   (S 18) : 16.4%
It can only be assumed that like has not been compared with
like - i.e. a special traffic count nearer to Gaborone taken in
1977 may have been compared to a standard count taken further
away from Gaborone at Metsemotlhaba in 1979. The figure of 11%
p.a. growth between 1979 and 1984 is correct if the permanent
stations S-14 and S-18 were those used in the calculations.
The figures for normal traffic growth of 10% up to 1990 and
7% thereafter quoted in the PCR are extremely optimistic. The
National Transport Plan (Hoff and Overgaard 1983) estimated
normal traffic growth for the country as a whole.at 10% p.a.  for
the period 1976 -1981, roughly equa'. to average G.N.P. growth
over the period. There was no reasor. to expect this relationship
to change over the near future. The Ministry of Finance and
Develooment Plannina has estimated expected G.N.P. growth during



- 22-
-   Annex 3A
Page 3 of 5
N.D.P. VI (1985 - 1991) at 4.9% p.a. on average. Estimates of
traffic growth beyond 1990 are pure speculation, but in the
absence of any major new mining projects, an assumption can be
made that G.N.P. and traffic growth will be roughly the same as
during N.D.P.  VI - i.e. roughly 5% p.a. An assumption of traffic
growth of 5% p.a. for the period 1985 - 1999 therefore seems more
realistic, assuming that the effects of upgrading the Gaborone -
Molepolole road on traffic generation have worked themselves
through.
Para. 5.03 : The upgrading of the Gaborone - Molepolole road was
not completed until June, 1979. It is assumed therefore that
benefits from V.O.C. and Maintenance savings were calculated as
beginning from this date and that correct adjustments were made
ffor cost escalation. I assume that the statement that all costs
and benefits are in 1976 prices is a mistake and that it should
say 1979 prices as in para. 5.06.
Given  the  observation of traffic growth between  1977  and
1979, the last sentence of this paragraph is unjustified. With
a revaluation of V.O.C. savings a lower than expected I.R.R.
would not be so much the result of poor project performance as of
poor data sources at appraisal.
Para 5.04 :  The estimates presented are very dubious. Should not
the social and wider economic benefits of this project be
stressed more than vehicle operating cost savings ? There is no
mention of employment creation and its impact on rural incomes
for instance.
Para. 5.05 s Again, projected growth rates to the project's end
are very optimistic and should be revised.
Table 5.1 s The gaps in the table relative to estimates for 1975
and 1976 need to be explained. How were savings for minibus and
pick-up traffic calculat2d ? - use of the same savings as for
passenger cars would induce a bias towards lower v.o.c. savings
compared to previous appraisals but this wouid reflect the
absence of important data rather than the use of the most up-to-
date data. Is lack of data a factor in the lower V.O.C. savings
used in the re-evaluation ?
Table 5.2 : The table gives very little data and makes it
difficult to check the results. A table with as much data as
Table 10 in the Third Project Appraisal Report would allow a much
easier comparison.

The data used to calculate expected rates of return for the
Gaborone - TMolepolole road below differ from the data used by the
World  Dank  in the Project Completion Report for the  ThiId  and
Fourth Road ProJects. The main difference is in the traffic data
used, where data taken from the Ministry of Works Transport
Statistics and froam special traffic counts taken on various
sections of the road by Roads Department in 1984 give a very
different picture of the normal traffic flows on the road. In all
cases, the 1984 figures are considerably higher than those used
in the Bank's re-evaluation.
The vehicle operating cost data are also different and are
based on the latest available estimates made by the Transport
Statistics Unit of the Ministry of Works and Ccmmunications,
converted into 1979/80 prices using the G.D.P. Deflator. Data are
given for more vehicle categories than in the Bank's re-
evaluation and the data used relate more directly to the vehicle
categories identified in the Roads Department's traffic counts.
There is no distinction made betweer. passenger cars and L.D.V.'s
in the traffic counts and so it was necesscry to create a
composite car/L.D.V. category for which a vehicle operating cost
figure was calculated using the proportions 50% L.D.V. and 50%
car. These proportions are roughly the same as for the combined
registered vehicle population of Molopolole and Gaborone.
Maintenance cost savings are also calculated differently and
follow  the  recommendations  of a  recent   feasibility   report
(Viability Of Roads In The Tuli Block i ZMCK Consulting Engineers,
June  1984  ) which  utilised data  from  the  Roads  Department
Maintenance   Branch's   cost  accounting  system  to   calculate
maintenance cost savings. The maintenance scenario assumes heavy
traffic on the road with a regravelling period of 3 years and a
resealing period of 7 years. A fogspray is applied to the bitumen
surface in years Z and It following construction. Maintenance
_ost savings constitute a small proportion of the benefits
derived from road upgrading.
The estimate of construction costs used is the same as that
adopted in the Project Completion Report. The same assumptions
concerning the surface composition of the road before upgrading
have also been used. No allowance has been made for a residual
life of an upgraded road although this is common practice in
Botswana. The full benefit of V.O.C. savings for generated
traffic  has been utilised in the calculations although  economic
theory more correctly prescribes incorporating half of the
realised  savings for generated traffic.  Adherence to this  rule
would  reduce  the  rates  of  return  considerably,   given  the
dominance  of vehicle operating costs in the benefits  total  and
the  high  levels of generated traffic.  However,  the aim is  to
produce an estimate rather than an exact figure. It has been
necessary to make a number of large assumptions in order to
arrive  at  the estimates shown in Tables 3  and  4.  These  were
necessitated because of the lack of detailed traffic data for the
year 1979. It was necessary to estimate past traffic levels for
much of the Gaborone - Metsemotlhaba section given the massive
under-estimation which would be derived from use of data for the
Metsemotlhaba  - Gaborone Fork section (permanent station  S-18).
Data  from this ,tation appear to have formed the.basis  for  the
Batik ' re-appraisal-. The assumptions made about traffic on the
Metsemotlhaba - Molepolole section are less heroic and thia
result can be presumed to be fdirly robust. For the shorter 6 km.
section it seems li:ely that there will be a large measurement

error. If traffic has been estimated too high for the immediate
post-1979 period, a considerable upward bias will have been
imparted to the results given the very high discount rate needed
to give zero net present value. If vehicle operating cost savings
for generated traffic were takeff as half of face value because of
the consumer suirplus argument, there would be a further over-
estimation because less of the traffic increase up to 1984 could
be considered as generated traffic. However, given the correct
high  traffic  flows on the firBt 8 km.  of road in 1984  and  15
years of design life remaining ( although this could be shortened
because of the very high growth in the number of equivalent
standard axles crossing the road, despite the dominance of light
traffic ), the rate of return for the first 8 km. will clearly be
very high.
The rates of return given in Tables 3 and 4 are much higher
than those given in the P.r.R.  despite the fact that much  lower
traffic growth rates are assumed for the period 1985 - 1999.

THIRD ROAD PROJECT LN. 1174-BT
Revised Economic Reevaluation for the Gaborone-Molepolole Road
1.       A new reevaluation was undertaken following the revised figures
for the road sub-section Gaborone-Matsemotlhaba (8 km); instead of the
traffic of 324 v.p.d. taken In the PCR of 1985, 426 v.p.d. was taken as per
government comments (taken in the PCR of 1985) and for the Matsemotlhaba-
Molepolole subsection (44 km) 2,177 v.p.d. was taken as per new counts
weighted by the road sub-section. Government comments also suggest that
the annual growth rate to be used is 10% from 1984 to 1985 and 5%
thereafter. However, due to the higher traffic volume than anticipated,
the present reevaluation took a somewhat higher growth rate i.e. 10% from
1984 and 1985 and 7% thereafter.
2.       The economic reevaluation of the road construction, based on
1979/1980 prices, indicates the following rates of return. For the
Gaborone-Metsemontlahaba sub-section an ERR of 42% while for the
Metsemotlhaba-Molepolole sub-section the revised ERR is 20%. In the 1985
PCR the corresponding ERR's were 13 and 12% respectively. The combined ERR
for the entire road is now about 24%.
