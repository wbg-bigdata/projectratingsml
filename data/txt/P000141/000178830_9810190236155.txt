FIFTH ROAD PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Republic of Botswana.
Amount:            US$17.0 million.
Terms:             17 years repayment including 4 years of grace, 9.25 percent
interest.
Project            The Project would upgrade Botswana's road network, encourage
Description:    rural development and strengthen road maintenance.  It would
complete the paving of an extension of the north-south road
to link with Zimbabwe; improve road access to portions of
the Tuli Block and adjacent areas; strengthen the Roads
Department by building a soils and materials testing labo-
ratory and road maintenance depots, and providing consulting
services and two instructors to complete the staffing of
Botswana's Roads Training Center. By reducing transport and
vehicle operating costs, it would benefit consumers and
traders. The Project faces no special risks, although
realization of its potential would be adversely affected by
a decline in cross-border traffic between Botswana and
Zimbabwe.

INTERNATIONAL BA11K FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECObMIENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANlA
FOR A FIFTH ROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Botswana for the equivalent of US$17.0 million for a Fifth
Road Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including four years
of grace, with interest rate of 9.25 percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Botswana 1/ is landlocked, bordered by the Republic of South Africa
(RSA), Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is the size of France, but has a pop-
ulation of only about 858,000, three-quarters of whom live in a relatively
small eastern corridor. The Kalahari Desert covers about two thirds of the
country. Rainfall is erratic and drought frequent.
3.        Livestock has been Botswana's principal resource, and cattle raising
remains the dominant economic activity for almost 80 percent of the population.
Since 1971, however, diamond, nickel, and copper mining have spurred economic
growth and significantly reduced dependence on livestock. Mineral and beef
c---orts fuelec rea; SDP growth at an annual average of 10 percent over the last
decade. Despite regional political turmoil, the outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease, and below average harvest, GNP per capita, estimated at US$725 in
1979, has almost trebled in current prices since 1973. The value of Botswana's
diamond production alone tripled between 1977 and 1979, and diamonds now
account for more than 50 percent of exports. The economy is expected to con-
tinue this growth through the first half of the 1980s.
4.        The Government's financial position has strengthened since 1972;
it is a net creditor of the banking system and has achieved recurrent budget
surpluses that have covered about half of steadily growing capital expendi-
tures that were largely previously externally financed. With rising income from
the Southern African Customs Union, direct taxes and minerals, recurrent reve-
nues rose from P 29 million (US$37 million) in 1972/73 to an estimated P 190
million (US$243 million) in 1979/80. Although about one quarter of 1978/79
expenditures were diverted to unexpected projects related to political events
and cattle disease, the Government's financial position did not suffer, as
revenues grew faster than expected and additional grants from bilateral and
multilateral sources were received. Emergency expenditures, considerably

distributed to the Executive Directors on April 20, 1978. An updating
economic mission visited Botswana in June 1980, and a new report is
scheduled for distribution by April 1981. Country data are given in Annex 1.

lower in 1979/80, were financed from a special contingency fund to avoid further
disruption of the development budget. Since 1973, the economy has also shown
overall surpluses in its balance of payments. Net international reserves were
about US$267 million in December 1979, at least six months' imports. This rela-
tively high level of reserves reflects the rapid rise in exports, sharp increases
in government transfer receipts and substantial inflows of private capital invested
in a new diamond mine. Rising prices for petroleum products and imported food,
exacerbated by depreciation of the pula, due to its being pegged to the US dollar,
placed upward pressure on domestic prices in 1979. To moderate inflation the
Government broke its dollar link and revalued the pula by five percent in Septem-
ber, 1979. 1/
5.        Botswana's rapid growth since independence has diverted attention from
its vulnerability to external developments, particularly, those in the region
stemming from political uncertainties. Botswana has no control over an essential
part of its transport system--its rail link with South Africa and Zimbabwe, which
is crucial to its livestock and mining sectors--and is owned by Zimbabwe. The
dominance of livestock and mining also makes the economy vulnerable to sharp
swings as prices and access to export markets fluctuate. Finally, drought and
cattle diseases have created hardship for a significant proportion of Botswana's
population.
6.        Dispite significant progress, inadequate infrastructure and shortages
of technical and professional personnel still hinder Botswana's development.
For example, although major towns and villages are linked by the relatively good
north-south road, road links to remoter district centers are still lacking and
many rural areas remain isolated. Therefore, the Government continues to
earmark a large proportion of its investment program--about 20 percent in 1979/80--
for roads. While the adult literacy rate has risen from 20 percent at inde-
pendence (1966) to about 35 percent in 1978, the economy remains heavily dependent
on expatriates, who account for about 70 percent of employees with university
degrees. Moreover, the demand for skilled workers will increase with the econo-
my's expected growth.
7.        Botswana also faces difficulties in reducing the economic and social
imbalances that have accompanied rapid growth. The traditional pattern of
cattle ownership, communal grazing and control of watering points has favored
a limited number of Batswana. A 1974/75 rural income distribution survey showed
about 4t percent of rural households without cattle, another 20 percent with
fewer than 10 head, while five percent owned about half the national herd.
This inequality has steadily widened as herds expanded and competition for
grazing land and water increased and exacerbated by drought. As the growth
1/ The Government decided in mid-1980 to peg the pula to a basket of currencies
consisting of 50 percent SDRs and 50 percent South African rand, the currency
in which Botswana pays for most of its imports.



- 3 -
of herds threatens to damage or destroy grazing lands through over-use and
erosion the Government adopted a Tribal Grazing Land Policy in July 1975 to
reform land tenure, modernize ranch management and increase productivity. This
program has not yet been successful in rationalizing government investment and
pricing policies that induce overstocking and has focussed lazgely on commercial
ranching rather than cattle smallholders. Botswana also recently started imple-
menting an Arable Land Development Program to expand rural employment, decrease food
imports and raise farm incomes by providing credit, inputs, extension and marketing
services and on-farm infrastructure such as fencing and roads. The program is
quite ambitious and its goals of grain self-sufficiency and cash crop incomes of
nearly US$400 per family will be difficult to reach.
8.        Botswana's development strategy aims at rapid economic growth, more
equitable income distribution, equal education and employment opportunities and
diversification of external economic and trade relations. The Fifth Development
Plan (1979-85), while focusing on employment creation, will give priority to
increasing rural productivity, promoting industry, improving education and
expanding infrastructure. The public investment program amounts to about US$678
million in 1979 prices, implying an average annual investment of 10.7 percent of
GDP, excluding expenditures for contingency projects.
9.        Real GDP growth, projected in the Plan at 10 percent a year, will
likely be below this level in its early years due to the Jwaneng diamond mine's
reaching full capacity in 1982, the dampening effect of oil price increases, and
uncertain prospects in livestock. However, a large new diamond mine is expected
to begin operations in 1982 so that Botswana's real growth should average about
14 percent for the rest of the Plan period.
10.       Multi- and bilateral agencies have extended substantial assistance
to Botswana on highly concessional terms. The Bank Group has been the main
multilateral source, but the European Economic Community, the African Development
Bank and OPEC sources have also been active. Bilateral assistance has come
from several sources and, in 1978, almost two thirds of Botswana's outstanding
bilateral debt was converted into grants. At the end of that year, total
external debt outstanding and disbursed amounted to US$120.7 million. Debt
service payments during 1978 were US$8.2 million and the debt service ratio 3.7
percent. Botswana is expected to continue to receive much of its assistance
from bilateral sources on grant or concessional terms. Given its improving cre-
ditworthiness, however, an increasing proportion of financing will come from
commercial sources, mainly in mining, and some hardening in the overall terms
of borrowing is expected. Botswana negotiated its first commercial loan from a
consortium of private banks in 1978 and is expected to remain creditworthy for
commercial borrowing. Based on projected export growth and a moderate hardening
in the terms of its borrowing, Botswana could borrow an estimated US$80 million
annually through 1985 without its debt service ratio exceeding five percent.
1/ These two projects would raise public investment to 10.7 percent of GDP.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA
11.       Botswana has received loans and credits totalling US$120.5 million--
6 credits (US$14.8 million) and 10 loans (US$105.7 million), including US$3.5
million on Third Window terms. These have financed four road projects, two
livestock projects, two education projects, two urban projects, two water
supply projects, plus projects for a development finance company (Botswana
Development Corporation--BDC), and engineering studies and infrastructure for
the Shashe mining complex. IFC's first operation in Botswana, a US$362,500
equity participation in BDC, was approved in March 1979. Summary statements
of Bank Group Operations in Botswana are provided in Annex II.
12.       As of December 31, 1978, the Bank Group's share of Botswana's ex-
ternal debt (disbursed only was 46.4 percent IBRD 33.6 percent) and accounted
for 84 percent of its debt service payments, a reflection of the predominance
of loans on favorable terms in Botswana's external debt. About 80 percent of
debt service payments to the Bank Group, however, are for the Shashe mining
infrastructure loans which are guaranteed by a consortium of international
mining companies. The Bank Group's share of external public debt (disbursed)
and debt service payments is expected to decline to about 24 and 29 percent,
respectively, by 1985.
13.       Botswana has demonstrated good performance in the planning and
execution of development projects. Bank-assisted projects have encountered
relatively few problems with two exceptions: the Shashe Copper/Nickel Mining
Project (Loans 776-BT and 776-2-BT) and the IDA-financed First Livestock
Project (Cr. 325-BT). Although the infrastructure component of the Shashe
Project was completed on schedule, the mining operation experienced technical
and financial problems. In early 1980, the various parties concerned agreed
to a second financial restructuring of the mining company, BCL. The First
Livestock Project, recently completed, experienced management and overstocking
problems in several ranches, which will have difficulty in meeting debt
servicing commitments. Fencing of large areas in the Kalahari region proved
complicated, and water facilities operated poorly. The Botswana Livestock
Development Company continues to have financial problems, largely due to
the curtailment in trading induced by foot-and-mouth disease. The Government
is pursuing proposals to remedy these problems.
14.       Future operations in Botswana include proposed projects in education
and power. A Third Education Project, now being prepared, would build,
furnish and equip about 1,000 primary classrooms and provide administrative
and technical assistance. Field investigations and preparation of a feasi-
bility study for a large, coal-fired power plant are underway and expected to
be completed in early 1981.



PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
15.       Botswana's major transport arteries are a 640 km rail-line and
parallel road running south through its heavily populated eastern quarter from
Zimbabwe to South Africa. Otherwise, its network of roads and tracks is
sparse and needs extension, upgrading, and maintenance. Botswana has a ferry
link across the Zambezi to Zambia in the north, four airports, and a number
of landing strips.
16.       Fifteen percent of Botswana's 6,900 km of gazetted roads is paved,
a fortyfold increase since independence, another 25 percent gravelled and the
rest earth and sand. Several thousand kilometers of uninventoried and un-
surfaced district roads and tracks provide additional access in rural areas.
17.       The development of Botswana's mining industry and the residual
effects of growth in the RSA have led to traffic growth averaging 10 percent
a year since 1970. More than half the country-s registered vehicles are
commercial goods carriers, generally of less than 1.5 tons capacity. While
Botswana's licensing laws favor local operators, capacity is low, and foreign
truckers dominate road transport. Despite sharp rises in fuel prices--to the
equivalent of US$2.46 per gallon for gasoline and US$2.31 for diesel--in
recent years, gasoline consumption is rising at 10 percent yearly, and diesel
15 percent.
18.       The main railway line is owned, operated and maintained by Zimbabwe,
which also provides services along some 70 km of spur lines built by Botswana
to service its mines. Only 20 percent of freight traffic has been of local
origin, with the rest in transit between RSA and Zimbabwe. Ninety percent of
the 600,000 passengers carried yearly are, however, local. The Government has
drawn up a US$84 million program to take over the railway during the next five
years.
19.       Botswana's four airports are not equipped to handle commercial
jet or night flights, although construction of an international airport at
Gaborone is expected to start in 1981. The national airline, Air Botswana,
contracts scheduled service to RSA and Zambia to a private firm.
Institutional Framework
20.       Botswana's post-independence concentration on improving its primary
highway network has been superseded in the Fifth Plan by an ambitious trans-
port policy of upgrading roads and improving maintenance, improving access
to rural areas, and reducing dependency on its neighbors in rail, air, and
road transport. Transport investments of US$264 million represent about 30
percent of Plan spending.
21.       Transport planning, carried out by the Ministry of Works and
Communications, has been essentially project oriented. The Government now
recognizes, however, the need for a more coordinated approach, and plans a
national transport study to prepare a comprehensive 15-year investment
program. The African Development Bank has agreed to finance the study
from savings under an earlier road project.



22.        Sixty percent (US$157 million) of the Plan's transport investment
is targeted for road construction; almost double the US$17.4 million aver-
aged over 1975-79. The foreign exchange component of new construction is
almost entirely financed from external sources, while maintenance expendi-
tures, now about US$890,000 a year, are met from fuel taxes and licensing
fees. While it is doubtful that Botswana will be able to carry out the full
program during the five-year Plan period, external funding for much of it has
already been secured. A major purpose of the National Transport Study (para.
21) will be to set road investment priorities after 1985.
23.        The Works Ministry-s Roads Department is responsible for Botswana's
gazetted road network. 1/ Most of the Department's senior staff are foreigners
paid by bilateral donors. Since a program to train counterparts is not yet
fully successful, there is a continuing problem of vacancies. The loan would
address the vacancy problem by providing US$160,000 to hire short-term con-
sultants. The Fourth Road Project included a new building for the Department's
Roads Training Center (RTC), which trains road technicians, equipment operators
and supervisors. Its staffing remains inadequate, however, and it was agreed
at negotiations that the Government would appoint, by June 30, 1981, two new
instructors and thereafter maintain a teaching staff consisting of at least
a Senior Training Engineer and five instructors (Section 4.03, draft Loan
Agreement). The Government has asked a bilateral donor to finance the two
positions.
24.       The Department relies on contractors, mostly foreigners, for all
major works but handles road maintenance itself. Maintenance has improved
markedly with the implementation of recommendations of a study financed in
the Third Project. The proposed Project will build two new and enlarge
seven existing maintenance depots.
25.       Although the Ministry-s Central Transport Organization, in charge
of road construction and maintenance equipment, has greatly improved its
operations recently with the aid of Canadian technical assistance, the avail-
ability rate of equipment and vehicles remains low. As the proposed Project
includes maintenance depots (para. 24), it was agreed at negotiations that
quarterly reports on equipment availability will be a part of the normal
reporting requirements. The transport organization's budgeting and accounting
procedures are being improved under bilateral technical assistance.
Bank-Group Assistance
26.       In Botswana, the Bank Group has helped finance four road projects
and an infrastructure project with a road component. The First Road Project
(Credit 63-BEC, US$3.6 million) in 1974 involved building 570 km of gravel roads,
improving the north-south road and supporting maintenance.  While the project was
1/   Local roads are administered by nine district councils under the Ministry
of Local Government and Lands. The councils have had few facilities for
maintaining local roads; a pilot technical assistance program financed
in the Third Project recently introduced labor-intensive construction
and maintenance method in one district, and these will be extended to two
more in the Fourth Project.



- 7 -
completed on time and within cost estimates, the audit report estimated that
economic benefits would be somewhat lower than expected because a forecast
shift from livestock trekking to trucking did not materialize. As a
consequence, the 1973 estimated rate of return for one road section was
negative and ranged between 4 to 16 percent for the other sections compared
with projections at appraisal of 8 to 20 percent.
27.       The Second Road Project (Credit 303-BT, US$2 million) in 1972 was
also financed by a Swedish International Development Authority credit of about
US$4 million. It reconstructed and paved an 80-km section of the noth-south
road, and provided technical assistance to the Roads Branch of the Public
Works Department. The project was completed ahead of schedule and within
cost estimates; the audit report confirmed its economic justification although
the rate of return, estimated at 13 percent, was 6 percent lower than the
appraisal estimate because a connecting road in South Africa was not built.
28.       The Third Road Project (Loan 1174-BT, US$5.8 million) in 1975 con-
sisted of constructing the 52 km Gaborone-Molepolole road, detailed engineer-
ing of the Mahalapye-Serule and Dumela-Ramokgwebana roads, a road maintenance
study, a district roads maintenance pilot program and training and equipment.
The Project has been completed, except for the maintenance program, which is
expected to be completed a year late because of delays in recruiting consultants.
29.       The Fourth Road Project (Loan 1408-BT, US$20.0 million), approved
in 1977, is constructing 167 km of roads, providing technical assistance,
preparing a feeder road program and strengthening the Roads Department.
Construction and studies are proceeding satisfactorily and an extension of
the pilot maintenance program awaits completion of its first phase under
the Third Project.
30.       The Shashe Infrastructure Project (Loan 776-BT, US$32.0 million)
in 1971 included construction of a 52 km gravel road between Serule and
Selebi Phikwe. Additional funds for bituminizing the road were included
in a supplementary loan which brought the total cost of road construction
to US$3.5 million. Works were completed in 1977.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       The Project 1/ would complete paving of the road linking the
country's north-south artery with Zimbabwe, improve three roads in the Tuli
1/   The Botswana Government prepared the Project based on consultants'
studies. It was appraised in June 1980, and negotiations were held in
Washington in November 1980. Mr. O.K. Matambo, Director of Economic
Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, led the govern-
ment delegation. A report entitled "Fifth Road Project - Staff
Appraisal Report," No. 3131b-BT, dated November 20, 1980, is being
distributed separately. Annex III gives supplementary information.

Block and adjacent tribal mining areas, provide road maintenance depots and
a laboratory, and strengthen the Roads Department. Specific components are:
(i) Improving the 76 km Dumela-Zimbabwe border road to two-lane
bituminous standards. The road, the only unpaved section of
the north-south spine road, links rural northeastern areas
with Francistown, a major supply and distribution center. The
existing gravel road is sometimes difficult to pass during
the rainy season and barely adequate during the dry season.
Detailed engineering has been completed.
(ii) Bringing the 25 km Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe road in the Tuli
Block to two-lane bituminous standards. The road services
the important mining town of Selebi Phikwe and is an extension
of the Serule-Selebi Phikwe road built in 1977. The present
gravel road and earth track are difficult to maintain because
there is little gravel and water in the area. A 7 km access
road to the Selebi Phikwe airport would also be built. Detailed
engineering has been completed.
(iii)  Making spot improvements to the Sefophe-Tsetsebjwe (56 km) and
Dikabeya-Sefophe (93 km) roads serving tribal farms in the
Tuli Block. These roads have poor drainage and are sometimes
impassable during the rainy season. The improvements would
allow access during all but the most severe rains. Detailed
engineering is not required for this work.
(iv) Supporting road maintenance by:
(a) constructing a new soils and materials labortory.
(b) constructing new or improving existing road maintenance
depots in Francistown, Gaborone, Ghanzi, Kang, Kanye,
Maun, Mahalapye, Nata, and Palapye.
(v) Consulting services to:
(a) supervise construction;
(b) prepare a program for strengthening about 80 km of main
roads, and training Roads Department technicians in
pavement evaluation techniques;
(c) develop road design standards appropriate for Botswana
and prepare a design manual;
(d) fill occasional Roads Department vacancies with temporary
staff who can be provided at short notice by consulting
firms with local offices.
(vi) Improving teaching at RTC by providing two additional instructors
and maintaining the expanded staff level.

Project Costs and Financing
32.       Project costs are estimated at US$25.0 million, including US$2.0
million duties and taxes. The proposed US$17.0 million loan would finance all
foreign exchange costs, except about US$400,000 for the two RTC instructors
(para. 23) and would cover 74 percent of net project costs. The Government
would finance the remainder. The Project's cost includes 10 percent physical
and 18 percent price contingencies, based on 14 percent yearly foreign and
local price inflation 1/ during 1980-81, and 12 percent a year thereafter.
33.       Approximately 244 months of consulting services are estimated to
cost US$2.1 million, an average of about US$6,900 per month for direct costs.
Local transport, office, and supporting services costs raise this figure to
US$8,600. These costs are based on recent consultants' contracts with the
Government which are relatively low because of the number of consulting firms
that have offices in Botswana or the RSA.
Project Execution and Procurement
34.       The Roads Department will be responsible for executing the Project,
which will be carried out over three years. It will be assisted by consultants
who will supervise civil works, prepare a design manual and pavement strength-
ening program, and fill short-term Departmental vacancies (para. 23).
35.       Unit price contracts for road construction and contracts for the
soils and materials laboratory and the nine road maintenance depots will be
awarded after international competitive bidding. However, because of the
relatively small size and scattered locations of the buildings, only con-
tractors already established in Botswana or in neighboring African countries
are expected to bid. Hence, publication may be limited to advertising in the
local press and Development Forum.
Disbursement
36.       Loan funds will be disbursed against 70 percent of the costs of civil
works for the roads, 60 percent of the costs of civil works for buildings, and
80 percent of the total cost of consulting services.
Benefits and Risks
37.       The Project's quantifiable benefits, which result from lower vehicle
operating and road maintenance costs, give an overall economic rate of return
estimated at 13 percent. As trucking in Botswana is highly competitive and
there are no government rate controls, part of the vehicle operating cost
savings are expected to be passed on to the general public. The Project would
also strengthen Botswana's highway maintenance capability and provide training
through the two RTC instructors.
38.       Improving the 76 km Dumela-Zimbabwe border road, a portion of the
country's main transport artery, accounts for 68 percent of project costs. The
1/ As price movements in Botswana are strongly influenced by imports, inflation
rates are expected to be the same for local and foreign costs.

road, on which traffic is expected to grow about seven percent yearly between
1983 and 2002, passes through an area dominated by Francistown, Botswana's
second largest urban center and a major employment, supply and marketing center,
and services some 71,000 ha with potential for increased agricultural production.
As the only road link with Zimbabwe, it is part of an important international
route running from South Africa through Botswana and Zimbabwe to other countries
in the region. Although the railway linking Zimbabwe and the north with RSA
also passes through this corridor, little traffic diversion from rail to road is
expected. The projected ERR for this road is 11 percent. A 10 percent cost
increase, or 9 percent diminution in benefits, would lower the return to 10 percent.
39.       Upgrading the 25 km Selebi Phikwe-Sefophe road and the 7 km access
route to the Selebi Phikwe airport is expected to yield economic rates of return
of 17 and 22 percent. A 10 percent rise in costs or decrease in benefits would
lower these to 16 and 20 percent, respectively. Spot improvements to 150 km of
feeder roads in the Tuli Block would yield an estimated economic rate of return
of 35 percent, based on savings in vehicle operating costs. In addition, the
improvements should facilitate agricultural development in the area. In view of
the high rate of return, no sensitivity analysis was made.
40.       These roads provide access from the Tuli Block farming areas to Selebi
Phikwe, a mining center and Botswana's third largest town. Traffic between
Sefophe and Selebi Phikwe is expected to grow about 7 percent yearly until the
operating capacity of the mines is reached in 1992, and 4 percent thereafter;
airport road traffic is expected to grow 5 percent a year until 1990, and 3
percent a year thereafter.
41.       The project's major risk lies in the possibility that traffic to and
from Zimbabwe on the road from Dumela might develop more slowly than projected.
Since the border was reopened early in 1980, however, traffic between the Francis-
town area and Zimbabwe has increased substantially and, barring unforseen events
in Zimbabwe, this growth is expected to continue.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Government of Botswana and the
Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.

43.       Special conditions of the Project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
AS OF NOVEMBER 20, 1980
Credit No. 325     Livestock Development Project; US$1.65 Million Credit of
June 30, 1972; Effective Date: April 30, 1973;
Closing Date: October 31, 1980
While the project is complete and the PCR has been issued, we and
the Swedish International Development Authority, extended the Closing Date
to October 31, 1980 to permit disbursement of resettlement claims on the
Nojane Ranch Manager's contract. We are now preparing to close the Credit.
The project's status deteriorated during its last six months. Several
ranches were overstocked and mismanaged, the water facilities and fences
continued to break down and the extension service failed to alter traditional
practices. The ranches will have difficulty in meeting debt servicing
commitments and the Botswana Livestock Development Company continues to
have financial problems largely due to the foot-and-mouth induced curtailment
in trading. The Government is aware of these problems and is discussing
proposals to help solve them.
Loan No. 1019       Botswana Development Corporation Project; US$4.0 Million
Loan of June 27, 1974; Effectiveness Date: December 9,
1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Due to lack of investment opportunities in Botswana and availability
of cheaper funds from other sources, about 35 percent (US$1.4 million) of the
loan remains uncommitted. The Bank and the Botswana Development Corporation
(BDC) developed a scheme to finance small-scale enterprises under a two-tier
system involving BDC and Barclays Bank of Botswana, and US$1 million of the
uncommitted portion of the loan was earmarked for this purpose on which the
Government was to assume the foreign exchange risk. In view of sizeable
foreign exchange reserves, the Government requested disbursements of the
SSE component in dollars or South African rand, but the Bank for procedural
reasons was unable to comply with this request and further disbursements
ceased. BDC's top management changed in July 1980, and we are discussing
the prospects of BDC's using the uncommitted portion of the loan with the
new managing director, before considering its cancellation.
Loan No. 1174       Third Road Project; US$5.8 Million Loan of November 21,
1975; Effectiveness Date: January 12, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980
The project was amended in 1978 to include additional components
to utilize surplus funds. The Gaborone-Molepolole road was completed satis-
factorily in 1979, and only implementation of the District Roads Maintenance
Pilot Program remains to be finished. Project completion is expected to be
one year behind schedule because of a delay in recruiting technical assistance
staff with appropriate expertise to implement the pilot program. In view
of delays, we have suggested to the Government extending Closing Date to
March 31, 1982.

and 1275T           and US$3.5 Million TW) of May 28, 1976; Effectiveness
Date: September 10, 1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1982
Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily except for certain
delays in completing building designs due to staff constraints in the Ministry
of Works. Delays are being overcome with the exception of work on an insti-
tution located in the Kahalam District, where completion is unlikely by the
Closing Date. The remote location of the institution has resulted in an
increase in cost to the project of about 16 percent (in local currency) which
is manageable for the borrower. Objectives of the project are expected to be
achieved.
Loan No. 1408       Fourth Road Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of May 20, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: August 18, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The project was amended in 1978 to utilize surplus funds. The con-
struction and studies components are proceeding on schedule. The extension
of the District Roads Maintenance Pilot Program is postponed until completion
of the Pilot Program under the Third Road project.
Loan No. 1497       Second Livestock Project; US$6.5 Million Loan of December 30,
1977; Effectiveness Date: November 27, 1978; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
The project is behind schedule mainly due to an eight-month delay in
achieving effectiveness. However, sound preparation for all components has
occurred and their implementation should gain momentum in the next six months.
While the lease format is finalized, time is being taken to help ensure that
leases do not give way to individuals with too many advantages. Since more
prior claims on the ranches existed than were first apparent, these interests,
as well as the community-s interest in ensuring its own rights in the future,
are being reconciled with the rights of the ranch applicants.
Loan No. 1584       Second Urban Project; US$8.0 Million Loan of September 11,
1978; Effectiveness Date: June 20, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily following delays
in loan effectiveness. Site improvements have begun in Francistown and will
commence shortly in Selebi-Phikwe. Legislation has recently been enacted
enabling town councils to recover service levies.
Loan No. 1763       Second Water Supply Project; US$4.4 Million of January 9,
1980; Effectiveness Date:   September 18, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The' project was declared effective on September 18, 1980, and imple-
mentation is proceeding satisfactorily.
