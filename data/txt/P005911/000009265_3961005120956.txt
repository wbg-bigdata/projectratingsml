REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
EDUCATION SECTOR                    PROJECT
CREDrr AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Governent of the Republic of Yemen
Beneficjry:        Ministry of Education
Credit Amount:     SDR 23.9 million (US$ 33.0 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard IDA
Desrition:         The project would assist the (Governnent to implement policy reforms in the
education sector, and to improve Yemen's capacity to develop human resources
to meet the emerging needs of the economy. This would be achieved through a
Planned Change Program (PCP) designed to: (a) enhance the learning
achievements of secondary students with special emphasis on science and
mathcematics education and quality of teaching; (b) improve the access of girls to
secondary education; and (c) establish labor market oriented two-year post-
secondary education programs covering business, commerce and industry.
The project includes national and school-based subprojects designed to address
the broad policy objectives in eight Change Areas: physical facilities, teacher
performance, curriculum development, school management, learning resources,
student evaluation, female access and community colleges. The reforms pursued
under the PCP have a long-term perspective which requires evaluation and
adjustment at different stages. Ihe sector approach provides the necessary
flexibility for making adjustments as the Program progresses, promotes the
application of objective criteria for the allocatP.n of funds to subprojects, and
encourages cooperation and coordination among beneficiaries through an
Intermediary Agency.
Bnefits:           Project benefits would be wide ranging and would improve the quality of middle-
level manpower, for which demand is strong and growing in the Yemeni
economy. Quality improvements in secondary education would directly benefit
a student population projected to rise from 563,000 in 1992 to I million in 2000.
The establishment of a national Community College system would provide
occupationally oriented middle-level manpower training to approximately 3,000
student per year in business, commerce and industry. Female access to education
would be increased, particularly in rural areas, and career advancement
opportnities for women educators enhanced.
Biska:              Ihree main risks exist. Eist the Intermediary Agency (PDMA), would contain
one new opeatg unit which would be inexperienced. This would be mi igated
through technical assistance provided in a twinning arrangement and through the
central role played in the PDMA by the well experienced Project Inplementation
Unit. Scn.d, interrelationships between subprojects could cause delays in
subproject implementation. This would be mitigated through representation of
interrelated subprojects on Change Area Policy Boa&ds. Ihird, majority private
sector participation in the governance structure of the Community College system
may be difficult for the present bureaucratic structures to accommodate. This risk



- H -
has been minimized Ihrough agreement on the composition of the Goverance
structre, which inmludes a majority private sector partcipadon.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
EDUCATION SECTOR  PiVEST           f PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Cmmta   Rug       d
1.01         Endowed with limited natural resources, Yemen belongs to the group of least developed
countries. Its per capita GNP in 1991 was approximately $540. Scant rainfall and desert conditions in
many areas severely restrict agriculture while manufacturing is still at an infant stage. Ihe average life
expectancy is less thaa 50 years; fertility and mortality rates are high as is illiteracy among adults,
especially females.
1.02         Modem economic and social development on a national scale started only in the late
1960s, after both the northern and southern parts of the country achieved political independence. During
the 1970s and early 1980s, Yemen experienced rapid economic growth financed largely from remittances
of emigrant laborers working in neighboring oil exporting countries. Foreign assistance supported the
development of infrastructure and social services, including education.
1.03         With the sharp fall of international oil prices in the mid 1980s, the flow of remitances
and foreign aid to Yemen slowed down significantly, creating serious imbalances in foreign trade and
government budgets. These problems were exacerbated by the Gulf crisis which caused large numbers
of Yemeni emigrants to return to their country at very short notice. In addition, political tensions in
Ethiopia and Somalia drove successive waves of refugees into Yemen. Together, these dislocations
increased the country's resident population by over one million, or close to 10 percent. These pressures
have resulted in widespread unemployment, growing poverty and declining real incomes. With natural
population growth ex,: eding 3 percent a year, the basic needs of many people, especially in rural areas,
are not met.
3. r         - =
1.04         In May 1990, the northern and southern parts of the country united to create the Republic
of Yemen. After a transitional period, general elections were held in April 1993 and the first democratic
government of Yemen was formed in May, 1993. Unification has resolved previous border disputes
between North and South, and opened the country to foreign investors. This has led to a surge in oil
exploration which is expected to result in a substantial increase of domestic oil production and exports
during the mid and late 1990s. Additional oil revenue supported by urgendy needed policy adjustments
could provide a basis for sustained economic growth and could broaden the tax base for public
expenditures. Economic prosperity and the recent renewal of emigration to Arab oil countries could ease
unemployment and improve living standards for large segments of the population. Programs for human
development, including education, would be able to grow at a similar pace, making it possible to address
present limitations in access and quality.
1.05         Economic recovery would lead to an increase of demand for trained manpower in a
variety of categories. To meet this demand and to support possible productivity gains in agriculture,
fisheries, industry and services, effective programs are needed to upgrade the quality of Yemen's labor

force. A determined effort will also have to be made to slow population growth, so that the benefts from
fiture development are not dissipated among an ever increasing number of people.
1.06         Yemeni authorides are krcenly aware of these issues and have consistently given priority
to human development A National Reform Progrm approved by Parliament in January 1992 articulates
the broad oudines of a development strategy for the united Yemen. The Program emphasizes the need
for an active population policy, and calls for a more effective education system. A National Population
Council zhaired by the Prime MinisW and supported by a Technical Secretariat was established in July
1992. The Council supervises the implemettation of an inter-sectoral acton plan addressing population
issues in the current decade. With respect to edu'cation and training the Program gives priority tuJ
increasing female pardcipation; reducing illiteracy among the adult population; and Improving the quality
of outputs to meet present and future human skdll requirements.
IH. TE EDUCATION SECTOR
A. Present
2.01         Present education and training in Yemen includes all major elements of a modern system:
primary and secondary education, teacher training, vocationa and technical training, and higher
education. In 1991192 some 2.5 million students were enrolled in the system, a tenfold increase since
1970171. In addition, some 70 thousand adults received literacy training that year. Ihe rapid build-up
of education facilities gives testimony to the priority assigned this sector by the authorities. Major
support also came from foreign donors who provided teachers and financed school construction and
equipment IDA was heaviy involved in the sector: since 1974 fourteen education projects have been
approved for Yemen.

2.02         Prior to unification, generad education In the norhern governorates was based on the 6-3-
3 system, I.e. six years of primary school followed by three years preparatory and three years secondary
education. In the South, uniq schools covered the first eight years, followed by four years of secondary
schooling. In 1992, a new education law was passed introducing a 9-3 system, nine years of compulsory
basic education and three years of secondary education. However, due to present financial constraints
the basic education requirement is temporarily limited to t)- fist 6 years.
2.03        ITe Minisr of Education (MOE) is respunsible for developing and implementing the
Government's education policy. Its organizational structure includes five major departments: Planning
and Finance, Management and General Services, General Elucation, Training and Qualifying, and
Supervision and Evaluation. The Ministry is headed by a Minister and a Vice Minister who are
supported by seveal Deputy Ministers and other senior staff. Directorates-General of Education are
responsible for local adminisraon at the governorae level. The Ministry of Higher Education was
recentiy abolished; its former functions arm now performed by the Ministry of Education. The key
providers of vocational trai ing are the Ministries of Education and of Social Services and Labor.
B. Malor Sedor Isues
2.04         The past emphasis on quantitative expansion has led to imbalances and quality
deficiencies. One major imbalance can be seen in Table I above: male enrollment in the system is three
times aS large as female enollment. The only exception is adult literacy training where female students
exceed males. Present education facilities are il equipped to train the needed manpower for the
economy. Moreover, inadequate teacher qualifications, overcrowded and poorly maintained school
buildings, insufficient instruction materWis and the absence of reliable testing have led to low
achievements among students and graduates.
2.05         Aetion needs to be focused on three major issues: access and equity, quality of
education, and manpower training. Present imbalances and deficiencies in education and training would
continue without major improvements in these three areas, and the effectiveness of the system remain
suboptimal.
2.06         Accessand Equt  Virtually all boys are attending school at the primary level. In urban
areas, especially in Sana'a Aden and Taiz, participation of girls is also high, although it still lags
somewhat behid that of boys. Ihere may be some renote areas where access to prmim education
remains difficult, but the mber of boys wot in school is insignificant. The situation is very different,
however, for girls. In rural areas, enrollment rates for girls are much lower than those for boys. Ihis
is partdy the result of traditional attitudes which discourage female education. It also reflects the shortage
of female teachers, who are more acceptable to parents for girls' education.
2.07         The under-representaton of girls continues in virtually all other streams of education (see
Table 1). In teacher training, for example, the share of female enrollment is as low as 14 percent. This
is all the more regrettable as the avaiability of female teachers would be essential for greater participation
of girls in genal education. Other crucial areas where female representation remains inadequate are
secondary education, vocational training, training of health workers and higher education. Increased
female access to seondary education is a precondition for enabling more women to continue career
preparation in these areas.

2.08          Zuat of Euon. improving the quality of educaton shoud be a priority objective
for the coming years. The principal factors contributing to present low levels of achievement and
efficiency are: (i) a shortacge of well-qualified teachers; (ii) outdated curricula and lack of teaching
materials; (iii) unsatisfactory student evaluation; (iv) weak school management; and (v) inadequate
physical facilities.
2.09         The rapid expansion of general education resulted in a surge of demand for teachers.
Until recendy, this demand has been met largely through recruitment of teachers from other Arab
countries, particularly Egypt and Syria. Twenty-five percent of teachers in primary and unified schools,
and as many as 47 percent in preparatory and secondary schools, were expatriates in 1990191. The
foreign exchange cost of employing these teachers became excessively high. Moreover, expatriates have
come to occupy positions which could eventually be filled by Yezuenis. Training of local teachers is
therefore a high priority for the Government. However, the system of teacher training in Yemen is still
evolving, and the quality of graduates remains uneven. The rapid replacement of expatriate teachers
following unification, often with untrained high school graduates, exacerbated the problem. As a result,
the quality of teaching has further declined.
2.10         Curricula and learning resources are generally inadequate for most educational streams,
including the training of teachers. More emphasis needs to be given to math and scienee teaching in
geea education; to the updating of instruction programs in technical and vocational schools; and to the
interrelations between the two. Teacher support mat-ials, audio-visual aids and student libraries are
rarely available. In addition, textbooks are in short supply and poor condition.
2.11         The existing system of student evaluation is outmoded and of doubtfil reliability. Most
examinations set and administered by MOE are valid as curricula based assessments. However, the
reliability of MOE's Grade 6, 9, and 12 examinations has not been evaluated and the level of difficulty
of various tests has not been standardized over time. As a result, pass rates on these examinations
fluctuate greatly from year to year, significantly reducing their utility for evaluating the impact of
educational policy changes. Improving the quality of examinations prepared by MOE requires greater
technical experse in tests and measurements, and additional resources for routine statistical analysis of
examination results.
2.12         Another area of concemn is school management. The absence of qualified Yemeni
professionals, together with local political pressures, often resulted in the appointment of unqualified
community leaders as headmasters. Additionally, 25% of schools are without headmasters. Weaknesses
in school administration are becoming severe as a result of these factors. Training of headmasters and
preparation of guidelines for school management is a high priority. These programs should focus on
academic leadership, school management and community involvement in school administration. More
fully trained headmasters will facilitate educational planning through contributing to a systemwide
educational database to be established and operated by MOE.
2.13         Support systems for decision making and planning also need attention. Absence of a
dataase and decision support system for guiding planners on alternative options has led to a prevalence
of ad hoc decision making, affecting the efficiency and quality of the system. An effective system of
plamning, supported by a continmously updated database, would be instrumental in developing norms and
standards with regard to teacher loads, class sizes, and physical facilities and would facilitate coordinated
decision making at all levels.

2.1AS         n g       re. Formal tical education and vocational training (IEVB ) begn
in 1970 with the establishment of a Technicad Secondary School in Sana'a. In subseq.,e t years, as the
needs for skilled manpower increased In the industi, commercial, griculul ad heldth sector,
additional instituons were established by a variety of agencies, both public and private. However,
despite this epansion, the TEVT system remains small and does not come close to meeting the demand
for silled manpower.
2.16         The situon is eveni worse for post-secondary education. Very few middle-leve
manpower tranng facilities exist, yet demand for such sklls appears to be strong and is likely to grow
as the economy diversifies and expands. A few post-secondary insttes curreny exist to train pimary
school btachers and health cre workers. However there are no community colleges which cater to the
demanis of other minists or to the needs of private firms for accountants, technicias, computer
oeators, middle-evel managers, etc. Thi type of education could be expanded with the active
particpation of the private setr and its quality enhanced through cost recovery mehanisms including
stdent fes. Prvate enterprises must often recruit expatriates who have appropriate skis and
periene, at much higher wages than Yemenis are normOlly paid. Recetly, there has been a small but
growing umber of Ymenis with univeasity degrees who cannot find employment in the public sector
and therere tun to the private sector. Such candidates are usualy overqualified acadically while
lacking the more practical training which is actually in demand.
C. aflfnmmLdi mdQDI.oilt
2.17         The National Refotm Program (para. 1.06) emphasizes the need for changes in the
education and traing system. Acknowledging present shortcomings in the sector, the program calls
for improving the quality of basic and secondary education; increasing the enrollment of girls; evnding
education fiaities in underserved areas; strengthening vocational taig and technical education; and
diversifying the output of higher education.'
2.18         In the cur   decade, the Government's strategy for education and training is therefore
concentrang on meeting the basic education and literacy needs of a growing populaon; str hening
and diversifying programs for human capital formaion to genera  needed labor skills; and Impoving
gender equt  in access to education and  aining.  As In other sectors, much of the emphasis in
education development will be placed on Instiution building, policy formulation and promoting
Involvement of the private sector. Unlike in the past where education was viewed as the sole
responsbilit of the public sector, the government now favors the establishment of private educadon
fcilties inluding schools, communty colleges and universities which are linked to the needs of local
labor market.

2.19         Specific programs in support of this strategy are being articulated in the Government's
annual investment programs, and will become the focus of the first medium-term development plan (1996-
2000) for the united Yemen.
D. 1FSnanding Educational Development
2.20         Financing recurrent expenditures and investments mandated in the Government's strategy
fbr education and training will require major additional resources. The broad magnitudes of these
expenditures until the end of the current decade have been estimated and reviewed with the Government,
and are shown in Table 2. Assumptions underlying the estimates are discussed below.
2.21         Cgst Estimates: Future demand for basic education will be determined by population
growth; increasing enrollment rates for girls; and government policy to expand education facilities in
underserved areas, including a more active adult literacy program. Taking into account these factors,
enrollment in primary education between 1992 and 2000 would increase by about one-third with higher
growth rates for girls than for boys. To meet this demand, and to reduce overcrowding in urban schools,
more than twenty thousand classrooms would have to be built at a cost of US$250 million. Recurrent
expenditures would have to be increased in step with the student population; in addition, allowances
would have to be made for quality improvements and maintenance. Enrollment in non-formal education
programs could be doubled at relatively little expense.
2.22         Secondary education (grades 7-12) is critical to the development of skllls relevant to the
economy. Given the secondary education GER of 32%, total enrollment should grow at a higher rate
(about 7% p.a.) than for primary education (3.3% percent p.a.). Moreover, the quality of secondary
education needs to be improved, and a stronger focus on science is required. Recurrent expenditures
could almost double during the 8 year period, and about US$300 million would be needed to construct
14,000 new classrooms.
2.23         To support the expansion in primary and secondary education and to replace expatriate
teachers, the number of Yemeni teachers will have to almost double. The capacity for teacher training,
developed under two completed and two ongoing IDA supported projects, is adequate to meet the
requirements for the coming years (Annex 1). There is, however, a need for more in-service training
and for a larger share of trained female teachers. Recurrent expenditures for teacher training would not
increase much, and no new investments would be needed.
2.24         Attendance in the present TEVT programt is low because of poor quality and lack of
labor market relevance. To meet the growing demand for skilled workers and technicians in production
and service sectors, a major effort is required to strengthen these programs and make them more
attractive for potential participants. The number of students enrolled in TEVT is projected to double by
the year 2000 with female enrollments increasing more rapidly than overall growth. In view of the
planned quality enhancement measures and increased enrollment, recurrent expenditures would more than
double and US$100 million would be required for capital investments.
2.25         Higher education at Sana'a and Aden universities expanded rapidly during the 1980s.
Excluding post-secondary teacher training, there were about 29 thousand students enrolled in 1992, most
of whom studied social sciences and humanities; this number is projected to double by the year 2000.



.7.-
Demand for higher education is strong, partdy because it is free, but also because admission requirements
are not rigorous. In view of the difficulties university graduates face in finding employmnt wPlh solely
academic qualifications, and the acute shortage of middle level manpower in the emerging modern sectors
of the economy, the Government has decided to develop labor market oriented two-year education and
training programs. Including these programs, recurrent expenditure in higher education would rise to
YR2.2 billion by 2000 and US$220 million in investment cost would be required over the same period.
A move toward two-year labor market oriented programs would ease the unit oosts of post-secondary
education.

education and trainipg would rise from YR 10.1 billion in 1992 to YR 17 billion in 2000 (constant

mainly from the oil setor, most of which is expected to materWize during the second half of the 1990s.
Second, some savings could be generaed through cost efficiency gains. Ihis would include phasing out
student subsidies; streamliing programs for teacher training and vocational education; better utilization
of education facfiities; and improvements in school management. Tird, additional re ces could be
mobilized through use fees or other forms of commmnity participation. For communt colleges, uitdon
fees are expected to cover about 40% of recurrent expenditures. Local communities will participate in
school maintenance, and multiple use of textboobk will be encouraged. Table 3 below illustrates the
magnudes involved. f for any reson some of these resourcs do not materialize, priority ought to be
given to quality Improvemen  over farther physical expansion, especily in secondary and higher
education.

2.27         Investment reuiremets for educadonal development are estimated to reach the equivalent
of US$ 900 milion during the eight year period of 1993 - 2000. Much of the finding needed to finance
these bestments Is likely to be provided by foreign donors who in the past have strongly supported
human developmet in Yemen. Durng the tr  years 1989 - 1991, disbursement of foreign assistance
for education averaged US$54 milion per year. Similar if not greater support can be expected for the
coming years. Another source of finace would be contributions ftom local communities which, in the
past, have played a najor role in the construction of rural schools. Private fimding for all stages of
education has been expanding in recent years, and represents another vein of resource for the education
sector. A private community college has already been started in Sana'a. In Hadramout a private
University project is In an advanced stage of preparation. Several private schools for basic education have
recently opened, and more are expected for the near fute. Remaining investments requirements would
have to be funded through the govenment budget.

2.28         MDA's lending strategy in Yemen has supported government plans to establish a moden
edu6ation and training system, and has been closely associated with the development of appropriae sector
policies. Educadonal objectives and staegies were reviewed in a recent IDA study on human
development and the fdings were discussed with the Government in February 1992. As a result of
this review, IDA's assistance stegUy Is focussing on helping the Yemeni Government to: (I) improve
Ieaing achivements In prima and secondary schools and increase access at low costs, especily for
gils, in primary and secondary education; (ii) expand the TEVT system with special atention to quality
ehacement through participation of industry in program planning and management; and (iii) make
highe educaton responsive to labor market needs and slow its expansion in order to reverse the decline

2.29         Over the past two decades, IDA has supported 14 education projects in Yemen with a
tot fnacial commiment of US$150 million. Ten projects have been completed and four are at various
stes of implemeion. Ihe focus of IDA lending has been to promote: primary and secondary teacher
training with specil emphasi on women teachers; quality improvements and equity in basic education;

the developmnt of skilled manpower through vocational training, techician training and engineering
education; the expansion of non-formal education, particularly in rural areas; public administraon
training; and the development of planning and research capabilites in MOE. The earlier projects
focussed on literacy, teacher training, capacity development In tfie MOE and other aspec related to the
quantative expansion experienced throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Only recendy have the government,
IDA and the donor community been able to shift their attention to access and equity, quality enhancement
of education and development of skdlled manpower.
2.30         The completed projects have generally been successfild, achieving most of the stated
objeives. Ongoing projects are being implemented as planned, although some serious delays in
disbursements began in 1989. The Government's reaction to IDA supervision and country portfolio
performance review initiatives since 1989 has resulted in marked improvements in the pace of both
implementation and disbursements over the past three years (disbursements increased from US$4 million
in FY91 to US$8 million in FY92 and US$12 million in FY93).
2.31         From the experience of ongoing and completed projects, the following lessons have
emerged: (i) project design must be flexible enough to allow for changes in priorities due to unification
(Education m, Cr. 915-YAR); (ii) cofinancing must be confirmed prior to project effectiveness
(Education IV, Cr. 1203-YAR); and (iii) prior Government commitment must be obtained for appropriate
levels of technical assistance (Education m, Cr. 915-YAR).

3.01         The proposed project would assist the Government in implementing its education sector
policy reforms and in improving Yemen's human resource development capacity to meet the emerging
needs of the economy. This would be achieved through a Planned Change Program (PCP) described in
paragraph 3.11 below, for implemendng the following major sector policy objectives: (a) enhancement
of the leaming achievements of secondary students with special emphasis on science and mathematics
education and quality of teaching; (b) improvement in the access of girls to secondary education; and (c)
establishment of labor market-oriented two-year post-secondary education programs, cnvering business,
commerce, and industry.
3.02         To support the PCP the project would finance a portion of the Government's overall
Investment program under a sector investment credit (see Table 2).

3.03         The policy framework for secondary (grades 7 - 12) and post-secondary non-university
education is based on Government priorities established in 1992 (para 2.17) and has been designated as
the Planned Change Program. The Program has been careflly developed in a participatory manner with
the actve involvement of teachers, headmasters, supervisors, MOE officials and pnvate sector
repr   Ives n order to genmrae the commitment needed to implement cmge. IDA, with assistan
from lapamese PEIRD &uds, played a catalytic role in developing the Program.

postsecondary education Program were also held in July, 1992. Similar Workshops were held in Aden
and Taiz In order to gain greater paticipation and commitment, and all Workshop findings were
prested to senior MOE officials for validation and refinement. A final Program was presented to IMA
duing the preparation mission in November, 1992. Working groups were established for each Change
Area and subprojects developed jointy by teams of Yemeni professionals, IDA staff and expatriate
consultants. Tne Program was formally submitted to IDA during the appraisal mission in the form of
a Sector Development Policy Statement (Annex 2). Assmances were obtained during n'iabons -b :
(i) the Government will implement the policies articulated in the Policy Statement and that it will seek
IDA ageement to any changes in these policies during the implementation period; and (ii) that a line item
for quality improvement will be established in the MOE budget starting in 1995, to be continued
througbout the life of the project, and that IDA will be informed of the amounts allocated.
3.05         The PCP consists of eight Change Areas. The strategies for implementing the policy
objectves wiftin each Change Area, at the national as well as the school level, are summarized below.
Objective 1: Enhacmet of secondary student learning.
3.06         At the            thinal Wag, this would include:
(a)    Phyial PaUitie  Improvement in the learning environment through reduction of
overcrowding, provision of equipment particularly for science and mathematics, provision of furniture,
maintenance of school buildings and equipment.
(b)    Teacher Performance: Improvement of teacher performance through development of
training modules and provision of summer schools and school-based training.
(c)    Curculum Del2gg=: Development of curricula, textbooks and teacher guides in
all subjects, with a special focus on science and mathematics, to promote active learning and creative
thking; esbshment of a condnuous curriculum renewal process through strengthening of instiutional
caacity.
(d)    Sool Maaeet Upgrading the skills and effectiveness of headmaters, inspectors
and spevisors through training programs and manuals and improving sector policy development through
establihment of a Management Information System (MIS).
(e)    L:ning R      :  Improvement in leaing resources through development of science
kits and provision of books to school libraries, and tirough pilot projects for introduction of computers
(Grades 11 and 12), use of TVIVCR for teaching, and strengthening audio-visual aid facilities.
(t)    Envaataon: Improvement of student evaluation and measurement at the school level and
development of quaeonritem banks through strengthening of institutional capacity.
Objective 2: Improvenent of female access
3.07         Improvement of female access to secondary schools in underserved areas dtrough
provision of additional schools and classrooms, development of home-based learning programs, a media
campaign, and insdttung career advancemen opporhtties for women teachers as counsellors,
hmi_Mm and supvisors.

Objective 3: Provion of labor market oriented post-secondary programs
3.08         Provision of labor market oriented post-secondary educaton and training programs to
meet community and regional needs for middle-level manpower through establishment of a countrywide
communty coUege system governed by a National Community College Council (NCCC), establishment
of community colleges, and establishment of a teacher education program to meet staffing needs of the
system.
3.09         At the sdocl lel the Program would support school-based initiatives for enhancing
secondary school students' learning achievements, with an emphasis on science and mathematics
education, improving the quality of teaching, and expanding female access to secondary schools. It's
scope would include subprojects in one or more of the areas addressed at the national level.
C. butl, h
3.10         Capacity to plan, implement and sustain reform and change is built into the project
through the following instittional framework (further elaborated in Chapter IV, paras 4.024.09):
(a)    Establisent of the Project Development Monitoring Agency (PDMA), which will
perform the traditonal IDA functions of appraisal, supervision, monitoring, evaluation and allocation of
credit fmds, based on agreed criterha and procedures (pan. 4.034.06);
(b)   Institutional development of concerned subsectoral entities to enable them to achieve the
overriding objecdve of the project, better planning and management of change, and ensure
institionalizaion of reform (para. 4.07, 4.08);
(c)    Establishment of a governance structure for the community college system through the
creation of the NCCC with representation of the private and public sectors (Annex 6);
(d)    Establishment of mechanisms for the identification of key sectoral issues and problems
in each Change Area, formulation of strategies for addressing these problems, and design and
implementation of relevant subprojects with the involvement of concerned Yemeni teachers and
professionals at national, regional, and school levels.
D. The lPlaned Change Pro&m
3.11        TIheProgram Includes national and school-based subprojects designed to address thebroad
policy objectives desced above (paras. 3.06-3.09). During appraisal, 25 subprojects were appraised
joinly by IDA staff, MOE representadtves and designated PDMA staff (see Annex 3, Subproject
Summaries and its Attachment, Sample Implementtion Schedules).3  Interdependencies between
subpwrojec, both witin and between Change Areas, were taken ino account during the planning and
scheduling of subprojecs. Ibis was done through network planning strategies which identify critical

PhysIcal Failitie:  mBas Cts: U1S 11.0 m)
3.12          The objective of this Change Area is to improve the physical conditions necessary for
effecdve teaching and learning in secondary schools. Ihis would be achieved through the strategies
described in paragraph 3.06(a).
3.13         Two subprojects which would contribute to the improvement of physical facilities have
been appraised. The first is aimed at reducing overcrowded classes, which are found primarily in urban
schools. t will also provide additional classrooms and/or schools for girls to expand female enrollment
in urban areas. In addition, it will promote the use of double shifting and will redistribute pupils among
schools so that primary and secondary pupils are served by separate schools. The second subproject will
provide science and other school equipment, as well as furniture, to secondary schools. A third
subproject for mainenance of school buildings and equipment, with contributions from both government
and non-government sources, is under preparation and is based on a maintenance study recently
completed under the Teacher Training Project [Cr. 1773-YEM].
3.14         The major outcomes of these subprojects would be: reduction in class size to 50 or less
in urban coeducational and boys schools through the addition of some 250 classrooms; expansion of girls
enrollment in urban schools through the addition of some 80 classrooms (or 160 classes using double
shift); provision of essental and cost-effective science equipment for grades 10 - 12; ptovision of
furniture and other school equipment to all secondary schools; and establishment of maintenance
procedures for all secondary schools.
Teacher Perfirmance: (Bs Costs: US 0.&m)
3.15          The objective of this Change Area is to upgrade the effectiveness of teachers in
secondary education to enhance the leaming achievements of students. ITis would be achieved through
the strategies described in paragraph 3.06(b).
3.16         Three closely interelated subprojects have been appraised. The objective of the first is
to produce a comprehensive range of training modules for use in various training situations. The modules
would focus on the development of general pedagogical skills required of all teachers. The two other
subprojects would establish inservice training systems through the provision of summer schools for
teachers and by developing a school-based system of inservice education.
3.17         The major outcomes of these subprojects would be: a comprehensive system of inservice
staff development for all teachers; the devolution of responsibility for staff development to schools
through a system of school-based inservice training; the production of training resources for inservice

education of teachers; and the establishment of summer sdhools for teachers to enhance professiona
development and disseminate innovations.
Curriculum Developmen: Bae Costs. USN  .lm)
3.18         The objective of this Change Area is to establish a sustainable curriculum development
process responsive to changing needs, particularly with regard to science, mathematics, environmenal
education, and the development of textbooks and teacher guides. This would be achieved through the
states described in paragraph 3.06(c).
3.19         Three subprojects in this Change Area have been appraised. The first would strengthen
insdtutional capacity of the Curriculum Development Department (CDD) of the Educational Research and
Development Center (ERDC) in order to establish an effective curriculum development process. Ihe
second and third subprojects would initiate and complete the first cycle of curriculum renewal and
produce prototypes of textbooks, teacher guides and laboratory manuals, by applying the processes
developed through the first subproject. Science, mathematics and environmental education will be dealt
with in the second subproject and remaining subjects in the third.
3.20         The outcomes of these subprojects would be: a curriculum development model for
sendary education appropriate to Yemen; a pool of resource persons with expertise in curriculum
developmen processes including instructional materials development; an educational resource centar;
stregthened instituonal capability in the CDD; and renewed curricula, textbooks and teacher guides for
al subjects.
Sdool Mgment: (Base Con: USS 1.6m)
3.21         The objective of this Change Area is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of school
adminitat  In order to improve policy making, resource utilization and students' learning achievements
at all levels. This objective would be achieved through the strategies described in paragraph 3.06(d).
3.22         Three subprojects in this Change Area have been appraised. The first would establish
a computer-based information system to serve the planning and development needs of the Ministry of
Education and to provide required baseline and contemporary data for monitoring progress of the PCP.
Ihe second and third subprojects would focus on improving management skills of headmasters.
Management mamuas would be produced and distnbuted to all schools and a system of training and
supervision would be developed to ensure that these are used effectively. All present and prospective
headmaters and deputy headmasters would attend training programs. At least 20% of places in training
programs would be reserved for females.
3.23         The major outcomes of these subprojects would be: the availability of data for effective
decision making and planning; better leadership in schools, resulting in a more eftive and efficient
teaching force; greater community participation in school management; and increased capacity of
secondday schools to directly contribute to the PCP.

providing emerging education technology applications In the Yemeni context. This objective would be
achieved through the strateies described in paragraph 3.06(e).
3.25         Four subprojects in this Change Area, with a main focus on science and mathematics,
have been appraised. Affordable resources would be made more widely available through upgrading the
facilities of the Media Resources Production Center to develop science kits, posters and models. Three
pilot subprojects would concentate on introduction of computers in 10 schools; use of educational TV
and VCR in 25 schools in addition to enhancement of production capacity for TV teaching programs; and
improvement of school libraries, including additional books in 40 schools and the development of 10
model school libraries. The pilot subprojects would be evaluated by the PDMA to determine the
viability, efficiency and sustanabiity of the widespread adoption of materias or strategies tested in the
subproject.
3.26         Ihe major outcomes of these subprojects would be experimentation with a variety of
modern learing resources and installation of teaching methods appropriate to these resources.
Additionally, the Government would be able to direct investments as appropriate after reviewing
evaluation studies of pilot subprojects. Development of a capacity to design low cost leaming resources
and deliver these to schools would meet the need for materials which schools are presently unable to
afford as these materials are currently available only as imports.
Evakuaion: MM Cost: US,1.&ml
3.27    The objective of this Change Area is to improve the reliability, comparability and validity of
the student asm  t system and to introduce Comprehensive Achievement Tests (CAT I & II) in grades
9 and 12. These objectives would be achieved through the strategies described in paragraph 3.06(t3.
3.28         Three subprojects have been appraised in this Change Area. The first would strengthen
the institutional capability of the General Directorates for Evaluation, Guidance and Supervision in order
to develop and implement an effective model for evaluation. The second would provide a student
sessment mamual for teachers, supervisors and headmasters and would establish a national system of
anual tests (CAT I & II) in grades 9 and 12 to provide continuous feedback to schools. The third would
develop a questionritem bank to facilitate quality improvement of in-school student assessment through
testng higher level abilities as opposed to rote learning.
3.29         The outcomes of these subprojects would be: a pool of resource persons with expertise
in different aspects of evaluation; an assessment scheme emphasizing application and enquiry;
establishment of a process for analWyzing results and providing feedback to schools; an integrated system
of inschool assessment and related training handbooks and manuals; trained personnel for inplementng
the intgrated system; and a pmcess for writing, processsing, banking and tetrieving items.
Objetive 2: llnproving Female Access (Base Costs: US$ 4.9m)
3.30         The objective of this Change Area is to expand female access to secondary schools in
underserved areas. This objective would be accomplished through the strategies described in paragraph
3.07.
3.31         Tbree subprojects in this Change Area have been apiraised. The first would provide new
schools, equipment and furnhre for girls, according to agreed criteria, in currently underserved areas



- 15 -
learning program for girls in rural areas who have completed primary education but are unable to
continue with secondary schooling. The third would initiate a media campaign to facilitate and promote
the education of girls. Trainig of female headmasters, supervisors and counsellors would be
accomplished under the school management Change Area (see paragraph 3.22).
3.32        TMe main outcomes of these subprojects would be the design and implementation of
interventions for girls, which could be adopted nationwide as appropriate. These interventions would
include development of new courses and relevant learning materials for girls in rural areas; an increase
in female participation at aU levels beyond Grade 6; and greater work force participation of rural women
in the long-term.
School Based Subprojects mBase Costs: USS 0.8m)
3.33         The objective of school-based subprojects would be to encourage teachers and
communities to adopt innovative development approaches in schools in order to: (i) take maximum
advantage of the physical and material resources; (ii) implement curricula using innovative approaches;
Ciii) foster improved teaching methods; (iv) encourage better school management; (v) support expanded
access of girls to education; (vi) upgrade learning resources; and (vii) improve assessment procedures.
3.34         The scope of the program was developed in a national seminar with the participation of
headmasters and supervisors during the preparation phase. An outline of the objecdves, scope, criteria
for selection and organizational arrangements for school-based subprojects is provided in Annex 5.
Schools may submit requests for funding from a pedagogic find established and administered by the
PDMA.
3.35         Support would be provided for the purchase of equipment, materials, technical assistance
and relevant local costs. Criteria for approval would include: (i) relevance to needs of the school; (ii)
feasibility of capacity, time-frame and resources; (iii) ability of the school to transfer experience gained;
and (iv) sustainability of the outcomes.
3.36         On an average US $10,000 could be allocated for each subproject providing for 14 or 15
subprojects per year. Proposals would be accepted twice a year for appraisal by PDMA, which would
allocate funds against agreed criteria detailed in the PDMA Operating Manual.
3.37         The major outcomes of the school-based subprojects would be to encourage school based
hmovation and widespread dissemination of best practices. Teacher based initiatives within the scope of
the seven Change Areas mentdoned above would mirror, at the school level, national activities supported
by the PCP. This tewacher initiative would enrich and contribute to the sustainability of the PCP.
Objective 3: EstablUshent of Post-Secondary Education Programs for the Preparation of
Middle-Level Manpower (ae Costs: US$ 14.8m)
3.38         The objective of this component would be to establish a national community college
system to meet community and regional needs for middle-level manpower, while concurrently meeting
the needs of young adults (secondary school graduates) in preparing for employment and long-term career
development. lhe proposed community colleges would offer occupationally oriented two-year, post-
secondary education and trainig programs which culminate in a post-secondary diploma. The colleges
would be closely linked to local and regional employers through business and industry participation in



. 16 -
curriculum and program planning and institutional management. The programs they offer would therefore
be appropriate and relevant to the needs of the respective communities.
3.39         Because the country is currently at a critical stage in its economic development program,
this component is an especially high priority for education sector investment. Employers in the
commercial, industrial, and social sectors, while striving to expand, update, and upgrade their operations,
are limited by the serious shortages of adequately trained middle-level manpower (i.e. computer
applications specialists, unit managers, technicians, accountants, and other such paraprofessional
persomel). Several labor market studies and surveys which give credence to the employers' verbally
reported needs have recently been completed (Annex 6). There Is therefore considerable justification for
establishing a post-secondary education and training system to meet identified needs.
3.40         Curricula would be designed to prepare graduates for a cluster of job opportunities within
a broad discipline area, thus enhancing job selection prospects and providing flexibility for individual
career development and job mobility. The program specializations would vary from one institution to
another, and would reflect the needs of the area which the respective college serves. To ensure continued
relevance, program specializations would be added and/or deleted in each institution as the regional labor
market changes. In addition to diploma programs, these institutions would also provide short-term
training (both individual and industry sponsored) to range from a few days to several weeks or months,
to upgrade or update employed persons, as a means of increasing their productivity and promotion
opportunities. Such short-term training would also be used to introduce new production proces-es and
technical applications, including the use of new computer software.
3.41         Four subprojects have been appraised and a fifth would be considered by the Government
at a later date for possible inclusion. All are directed toward establishing the proposed national
community college system. A general description of each subproject is provided in the following
paragraphs and a more detailed description of the community college component is included as Annex
6 to this report.
3.42         Govnn  Framework for the Community Collee System (Base Costs: USS D.2m}.
This subproject would support the development of a national famework and governance structure for
operating the proposed community college system. The key element in the governance structure would
be the NCCC, with membership selected from among recognized leaders in both the private and public
sectors. The NCCC would be established outside the bureaucracy of the Ministry but remain
administatively linked to i.
3.43         The Council would formulata policy and set academic and operational standards and
guidelines for the CC system. These policies and standards would apply to all two-year post-secondary
institutions in the country, regardless of their sponsoring/funding ministry, including private colleges
which are beginning to develop. An Executive Directorate would serve as the NCCC's executing agency
or operational arm to transmit and carry out its policies and directives. The project would support
required office equipment in the new Directorate and TA support summarized in Annex 7.
3.44         Sna Community Cle   Base COt: U    6.7ml. The Sana'a CC would be
established in a facility presently occupied by the Sana'a Technial Secondary School (TSS). The TSS
would, in effect, be upgraded to post-secondary status. The college would be established in three phases
with the first third of the program beginning in 1995, the second third beginning in 1996, and the final
group starting in 1997. The specialization areas would be organized under two major categories:
Euznnd&I TehnIg  with programs in electronics and computer technology, construction
managemen_  and automotive technology; and Business md Mmagement with office management,
entspris management, computer software applications, and hospitality and tourism management
progms. Business and industry linkges would be established through local business leaders serving



- 17 -
on the College Board of Governors (CBG) and local specialists serving on the program advisoty
committees.
3.45         Project funds would be provided for renovating and equipping the existing buildings and
adapting them to the special needs of the community college. Fu.nds would also be made available for
consultant services and fellowship training abroad (Annex 7). This subproject would be implemented
concurrently with the Aden CC subproject, so that technical assistance consultants would be shared and
fellowship training grouped for economies of scale.
3.46         Aden Community College fBase Costs: US$ 7Snmi'. This subproject would establish
the Aden CC in a facility currently being used by the Commercial Institute in the Kormaksar area of
Aden. Ihe facility is being converted from a mixed secondary/post-secondary to a solely post-secondary
institution. The Aden CC would be established and operated in the samne manner as the Sana'a College
and would also be implemented in three phases. It would establish the same types of linkages with the
Aden area, regional business and industrial leaders and technical specialists, as are described above for
the Sana'a CC. The two subprojucts would be implemented in parallel, with equipment specifications
and tendering for the two institutions to be carried out simultaneously.
3.47         Project support would be provided for building renovations, instructional equipment, and
technical assistance. Technical assistance (consultants) would be shared by both institutions (Aden and
Sans'a) and there would be collaboration between the two on fellowship training arrangements in order
to enhance the effectiveness of training and achieve greater economies of scale.
3.48         Techical Teacher Education Program (Base Costs: USS 0.4m). This subproject would
support the establishment and development of a technical teacher education department and program in
the Faculty of Education at the University of Sana'a. This would be a key element of the community
college component as successful implementation of the community college system will depend in great
measure on the availability of qualified teachers and administrators for leading colleges in their formative
years.
3.49         Because the community colleges and the type of post-secondary, occupationally oriented
programs which they provide would be a new concept for education and manpower training in Yemen,
there are presently very few teachers who understand the philosophy of community colleges and could
provide appropriate instruction. It will therefore be necessary to establish a teacher education program
designed specifically to provide the required technical and instructional skills needed by the commun1ity
college staff.
3.50         The proposed technical teacher education departnent would offer both Bach-'ors and
Masters programs, accepting selected graduates from the community colleges and other similar post-
secondary institutions for admission to the Bachelors degree program. The proposed department would
establish a cooperative arrangement with Sana'a Community College to teach some of the Bachelors
advanced technical course-work in the CC laboratories, and with other relevant departments at the
University to teach advaned course-work for the Masters program. Graduates from the Bachelors
program could teach at the vocational and technical secondary schools or go on for a Masters program
and ultimately teach in the community colleges or other post-secondary occupationally oriented
instiutions.
3.51         The subproject would include instructional equipment appropriate for the teacher
education program and TA and fellowships summarized in Annex 7.
3.52         Durn  nenU    asurances were obtained that: (i) a governance structre for the
Conmumnitv CllWege evtem. with maioritv 1rivsatA sctor renresentation- would be established by March



- 18 -
a fee structure would be in operation by June 30, 1995; and (iv) technical teacher training programs for
Community Colleges would be initiated at the University of Sana'a Faculty of Education by October 1,
1994.
IV. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT, IMPLEMENTATION,
COBS AND FINANCING PLAN
4.01         The Government's Planned Change Program (PCP) is a comprehensive long term strategy
for the development of human resources and skilled manpower. The Government is committed to
carrying out the PCP (pam 3.03-3.09) but realizes that it will require more than the life of this project
to accomplish the Program's objectves. The proposed project therefore represents Phase I of the PCP.
Any reform program with such a long term focus requires evaluation and adjustments at different stages.
The sector approach provides the necessary flexibility for making adjustments as the Program progresses,
promotes application of objective criteria for the allocation of funds to subprojects, and encourages
cooperation and coordinadon among the beneficiaries through an Intermediary Agency, the PDMA.
A. Pram lMgone
4.02         Manaement Structure. Design of the management structure of the proposed project is
shaped by three key factors agreed with the MOE: (a) to avoid bureaucratic practices and to increase
accountability, Subproject Directors should be professionally qualified individuals from within or outside
of MOE; (b) successful implementation of the program would not be possible without ensuring
management of the project according to MOE policy and developing ownership of the project at various
levels of the MOE; and (c) present expertise in the education sector is dissipated and there is no critical
mas relevant to any Ch2nge Area in any single institution. The management structure of the proposed
project would ensure ta the best expertise in the country is utilized on a consulting basis, ensuring
effective and efficient Implementation of the project.
4.03         An Intermediary. the Project Development and Monitoring Agency (PDMA), for which
an Operadng Manual4 has been developed, would contain as its core implementation unit the well
functioning Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The PDMA would be the key institution for planning,
implementing and coordinatng the Program. It would be responsible for subproject supervision,
monitoting and evaluation and would appraise the remaining national and school-based subprojects under
preparation, and future subproject proposals. Eight professionals would be recruited to staff the new units
of the PDMA and to strengthen the existing PIU (Annex 8).
4.04         A Hiher Council chaired by the Minister of Education and including representatives from
the Mistries of Planning and Development and of Social Services and Labor, and the Secretary of the
High Tender Board, wil set policy and be responsible for: (a) approval of proposed subprojects; ()
reviewing progress reports and recommending actions; (c) authorizing resources for subprojects; (d)
evaluatig progress of the Program and determining appropriate changes of the Program's scope or
emphasis. The Higher Council will have an Executive Secretary whose key responsibility wou. ' be to
coordinate the work of the technical units of the PDMA. While the Executive Secretary has already been

- 19-
appointed and Is initiating start-up operations, the full PDMA will be established upon issuance of a
Government decree.
4.05         In addition to the existing well staffed PIU, one addidonal technical unit, the Project
Development Unit (PDU), would be created within the PDMA.' The PDU was established by the
Minister of Educadion prior to negotiations. The PlU will continue to be responsible for civil works,
equipment, fiurniture and technical assistance procurement and the maintence of accounts. Its additional
responsibility would include subproject supervision, for which two staff r-ould be added. The g2U, to
be composed of four professional staff, would be responsible for: (a) scrutiny of subproject proposals to
the Higher Council; (b) assisffng subproject proposers and resubmissions of referred subproject proposals;
(c) monitoring and evaluation of subprojec; (d) coordination of data collection and analysis to prepare
option papers for the Higher Council; (e) publicadon of a Planned Change Newsletter; and (t) submission
of progress reports to the Higher Council on program status.
4.06         Durint negytiations assurances were obtained that an adequately staffed Intermediary
Agency, designated as the PDMA, would be established by Government decree and would be maintained
throughout the life of the project according to terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. This Agency would
include the Higher Council with its Executive Secretary, the PDU, and the existing PIU. The
organizational structure of the well functioning PIU will be maintained and two persons added to its staff.
B. PronImlmentation
4.07         Subproiect Directors would be responsible for the Implementation of their subprojects
following authorizadon by the Higher Council (Annex 8, Attachment 1). However, as stated above, all
procurement actions would be performed by the PIU. To ensure effective implementation, Subproject
Directors would: (a) execute action plans as approved by the Higher Counci; (b) manage resources
allocated to the subproject; (c) direct the acivities of subproject working groups and review their
products; (d) monitor outcomes to ensure consistency with subproject objectives; (e) prepare and deliver
biannual progress reports on subproject activities, outcomes and finances to the PDMA; and (f) liaise with
the PIU on all procurement and financial matters. A short-list of candidates for Subproject Directors has
been identified and the Minister of Education has made final appointments for subprojects starting in
CY94. Expert Advisory Groups (EAGs) composed of eminent professiona!s would normally be
established for each Change Area, or for individual (or clusters of subprojects where appropriate.
Composition, size and frequency of meetings would be detennined by Subproject Directors, but EAGs
would normally consist of no more than four persons. Ihese groups would advise Subproject Directors
on subproject designs technical aspects of implementation, and evaluation methods but would have no
formal role in subproject management.
4.08         A Policy Bo   consisting of four members would be established for each Change Area.
Boards would be chaired by a Deputy Miister of Education for the sector relevant to the Change Area,
or other emient professional, ar- would include nominees of Policy Boards from italatd Change
Areas. The Mnister of Education has appointed all Policy Board Chairpersons. The Boards would ensure
congruence of subproject activities and outcomes with MOE policy, and would serve as a forum to ensure
timely coordination of interrelated subprojects. While the Boards would have no role In subproject

management, they would play an important role in eliminating bottlenecks in implementation through
providing a direct avenue for coordination of closely related activities in separate subprojects.
4.09         During negotiations assurances were obtained that a subproject management structre
consisting of Change Area Policy Boards, Subproject Directors and Expert Advisory Groups will be
established and maintained throughout the life of the project. Subproject Directors for subprojects starting
in CY94 have been appointed.
C. antus of Prle Prepration
4.10         Status of epaaion. Twenty five national subprojects have been appraised by MDA with
the involvement of MOE officials and other Yemeni counterparts. Any future subproject proposals would
be appraised by the PDMA. Criteria for appraisal of subprojects have been included in the PDMA
Operatig Manual. With regard to Community Colleges, curriculum and equipment lists are being
prepared for identified courses and will be completed by January 1994. Equipment lists for secondary
schools already exist and have been reviewed by IDA.
4.11         Architectural Design and Sites. Design services for renovation and expansion of existing
buildings designated for the Sana'a and Aden Community Colleges would be handled by architectural and
engineering consultants who would collaborate with the PIU's engineering and architectural staff. Design
fees for these two colleges are covered by a Japanese PHRD grant. Future additional design work for
commaunity colleges would be done by architectural and engineering consultants in accordance with IDA
guidelines. All other school design work for urban and rural schools would be the responsibility of the
architecture/engineering department of the PIU. All construction supervision would be handled by the
PIU. Community college facilities would be housed in existing available sites. Acquisition of sites would
only be required for new schools in rural areas, if existing acceptable sites cannot be identified.
4.12         Maintenance. Project costs include funds for maintenance of equipment and buildings.
A subproject proposal on maintenance will be completed by December 1993 (see para. 3.13).
4.13         Technical Assi=e. Six Technical Assistance packages were designed by the Change
Area working groups. The packages and detailed terms of reference were reviewed by IDA at appraisal
and a summary is given in Annex 7.
D. Monltorlnf and Evaluation
4.14                 S}ervio. The PIU would be responsible for supervising implementation
of subprojects. Individual subproject progress reports and financial statements would serve as the basis
for biannual reports to the Higher Council of the PDMA and annual progress reports to IDA. IDA's
supervision missions (Annex 9) would have access to supervision reports on each subproject and would
also undertake joint supervision with the PDMA. An integrated action plan of key implementation
activities was agreed during negotiations. ASrMan  were obtained during negotiations that annual
progress reports would be forwarded to IDA by June 30 of each year.
4.15         Eiject Monitring. Monitoring of the project as a whole, and of individual subprojects,
would identify delays and the causes of delays in accomplishing targets and would determins appropriate
actions for rescheduling activities. The PDMA would be responsible for overall project monitoring on
the basis of performance indicators shown in the Integrated Action Plan (Annex 2, Attachment).
hdividua subprojects would be monitored by the PDMA on the basis of performance indicators given
in Amex 10. Overall project monitoring will be undertaken annually. More frequent monitoring would



- 21 -
be undertaken for pilot projects and for projects fcing delays in implementation. Data obtained through
monitoring would be furnished to Subproject Directors, the MOB and IDA. The PDMA will be provided
technical assistance for the design of the monitoring system.
4.16         Subproject Directors would monitor their own subprojects on the basis of indicators
provided in subproject proposals to ensure accomplishment of targets. The PDMA and Subproject
Directors would rely on the MIS for data collection to monitor subprojects. The project monitoring
structure and subproject specific performance indicators have been agreed with the Govermment during
appraisal.
4.17         Mid-Term Evaluation. A mid-term evaluation of ;he project would be conducted jointly
by IDA and the Government no later than December 1997 and would be based on an initial review
conducted by the Executive Secretary of the PDMA. The review will use the reports mentioned in para.
4.14 and IDA supervision aide-memoires and other PDMA documents to determine: (i) the progress made
in achieving the PCP's ob*jectives; (ii) the contribution of subprojects to their respective Change Areas;
and (iii) the effectiveness of the PDMA. Through the mid-term evaluation, the Govermment and IDA will
identify examples of best practice for adoption, existing problems in the overall management of the PCP,
and the effect of Government policies on the education sector as a whole. Based on an analysis of the
results, a work program for the remaining life of the project would be implemented according to a
schedule satisfactory to IDA (Annex 11). Assuamnc  were obtained during neggiatiom that a joint
evaluation would be conducted before December, 1997 and its recommendations incorporated in an action
plan for Project implementation.
4.18         Imact Assesn. In order to assess the project's impact, baseline data and data
obtained during the life of the project would be compared with post project data. The PDMA would
establish baseline data and trends by coordinating with the MIS in the MOE to gather, analyze, and
ntepret data relevant to identified impact indicators (Annex 12). TA would be made available to the
PDMA to assist in this exercise. The impact indicators were agreed with the Government during
appraisal.
4.19         Proect Suainablity. Various project features would contribute to sustainability of the
Program. 'Te participatory approach adopted for project preparation has engendered a high degree of
ownership and commitment at all levels, which is being continued in project implementation and
management through coordinating and decision iraking structures involving different subsectors.
Institution building processes in the different Change  eas such a. curiculum development, evajuation,
teacher performance and the community college system would have continued benefits. A well planned
project monitoring system linked to final impact assessment and delineation of impact indicators in
advance would allow policy formulation in future. Finally, policy and funding commitment of the
Government to the project is strong and the increment of recurrent expenditure during and beyond project
completion is minimal. The increase in recurrent costs therefore does not threaten project sustainability
(see para 4.25). As a processes oriented initiative, the main determinant of sustainability would be the
internalization and adoption of innovative practices by various subsectors in the MOE.

4.21           Basis of Cost Estimates: Estimate  costs for construction of school faciities are based
on reviews of recent bids received by the PIU for comparable facilities. Costs of renovating existing
facilities are based on mission estiaes of the work involvdd to bring these buildings up to acceptable
standards. Furiture costs are based on existing fwrniture lists. Equipment costs are based on
specifications for about 80% of the new equipment for workshops and laboratories. For the remainder
of the faclities, equipment cost are mission estimates. Technical assistance costs of US $8,000 per man-
month of specist services and US $2,500 for fellowship trainig have been esdmated on the basis of
recent prices for comparable technical k  sistance to Yemen. Base cost estimates reflect prices as projeced
at the time of negotations.
4.22           Custo: Project costs include an esdmaed US $1.7 milion in indirect
taxes on locally procured cvil works and goods. Equipment and goods imported directly for use by
government agencies are exempt from duties and taxes.

4.23                =w                Project costs include a contingency allowance for unforesee
physical additions (US $4.3 million), equal to 10% of the estimated base cost. Price condngencies
between negotiations and the end of project implementation are estimated at US $2.4 million equivalent,
or 6% of the base cost plus physical contingencies. Total contingencies represent 16% of the base cost.
4.24         Foreign  xhagc.C=pnn: The foreign exchange component is estimated as follows:
construction and rehabilitation of existing faciities - 53%; fiuriture - 85%; equipment - 62%; training
materWl and software - 80%; specialist services - 75%; fellowships - 100%, and; local training - 30%.
The resultant foreign exchange component of the project, including contingencies, is estimated at US
$31.4 milion or 63% of total project costs.
4.25           r=           'MThe incremental recurrent costs of the Program include personnel cos
(YR112 million), mainnance costs (YR13 million) and other operational costs (YR10 million). The
project, when completed, would therefore add a total of YR135 milion annually to the recurrent costs
of the MOE (Tables 8a-d)), which represents 1.3% of MOE's 1992 recurrent expenditures.
4.26         Mect Encg: The proposed IDA credit of US$ 33.0 million and OPEC fund co-
financing of US$ 8.0 million equivalent would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange component
(US$ 31.4 million) of the project and 52 percent of the local costs (US$ 9.6 million). The Government
would finance 48 percent of local costs which amount to US$ 8.7 million (18 percent of the total project
cost). During negotiations assurances were provided by the Government that co-financing agreement with
OPEC would become effective by July 1, 1995. The financing plan is shown in Table 4.3 below:

4.27         For civil works contracts and major packages of goods suitable for Intnational
Competitive Bidding, the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank, with modifications
agreed by IDA, will be used. Goods including equipment, furniture, books, manuals, training materas
ad software esdmated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more per package would be procured in
acordance with the *Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (May 1992).
In the evaluation and comparison of bids for goods, domestic manufacturers would be granted a margin
of preferce of 15%, or the relevant duty, whichever is lower, in accordance with Appendix 2 of the
Guidlnems. Mme anounts and medhods of procurement are shown in Table 4.4. All contracts will be

(a)      I     C ete Biddin a&H. Civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$
2.0 million or less per contract up to US$10.0 million in aggregate would be awarded on the basis of
LCB procedures since the contracts are small, widely scattered geographically and unlikely to attract
foreign firms. Standard bidding documents agreed with IDA will be used. LCB procedures will: (i)
incorporate explicit statements to bidders of qualification, bid evaluation and award procedures; (ii) be
adverdsed widely in local papers, with bid openings in public; and (iii) not exclude the participation of
interested bidders from other IDA member countries.
(b)    Internadona Shoping MS. Bid packages for goods estimated to cost less than US$100,000 up
to an aggegate amount of US$3,000,000 and containing small quantities of a great variety of items,
which would not be expected to interest volume suppliers, may be awarded under IS procedures based
on comparing price quotations from at least three suppliers from at least two countries elegible under the
Guidelines in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.

(c)    LOl Shopun OM. Bid packages for goods esdmated to cost less an US$50,000 up to an
aggegate amount of US$400,000 and containing small quantities of a great variety of items, which would
not be expected to interest International suppliers, may be awarded under IS procedures based on
comparing prices from at least three suppliers eligible under the Guidelines in accordance with procedures
acceptable to WDA.
(d)    Technicad Assistace.  Technical assistance under the project would be used for project
preparationand implementation support (US$8.1 million) and instittional development (US$ 2.9 million,
including locally finded training of US$0.4 million). Most international TA (US$ 9.2 million) would
be procured through "twinning arrangements' with centers that have experience in providing consultants
as well as fellowship training. Local technical assistance (US$1.4 million) would be procured through
contractual arrangements with institutions such as the University of Sana'a and the ERDC. Ihese
arrangements will be in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency' (August 1981). During negotiations a shordist
of poteal Twin Centers was presented for IDA review.
4.29         Disuements h Ie proposed project would be disbursed over a period of about eight
years in accordance with the disbursement profile of eight and a half years for the education sector for
Yemen as stated in the Standard Disbursement Profiles of August 1993. Assurancm were obtained ddng
negotiafions *hXall contracts financed by IDA wiUl be denominated in foreign currency. Disbursements
would be made against:
a)    85% of civil works contrats.
b)    100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditues for equipment, vehicles,
books, training materials, manuals and software.
c)    100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures for consultants services and
fellowships.
4.30         Disbursements from the proposed credit are expected to take place on an average of about
4 months after expenditures are incurred. A disbursement schedule reflecting this and providing a
comparison with the above mentioned profile is shown in Annex 13. The closing date is September 30,
2001, and disbursements are expected to be completed within four months of this closing date.
4.31         Disbursements against contracs for goods and services exceeding US$ 50,000 equivalent
would be made against normal docmention. Disbursements against contcs below that level would
be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), available for examination by IDA missions.
To facilitate tmely project implementation, the Government would establish, maintain and operate, under
teams and conditions satisfactory to IDA, a special account in The Central Bank of Yemen, to which IDA
would make an initial deposit equivalent to about US$400,000. The special account would be replenished
on a monthly basis. Withdrawal applications would be supported by appropriate documentation.
4.32         Ac t Eand Audits. The PW would maintain separate accounts for the project and
woud prepare all documentio required by IDA. Project accounts, including the special account, would
be adit  in accordance with the March 1982 Bank "Guidelines for Financil Reporting and Auditng
of Projects Financed by the World Bank". IDA would be provided within six months of the end of each
fisc year with an audit report of such scope and detail as MA may reasonably request, including a
separate opinion by the auditor on disbursemens against certified statements of expenditures. The
Government provided aL%lLam to this effect during negotations.

V. BENEFIS AND RISKS
A. Benets
5.01 The principal benefit of the project would be an improvement in the quality of middle-level
manpower for which demand is already strong and likely to increase further in the coming years. This
would be achieved through improvements in the quality of secondary education and the establishment of
a national community college system. In addition, the project would increase access of females to
secondary education, especially in underserved areas, through provision of schools for 5,000 girls,
incentive programs to recruit female teachers and headmistresses, and specialized courses for female
students.
5.02 Improvements in the quality of secondary education would benefit a student population rising
from 563,000 (1992) to an estimated one million (2000). Quality would be enhanced through: (i)
internalizing innovative processes, enhancing the ability of MOE to plan, implement and manage change,
principally through the PDMA but also through various other agencies; (ii) sustained curriculum,
evaluation, and learning resources development and renewal processes; (iii) dissemination of improved
teaching thniques to replace the current focus on memory-based learning; (iv) development of capable
school leadership through provision of headms' training, and dirough establishment of an MIS; (v)
active community participation in schools through school-based subprojects.
5.03         Community colleges would provide labor-market oriented two-year post-secondary
programs enrolling some 3,000 students of business, commerce, and industry. The colleges would work
closely with private sector employers ascertaining relevance of training and engendering community
support. Over time, graduates are expected to meet the demand for middle-level positions in the areas
served by each college, including replacement of expatriate employees. Establishing a network of
community colleges would also help to relieve pressure on the universities in Sana'a and Aden.
B. ER3la
5.04         Ihere are three main risks to be addressed: First, the new unit of the Intermediary
Agency (PDMA), the Project Development Unit, is inexperienced. This rsk will be mitigated by the
provision of technical assistance through a twinning arrangement which will provide PDMA with advice
from a similar Institution, and by the core role played in the PDMA by the experienced and efficient
Project Implementation Unit. Second, b.cause many of the subprojects are interrelated, delays in
implemaon of a subproject could resull. !n bottlenecks in others. This risk will be mitigated through
representation of intrelated subprojects on common Change Area Policy Boards and through careful
training provided to PDMA staff in fadiitu ing subproject implementation. Third, bureaucratic systems
in Yemen may not adjust to private sector participation in the community college system. This risk will
be mimzed through prior agreement on the structure and composition of the NCCC, the govening
body of the system, to include a majority of private sector representation on the Council.
VL ACTIONS AGREED AND RECOMATIONS
6.01   DWIng            assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a)    The policies articulated in the Policy Statement (Annex 2) will be implemented and that
the Government will seek IDA agreement to any changes in these policies duing the

0)    An adequately staffed PDMA would be maintained with terms of reference
saisfctory to IDA during the life of the project (para. 4.06). 'he PDMA will
be established as a condition of Board Presentation.
(c)    A subproject management structure consisting of Change Area Policy Boards, Subproject
Directors, and Expert Groups would be established and numahtined throughout the life
of the project according to tenms of reference satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.09).
(d)   A goverance structure for the community college system would be
established by March 31, 1994 (para. 3.52).
(e)   Interim Directors for the community colleges in Sana'a and Aden would
be nominated by January 31, 1994 (para 3.52).
(f)    Technical teacher training programs for Community Colleges would be initiated at the
University of Sana'a, Faculty of Education, by October 1, 1994 (para. 3.52).
(g)   Technical assistance would be procured through twinning arrangements
with appropriate institutions (para. 4.28 [dl).
(h)   A line item budget for quality improvement would be included in the
governents budget starting in 1995 and would be maintained
throughout the life of the project. !DA would be informed of the amount
of budgetary alocations for quality improvement upon request (para.
3.04).
(i)    Annual progress reports based on individual subproject reports and financial statements
would be prepared and forwarded to IDA by the PDMA (para 4.14).
j)    A joint mid-term evaluation would be conducted before December, 1997 and based on
its recommendations, an action plan for the remaining life ot the project would be
implemented according to a schedule satisfactory to IDA (para 4.17).
(k)   IDA would be provided within six months of the end of each fiscal year with an audit
report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request, including a separate
opinion by the auditor on disbursements against a certified statement of expenditures
(para 4.32).
0)    Contracs to be financed by IDA will be denominated in foreign currency (para 4.29).
(m)   Key project activities would be inplemented in accordance with an
intoegrated acdon plan (para 4.14).
6.02   Subject to the above conditions, the project would provide a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
US$ 33.0 mIlion equivalent to the Govemment of Yemen.

AN&PX 1.
ADEQUACY OF CTT TEACHER-TRAINING CAPACITY
A comparison of the number of additional teachers required for supporting the program (demand) and
the mber of additional teachers trained according to the current capacity (supply) is necessary in order
to assess currat teacher taining capacity for the Planned Change Program.
Demand:      Consider the number of teachers required for secondary education (Grades 7-12) by the
year 2000-01. There are two sources of demand:
(1) Additional teachers to support the enrollment expansion between 1991-92 and 2000-01 (due mostly
to population increase): Annex 1, Table 1 indicates that between 1991-92 and 2000-01, there will be an
increase of 504,078 secondary students. Assuming a student/teacher ratio of 40:1, 12,602 secondary
teachers will be required to support the enrollment growth. Thus, a total of 13,112 secondary teachers
wiU have to be added between 1991-92 and 2000-01.
(2) Additional teachers to support the various sub-projects in the Planned Change Program: Table 2
shows the number of teachers required to support the various sub-projects. It shows that, by the year
2000, a total of 510 secondary teachers (of which 263 are female) will be needed to sustain the sub-
projects.
Supply: Secondary teachers are trained in four-year and two-year post-secondary teacher-trainig
program. Table 3 shows the number of registered students m four-year programs in 1990-91 and 1991-
92. Table 3(a) shows the number of graduates from four-year programs during the 1988-89 to 1990-91
period. Disussions with admIni rs of four-year programs indicate that about 70% of fourth-year
det graduate from their programs each year. If the enrollment pattern is maintained at the 1991-92
lvel, then there wfll be 1,690 four-year graduates per year, or 15,210 such graduates for the 1992-93
to 2000-01 perod.
Table 4 shows the number of registered students in two-year programs in 1991-92. Again, assuming a
70%   adution rate for second-year students, there will be 730 two-year graduates per year, or 6,570
suh graduates for the 1992-93 to 2000-01 period (actual number may be higher since new two-year
pgams are being added).
Comparn demnd and supply: The total supply of secondary teachers for the period 1992-93 to 2000-
01 wI be 21,780 and the total number of secondary teachers required by 2000-01 will be 13,112. Thus,
if al the graduates remain in teaching, the projected demand will be more than covered by the projected
supply. Even if only 60% of these graduates remain in teaching, the projected demand will stll be met.
Curently, 24% of secondary teachers are females. 29% of fourth-year students of four-year programs
and 30% of second-year students of two-year programs are females. If 29% of graduates are female and
they stay in teaching, hen, by the year 2000-01, there will be 1,089 additional female teachers retative
to the current level. ITese addional female teachers will more than cover the 263 female teaching posts
required to support the Sub-projects in the Planned Change Program.

6.    Evaluation
Improving the reliability of tests and examinations, providing feedback to schools on student
performance in national examinations, improvements in school-based assessment, administration of
comprehensive achievement tests at preparatory and secondary levels to act as a moderating as well as
a quality-monitoring system and the establishment of question/item bank for improving the quality of tests
and examinations.
7.    Increasing female access to secondary education
In the areas of Physical facilities, Teacher performance and School management, the strategies
include special attention to girls' schools for improving access in urban areas as well as development and
areer advancement of female teachers. In this context, the strategies include provision of additional
classrooms in existing girls' schools and construction of new girls' schools in the presently underserved
rral areas, offering home-based learning facility for girls and media ca1paigns for educating parents and
girls on the need and benefits of secondary education.
8.    Community College System
To meet the need of middle-level manpower in business and industry, the establishment of a
Community College system in the country is included in the program. This would be accomplished
through a National Community College Council with majority private sector represenion, for the
Govemance of the system. lhe establishment of Community Colleges at Sana'a and Aden, and possibly
at Taiz as well as the offering of Technical Teacher Education Programs by the Faculty of Education at
the University of Sana'a are included in the Planned Change Program.
The actions to be taken for implementing the Planned Change Program, under the different
Change Areas, the time-frame for such actions, the targets planned, and the key performance indicators
for monitoring the implementation and the accomplishment of the objectives of the Planned Cbange
Program are appended.
The Planned Change Program has the firm support of the Government of Yemen. We are
committed to the implemeion of this program in such a way that the benefits derived from its
implementation are sustined, laying the foundations for a long-term educational development in the
country. We look forward to working with the International Development Association in implement
this program.

ANNEX 5
SCHOOL-BASED SUB-PROJECIS
A.    Daft Announcemen
1.    What is A School-Based ub-project?
A school-based Subproject is a school-initiated activity with carefully defined objectives, strategies
and outcomes, which aims to improve a specific aspect of teaching and learning In a school. It is time-bound
and involves setting target dates for achieving its objectives and for the achievement of intermediate steps.
2.    Sch&oo-Based Subprojects Under the Edqcation Sect_r kvestment Project for the Republic of Yemen
Under the proposed project, the Government of Yemen plans to upgrade the quality of secondary
education (defined for this purpose as education in Grades 7 to 12) across seven areas: (i) physical resources,
(ii) curriculum, (iii) teacher performance, Civ) school management, (v) female access, (vi) taching resources,
and (vii) student evaluation. lhese reforms will be at the national level. At the same time, however, the
Government wishes to ensure that schools participate with reforms of their own, which would take maximum
advantage of changes at the national level. Schools which indicate willingness to participate are invited to
design and implement one or more school-based subprojects, supported on a competitive basis with modest
finds and materials.
3.    The-Aims of School-Based SubMoects
The aims of school-based subprojects would be to improve the quality of teaching and learning
through such development approaches as: (i) taking maxihmm advantage of the physical resources available
in a school; (ii) ensuring that the curiculum is implemented effectively and efficiently; (iii) fostering
imnproved teaching methods and standards of teaching performance; (iv) encouraging improvements in all
aspects of school management; (v) supporting improved access to education by girls; (vi) upgrading the
availability and effectiveness of learning resources; and (vii) promoting the development and effective use
of up-to-date methods of assessing student progress and the outcomes of learning.
4.    Ptocu
The Project Development and Monitoring Agency under the Project Development and Monitoring
Higher Council will establish a Pedagogic Fund to finance the school-based subprojects. Proposals are invited
for financial support, equipment, materials and/or technical assistance for specific school initiadves.
Proposals may be submitted in January and June of each year.
Each proposal should prvide information under the following headings:
.Objectives
.Scope
.Action plan with target dates
.Timefame
.Personnel involved
.Resources required
.Expected outcomes



- 71 -
.How the subproject will be evaluated
.Budget
Schools will compete for allocations provided through the Pedagogic Fund to the extent that financial
resources are available. The process is to be repeated over the years until the funds are depleted. Efforts will
be made, however, to replenish the Pedagogic Fund from local community sources. It is anticipated that 14-
15 subprojects per year may be approved, with average budget allocations equivalent to US$10,000 each, but
with amounts varying according to need.
5.    Criteria for Selection of Projects
While additional specific criteria are likely to be established by the Project Development and
Monitoring Agency, the following will be taken into consideration: (i) the relevance of the subproject to the
needs of the school and to education in Yemen and the planned educational changes at the national level; (ii)
the practicability of the subproject in terms of its scope, timefrane and resources required; (iii) the
willingness and capacity of the school to help other schools initiate similar reforms; and (iv) the sustnability
of the outcomes, that is, the extet to which they are likely to have a lasting impact on the quality of teaching
and learning in the school.
6.    Tyes of Emiects
The projects will be limited in type only by the needs and creative initiative of the schools. Typical
projects which could be developed include the following: (The list is n=1 provided as an exemplar but simply
to indicate the tpes of activities which headmasters consider to be appropriate for Yemen.)
Physical Facilties    Development of physical resources through community, teacher, and stent
participation.
Sience Education    Development of Science Resources Centers;
Development of centers for a school cluster;
Development and use of demonstrations with locally available materials for the
teaching of science.
Management          Organization of summer schools in management;
Improved student assessment and learning resource development;
Community development projects.
Curriculum          Development of centers for creative learning for teachers;
schools             Improvement of teaching and learning through socially and locally relevant projects.
Teacher
Performance         Teacher performance appraisal and development using self/peer/video feedback
systems for a school cluster;
Teacher centers for a cluster of schools.
Student EvaluatIon   Development of question/item banks for a school cluster.
Larning Reources  Development of teaching aids in a school cluster from locally
available materials;
Innovative uses of libraries for improving learning.



- 72 -
Fanal Educton    Improved counseling for basic education of female students by teachers and students
of secondary schools;
Community development, including health care, e.g., sanitation projects;
Development of "Earning and Learning" projects.
7.
Since school-based educational subprojects are part of the Planned Change Program designed to
improvo the overal quality of education in Yemen, they should: (i) directly improve the quality of teaching
and learing in the school concerned; (ii) serve as exemplars for other schools to improve the quality of their
teahg and leaming; Oii) direcdy reflect at the school level planned educational changes occurring at the
national level; and (v) provide feedback to the national level on the appropriateness and effectivenes of the
Planned Change Program.
8.    Monit&g and Follow<-R
Successful applicants are required to: (i) be subject to supervision by an appropriately designated
authority during development of the project; (ii) prepare a short descriptive report of the project stessing its
scope and impact in a form suitable for publication and distribution to other schools; and (iiU) give direct
assbmem  to nearby schools interested in and willing to initiate similar reforms.
B.    Qrannnl&rangMU=n=a
A working party appoined by the Project Development and Monitoring Agency wi receive,
raise, and approve submissions. The working party may require proposals to be amended and elaborated
to meet criteria for acceptance.
The Project Development and Monitoring Agency will also monitor the development of subprojects
and receive and approve final reports from all participating schools. Monitoring will be undertaken tbrough
receipt of progress repots from the headmasters of the participating schools, and continued funding wil be
conditional on demonstration of satisfactory progress.

ANNEX 6
COMM  NiTY COLLEGE COMPONENT: AN OVERVIEW
MECGROI,MN
Introductdon
1.    This project component would focus on the establishment and development of a national community
college system to meet local and regional needs for middle-level manpower. It aims concurrently at meeting
the individual needs of young adults (secondary school graduates) for education and traning opportunities
in preparation for employment and long-term career development. The overriding goal of the component is
to ensure the provision in Yemen of high quality human capital in support of economic and national
development.
2.    This component is an especially high priority for education sector investment in Yemen due to the
cowntry being currently at a critical stage in its economic development program. Employers in the
commercial, industrial and social sectors, while striving to expand, update and upgrade their operations are
limited by serious shortages of adequately trained middle-level manpower, i.e. computer applications
specilists, unit manager and supervisors, technicians, accountants, office managers, and oether such
paraprofessional personnel. There is great need therefore to establish a post-secondary occupatioial education
and training system to meet the identified needs.
3.    Yemen has been lagging its neighboring and other more developed countries in this aspect of
education because post-secondary education and training to prepare middle-level manpower was, until
recently, virually unknown in the country, or at most addressed only mildly by the Government. At the
same dime, enrollments in professional degree programs at the university level, particularly at the Urdversity
of Sana'a, have been allowed to expand at an extremely raped pace to accommodate greater numbers of
sents, for an extremely limited higher-level job market. The secondary vocational and technical schools
are traning individuals to meet the lower level skilled manpower needs, but the gap between this and the
higher professional levels continues to widen and go largely unfilled. This proposed project component would
therefore assist the Government in establishing a training capability for meeting the identified middle-level
manpower needs through the establishment of a national community college system.
ksues and Rationale for the ommunit College System
4.    Ihere are three major issues in Yemen which combine to justify the establishment of a communty
college system: the already mentioned shortage of middle-level manpower, the need for Yemenization of the
worforce, and the social demand for post-secondary, occupationally-oriented education and training at less
tm the university level.
5.    Lak of MiddleLdwg M       sn .  As business and industry continue to develop and expand in
Yemen, the need for middle-level manpower to support the required operations contimues to increase.
Employers in both the public and private sector report that they are unable to recruit individuals who are
qualified for positions of middle-level responsibility which link professional managers, engineers, and medical
specialists to the skilled workers. In order to examine this expressed concemn more closely, IDA, along with
seeral  untp    staff and consultants from the Ministry of Education met on several occasions with
represetives of numerous employer groups, hosted by the Chambers of Commerce in Aden, Sana'a, and
Taiz, to obtain their views on the need for establishing a community college system and their willingness to



- 76 -
support it. There T as enthusiastic response in all cases from those in attendance, with pledges of
contributions through the provision of equipment, part-time instructional staff, part-time student jobs, student
scholarships, etc. (Attachment 1).
6.    A limited labor market survey' carried out recently in the major governorate cities of Yemen (an
ar-bitary sphl of 278 fis in Aden, Hodeida, Mukallah, Sana'a, and Taiz), plus a subsequent study"'
analyzing data obtained iL 't survey and data from a previous (1992) labor force survey by the Central
Statistical Office (CSO), - re credence to the employers' verbally reported needs. The Suflan study found
that the selected sample of 278 firms, with a total of 81,200 employees, had in 1992 only 3,100 middle-level
workers, 3,8% of their total employment (Attachment 2, Table 1). EdwardsO estimates that this proportion
natioally appears to be about 3%, although the limited data make this a very rough estimate. The typical
manpower distribution in more developed economies is in the order of 10% professional, 30% middle-level
or technician, and about 60% skilled and unskilled workers. The estimated distribution in Yemen implies
an obvious imbalance of manpower and gives rise to the expectation of a relatively strong demand for the
group which is in short supply. A good indication of the demand for middle-level workers in Yemen is
reflected by the salaries they earn in comparison with individuals having lower level skills. The middle-level
workers, according to the Ministry of Labor (MOL), can earn in the private sector about 3-5 times the salary
of those in the lesser trained group (Attachment 2, Table 2).
7.    The sampled fthms, with only about 3.5% of the country's total employment, reported more than
3,300 technician-le.el job vacancies which they would fill immediately if properly trained and qualified
applicants were available (Atachment 2, Table 3); 228 vacancies were reported for professional level staff.
Based on this study sample, even though limited, the severe shortage of middle-level manpower, even at
Yemen's level of development, appears quite obvious. A very rough estimate of the middle-level manpower
who might be trained via community colleges in Yemen, i.e., estimated current employment plus the unfilled
needs (the combined total possibly as high as 67,000) is shown by occupational category in Attachment 2,
Table 4. These middle-level positions are extremely important to the continuing development and expansion
of the productive and services sectors. Yet, there are few educational institutions in the country which
provide the training required to prepare individuals for such employment roles, or to upgrade those already
employed. More and different types of training institutions/programs (bigh quality and occupationally
relevant) are needed to respond to this increasing demand.
8.    Yemeniztion of he Mlk Force. A gradual phasing out of most foreign workers with replacement
by Yemenis trained locally is an important goal of the Government. It has been esfimated by various sources
that there may be as many as 100,000, or more, expatriates working in Yemen at various occupational
levels.21 At the end of 1992, some 12,800 foreign workers were formally registered with the MOL
(Attachment 2, Table 5) for working in the private sector, and another 15,000 (mainly teachers) with other
ministries, leaving the remainder ;possibly as many as 80,000) filling other public sector positions. Of those
registered with the MOL, some 3,000 to 4,000 are estimated to be middle-level workers most of whon>, along
with their ultimate successors, could conceivably be replaced with properly trained Yemenis. The cost of

expatriate workers in Yemen Is very high in many ways, especially considering that they are paid more than
indigenous workers and generally contribute less of their time, interests, and eanungs to local community
welfare and development. At the same time, they are filling jobs which Yemenis could fill if adequately and
appropriately trained.
9.    S.gial_ d  The provision of education and training opportunities is viewed by many in Yemen
as a social benefit for which all young people should be eligible. However, such provision is becoming an
increasingly difficult task given the limited learning spaces available and the rapid growth in the umnber of
secondary school graduates. For example, some 80,000 secondary school students sat for final year
examinations in the summer of 1993. About 50,000 of these persons will score suftficiently high on the exams
to be eligible, after completing their two-year military obligation, for admission to the approximately 15,000
first year student seats in the two universities. Ih  eill leave up to about 35,000 of the 1993 graduates with
aspirations for firther education, but withoutopport,mities for university admission. While all young people
do not want, or need, a university education, many (at least halt) could profit from post-secondary
occupational education in a community college setting. Special opporunities for high quality training at the
post-secondary level in the high demand occupational specializations would help alleviate part of the social
pressure for higher level university admission, while providing appropriately trained manpower to help meet
the country's productivity and development needs.
Mm GoTLentR
10.   Based on the needs discussed in the previous paragraphs, the Government proposes to establish a
community college (CC) system of two-year education and training programs, culminating in a post-secondary
diploma. TIDS is seen as an extremely important contribution, if only a partial solution, to the problems
described above. Such institutions would help to address the unmet staffing demands of busine3s and
industry, as well as the career development needs of a large segment of secondary school graduates, through
the provision of occupationally oriented education and trainLng which is more appropriate to their own needs
and to the needs of the respective communities. These institutions would also provide short-term training
ranging from a few days to several weeks, or months, to upgrade and/or update persons already employed,
as a means of increasing their job productivity and promotional opportnities. Such short-term training would
also be used to itroduce new production processes and technical applications, including the use of new
computer software, etc.
11.   The Government's proposal to move forward with implementation of the community college system
is soundly based, and responds to the identified manpower needs as determined from the expressed support
from business and industry, information from the previously cited2 manpower needs survey, and the labor
market study for community colleges. A summary of the proposed community college system and how it
would be managed is described in the following pargraphs.
COMMC)ENT DESCRZ=lO
12.   This component, in addition to developing a network of three individual community colleges, would
give special attention to the estblishment of a governance structure and a technical teacher education program
to support the instiudons as indicated in the objectives below.

c9lman= OQWWU
13.   QbJecive 1:  To establish and develop a national community college system, including an
administrative framework and goverce structure under which national policy and academic standards would
be formulated for all two-year post-secndary institutions and through which close likages between the
colleges and employers, relevance of curricula, and high quality instruction would be ensured.
14.   Qbjectivey. To establish and implement a network of three community colleges, one each at Aden,
Sana'a, and Taiz, to meet the identified middle-level manpower needs of business, industry, and the public
sector in these cites and their respective govenorates, to meet the employment and career preparation needs
of local young adults, and to upgrade the job skills of working adults.
15.   Obijgg&&e. To establish in the College of Education at the University of Sana'a a Bachelor's and
Master's Degree program in technical teacher education which would prepare highly qualified teachers and
other educational personnel for the countr's community colleges, its other two-year post-secondary technical
institutions, and the MOE secondary vocational-technical schools.
Characteristics of e Proposed Communit Colleges
16.   The Community Colleges (CCs), as planned for inclusion in this project component, will be two-year
post-secondary institons, devoted to education and traning for direct employment, rather than for university
transfer. Their major responsibility will be to prepare individuals mainly from their own regional service
areas, through broad-based educational programs, for middle-level employment positions within local business
and industry and the governmental agencies. Curricula will be designed to prepare for a cluster of job
oppoMnities within a broad discipline area. The program and curricula specializations will vary from one
stittion to another, depending on the needs of the local area which the respective college serves. Also,
progam specializations will be added and/or deleted in each institution as the regional labor market changes.
17. The community college system will be based on the concept of serving multiple education and truaining
needs of a local area, with *built-inW flexibility for responding quickly to rapidly changing manpower needs
in the labor market. The underlying policy framework for establishing this proposed community college
system is based on a nunber of basic principles, both philosophical and operational, the most significant of
which are disussed in the following paragraphs.
18.   Edoa         Ig2 and T rymen. The central mission of the project community colleges will
be to provide post-secondary education and training programs which prepare individuals for employment in
te middle-level occupations of industry, commerce, and community services. This mission would be
accomplished through the provision of academic programs which prepare individuals for first-ime
employment, short-term training programs to upgrade the knowledge and skills of employees in public and
private sector enterises, and special manpower programs to retrain workers in restructured and expanding
industries. Such an emphasis on education and training for employment requires close and effective linkages
with the community and its productive sector employers.
19.   Partlcipation of Employers and Community Leaders. Effective and relevant education and training
proams, responsive to the demands of the community and its labor market in a fast-changing technological
environment, are minimal requirements for sustnable economic development. Provision of such programs
is possible only through the active participation of industry, business enterprises, and government employers
in the education and training process, i.e., design, delivery, and evaluation of the colleges' instructional and
wmmuity services programs. At the program design phase, rerqestves of local employers and other
community groups will provide valuable input into program definition and curriculum content through service



- 79 -
on program advisory committees. Local business managers, engineers, and other practicing professionals
would ensure greater community and occupational relevance of the college programs by teaching some of the
courses on a part-time basis, or contributing in other tangible ways. Representatives from the productive
sector would also provide a valuable service to the colleges by participating in periodic review and evaluation
of the academic programs.
20.   Supprt For ReonalEonomic Develgmnent. Unlike most universities, the proposed community
colleges would be smaller and could therefore be more widely and regionally distributed. In addition, they
could start up, and phase out, training programs much more quickly in response to the labor market demands.
In many countries, community college systems serve as a rallying point to attract regional investment for
economic development, with the promise of providing educated and well-trained personnel for the middle-
level occupations which are so important in the development and expansion of modem technological
operations. Further, studies have shown that community college graduates are more likely to remain in their
home area and seek employment on a regional basis than are university graduates. And finally, community
college graduates are also likely to become entrepreneurs, thus creating small-scale enterprises (and jobs)
which contribute to the nation's economy.
21.   Access and Equity. Community colleges, because of their wider regional distribution and their
emphasis on employment-oriented eduction, uffer access to higher education for a segment of the population
which might otherwise be "left out" by having little or no opportunity for post-secondary/university studies.
The colleges are, by definition, community, regional, or local institutions which, by their unique nature,
provide a desirable alternative to the traditional higher education experience, through regional and more
diverse geographic opportunities which universities do not normally provide.
22.   Autonomy and Accountability. The success of community colleges in achieving their goals of
providing relevant education and training to meet the manpower needs of business and industry, and to act
as catalysts for regional economic development, will depend on the provision of a governance framework to
ensure a reasonable degree of autonomy in the allocation and management of financial, physical, and human
resources. Such a framework would, at the same time, be constructed in a way to ensure that quality in
education, and efficiency in the allocation and use of resources, are achievable. Also, a higher level of
autonomy for institutional management will be based on a clearly established framework of management
accountability.
23.   Resource Mobilizatign. The development of a community college system in Yemen has to be seen
in the context of reform to higher/further education and the need for resource mobilization and cost recovery.
It is important, therefore, that careful attention be paid to studying viable alternatives to the current "free
higher education"t syndrome and that legal provision be made for the colleges to collect and use at the local
level: student fees, tuition, equipment utilization fees, and fees for institutional services. In the case of
Yemen, the necessary legal provision for such steps would probably need to be enacted in accordance with
Articles 58 ard 68 of the 1992 General Law of Education.
24.   Societal Impact: The Role of Graduates. Societal acceptance of the community college concept, and
the system as a whole, will be extemely important and will depend on the extent to which its graduates are
accepted by the country's employers and professional associations. It will also depend on a positive image
being established for the colleges and strong acceptance by prospective students and their parents. An
important factor in this case will be the definition of an equitable occupational title, role, and remuneration
of these graduates by employers in both the public and the private sectors.

Community Coll=
25.   Success of the community college system will depend in large measure on a strong local and semi-
autonomous system of management, operating under the policy guidelines of a national coordinating body,
with active involvement of the private and public sector employer groups. While this condition can be met
in different ways, a two-tier structure including a National Communitg College Council, or similarly in&ed
board, for establishing general policy and operational guidelines, and individual College Boards of Governors
for each respective institution, such as described below, is generally considered to be the most successful in
other countries and is therefore proposed for the Yemen CC system.
26.   National Community Cllee  ncl. The National Community College Council (NCCC) would
be responsible for setting broad policies and guidelines for the system as a whole. It would establish
minimum standards for institution and program quality, including standards, but not content, for program
curricula. It would also establish standards for, but not control of, staffing and management of the
institutions. 'The Council, as designated representative of the Miistry, would comprise eleven members and
would be chaired by a representative of the private sector. Te other members of the Council would be
equally divided between the private and public sectors' employing firms and organizations. Private sector
members of the NCCC would be nominated by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, with public sector members being nominated by their respective ministries. Formal appointment
of the members would be made by the Minister of Education, as the MOE would be given authority for
funding the community college system and held accountable for its well-being. Terms of appointment would
be for three years on staggered terms to ensure continuity, with the possibility of re-appointment for a
maximum of one additional term. The NCCC would have an Executive Directorate to provide operational
support to the NCCC in carrying out its mandate. The Directorate would include four small operational units
of 2-3 persons each, covering the areas of human resources, finance, curriculum, and the labor market.
27.    Co=I B&ards of Gov . 'he individual College Boards of Governors (CBGs), or governing
boards, for each institution would be responsible for establishing institutional philosophy, for setting
institutional policy, rules, and regulations (consistent with national policy), and for monitoring/overseeing
institutonal administration. As a local governing board, it would also be responsible for approving the
proposed annual budget for the college and all major expenditures above a specified limit. This Board would
be responsible for recruiting and hiring the college director or chief administratr and also for terminating
his/her employment if necessary (with due cause), as well as approving the employment of new staff
recommended by the director. The CBG, as designated representative of the government, would comprise
a maximum of nine members and would be chaired by a representative of the private sector. The other
members of the Board would be equally divided between the private and public sectors local employing firms
and organizations. Private sector members of the CBG would be nominated by the local Chamber of
Commerce with the public sector members being nominad by their respective government departments.
Formal appointment would be made by the Minister of Education. Terms of appointment would be for three
years, with the possibility of re-appointment for a maximum of one additional term.
Planed Growth of the Community College System
28.   As the Republic of Yemen embarks on this new form of education, consideration must be given to
a basic philosophy of institutional location and size. The nature of the programs to be offered in these
ihstiuons requires that they be located close to the job markets which they will serve. One alternative might
be to have a few very large institutions, i.e., student enrollment in the order of say 20,000 to 25,000, located
in two or tee widely disbursed areas. Ihis policy would almost dictate that Sana'a, Taiz, Hodeida, and
Aden would be the locations, as they have the larger populations.



-81 -
29.   A second, and possibly better, alternative to ensure greater access by Yemen's total student-age
population would be to maintain the instittons at a smaller size and arrange for them to be more widely
distributed. A ceiling on the enrollment at each institution of around 7,000 to 8,000 students would require
a policy of building new instiutions as these enrollment levels are reached.
Tecltcal Teacher Education
30.   An adequate supply of qualified teachers and administrators is crucial to Yemen's development of an
effective community college system. A properly trained cadre of teachers and administrators will be critical
for guiding and administering these colleges and programs in their initial formative years. The staffing of
technical education programs is a difficult task in all developing countries and attracting and preparing
qualified individuals to teach in the new Yemen community college system will require especially innovative
and creative strategies.
31.   The appropriate solution to the staffing problem requires the development of both short- and longterm
strategies for staff development, both of which are proposed in this component. The long-term task would
be to develop a new department of Technical Teacher Education within the Faculty of Education at the
Undiversity of Sana'a to prepare CG-wu  cllege eachers at the BSc and MSc Degree levels. The short-
term task would consist of a series of programs to recruit and train, in local short-courses and in out-of-
country programs, various combinations of expatriate and local university graduates.
32.   In addition to the above activities, a teacher-needs-assessment capability would be developed in the
Human Resources Unit of the NCCC Executive Directorate to identify needs for teacher and administrator
training efforts and to coordinate the programs organized for this purpose. Such programs would also be both
short- and long-term, conducted in Yemen and other locations outside the country. The primary unit for
conducting short- and long-term programs would be a proposed new department of Technical Teacher
Education in the Faculty of Education at the University of Sana'a.
Proiect Imnlementation
33.   Implementation of this project component, e.g., NCCC organization and development, legal
documentation, curriculum and materials development, coordination of fellowships and consultants,
preparation of equipment lists and specifications, etc. would be carried out by the Executive Directorate of
the NCCC and the NCCC expatiate consultant, with assistance from the Ministry's Project Implementation
Unit (PIU). The PIU would be responsible for preparing all construction drawings for the required building
renovations and extensions, for preparation of tendering documents and procedures, and supewrision of the
onstruction work. The PW would also handle the actual contracting of technical assistance, in cooperation
with the NCCC's Executive Directorate.
34.   The Executive Directorate would be responsible for working with the University of Sana'a and its
Faciuty of Education in establishing and developing the technical teacher education program. And finally,
the NCCC Directorate would be responsible, with outside assistance as necessary, for designing an evaluation
plan for the component and for ensuring its implementation.
35.   Maintenance Fund. Proper midntenance of buildings and instructional equipment is extremely
important to the longterm operation of community college facilities. The project would therefore include
the establishment of a building and equipment Maintennce Fund, derived from student fees, to ensure that
project buildings and equipment are kept in operable condition at all times. The Maintenance Fund, to be
established at a relatively low level the firs year of project implementation, because equipment would be new
and fcilities newly renovated, would be fully subscribed the first year with proceeds from the IDA Credit.



- 82 -
The Government/College conrbution would stat at the beginning of the second year when the Fund's level
would be increased. The Fund would continue to increase on an annual basis through year five, at which
time it would level off and be maintained at YR 2.5 million in real terms based on 1993 currency vlues, in
accordance with the distribution Indicated in Table 1 on the following page.

36.   The proposed mainteace allocation for the community college is calculated as 12% of salaries (6%
for equipment and 6% for buildings); i.e., [YR 1.6m (salaries) X 12 mo. X 12% = YR 2.3 m/yearl. On-
going mantnance support (replenishment of the Maitenance Fund) would be provided from student fees
which, after the college achieves a steady state enrollment of about 2,500 students, would support the entire
mantenance program for buildings and equipment.
37.   StudentFe. lhe Government has agreed that community college students would be requited to pay
a portion of the system's operational costs. It has been determined that such fees should cover about 40%
of the recurrent costs, which is consistent with student fee requirements in most Western European countries
and North America. Ihe student fees, calculated on this basis for one institution at full enrollment, would
amount to about YR 4,000/year. (This is calculated as: salaries at 19.0 mln.; supplies, utilities, and
maintenance at 5 mln. or a total of 24 mln per year for recurrent costs. This figure divided by 2,500 students
times 40% equals rougy YR 4,000/year.) This level of student fees would generate a fund of YR 10
milion per year (2,500 sdents X YR 4,000/year). As described previously, the total income received from
student fees would be used as follows:
1/4 of Student Fees (YR 2.5 mln): Loans for needy students
3/4 of Student Fees (YR 7.5 mlii): Maintenance (YR 2.5 mln)
Supplies and utilides (YR 2.5 mln);
Equipment replacement (YR 2.5 mln.).

Two principles guide the PDMA's orgizato  First, it will maintain a direct worldng reladonship with all
Subproject Directors as wel as with the Ministy of Education. To facilie this, two tedhnical uns will be
served by a coordintig unit which serves also as the Executive Secretaia to the bntmedis policy
making body. Secondly, the PDMA wil fcton with a small stai while utilizing existg educational
agencies in Yemen to carry out subtanti monitoring and evaluadon finctions. Ihese lins will help to
disseminate knowledge gained from hrmlemeation of the Planmed Change Program throughout the education
sector in Yemen.
neu Higbr CQounil ITe policy making body for the PDMA and the Planned Change Program will be the
Higher Councl, which will be chared, ex-officio, by the Minister of Education. The Higher Council, in
additon to settng policy for he Progm as a whole, will be the principal decision making body for approval
of proposed subprojects. In the process of subproject appraisal the Higher Council may refer nadequatey
prepared subprojects for rmision and resubmission; in hi case I will recommend specific Improvement
which should be made before resuI,-on It will consider monitorng and evaluation reports concerning
operating subproject, manding apprie actions, and recomndin to IDA cancelation of individul
subproje funds where necessary. Ihe Coun  will also identify best practices wihin the Plannee Cbange
Pogm  and instruct dat these be disemiaed to other subprojects andlor included in new subproject
proposas. It will be the responsilt of the Council to approve action on the reports mentioned above.

Ihe technical uni of the PDMA are divided according to their functional roles. The Executive Secretary to
the Higher Council will serve as the centra coordinating point for the Higher Council, the Project
Development Uni (PDU), and the Project Implementaion Unit (PIU). A discussion of the functions and
staffing of the PDMA follows.
Tno Executive SecMuy wil be the point of contact between the PDMA and other agencies which are
involved in or which could contribut to the Planned Change Ptogram, as well as the executive and
coordinating body within the nbtermediary. Subproject proposals will be submitted to the Executive Secretary,
who will then forward them to the PDU and P}U for appropriate stages of review and appraisal. The
Secretar.y will be responsible for coordinaig decisions of the Higher Council witi the PDU, PWU, Change
Area Policy Boards, and Subproject Directors and will likewise liaise with Subproject Directors to prepare
biamual reports on the status of each Subproject for submission to the Higher Council.
The Executive Secretauy will produce and distribute a Planned Change Newsletter in order to provide
information about the Program to education professionals throughout Yemen, and wil represent the PDMA
at naional, regional and institutional meetidngs. The Secretary will also prepare, or have prepared, annual
fa    audits of the Program as a whole and submit these to IDA before June 30 of the following fiscal
year. It will also oversee develoWment of a database on the Planned Change Program and prepare issue and
option papers for discussion by the Higher Council.
The Project implementation Unit is a well functioning agency established in the early 1970s. Its curret
staffing structure and composition will not be affectd by its incorporation in the Agency. The decision to
Include the PIU in the Agency was made on the grounds that its current functions include nearly all of the
activities the Agency will have to carry out for effective implementation of subprojects. The Unit Is headed
by a Director General and has a complement of about 20 trained staff.
The PIU would be solely concerned with subproject implementation. While it will advise the PDU on
implementation aspects of subproject proposals, most of its work will concentrate on subprojects under
implementadon. The PU will procure all approved equipment, materials and other resources for subprojects,
and will maintain accouts of expenditures for each subproject. All cost estimations, budget systems, and
financial control systems required by Subproject Directors wiUl be designed by, or in cooperation with, the
PIU.
The PlU's constuction depart, with about 60 staff, is responsible for preparing and monitoring
construcdon programs and budget requests for school-based and Community CoUege subprojects. Prototype
designs and equipment layouts for worlshops and laboratories would also be prepared by this Unit Design
development, preparation of tender documents, contracting and supervision will also be the responsibility of
the PIU. Under the proposed project the PIU would also prepare equipment layouts and arrange for necessary
modificatons to exiting facilities.
Thi procurement unit of the PIU, staffed by six professionals, would be responsible for aUl procurement under
the proposed project. During FY93 it handled approximately US$8 million worth of local and foreign
equipment contracts, from the drafting of tender documents to final distribution and settlement of contracal
disputes. The unit is equipped with personal computers itegrated In a Local Area Network.
The PFlJ wil supervise all subprojects, either in cooperation with the Subproject Director, IMA missions or,
at times, as the implementing agency for subprojects whose primary component is the provision of physical
facilities. Supervision rets wMI be forwarded to the Higher Council. In cooperation with PDU, the unit
wil help to prepare option papers on design and implemention issues relevant to ongoing and future
subprojects for consideration by the Higher Council.
1he Pe    D A tUnit is responsible for the development and review of all subprojects' otnibution
to enhancement of educatonal quality. While it will not have direct implementation responsibilities, it wi
need to work closely with the PIU to ensure that subproject invitation, development, appraisa,
implementation and monitoring and evaluation are conducted in such a way as to advance the goals of the



- 92 -
Planned Change Program. The PDU will undertake a preliminary appraisal of all new subproject proposas
submitted to the PDMA.
In regard to ongoing subprojects, the PDU will establish and operate monitoring and evaluation systems with
the dual purposes of identifying broad issues which may be relevant to the content and design of futre
subprojects, and contributing to subproject specific monitoring and evaluation reports prepared by the PIU.
At times, outside agencies may be identified and contracted by the PDU to undertake research or evaluative
reports on subprojects. Ihe PDU will also coordinate Technical Assistance in the various subprojects to
ensure efficient utillzation of resources.
Further developmenal responsibilities will be placed with the unit. Examples of good or best practices in
subproject design and implementation will be identified for inclusion in the Planned Change Newsleter. PDU
will also prepare, in cooperaion with the PIU, options papers concerning subproject design and
implementation issues for consideration by the Higher Council.
Staffing of the PDMA The PDMA would be established with the current staff of the PIU serving as the core
unit. Small numbers of additional staff would be needed for the PDU. For the Highier Cuncil, the Minister
of Education will serve as ex-officio Chairman and the Vice Minister as Deputy Chairman, while the
Ministers of Planning and Development and of Labor, and the St :retary of the High Tender Board, will serve
as members. The Executive Secretary of the PDMA will be assisted by a Deputy Executive Secretary. The
Polect Develooment Unit will be staffed by four professionals. The Unit will be headed by a Director
General and will contain also two Deputy D.G.s and a Research Officer. Two staff would be added to the
Project hmplementation Unit in order to fulfill its added supervision functions under the program. The Unit
is headed by a Director General and already has a substantial complement of staff. The PDMA will have a
common pool of sipport staff including two typists and a computer database specialist.
B. Program implementation
Poliy Boards The Planned Change Program is made up of several Change Areas which contain a number
of subprojects. A Policy Board, to be Chaired by a Deputy Minister or eminent professional with experience
in a relevant educational subsector and who is appointed by the Minister of Education, will be established
for each Change Area. Membership of Policy Boards will include the Directors of interrelated subprojects
or those which contribute directly to the Change Area. The Boards would ensure congruence of subproject
activities and outcomes with MOE policy, and would serve as a forum to ensure timely coordination of
interrelated subprojects. Wh:Ie the Boards would have no role in subproject management, they would play
an important role in eliminating btenecls in implementation through providing a direct avenue for
coordination of closely related activities in separate subprojects. Policy Boards would normally meet twice
yearly, but would be available to meet when necessary in order to facilitate subproject implementation or
address policy issues of concern to the MOE.
Sibgrject Directors Subproject Directors would be directly responsible for the imp' neatation of their
respective subprojects. Individuals may serve as Directors of mere than one subproject simultaneously in the
same Change Area, depending on the size, scope, level of complexity and duration of the respeive
subprojects. To ensure effectve implementation, Subproject Directors would: (a) execute action plans as
approved by the Higher Council; (b) manage resources allocated to the subproject; (c) direct the activities
of subproject working groups and review their products; (d) monitor outcomes to ensure consistency with
subproject objectives; (e) prepare amd deliver progress reports on subproject activities, outcomes and finances
to the PDMA; and (t) liaise with the PIU on all procurement and financial matters.
Emert Advisory  mau   composed of four eminent professionals in a field relevant to each Change Area
would be established to provide advice to Subproject Directors on substantive issues relevant to their work.
Ihese groups would have no formal role in subproject management but would be available to Subproject
Directors to assist in review of subproject outcomes and to advise on appropriate work processes and
strategies.

Prqeaaon, Appraisal and Approval of Subprojeds
Mme A ,hal Pr9sa A particular subproject would start with the identification and agreement of a need
wbffin the Planned Change program. A draft proposal would be prepared by an origing endty, and could
be further refined by a Change Area Policy Board or Subproject Diructor on request. The subproject
proposa would then be submitted to the PDU for appraisal and consideration by the Higher Council.
Following PDU's appraisal, ik woud forward its recommendations and the proposal (through the Execudve
Secary) to the Higher Council, which may approve, reject or refer proposals for revision and resubmission.
Assistn  will be provided by the PDU to potential beneficiaries who require help in developing or revising
proposals. Approved subproject ill be forwarded to the Subproject Director for execution if approved.
Since the Higher Council Is the sole body which can authorize implementation of subprojects, proposals must
be scheduled for presentation at the Higher Council's bianmual meetings.
PeetaradonH New subproject proposas could be originated by an indiv;dual, a group of people, an insttion,
or group of itions  dfying work to be done in any given Change Area. Draft subproject proposals
would be prepared following design criteria set forth in Section 11 of the PDMA Operating Manual. New
sbproject proposals would be expected to complement the scope and objectives of the Planned Change
GeneralAgziL  kd=   The PDMA Operating Manual sets forth the folowing gene   criteria for
awpraisa of subprojects. Proposals would need to show that the subproject is:
a) Relevant to the objectives of the Planned Change Program;
b) Compleme     to other subprojects in the relevant Change Area;
c) Contins a technically sound design which states how specified inputs would achieve the desired ouuts;
d) Capable of being implemented effectively;
e) Cost efficient witn its schedule for resource acquisition and utilization;
d) Able to suwtain benefit beyond subproject completion.

ANNEX 10
MONMORING AND EVALUATION
Monitoring of subprojects in the Plamied Change Program (PCP) would normally be :ndertaken annuy.
However, for subprojects lagging considerably behind scheduled completior dates, the Project
Development and Monitorng Agency (PDMA) would conduct more frequen. monitoring and would
detemne appropriate frequency and scheduling.
Data on the status of each subproject would be gathered through questionnaires corresponding to
performace indicators addressed at the national or Governorate levels, with rural/urban, boys/girls and
preparatory/secondary breakdowns (grades 7, 8, 9 / 10, 11, 12) as appropriate (See attachement 1). The
performance indicators specified in attachment I have been categorized into inputs and outputs. Data on
each indicator would be gathered to enable assessments on quantitative adequacy, as well as qualitative
adequacy where applicable. Quantitative adequacy would be determined by comparing actual
accomplishment on the date of monitoring with targets set for accomplishment on that date. Quantive
daa gathered anmually could also be used for determining trends, even in the absence of specific targets.
Qualitative adequacy would be assessed based on user, peer and counterpart evaluation on a rating scale
wih increments of high, average and low quality. In the event that subprojects demonstrate shortfalls
in accomplishing targets or show unsatisfactory trends, the data gathered would be used to identify causes
and determine appropriate actions to accelerate implemenation and meet scheduled deadlines.
The PDMA would receive technical assistance in designing the questionnaires and developing a system
for data gathering, processing and analysis. The Governorates' Departments of Education would provide
assistance to the PDMA in gathering data. The Management Information System (MIS) in the MOE
would assist the PD;.IA in data processing and analysis from the time the MIS becomes operational.
The PDMA would be responsible for macro level monitoring of the entire project. Analyses and
fdings peaning to each subproject would be made available to the concerned Subproject Director
(SPD) for necessary action.
In addition to the macro level subproject specific monitoring undertaken by the PDMA, SPDs would
undertake micro level monitoring to track the progress of their respective subprojects. The frequency
of this monitoring would be determined by the SPD in consultation with the associated Expert Advisory
Group in order to ensure that the subproject is implemented on schedule.
Subproject entities such as schools or national level entites e.g., the Curriculum Development
Department, the Geeral Diecrates for Supervision and Evaluadon and other national level agencies
would provide to the SPDs the required data inputs. The SPDs would analyze and interpret the data using
the performance indicators and targets specified in their subproject documentation to meet subproject and
project objectives.
Causes of implementation delays and possible actions to accelerate implementation and bring it back in
line with the projected schedule would be identified by the SPDs in consultation with the associated
Expert Advisory Groups or any other concerned agencies. The SPDs would take all necessary action
related to those issues which are under their direct authority. However, issues beyond the SPDs authority
would be placed before the Policy Boards and/or the PDMA for consideration and appropriate action.
Ihe PDMA would prepare a comprehensive report informing IDA and the MOE of the results of project
monitoring, the decisions and actions taken to ensure that the project is accomplished on schedule, and
the reasons for revising subproject implementation schedules. The report would also indicate any
assistace required of IDA or the MOE regarding project implementation.

ANNEX 11
MID-TERM EVALUATION PLAN
Objectis
The objectives of the mid-tMem evaluation will be to (i) review, with the executng instti, the quality
of implementation and efficiency of the Planned Change Program; (ii) review the government's strategies
and action plans and how they are being implemented; and (iii) discuss the impact of the govemnment's
reform program on the education sector as a whole, based on the on-going Planned Change Program
Tlmn and Produres
Four years after signing the loan, or after 50% of loan fuids are commined, whichever comes first, the
Bank and the govemen will jointly evaluate the progress of the project. The evaluation will be based
on a prelimiary report prepared by the PDMA covering the issues described below. Individual sub-
project progress reports and financial statements, IDA supervision mission aide-memoires and other
PDMA documents wil be used to prepare the preliminary report. The PDMA will submit the report to
MDA and the government no less thn 2 months prior to the evaluation.
Focus of the Preliminar Report
The report will cover the following issues and questions:
(X)  Extet to which overall commitmets, disbursemens- and counterpart fimding are
in accordance with forecasts made at the time of negotiations, discussions of any
shortfall, and proposals for remedying inadequacies in procedures leading to shortflls.
(i) Review of commitments, disbursements, and counterpart fimding on an individual
b-project basis.
(iii) Inim review of milestones established during negotiation of the loan and
identification of relevant milestones for the remaining project period, including review
of interdependencies between sub-projects identified during appraisl.
(v) Review of PDMA's procedures, i.e., the extent to which guidelines are being
followed and continue to be appropriae, noting examples of best practice adoptions,
achievements, and successes as a consequence. Review of Agency procedures,
management, feedback mechanism, etc. Review of extent to which non-solicied
proposals are working. Review of adequacy of coordination among the sub-projects and
with other non-Planned Cbange Program projects in education, such as between science
education and other science sub-projects, financed by the govemment or other donors.
(v) Review of the Community College System and labor market supported attempts at
mdustryleducauon coLaboration. Progress to date and proposed new  atives.
(vi) Rview of efforts at cost recovery and cost sharing in the mantenance,
consumables, basic techology, and science sub-projects.
(vii) Review of updated sub-project implementation schedules and identification of
setbacks, If any, in the project. Based on the review, determination of the critical path
Ihat wfll emerge for the remaining life of the project.



- 111 -
Resuls of the Evaluation
On the basis of the review, the government shall:
(a) adopt improved operational guidelines for the PDMA as appropriate;
O) revise sub-project objecves and strategies as appropriate; and
(c) reallocate funds across sub-projects as appropriate to enhance the impact of the sub-projects.
During the mid-term evaluation, the Bank and the government will focus on identifyng exising
problems in the overall management of the Planned Change Program and of the effects of government
policies on the education sector in Yemen. A discussion of the results of policies and programs to be
implemented on the basis of the review will be furnished and a joint work program for the remaining
Implementation years of the project will be finalized with 1ne PDMA. The project would then be
modified on the basis of the findings and recommendations of the mid-term evaluation.

ANNEP 12
IIMPACT ASSESSMENT
Impact assessment aims at determining the extent to which a project would cotinue to produce
an acceptable flow of net benefits beyond project completion date. The assessment involves categorizing
a number of sustainability indicators based on the flow of project benefits after project completion, to
measure over time the post-completion levels of inputs, outputs, efficiency, quality and spin-off effects.
(Refer OED Report No. 9225, Pages iii, 49 & 50)
In order to assess the extent of flow of project benefits beyond project completion, baseline data
at the start of the project or from a later date (as may be applicable and practicaable) and the progress in
the flow of benefits after the baseline date would be required. The post-project trends in flow of project
benefit would be compared with trends during the project. Sustained flow of benefits at levels
commensurate with the socio-economic context of the country would indicate positive impact.
Imp  assessment of the Planned Change Program would be conducted in the context of the three
major objectives of the project: (i) enhancement in the learning achievements of secondary students, with
special emphasis on science and maths education and quality of teaching; (ii) improvements in access
of girls to secondary educadon and; ffii) establishment of labor-market oriented two-year post-secondary
programs covering business, commerce and industry.
The PDMA would undertake the responsibility of gathering data from the schools and
community colleges, dtough the concered Sub-project Directors (SPDs) or the Governorates with regard
to each impact indicator. Data gathering would commence from 1995 or 1996, depending on the year
of coencemen of the sub-project, or likely date from which the benefits with regard to the indicator
could be antIcipated. Data would be gathered annually. Data processing and analysis would be
undertaken by the PDMA, with assistance from the MIS, from the time the latter becomes operatonal.
For a list of indicators giving the expected breakdown for data collecion with regard to each
indiato for the Planed Change Program, refer to the attached.
