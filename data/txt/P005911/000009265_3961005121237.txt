MEMORANUM AND RECOMMbINA2Q Of THE PRESENT
OFQ  IN3m&=A DEELOPUM ASSOITN
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR$
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF YEMN
FOR AN ED=AT1Q SE(=T  ISTMENT SROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendaon on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Yemen for SDR 23.9 million (US$ 33.0 million equivalent) to help
finance an education sector investment project. The credit would be extended on standard IDA terms
with a maturity of 40 years.
2.    comu t/lou a&droumd. Three years aftr the unification of Yemen in May 1990, a
democrtically elected government was formed. The major challenges facing the new Government are
to revive the economy, which has suffered severely in the aftermath of the Gulf Crisis, and to satisfy the
basic needs of a rapidly growing population. Soon to be launched policy adjustments are expected to
provide the basis for a resumption of economic growth in the mid and late 1990s. This would lead to
an increase of demand for trained manpower in a variety of categories. To meet this demaad and support
possible productvity gains in agrculture, industry and services, a sustained effort is needed to upgrade
the quality of Yemen's labor force.
3.    Over the past two decades, Yemen's education and training system  (ETS) has grown
phenomenally. Enrollments expanded from some 250,000 students in 1970/71 to over 2.5 million in
1991192, with basic education (Grades 1-6) accounting for 1.9 million; secondary education (Grades 7-12)
563,000; teacher training 26,000; vocational and technical training 13,000; and higher education 52,000.
In addition, some 70,000 people participate in nonformal literacy and vocational training courses. The
rapid build-up o4 the ETS and the high share of government expenditures allocated to the sector (20
percent) clearly illustrate the priority given to human resources development in Yemen.
4.    Impressive as these achievemens are, the past emphasis on quantitative expansion has created
imblanc  and qualitative deficiencies in the system. At all levels of education, female enrollment rates
are considerably less than those for males. There are also significant regional disparities in access to
educational facilities. Educational achievements are often unsatisfactory. A large number of boys and
girls leave basic education without attaining functional literacy. Graduates from other educational streams
are frequently ill prepared for the jobs available in labor markets.
5.    A major cause of quality deficiencies is the shortage of well-qualified teachers, a problem
exacerbated by the Government's decision in 1991 to replace expatriate teachers, often with untrained
high school graduates. Additionally, curricula are inadequate and teaching materials are in short supply.
There is little emphasis on problem solving in science teaching in general education, and instruction
programs in technical and vocational schools are not up to date. The existing system of student
evaluation is outmoded and unreliable. Physical facilities are often in poor condition. Classrooms are
overcrowded, furniture is lacking or damaged, laboratories and libraries frequendy non-existent. There
is little maintenance of buildings, causing them to deteriorate quicldy and creating health hazards for
students and teachers. Addressing these problems effectively will require improvements in the
management and planning of educational facilities and programs, including strengthened capacities for
policy analysis, research, monitoring, and evaluation. There is also a need for improved supervision of
schools and better management within schools.

6.    These Issues were identified in a recent IDA study on human resource development in Yemen',
which was discus  with the Government in February 1992. Based on the study's findings and
recommendations, the Goverment, with IDA assistance, has put In place the flrst of a possible series
of projects to strengthen basic education, with emphasis on quality improvement and access for girls.
Two completed and two ongoing projects would generate adequate capacity to train teachers for the
primary and secondary levels. 'Me proposed project bas been under preparation since November, 1992.
It would form an integral part of a longer-term sector investment program focusing on quality
improvement in and increased female access to secondary education, and would strenthen training of
middle-level manpower for which demand is already strong and likely to increase in the coming years.
A Planned Change Program (PCP) addressing current issues in secondary and post-secondary education
would form the basis of the project.
7.    proeet Objetives. The proposed Education Sector Project would enhance Yemen's capacity
for human resource development In order to meet the emerging needs of the economy and is consistent
with the Government's education sector objectives, i.e. (i) enhancement of secondary students' learning
achievements, with special emphasis on science and mathematics education and the quality of teaching;
(ii) improvement in girls' access to secondary education; and (iii) establishment of labor market oriented
two-year post-secondary programs covering business, commerce and industrial subjects.
8.    Prjge lscript. The proposed project would achieve the above stated objectives through
national and school-based subprojects in the eight Change Areas which constitute the PCP: (i)
Improvement in the learning environment through reduction of overcrowding through provision of
classrooms, provision of equipment especially for science subjects, and establishment of a mantnce
program (total cost US $11.0 m); (ii) improvement in teacher performance through development and
provision of taining modules, summer schools fer teachers and school-based training programs (US $0.5
m); (iii) strengthening of institutional capacity for and development of curricula (US $1.1 m); (iv)
improvemen of school management through development and provision of school management training
and materials and establishment of an educational Management Information System (MIS) (US $1.6 m);
(v) development of learning resources (US $2.7 m); (vi) strengthening of insdiutional capacity for the
development of evaluation proces to improve the reliability, comparability and validity of examinaons
(US $1.0 m); (vii) increasing female access to secondary education in underserved areas (US $4.9 m);
and (viii) establishment of a nationwide labor-market oriented Community College system (US $14.8 m).
Twenty-six subprojects in these eight areas have been prepared, of which 25 have been appraised jointly
by IDA staff, Minisy of Education (MOE) staff and designated Intermediary Agency stafr. The proposed
credit would cover civil works, equipment, fitre, materials, library books, local costs for semas,
workshops, printng of manuals, and technical assistance for all aspects of implementation, including the
Jatermedary.
9.    ParticinoryPreparation. From identification (August 1992) through pre-appraisal, the
proposed project has evolved with the participation of Yemeni teachers, professionals, officials from the
jj    "Republic of Yemen# Human Development: Societal Needs and Human Capital
Response, June 23, 1992, Population and Human Resources Division, Country
Department II, Middle East and North Africa Region.
2/    Republic of Yemen, Dasic Education Project (Credit 2412), approved in
VY93.

MOE, and private sector represeves. The scope of the program was conceptualized by the Yemenls
through three workshops during the Identification mision in which IDA played a catalytic role. The
program was subsequently validated by a Headmasters workshop and by senior MOE officials includiW
he Minster and Deputy Ministers. Yeni working groups, including one expatriate consultt, were
established for each Change Area to develop subprojects. The project's scope, Change Areas and
prepared subprojects were reconfirmed by the newly elected Government and presented to IDA during
the pre-appraisal mission In August, 1993. TIis approach, involving the active participation of over 200
Yemeni teachers, administators and professionals, has resulted in a high degree of commitment and
ownship of the PCP.
10.   Project £nemato   The Project Development and Monitoring Agency (PDMA), the
Intermediary, would be the key institution for planning, Implementing and managing the PCP. Headed
by a Higher Council chaired by the Minister of Education, the PDMA is built around the well funcdoning
and experienced Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and includes one new unit, the Project Development
Unit (PDU). The PIU will handle all procurement, accounts, TA and supervision while the PDU will
be responsible for appraisal, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects and the PCP as a whole. An
operaing manual for the PDMA including responsibilities and functions of units has been prepared and
agreed during appraisal. The Higher Council will have an Executive Secretary, who was appointed in
October 1993, and whose key responsibility would be to coordinate the work of the two units. in
addition to the present PIU staff, the PDMA will include only six new professional staff.
11.   Subproject Directors (SPD) would be direcdy responsible for implementation of subprojes in
each Change Area. A Policy Board to be chaired by a Deputy Minister or eminent professional with
experience in the relevant educational subsector, who would be appointed by the Minister of Education,
would be established for each Change Area, and would include nominees of Policy Boards from
interlated Change Areas. These Boards would ensure congruence of subproject activities and outcomes
with MOE policy and would provide a direct avenue for coordinating activities of interrelated subprojects.
Each SPD would have access to an Experts Group with a national membership which would serve as a
esource for advice on technical issues related to subproject activities.
12.   Pog300t Sutainability. Tbe project, when completed, would add YR135 million to the recurrent
costs of MOE, which represents 1.3 percent of MOE's 1992 recurrent expenditure. The availability of
funds therefore does not threaten project sustainability. Institution building processes in the different
Change Areas such as curriculum development, evaluation, teacher performance and the community
colege system would have contiued benefits through the intenwalization and adoption of innovative
practices by various subsectors in MOE. Lastly, the high degree of ownership and commitment generated
by the participatory approach adopted for project preparation would also be a key contributing factor to
project sustainability.
13.   Lessons Leamed from Previous M1A Involvement. The proposed project Is the next logical
step in IDA's relatively long experience with Yemen's ETS. Through 14 projects since 1973 (10
completed and 2 closing in FY94), IDA has invested about US $150 million in the sector. These projects
are contibudng to the development of ETS in Yemen, and have addressed priority needs in teacher
training, technical education and vocational tining, engineering education, nonformal education, and
development of research capabilty in the MOE. Implementation delays beginning in 1989 slowed
disbursemts; however, the Government's reaction to IDA supervision and country implementation
review initatives has resulted in marked improvemeLts in the pace of both implementation and
disbursements over the past two years (disbursements increased from US $4 million in FY91 to US $8



-5-
million in FY92 and US $12 million In FY93). Lesns learned from completed and ongoing projects
and considered in the design of the proposed project include the following: (i) project design must be
flexible enougl* to allow for cbanges in priorities due to unification; (ii) cofinancing must be firmed up
prior to credit effectiveness; and (iii) prior commitment of the Government must be obtained for
appropriate levels of technical assistance.
14.       De tor DA Involvement.  Given Yemen's rapid population growth, poor social
indicators, and modest women's participation, the country asistance strategy has identified human
resource development as a priority. Historically, about 20% of IDA lending has been directed to this
sector with a significant increase in recent years. IDA's sector strategy places priority on improving
quality and leang achievments in grades 1-12, particularly for girls; expansion of technical education
with the participation of business and industry in planning; and, fostering labor market relevant post
secondary education. Ihis project's emphasis on quality improvement in secondary education
complements the previous Basic Education Project.
15.   While the Government is strongly committed to the project, it will need substantial outside
support to implement the program. The Government has requested IDA assistance for the project, to be
supplemented by cofinancing from other donors. IDA support for the project would be justified for the
following reasons: (1) MIA's past involvement in the sector; (ii) the Association's catalytic role in
preparing the project; and ORii) the PCP is a long-term initiative which covers a wide range of issues and
activities. No other donor would have the depth of experience and financial resources necessary to
support such a reform program.
16.   A&mUnt RggdW. Agreements have been reached with the Govenunent on: (i) a sector
development policy statement, including reform objectives, action programs, performance indicators and
targets, delivery dates, and continued commitment to the PCP during the life of the project; (ii)
establishment of the Intermediary (PDMA) and finalization of the management structure for Change Areas
and subprojects; (iii) inclusion in the MOE budget of a line item for quality improvement; (iv) financing
of local costs at the market exchange rate through disbursement against contracts denominated in US
dollars; and (v) procurement of technical assistance through twinning arrangements. For Community
Colleges, agreement has been reached on: (i) establishment and structure of the governance system; (ii)
upgrading of existing secondary technical schools in Sana'a and Aden to serve as Community Colleges;
and (iii) cost recovery mechanisms.
17.   En1rgnmental Axsmnt. The project is classified as OC* for environmental assessment.
Components that enhance environmental benefits Nvould include environmental education coverage in
secondary science education progrAms, a key focus of the project.
18.  fram    Objective Ca oies. As explained below (para. 18), the proposed project would
contribute to: (i) poverty alleviation through labor market oriented education and training programs; and
(ti) bringing women into the mainstream of economic and social activity.
19.    eneits. Ihe project would provide an improved learning environment to, and contribute to
enhanced achievement for, a student populaion estimated to rise from 563,000 in 1992 to approximately
1 million in 2000 in secondary education rades 7-12). Improvements in the quality of secory
education would result from: (i) enhacn the ability of MOE to plan, implement and maage change
through the PDMA and various other agencies by internalizing innovadve processes, and through
establishment of an MIS; (ii) sustained curriculum, evaluation, and learning resources development and



renewal processcs especially In science education, including environmental education; (Mii) dissemination
of Improved teaching techniques to replace the current focus on memory-based learning; (iv) increased
female access to secondary education, especially in underserved areas. through provision of school places
for 5.000 girls, inceolive progams to recruit female headmasters and specialized home based learning
programs for girls; (v) development of capable school leadership through provision of headmasters'
training; and (vi) active community participation in schools through school-based subprojects.
Establishment of a NAiol Cmmunity College System would benefit some 3,000 students per year and
help to replace expatriate workers in middle level positions with Yemenis through the provision of
employment related training which has been desig,ned, and would be contiually monitored and revised,
with the acdve involvement of private sector employers in order to ensure continuing labor market
relevace.
20.   RkM. There are three main risks to be addressed: First, the new unit of the Intermediary agency
(PDMA), the Project Development Unit, is inexperienced. This risk will be midtigated through the
provision of techical assistauce which will provide PDMA with advice from a similar institution, and
by the core role played in the PDMA by the experienced and efficient PIU. Second, because many of the
subprojects are itelated, delays in Implementation of a subproject could result in botdenecks in others.
This risk will be mitigated through represeion of interrelated subprojects on common Change Area
Policy Boards and through carefl training provided to PDMA staff in monitoring subproject
implementation. Third, bureaucratic systems in Yemen may not easily adjust to private sector
pardcipation in the Community College system. This risk has been minimized through agreement on the
composition of the National Community College Council, the governing body of the system, which
includes a majority private sector participation.
21.   Reconnnendao. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Associaton and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
