                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Projects
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a cluster assessment of a series of World Bank funded activities that aimed to
address natural resource management issues in Tanzania: The Tanzania Forest
Conservation and Management Project and its companion the Eastern Arc Forest
Conservation and Management Project; a policy note, ―Environmental crisis or
sustainable development opportunity? Transforming the charcoal sector in Tanzania?;
and a political economy analysis report, ―Enabling Reforms: A stakeholder-based
analysis of the political economy of Tanzania’s charcoal sector and the poverty and
social impacts of proposed reforms?.

The Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management Project (TFCMP) and the Eastern
Arc Forest Conservation and Management Project (EAFCMP) were integrated into a
single operation with International Development Association (IDA) resources and a
Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant. The IDA and GEF funded parts were
appraised separately and issued two separate project identification numbers due to timing
of the GEF approval process. The IDA credit was approved on February 26, 2002,
became effective on May 29, 2002. The GEF grant, which appraised under the title of the
Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and Management Project, was approved on July 3,
2003, became effective on May 18, 2005. The projects were originally scheduled to close
on December 31, 2007. The closing date was extended once, by two years, to allow for
completion of activities that had been added through project restructuring and to make up
for slow implementation progress during the first few years of the project period. A total
of US $37.3 million of the IDA credit was disbursed and US$ 28,884 was cancelled. The
US$7 million GEF grant was fully disbursed. The final total project cost was US$44.7
million.

The sector work ―Environmental crisis or sustainable development opportunity?
Transforming the charcoal sector in Tanzania?, was begun on November 15, 2007 and
delivered to the government on March 31, 2009. The report was officially launched in
Tanzania in August 2009. Originally estimated at a cost of US$70,000, the final cost was
US$138,120, financed through the Bank’s administrative budget and Bank executed trust
fund resources from the Bank Netherlands Partnership Program-Environment (BNPP-
Environment).

The sector work ―Enabling Reforms: A stakeholder-based analysis of the political
economy of Tanzania’s charcoal sector and the poverty and social impacts of proposed

Tanzania in June 2010. The estimated cost was US$80,000. The final cost was US$
77,288 financed by trust fund resources provided by the Governments of Finland and
Norway and the Bank’s administrative budget.

This report was prepared by April Connelly, Evaluation Analyst, IEG. IEG conducted a
mission to Tanzania from November 6 to November 19, 2010, visiting Dar es Salam, the
District of Mkuranga, and Morogoro. The findings of the project assessment are based on
a review of project documents, relevant literature, and interviews with Bank staff and
consultants who worked on the project, central and local government personnel, donor
representatives, representatives of key non-governmental organizations and community
                                             x


organizations, and villagers. Annex A lists the persons interviewed in Tanzania and at
Bank headquarters in Washington.

The findings of the AAA assessment are based on a review of internal files, the reports
themselves, and interviews with Bank staff, government officials, development partners
and civil society organizations in Tanzania. The AAA review is part of a pilot initiative
IEG is conducting to develop a methodology for assessing AAA products. The pilot
criteria for rating the various dimensions of AAA products are presented in Annex C.

IEG would like to express its appreciation to all those who participated in the assessment,
and to staff at the World Bank office in Dar es Salaam, particularly Leah Mukutu, who
helped make appointments and arranged transportation.

Summary
This Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) examines a series activities the World Bank
supported in an attempt to improve the management of Tanzania’s forest resources: a GEF
and an IDA funded operation that aimed to strengthen the institutional framework for
sustainable forest management and two pieces of analytical work that promote reforms aimed
at transforming Tanzania’s charcoal sector into a sustainable development opportunity.
These activities were selected for review to draw lessons from different approaches to
reforming sectors related to natural resources management and to provide input into IEG’s
forthcoming forest evaluation.

The Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management Project (TFCMP) and the Eastern
Arc Forest Conservation and Management Project (EAFCMP) (2002-2009) are fully
blended operations financed by a US$31.1 million International Development Association
(IDA) credit and a US$7 million Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant. The projects were
appraised and approved separately but were implemented as a combined operation. Their
shared project development objective was to assist the government in the establishment of a
framework for the long-term sustainable management and conservation of Tanzania's forest
resources, strengthening the role of individuals, institutions and communities, and the private
sector in management and conservation of forests. The global environment objective was to
promote the sustainable conservation and management of the Eastern Arc forests. The
closing date was extended once, by two years, to December 31, 2009, to make up for slow
implementation progress and to allow for the completion of activities added during project
restructuring in 2007.

Project design focused on institutional reforms, in particular the creation of a new executive
forest agency, the Tanzania Forest Service (TFS). Many elements required to establish the
TFS were put in place, and several tools were developed to enhance the institutional capacity
to sustainably manage forest resources. Resources were channeled directly to communities to
facilitate the process of establishing participatory forest management agreements. The
Eastern Arc Conservation Endowment Fund was established as planned, and is funding
conservation activities in the Eastern Arc Mountain forests. However, the TFS was not
established until July 2010, seven months after project closure, and is still not functional. A
number of the proposals to strengthen the capacity for sustainable forest management could
not be implemented. In addition, a monitoring system to provide information on outcomes of
small grant sub-projects was not established and public-private partnerships for the
management of industrial forest plantations were not piloted. Finally, the Endowment Fund
did not meet its target to raise additional capital. Though many project outputs have the
potential to contribute to sustainable forest management, there is little evidence that the
project’s achievements to date constitute a coherent framework for the sustainable
management of Tanzania’s forest resources.

The outcome of the TFCMP and EAFCMP is rated Unsatisfactory. The relevance of
objectives was substantial, while the relevance of design was modest. The objective of
establishing a framework for long-term sustainable management and conservation was
modestly achieved. The objective of strengthening the role of individuals, local institutions,
and communities in management and conservation was modestly achieved. Achievement of
the third objective, strengthening the role of the private sector, was negligible. Efficiency was
rated modest. The quality of Monitoring and Evaluation was negligible. Initially there were
                                            xii


few quantitative outcome indicators and no baselines or measurable targets. An attempt was
made to improve the M&E framework during implementation by changing the wording of
indicators to make them more measureable and by retroactively establishing baselines. While
progress against each of the key performance indicators was recorded, the link between the
reported achievements and project activities is tenuous in some cases.

The Risk to Development Outcome is rated high. Project gains are at risk because of
insufficient funds to continue activities since project closure and unresolved benefit
sharing issues at the policy level. Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
While the project responded to priorities outlined in the forest policy, its scope was
overambitious, M&E was of poor quality, and supervision was hampered by a lack of
continuity in task managers. Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
Government commitment was insufficient to bring about the proposed reforms within the
project timeframe and project management suffered from capacity constraints in
procurement and financial management.

The report Environmental crisis or sustainable development opportunity? Transforming
the charcoal sector in Tanzania: a policy note (carried out in 2008-2009) aimed to:
consolidate and analyze information on the charcoal sector; present policy options that
could turn the sector into a sustainable activity that provides economic incentives as well
as environmental benefits; and identify knowledge gaps and piloting activities.

In terms of results, the report is rated satisfactory. It has contributed to the broader
development dialogue on the charcoal sector in Tanzania. It led to a follow-up sector
work that assessed the political economy of the proposed reforms. Other donors in
Tanzania have drawn on the report’s analysis in the development of their own programs
and it has served as a reference for World Bank staff working on household energy
issues. As a result of the diagnostic ground work laid by the report, Tanzania is under
consideration as a pilot country by a trust fund program that intends to finance clean
cooking initiatives. At the time of this assessment, however, the report received little
attention from the government.

Strategic relevance and ownership of the report is rated satisfactory on balance. The
report addressed a topic of high relevance to Tanzania and other Sub-Saharan African
countries. The report aimed to be strategic, by highlighting charcoal sector reform as a
potential sustainable development opportunity. It was delivered as the government
embarked on a review of its energy strategy and also corresponds with renewed interest
within the Bank. Feedback was solicited from an array of local stakeholders in the course
of producing the report, including the formulation of recommendations, though the level
of government interest and engagement beyond participation in stakeholder workshops
appears to have been limited.

With respect to quality, the report is rated highly satisfactory. Stakeholders interviewed
by IEG, including government technical staff, unanimously viewed the document as a
high quality diagnostic piece. It drew on a wealth of studies that had already been
completed on the topic but its value added lies in the comprehensive description of the
sector across all segments of the value chain, which is presented in a readable and easily
accessible fashion, and its clear actionable recommendations.
                                            xiii


Finally, dissemination and sustained dialogue is rated satisfactory on balance. The team
made an effort to reach different audiences by publishing the report’s findings in different
formats. Its translation into the national language, the production of a short film and its
availability on the Bank’s external website set it above the dissemination of many other
Bank ESW products. However, there is little evidence of sustained engagement.

The report Enabling reforms: a stakeholder-based analysis of the political economy of
Tanzania's charcoal sector and the poverty and social impacts of proposed reforms
(carried out in 2009 – 2010) was a follow-on analysis to the policy note, undertaken to
gain a better understanding of the feasibility of the suggested reforms. Its objectives
were to: 1) provide relevant stakeholders with a profound analysis of the political
economy of the charcoal sector in Tanzania, including mapping networks and power
relations prevalent in the charcoal sector, in order to better understand the role of
different players; and (2) analyze the poverty and social impacts of proposed policy
reforms in the charcoal sector.

Results are rated satisfactory. The report contributed to the broader development dialogue
on charcoal, specifically providing a better understanding of the political economy of the
charcoal sector in Tanzania. It has served as a reference for staff working on similar
issues within the Bank and other development partners operating in Tanzania. As of
November 2010, the report, issued in June 2010, had had little influence on government
policy, though it may be too early to expect to see such results.

Strategic Relevance and Ownership is rated satisfactory. The report addressed an
important development constraint for Tanzania and was produced in a participatory
fashion, including multiple stakeholder workshops in which participants generated the
primary inputs to the report, but there is little indication of government involvement in
defining the scope or carrying out work on the report beyond participation in relevant
workshops.

Quality is rated highly satisfactory. Stakeholders gave the report high marks for its
systematic documentation of the political economy surrounding proposed reforms, which
many felt was important information that had been missing from other studies on the
topic. The report has been touted within the Bank as a best practice example of political
economy analysis for a sector.

Dialogue and Dissemination is rated satisfactory. The authors have been proactive in
disseminating the report to relevant staff within the Bank but there was little follow up in
Tanzania by the Bank beyond the initial dissemination workshops, though it may be too
soon to assess this dimension of the report.

Lessons

The experience of the Forest Conservation and Management Project generates the
following lessons:
     A reform agenda that depends on the buy-in of key individuals can be stalled
       unless there is: (a) a contingency plan for the loss of political will and (b)
                                            xiv


       sufficient flexibility in project design to enable adjustments to changes in the level
       of ownership.
      Late and incomplete restructuring can result in a failure to complete activities
       within the project timeframe and, as a consequence, to achieve project objectives.
      The use of demand-driven approaches for forestry or natural resources
       management activities may be constrained by insufficient demand, as
       communities often have other priorities.
      Small grant monitoring that narrowly focuses on ensuring that grant monies were
       used for their intended purpose is insufficient to demonstrate outcome level
       results and is a lost opportunity for learning.
      The financial sustainability of endowment funds can be compromised without
       sufficient and early attention to developing the fund-raising skills of Endowment
       Fund staff.

The charcoal reform sector work generates the following lessons:
    High quality analysis is insufficient on its own to prompt action from government
       decision makers.
    Reform of sectors in which responsibility cuts across multiple agencies may be
       difficult without a sustained dialogue through multiple sector units in the Bank
       (forestry, environment, energy).

The following lessons emerge from both the TFCMP/EAFCMP and sector work
experience:
    Changes in mind-set may be difficult to bring about without a strategy for
       generating broad-based consensus up front.
    One project cycle may not be long enough to bring about institutional changes.
       Similarly, dissemination of analytic work without a program for sustained
       dialogue may limit results.

1. Background
1.1    Forest and woodlands cover nearly 40 percent of the total mainland area of
Tanzania. Forest resources play an important role in mitigating the impacts of poverty
(World Bank 2002). Eighty-seven percent of the poor live in rural areas and depend
heavily on forest resources, including charcoal and firewood, to support their livelihoods
(Miledge and others 2007, Blomley and Iddi 2009). Forest products account for 10-15
percent of Tanzania’s registered export earnings and the forest sector provides about 3
million person-years of employment annually (MNRT 2008a, cited in Blomley and Iddi
2009). Tanzania’s forests also make an important contribution to the country’s energy
and water supply. Biomass (wood fuels and charcoal) is the main source of energy for
both urban and rural households, accounting for over 90 percent of Tanzania’s energy
supply (URT 2003). Catchment forests play a critical role in maintaining water flows to
urban areas and to hydroelectric generating facilities, the main commercial energy source
in Tanzania.

1.2     The bulk of Tanzania’s forests are dry ―miombo‖ woodlands1 that provide critical
forest products to rural communities and urban centers, are an important source of dry
season grazing, and perform important services as watershed catchments. The highest
levels of Tanzania’s forest biodiversity are found in the country’s montane forests,
concentrated in the Eastern Arc Mountains, a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot.2
The forests in these mountains also feed over 22 rivers; their catchments collectively
provide water for all of the nation’s coastal communities and generate nearly 70 percent
of Tanzania's hydroelectric energy (World Bank 2003).

1.3     The effective management of Tanzania’s forest resources is constrained by
several factors. Financial resources for the sector are tightly constrained and heavily
dependent on donor funding, which has been highly fragmented and ineffective at
addressing Tanzania's national policy priorities (World Bank 2002). National budget
allocations to the Forest Sector have generally been inadequate and subject to
fluctuation.3 The potential for forests to generate revenue to finance forest management
has not been realized due to poor governance, lack of accountability and limited oversight
which hinders effective revenue collection (World Bank 2002). Sustainable forest

  The miombo woodland is one of the major dry forest-savannah biomes of the world. It covers much of
central and southern Africa and is named for the oak-like "miombo" trees.
2
  The biodiversity hotspot concept identifies areas for conservation priority based upon where the
conservation threat is greatest to the greatest number of species. There are 34 designated biodiversity
hotspots globally. Two factors determine which areas qualify as hotspots: number of endemic species
(those found nowhere else) and degree of threat.
3
  The unpredictable flow of funds from the Treasury to Ministry Departments and Agencies is not unique to
the forest sector. Commenting on this problem in general, Caulfield (2002) notes ―A recent (2001) public
expenditure review conducted by the Government of Tanzania and World Bank highlighted the lack of
predictability of budget releases as one of the main problems afflicting financial administration. Month-to-
month releases are highly variable and do not reflect the needs of the recipients—extreme cases such as the
Ministry of Water receiving more than its total annual budget in one month. Deviations between annual
budgeted and actual figures for Ministries has varied as much as up to 40% in the last two years, but some
estimates put this figure even higher (Therkildsen 2000). Unpredictability of resource flows from the
Treasury to spending units impacts on both allocative and operational efficiency.‖ The problematic release
of funds from Treasury to Ministries has also been noted in subsequent Public Expenditure Reviews.
                                             2


management is also hindered by uncertain tenure and lack of protection status.
Unreserved forests, which are not formally gazetted as reserves, represent approximately
56 percent of the national forest estate. Deforestation occurs in both reserved and
unreserved forests but is more prevalent on unreserved lands where the lack of protected
status allows for their legal conversion to other uses (World Bank 2002).

1.4     Charcoal is an important forest product. It not only accounts for a large share of
Tanzania’s energy, but its unsustainable production is one source of forest resource
degradation, particularly in forests adjacent to urban areas. There is no coherent policy
framework governing charcoal production, trade, and use in Tanzania. Charcoal
regulations are unclear, partially enforced, or easily bypassed. Consequently, only an
estimated 20 percent of the taxes and fees due on charcoal-related activities are collected
and paid (World Bank 2010b). The highly informal nature of the charcoal sector also
creates challenges for forest management.

1.5     This assessment reviews a series of activities the Bank supported in an attempt to
improve the management of Tanzania’s critical forest resources: a GEF and IDA blended
lending operation that aimed to strengthen the institutional framework for sustainable
forest management and two pieces of analytical work that promoted reform of the
charcoal sector. Both the forestry sector and charcoal trade are characterized by weak
governance, law enforcement, and other regulatory capacity (Miledge and others 2007,
World Bank 2010, World Bank 2011a). The forestry project and the charcoal sector work
assessed in this report advocated ambitious agendas to reform each sector. The proposed
reforms required significant political support; results in both cases have been constrained
by a lack of adequate political commitment and buy-in.

1.6      The report proceeds as follows: Chapter 2 assesses the Tanzania Forest
Conversation and Management Project and the Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and
Management Project. The policy note and political economy analysis of the charcoal
sector are reviewed in chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 5 presents the lessons from each set of
activities as well as some common lessons that emerged across all three activities.

2. Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management
Project and the Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and
Management Project
Context
2.1     The project was developed at a time when the dominant paradigm of forest
management in Tanzania was shifting from an approach of ―command and control‖,
which excludes local community involvement towards active management, with greater
participation by non-state actors (World Bank 2002). In 1967, Tanzania’s forests were
nationalized under the Arusha Declaration, which aimed at building a socialist state
(Kihiyo 1998). While the central government was responsible for the management of
public land, in practice virtually no management activities were undertaken and much of
the forested areas were treated as open access. As population growth increased pressures
on forests, there was an increasing recognition that the government did not have the
                                             3


capacity to effectively manage the country’s vast stretches of natural forests and
woodlands on its own. Government capacity to effectively manage the state’s 80,000 ha
of industrial plantations was also limited. At the same time, there was increasing
awareness of the need to involve communities in the management of forest resources and
acknowledgement that communities are entitled to these resources, consistent with a
worldwide shift toward participatory forest management by development practitioners
(World Bank 2002).

2.2     In 1998, Tanzania approved a new National Forestry Policy that provided scope
for developing alternative forest management and conservation regimes and encouraged
the participation of communities and other non-state actors (MNRT, 1998a cited in
Blomley and Said, World Bank 2002). This was followed by the government’s
preparation of the National Forest Program (NFP), which outlined a plan for
implementation of the forest policy, provided the framework for future public
expenditure in the forestry sector, and outlined priorities for donor financing. The
Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management Project (TFCMP) was conceived in
response to the disconnect between the policy objectives put forth in the NFP and the
prevailing institutional structure that was to deliver on these objectives yet remained
oriented toward regulation and enforcement of forest legislation and the exclusion of
local populations (World Bank 2002).

2.3     Preparation of the TFCMP followed the IDA-funded Forest Resources
Management Project (US$ 18 million, 1992-1999). The TFCMP was to serve as a
financial delivery mechanism for the National Forest Program by supporting four of the
innovations called for by both the forest policy and NFP:

2.4     Establishment of a new forest agency as a semi- autonomous ‘executive
agency’. The forest policy called for the creation of a new service-oriented forest
management agency to be established as a specialized 'executive agency' as defined by
the Executive Agencies Act (1997). This proposal was consistent with a wider national
program of civil service reforms ongoing at the time. Executive Agencies are semi-
autonomous public bodies whose operations share many of the characteristics of the
private sector: they are often funded by charges imposed on service users and retain a
higher percentage of what is collected than ministry agencies, pay higher wages than the
public sector, frequently are funded on a performance-related basis, and recruit
executives through open competition (URT 2005). Establishment of the agency was
intended to improve the capacity to provide service delivery functions to facilitate forest
management.

2.5     Support the management of forests by communities through Participatory
Forest Management (PFM) agreements. The National Forest Policy also recognizes the
need to bring unreserved forests under the jurisdiction of local communities through PFM
arrangements (Blomley and Iddi 2009, Blomley and Ramadhani 2006). The TFCMP
supports the expansion of the two primary PFM approaches in Tanzania: Joint Forest
Management (JFM) and Community Based Forest Management (CBFM). JFM is a
collaborative management approach whereby forest management responsibility and
returns are shared between government and forest-adjacent communities. JFM takes
place on land that is owned and managed by central or local governments for forest
                                              4


management, such as National Forest Reserves (for catchment, mangrove, or production
purposes). CBFM takes place in forests on ―village land.‖ Villagers assume full
management responsibility for an area of forest within their jurisdiction that has been
formally declared by village and district governments as a village land forest reserve
(VLFR). Villagers have the right to harvest and retain all income from the sale of forest
products and to undertake forest surveillance patrols (including arresting and fining
offenders). They are also exempt from local government taxes on forest products and
regulations regarding ―reserved tree‖ species. (Blomley and Ramadhani 2006).

2.6     Encourage greater participation of the private sector in industrial plantation
management. The National Forest Policy calls for more active involvement of the private
sector in industrial plantation management in order to improve efficiency and
productivity, and to reduce the fiscal burden of plantations on the public sector. The
project aimed to support this goal by providing resources to develop and implement a
framework to involve the private sector in the management of existing industrial
plantations and strengthen the potential for the development and management of new
plantations.

2.7     Improving capacity for the conservation of forest biodiversity. The National
Forest Policy places a high priority on the conservation of forest biodiversity and
management and calls for the establishment of new forest reserves in areas of high
biodiversity value. Tanzania is a signatory to a number of biodiversity and natural
resource conservation conventions, yet within the prevailing institutional structure there
is very little capacity to address biodiversity conservation needs. Forest protection was
undertaken in the past largely to meet the needs of the timber industry and to protect
watershed catchments. Moreover, within the constrained fiscal framework in Tanzania,
there are almost no public sector resources to make these types of investments in the
absence of a financial return (World Bank 2002). The project aimed to address this
through the establishment of a conservation endowment fund, the Eastern Arc Mountains
Conservation Endowment Fund (EAMCEF), as a sustainable source of funding for
conservation of the Eastern Arc Mountains forests, one of Tanzania’s biodiversity
hotspots.

Design
2.8     The TFCMP and the Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and Management Project
(EAFCMP) were essentially an integrated operation that blended International
Development Association (IDA) resources with a Global Environment Facility (GEF)
grant. The IDA credit and the GEF grant were appraised separately due to timing of the GEF
approval process. Therefore, two project appraisal documents (PAD) were prepared and two
project identification numbers were issued, but the project was managed as a single operation
with shared objectives and will thus be evaluated as such. The IDA credit was approved on
February 26, 2002 and became effective on May 29, 2002. The GEF grant, which was
appraised under the title of the Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and Management Project,
was approved by the Board on July 3, 2003 and became effective on May 18, 2005. The
project was originally scheduled to close on December 31, 2007.

OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS

2.9     The formulation of the project's development objective (PDO) varies between the
credit/grant agreement and the project appraisal document.

2.10 According to the Development Credit Agreement (schedule 2): ―The objective of
the project is to assist the Borrower in the establishment of a framework for long-term
sustainable management and conservation of its forest resources by strengthening the role
of all stakeholders, that is, individuals, local institutions and communities and the private
sector in management and conservation of forests."

2.11 According to the PAD (pg. 5): " The objectives of the proposed Forest
Conservation and Management Project (FCMP) are to provide the resources to assist
Government in policy implementation, in particular by developing a framework for the
long-term sustainable management and conservation of Tanzania's forest resources,
strengthening the role of individuals, communities, villages, and the private sector in
management and conservation of forests, and implementing this framework on a pilot
scale. The project's specific objectives are to: (i) support the establishment of a new
national forestry institutional framework effectively to support the sustainable
management and protection of Tanzania's forest, woodland and industrial plantation
resources; (ii) establish the framework for involvement of the private sector in industrial
plantation development and management; and (iii) develop the institutional capacity
within the forestry sector for coordination, financing, and management of biodiversity
conservation interventions within Tanzania's forests, in particular in the forests of the
Eastern Arc mountains.‖

2.12 For the purposes of this assessment, IEG will use the articulation of the objectives
from the Development Credit Agreement because it is the legally binding document.
Moreover, the wording of objectives in the credit agreement and the PAD are
substantially similar. The ―specific objectives‖ referenced in the PAD are not objectives,
but a recapitulation of the project components.


2.13 In addition to the PDO, there was a global environmental objective (GEO)
associated with the GEF funding. Two versions were presented in the PAD:

      ―The global environmental objectives of the project are to (i) develop and begin to
       implement an integrated biodiversity conservation strategy for the Eastern Arc
       Mountains (which account for 40 percent of Tanzania's remaining tropical high
       forest cover), which will, in turn, strengthen Tanzania's capacity to coordinate and
       lead forest biodiversity conservation interventions, (ii) support an integrated
       community-based pilot intervention in a priority conservation area to achieve
       sustainable impact related to both biodiversity and human development, (iii)
       improve the institutional mechanisms and capacity to undertake forest
       biodiversity conservation, and (iv) develop, and implement on a pilot basis, a
       sustainable financing mechanism for conservation activities in the Eastern Arc
       forests.‖ (pg. 6)
                                             6


      ―The main global environmental objective of this GEF activity is to promote the
       sustainable conservation and management of the Eastern Arc forests.‖ (pg. 14)

2.14 According to the PAD the project contained four main components and nine
subcomponents.

2.15 Component 1 –Supporting institutional change and improving service
delivery (appraisal cost US$22.1 million; actual US$25.6 million). This component
would assist the government with the design and establishment of the TFS as a
specialized 'executive agency', as defined by the Executive Agencies Act (1997). Sub-
component 1.1: Establishment of the TFS with clearly defined roles, functions,
performance standards, and monitoring. The project provided resources to manage the
change process, to strengthen the capacity for administration and management, to
rationalize and to strengthen the capacity for tasks related to policy, planning, and
legislation (which would remain with the Ministry). Financing of key infrastructure
investments including construction of new office facilities to house TFS headquarters and
Ministry staff in a single location, and a limited amount of civil works at the regional and
district level based on an assessment infrastructure needs. Sub-component 1.2:
Improving revenue collection from forests and woodlands, to improve the capacity of the
TFS to become self-financing, and ensure that revenues are reinvested at the local level in
forest protection and management through local institutions. The project provided
resources for the design and implementation of a coherent forestry revenue strategy to
increase net revenues, this included commissioning studies, piloting improved revenue
collection and forest surveillance activities, and the purchase of vehicles and equipment.
Sub-component 1.3: Improving service-delivery mechanisms for participatory forest and
woodland management. The project funds supported workshops; awareness raising
activities; support for networking, information sharing, and monitoring; the preparation
of guidelines; training facilitators; and, providing assistance to villagers to put in place
participatory forest management agreements.

2.16 Component 2 - Private sector involvement in industrial plantation
management (appraisal cost US$2.9 million; actual US$3.0 million). The component
would provide the resources to assess the technical and financial feasibility of industrial
plantations with reference to existing and potential markets as well as the formulation of
steps and guidelines for the private sector's involvement. Multiple mechanisms for the
involvement of the private sector would be developed and implemented on a pilot basis,
and were expected to include leasing arrangements, joint forest management, and co-
management. Sub-component 2.1: Improving the plantation resource information base
and management planning capacity. Sub-component 2.2: Strengthening institutional
support services for private sector involvement. Sub-component 2.3: Pilot alternative
management of selected industrial plantations. Sub-component 2.4: Monitoring and
evaluation of the pilot operations.

2.17 Component 3 - Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and Management (appraisal
cost US$9.2 million; actual US$ 13.4 million). To be financed largely by GEF
(supplemented by IDA), jointly developed and implemented by the World Bank and
                                                     7


UNDP.4 This component would support institutional reform, strategy development, pilots
of community-based conservation, and the establishment and operation of a sustainable
financing mechanism for tropical high forest conservation in Tanzania through the
Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund. Sub-component 3.1: Institutional
reforms for forest biodiversity conservation, in particular of the Eastern Arc. Sub-
component 3.2: Mechanisms for sustainable financing of biodiversity conservation,
including the establishment of an Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment
Fund.5

2.18 Component 4 - Project Administration and Management (appraisal cost US$
0.6 million IDA; actual US$2.7 million) To finance the costs of administration and
management of the project components.

PROJECT RESTRUCTURING

2.19 The DCA was amended three times. Each amendment was approved at the
Regional Vice President level rather than at the Board because the objective and
associated indicators remained unchanged. The GEO also remained unchanged.

2.20 The DCA was first amended on July 5, 2006, adding a subcomponent to provide
participatory forest management sub-grants at the community level and adjusting
implementation arrangements to allow for these funds to be implemented by the project
management unit of another Bank funded project that was under implementation at the
same time as the TFCMP/EAFCMP, the Tanzanian Social Fund II (TASAF), through a
special financing window restricted to participatory forestry management activities.
Initially it was envisaged that the TFCMP/EAFCMP would focus its support for
participatory forest management at the central government level by implementing
awareness raising activities and training a pool of service providers, and that the Danish
International Development Assistance (DANIDA) would complement this by supporting
participatory forest management activities through local government offices in the
districts. 6 During implementation, the government requested that the TFCMP/EAFCMP
finance additional participatory forest management activities at the local level to roll out
4
  The Eastern Arc component of the TFCMP was part of a larger request for GEF support made up of a
US$7 million grant to be implemented by the Bank under the TFCMP and a separate US$5 million grant to
be implemented concurrently as a separate project under the UNDP. The UNDP and World Bank presented
a single joint GEF proposal for US$12 million but requested that the GEF Secretariat make two separate
disbursements. Each IA followed its own internal project management processes. Though the description
of the UNDP-implemented GEF activities were noted in the TFCMP PAD, those activities are not included
in the TFCMP credit agreement and the US$5million GEF grant implemented by UNDP is not counted in
TFCMP project costs.
5
 The PAD also refers to two additional sub-components funded by a separate US$ 5million GEF grant and
implemented by UNDP as a complement to the Bank implemented activities: (1) Development and
preparation of an integrated Conservation Strategy for the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests; and (2) a forest
conservation intervention through government and community partnership initiatives.
6
  At appraisal, in the spirit of discussions of moving toward a possible Sector Wide Approach in forestry,
the Bank and other donors supporting participatory forest management activities agreed to support
government efforts to develop a nationwide program as opposed to implementing projects in isolation of
one another. Following approval of the TFCMP, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Finland) also agreed to
the support implementation of PFM activities at the district level.
                                             8


participatory forest management on a larger scale, because support from other donors was
not national in scale.

2.21 Rather than disburse funds to local governments who would in turn prepare forest
management agreements on behalf of communities, the Bank decided to channel these
resources directly to local communities by creating a special participatory forest
management window under an another IDA financed project, the Second Tanzania Social
Action Fund (TASAF), that was already operating at the community level utilizing the
community driven development approach. The decision to utilize TASAF, however,
created some tension with the other development partners who had already spent a year
creating procedures to finance participatory forest management through local
governments at the district level, were concerned with the parallel systems created, and
felt the Bank’s decision was contrary to principles of donor harmonization.

2.22 The DCA was amended for a second time on July 20, 2007. The project closing
date was extended by two years to make to make up for slow implementation progress
during the first few years of the project period and allow for implementation of additional
activities. The results framework was adjusted to improve the measurability of indicators.
A new disbursement category was added that enabled the implementation of a
Resettlement Action Plan related to setting up a protected area. The country financing
parameters were retrofitted to increase the percentage of disbursements for all categories
by 100 percent and credit proceeds were reallocated from government capacity building
to project management. Additional subcomponents were added but no additional funds
were required due to significant exchange rate gains over the course of implementation.
Two sub-components were added under component one: (i) implementation of forest
resources and ecosystem assessment, and the preparation and pilot implementation of
forest management plans; and (ii) support the government’s efforts to integrate
sustainable woodfuel utilization in the overall energy strategy of the country by financing
activities to improve charcoal production; to study the feasibility of woodfuel plantations;
as well as to pilot innovative economic instruments that also consider alternative sources
of energy. A sub-component was added to component three providing support for: (i)
consolidation of protected area forests and nature reserves; (ii) facilitation of preparation
and pilot implementation of management plans of selected critical watershed forests; and
(iii) implementation of a Resettlement Action plan and the use of SDR1.16 million of
credit proceeds to pay compensate approximately 1,130 farmers, in an area affected by
the creation of a new protected area.

2.23 A third amendment to the DCA was made on August 4, 2009 which reallocated
credit proceeds to reflect changes in disbursement categories consistent with the final
agreed activities and budgets for the remainder of the project period, and increased the
amount of funds that could be held in one of the special accounts.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

2.24 The Forestry and Beekeeping Division (FBD) of the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Tourism (MNRT) was the lead agency charged with project
implementation. A mainstreamed project implementation unit was created led by a
project coordinator and supported by technical component leaders, and procurement and
                                                    9


financial management specialists appointed by the MNRT. An Executive Agency
Implementation Team, representing all the units of FBD, was also appointed to oversee
the process of establishing the TFS.

2.25 The National Forest Program Steering Committee, comprised of representatives
of the MNRT and other key government agencies, had overall oversight responsibility to
ensure that project activities were implemented in a manner consistent with the National
Forest and Beekeeping Program. The NFP Steering Committee was later replaced with
the National Forest and Beekeeping Program Sector wide Approach Steering Committee.

2.26 The Management Unit for TASAF II, another IDA financed project, was charged
with implementing participatory forest management at the village level through a
dedicated participatory forest management window established under a Memorandum of
Understanding with the MNRT, dated February 6, 2006.

2.27 The EAMCEF implemented activities associated with the establishment and
operation of the endowment fund under a subsidiary agreement with the government. The
EAMCEF operates as a Not-For-Profit Non-Governmental Organization. It is governed
by a Board of Trustees and its day-to-day operations are run by the Endowment Fund
Secretariat (EFS).

Implementation
PLANNED VERSUS ACTUAL COST AND FINANCING.

2.28 The US$40 million project was to be financed with a US $31.1 million IDA
credit, a US $7 million GEF grant, Government counterpart funding of US$ 1.7 million
and the remaining US$ 0.2 million was expected to come from un-specified national
NGOs. US$0.03 million of the IDA credit was cancelled. Actual project cost was US
$44.7 million financed by a US $37.3 million IDA credit,7 a US $7 million GEF grant,
and a US $1.3 million Borrower contribution.8 There was no reallocation of funds across
components. Exchange rate gains over the project’s life were sufficient to cover the new
activities added during project restructuring without reallocating funds from other
components.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

2.29 Project implementation was hampered by four main issues: delays in the approval
of critical steps to move forward with proposed reforms; turnover of government and
Bank staff; delays in establishing mechanism to support participatory forest management
activities at the local level; and weaknesses in procurement and financial management.



7
 The difference between appraisal estimate the actual amount of the IDA credit is due to appreciation of
special drawing rights over the project’s implementation period.
8
  The total amount of funding from all sources was US$ 45.6 million while the final project cost was
reported to be US$44.7 million. IEG could not find an explanation for the US$.9 million discrepancy.
                                                    10


2.30 Approval of critical steps to move forward with proposed reforms was delayed
by wavering government commitment. The main focus of the project was to support the
transition of the Forest and Beekeeping Division of the MNRT into a semi-autonomous
agency-the Tanzania Forest Service (TFS). The key framework documents required to
establish the agency were approved by the Head of the Public Service Management in the
President’s office in 2006 but final review and approval within the MNRT was
continually delayed throughout the life of the project. 9 The process of establishing the
TFS was also delayed by the failure to appoint a Chief Executive to lead the agency.
Suitable candidates were shortlisted through a competitive process but the Minister did
not confirm the appointment. Planned activities to involve the private sector in the
management of state owned industrial plantations could not be carried out in part due to
delays in the establishment of the National Forest Advisory Committee (NFAC),
responsible for vetting all concession management contracts. Government commitment to
move forward with PSI activities waned out of a reluctance to pursue concession
agreements in the absence of reliable information on the forest resource base and the lack
of appropriate regulatory and procedural frameworks to allocate concessions, concerns
over an attempted pilot concession that was perceived to have been offered in a non-
transparent manner, the lack of a common understanding of the concept of private sector
involvement, and general backlash against privatization after mixed results in other
sectors. Senior FBD staff also had reservations about the concept of awarding
concessions based on their view that industrial plantations would be the most valuable
asset for generating revenue for the future TFS.

2.31 Frequent turnover of key staff in both the Ministry and the Bank resulted in a
loss of institutional memory, which weakened the leadership and implementation
capacity required to move the proposed reforms forward. On the borrower side, there
were multiple changes in the Minister and Principal Secretary in the MNRT and in FBD
Directors.10 With each change, the incoming official required time to understand what the
proposed reforms were intended to achieve before signing off on them. Some were
openly opposed to the proposed reforms. Others were appointed in an acting capacity and
consequently held little power. Technical staff in the project implementation unit also
changed.11 As a result there were few individuals from the project design stage who could
brief new leadership and facilitate the change management process within the FBD. On

9
  The reasons for delays under the project are unclear. The broader literature on Tanzania’s Executive
Agency Program, however, reports a lack of political will and support and, in some cases, open hostility to
the establishment of other executive agencies in Tanzania. Caulfield (2002) suggests that this is in part a
consequence of the Minister’s low profile in the Executive Agencies Act and in practice.

10
  During the course of the project, there were four Ministers, four Principal Secretaries, two FBD
Directors, and three acting Directors, some of whom held their post for less than a year.
11
  There were a total of four Project Coordinators as well as turnover of component leaders and changes in
the composition of the Executive Agency Implementation Team. The initial members of the Executive
Agency Implementation Team had been trained in change management to be able to assist the Chief
Executive in the establishment of TFS. Supervision reports indicate, however, that within four years of
inception the team had lost five of its nine original members. Their replacements reportedly lacked basic
change management skills required to improve awareness of the TFS objectives and the overall change
process among FBD staff.
                                            11


the Bank side, there were a total of four task managers, which contributed to loss of the
momentum for institutional reform that had been generated during project preparation
and had implications for effective supervision and dialogue with the government.

2.32 Delays in establishing a mechanism to channel funds directly to local
communities and subsequent disbursement challenges delayed funding of many
participatory forest management subprojects until the final year of the project.
Disbursements under the participatory forest management window that was created in
TASAF were initially slow due to the low priority that communities ascribed to forestry
and district staff’s misunderstanding of the eligibility criteria for PFM funds. District
staff were unfamiliar with TASAF’s definition of a community as ―a group of individuals
with a common need‖, and rejected proposals for natural resource management
subprojects if members of the same village had already submitted a proposal for another
type of subproject. The district staff viewed these groups as belonging to the same
community, while according to TASAF they were distinct. To address these issues the
project carried out awareness raising activities to explain the potential benefits of PFM to
communities and capacity building workshops to explain TASAF rules to district staff.
Local service providers were also hired to facilitate the community planning process in
districts where interest in natural resource management subprojects was highest. Once
interest in PFM activities increased, subproject approval was constrained by inadequate
appraisal and low quality proposals. Training workshops were subsequently held that
improved facilitator capacity for subproject appraisal. The number of approved
subprojects increased, but this in turn created a cash flow bottleneck. Consequently
approved subprojects waited over three months for the release of funds.

2.33 Procurement was a persistent problem, resulting in slow disbursement, project
inefficiencies, and the delay or cancellation of some activities. Supervision documents
note that during the initial years the implementing agency lacked the capacity to
implement agreed systems, including financial management, procurement and contract
management. The first year of implementation was spent putting systems in place for
these functions. Implementation was subsequently delayed by lengthy bureaucratic
government procurement procedures. Additional procurement expertise was eventually
contracted, but problems persisted. The improved revenue collection sub-component was
particularly affected.

SAFEGUARDS

2.34 At appraisal the project was categorized as a category B project and the following
safeguards were triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01),
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04), and Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36). An
analysis of environmental and social issues related to the Project was carried out during
preparation and concluded that overall Project impact on environmental management and
conservation in forests would be positive. The project completion report indicates that
environmental compliance mechanisms were also strengthened during implementation,
including the preparation of Forest Sector-specific Environmental Impact Assessment
Guidelines.
                                            12


2.35 While no social safeguard was triggered at appraisal, during the project
implementation period the government established a protected area in the Eastern Arc
Mountains and requested to use US$1.75 million of credit proceeds to contribute to the
development of a resettlement action plan to compensate farmers in the affected area
triggering O.P. 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). By project closure, all cash
compensation had been duly paid out and a grievance settlement mechanism was
implemented. Land for compensation was identified and demarcated on an idle, state-
owned plantation estate but as of the IEG mission allocation of land was not completed.
Follow up to ensure that ownership of the farm is revoked by the President and allocated
in accordance with the resettlement action plan is being undertaken by the local MP
through the Commissioner for Land at the Ministry for Lands, Housing and Human
Settlements.

Achievement of Objectives
OBJECTIVE 1: DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE
MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF TANZANIA'S FOREST RESOURCES

Outputs

2.36 Progress towards the establishment of new forest agency. The key documents
required to establish the TFS were prepared and approved by the Head of the Public
Service Management in the President’s Office, and an Acting Chief Executive was
appointed in November of 2009 to oversee the change management process. However,
the TFS establishment order, a critical step in creating the new forest agency, was finally
issued but only after project closure, despite the two-year extension of the closing date
and a loan covenant that "the Borrower shall establish and operate the Tanzanian Forest
Service as an autonomous institution within 24 months after the effective date". A new
building was constructed to house the TFS headquarters. Construction of the building
also enabled the entire MNRT, which had previously been located in 40 different offices,
to move into a single location.

2.37 Improving revenue collection. The project commissioned studies that explored
different mechanisms to improve revenue collection, but few of the study
recommendations have been implemented. A forest royalties criterion was developed
based on the market value of forest products and services, as opposed to administrative
pricing currently practiced, but its use has not yet been approved. A computerized system
to track revenue collection was piloted in 25 districts, but FBD staff report that the
system is no longer functional due to problems with computer viruses, unreliable
electricity, and the fact that some District Forest Officers are computer illiterate.

2.38 Forest surveillance activities were also carried out to contribute to improved
revenue collection and forest governance. Water-mark documents for licensing of forest
produce were introduced to control forgery. Twelve permanent checkpoints were
constructed to control the transport of forest products on roads that enter the main
markets for forest products. While this is an improvement over the temporary structures
that previously served as check points, FBD staff indicated that this is well below the
estimated 80 checkpoints that are needed. The project budget was sufficient to construct
                                             13


additional check points, but procurement bottlenecks meant that the funds could not be
utilized before project closure. Vehicles were provided for Forest Surveillance Units
(FSU’s) in each of the seven terrestrial zones of the country and two speed boats were
procured to patrol the coastline. The 25 districts with the most forest resources were
provided with vehicles and received funds to patrol and supervise harvesting activities.

2.39 Ecosystem planning and mapping. TFCMP/EAFCMP funds contributed to the
creation of a central database for forestry data nationwide, the National Forestry and
Beekeeping Database, which was largely supported by other donors. The system was
piloted in 65 districts, but a number of capacity constraints were encountered in scaling it
up; as of the IEG mission in November 2010 it was not operational. FBD staff reported
that at the request of development partners they have gone back to the drawing board to
develop a strategy to start over. Project resources also covered the government’s co-
financing of a National Ecosystem and Forest Resources Monitoring Assessment
(NAFORMA) financed by the Embassy of Finland. Launch of work on NAFORMA was
delayed, however, due to factors unrelated to the project. As a result TFCMP/EAFCMP
funds were used instead to procure vehicles.

2.40 The project achieved mixed results with respect to strengthening the core
functions that can contribute to sustainable management and conservation of forests
within the existing institutional framework. Management plans were completed for 1.3m
hectares of production and protection forest, including eight critical ecosystems,
exceeding the target of 150,000 hectares. Four thousand five hundred hectares were set
aside for sustainable wood-fuel production within a government plantation scheme and a
wood-fuel action plan was prepared that drew on the findings of the policy note on
charcoal sector reforms (assessed in chapter 3). However, as of November 2010 the wood
fuel action plan had not been implemented, and it has not been incorporated into a nation-
wide energy strategy as had been envisioned in the project restructuring document.

2.41 Mechanisms to support forest conservation activities. The Eastern Arc
Conservation Endowment Fund (EAMCEF) was established to address the need for long-
term support for conservation and management of the Eastern Arc Mountain forests. The
fund was capitalized as planned and is operational, but operates on a smaller scale than
anticipated. During the project timeframe, a total 49 small grant projects were funded (vs.
target of 20 small grant projects) that address three priority categories: half of the grants
financed community based conservation and development activities designed to improve
the livelihoods of forest adjacent communities, 45 percent funded subprojects that aimed
to improve ecological functions of the ecosystem and strengthen the management
capabilities of the responsible institutions, and 15 percent financed applied biodiversity
research relevant to conservation of biodiversity. As of November 2010, 41 of the grant
funded subprojects had been completed and 8 were ongoing.
                                                     14


Outcomes

2.42 As of the IEG mission in November 2010, the TFS was not yet functional and had
no Chief Executive or management team.12 An opportunity was missed for the TFS to
benefit from capacity building through implementation of the TFCMP/EAFCMP.

2.43 Revenue collected by the FBD increased over pre-project levels. Project files
indicate that revenue collection was 2 billion TZS in FY 1999/2000, 23 billion TZS in
2007/08, and 15.5 billion TZS in 2008/2009; FBD staff informed the IEG mission that
collection in FY 2009/2010 was 33 b TZS. It is not possible to determine the extent to
which this was due to project activities. There is no information to show the extent that
the increase in revenue collected is due to better collection procedures and how much is
due to increased production.13 Anecdotal evidence suggests that the FBD’s field presence
and enforcement capacity were strengthened as a result of the project’s support for
surveillance activities. FBD staff also report that funds for forest surveillance are now
allocated in a more strategic fashion, focusing on the 25 priority areas with the highest
incidence of illegal logging; prior to the TFCMP/EAFCMP, FBD resources were not
targeted to specific areas.

2.44 There is no information on the outcome level results of the EAMCEF grants to
determine if they are in fact contributing to improved conservation of the Eastern Arc
Mountain forests. The EAMCEF monitoring system verifies that subproject funds have
been used for agreed purposes, but it does not measure the outcomes resulting from the
subprojects.14

2.45 Efficacy of the first objective is assessed as modest. Although several of the
project’s outputs have the potential to improve the core functions associated with
sustainable forest management, the TFS is still not operational, and there is no evidence
of the contribution of outputs improved forest conservation. Moreover, the project’s
achievements do not in themselves constitute a cohesive framework for the long-term
sustainable management and conservation of Tanzania’s forest resources.

OBJECTIVE 2: STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, AND
VILLAGES IN THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF FORESTS

Outputs

2.46 Workshops were carried out to raise awareness of PFM process and legal
requirements among stakeholders, but details such as the number of workshops carried

12
   There were several pending steps before the agency can become operational: recruitment of a Chief
Executive to lead the agency, ceremonial launch of the agency, selection of a senior management team,
transfer of assets from the FBD to the TFS, and submission of a proposed budget in time for the national
budgeting process in March 2011.
13
   The project completion report notes for example, that policy changes – not related to the project -
regarding the export of logs have also had an impact on the quantities of logs and other products
transported. (World Bank 2010).
14
     Further details of the EAMCEF are discussed under the achievement of the GEO below.
                                                     15


out and the number of participants were not made available to IEG. Guidelines were
prepared that aimed to clarify and streamline legal procedures associated with PFM,
including harvesting guidelines for village forest management arrangements and a
revision of the guidelines for establishing community based forest management
agreements. A draft of the guidelines for establishing joint forest management
agreements was also prepared but has not yet been published, as the Ministry of Finance
has yet to approve the proposed revenue sharing formula. Four hundred local facilitators
were trained in the process of facilitating the establishing PFM agreements.

2.47 Under the TASAF PFM window, 273 subprojects were financed in 25 districts.
Of these, 212 funded the process of establishing legally recognized PFM agreements: 179
subprojects resulted in the establishment of CBFM agreements and 33 resulted in JFM
agreements. Among the 61 projects that did not finance PFM agreements, 55 subprojects
financed beekeeping activities, and 6 subprojects funded the establishment of nurseries,
which provided temporary employment for food insecure populations to plant trees.

Outcomes

2.48 The project’s target was to bring 50,000 hectares of unreserved forests under
reserved status through the establishment of CBFM or JFM agreements. Data that IEG
obtained from the TASAF implementation unit indicate that the 212 subprojects that
supported established CBFM and JFM agreements cover 2.3 million hectares of forest,
substantially surpassing the target. CBFM agreements account for 2,303,103 ha. and JFM
agreements account for 40,971 ha. However, the outcomes resulting from the CBFM and
JFM subprojects (such as changes in forest condition and improvements in village
livelihoods) are not known. TASAF only monitors compliance with agreed actions that
lead to the legal recognition of a PFM agreement, but does not measure the outcomes
resulting from the creation of such agreements, such as how well communities are
implementing their plans and whether anticipated ecological and economic benefits are
materializing.15 Moreover, a mechanism was not created to ensure continued delivery of
PFM services to these communities or to expand PFM agreements beyond the project.
The outcome-level results from awareness raising activities, training and the publication
of guidelines were not monitored.

2.49 Efficacy of the second objective is assessed as modest. The project succeeded in
expanding the number of PFM arrangements in the country, surpassing the targets it set
for itself in this regard, but there is no evidence to substantiate how well communities are
implementing their plans and whether the anticipated benefits are materializing.
According to the project’s appraisal document, ultimately the goal of the project’s
support was to improve service-delivery mechanisms for PFM and now that the project
has closed there is no longer a mechanism to deliver these services.


15
  The broader literature on PFM agreements in Tanzania, notes that data on the outcomes resulting from
PFM in general is limited. Preliminary research shows that when well facilitated, PFM contributes to
sustainable forest management and can lead to recovery and/or maintenance of forest quality, though
contribute to sustainable forest management, though further research and documentation is required to
confirm this conclusively. Evidence is less clear with respect to actual economic returns and contributions
to rural livelihoods generated by forest management under PFM.

OBJECTIVE 3: STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE
MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF FORESTS

Outputs

2.50 The project aimed to pilot three mechanisms to involve the private sector in
plantation management and monitor their implementation in order to learn which
mechanisms were most suitable. The target was for 20,000 ha of forest plantations to be
placed under private management agreements. Three areas were identified as pilot sites
where informal public-private management arrangements were already in existence and a
memorandum of understanding was drafted to pilot formalized agreements on 16,563
hectares. However, formal contracts were not issued and the pilots were not carried out.

2.51 The project prepared the ―Framework and Guidelines for Evaluating and
Awarding Forest Concessions in Tanzania‖ and a template for concession agreements but
approval of the documents by the National Forest Advisory Committee (NFAC), as
required by the national forest policy, was still pending as of November 2010. A forest
inventory of all 80,000 ha of state owned industrial plantations was completed in 2009
and the outdated management plans for 15 government owned plantations were updated.
However, results have been constrained by delays in putting in place the NFAC, which
approves all concession management contracts. The Committee was finally established in
April 2010, four months after project closure. The IEG mission was informed that the
Committee meets quarterly but as of November 2010, the concessions guidelines and
template had not yet been reviewed and no contracts had been approved.

Outcomes

2.52 The project’s outputs have laid the some of the groundwork to enable future
involvement of the private sector in the management of plantations. The forest inventory
improved the information base on plantation resources which provides the FBD with
critical information to make an informed evaluation of future concession bids. However,
to date the FBD has not formally engaged with the private sector to manage government
plantations and there is little indication that it intends to do so in the near future16, and
the project did not learn what public-private arrangements are most suitable. Efficacy of
the third objective, therefore, is assessed as negligible.

GEO: PROMOTE THE SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE
EASTERN ARC FORESTS.

2.53 US$ 2 million of the IDA credit and the full US$7 million GEF grant were
devoted to the establishment of the Eastern Arc Conservation Endowment Fund
(EAMCEF). The primary purpose of the EAMCEF is to address the need for long-term
support for conservation and management of the Eastern Arc Mountain forests. The
entire GEF grant was devoted to capitalizing the fund while the IDA credit financed the
initial operations and programmatic expenses as well as sub-project grants during the

16
  One school of thought among FBD officials is that rather than offering concessions of state owned
industrial plantations the private sector should be encouraged to develop their own plantations.
                                                       17


establishment phase (2002-2009). As noted in the discussion of the achievement of the
first project objective, during the project timeframe, a total of 49 small grant projects
were funded but there is no information on the outcome level results of the EAMCEF
grants to determine if they are in fact contributing to improved conservation of the
Eastern Arc Mountain forests (see paragraph 2.44).

2.54 According to the project’s 2010 completion report, revenue generated from the
fund is currently insufficient to implement conservation activities in the full area under its
mandate. As a result grant activities have been limited to a subset of five districts to
ensure that available resources achieve results on the ground. A fundraising plan was
developed to secure additional funds to increase the endowment’s principal but it has not
been fully implemented. Additional capital raised during the project implementation
period was limited to a US$ 371,575 grant from Unilever. Revenue generated from the
endowments investment has been less than anticipated as a result of volatility associated
with the global financial crisis and the need to adopt a more conservative investment
strategy than originally planned. The fund declined from US$7.7 million in September
2007 to a low of US$ 5.8 million in December 2008. By project end (December 2009) the
endowment fund had recovered to US$7.8 million, but it was below the target of US$11
million set as part of the 2007 project restructuring. The IEG mission was informed that
as of November 2010 the fund was close to US$ 8 million.

Ratings
2.55 Relevance of Objectives is rated Substantial. The project's development
objectives were consistent with the 2000 CAS objectives of supporting sustainable rural
development and private sector development as well as the goal of public sector reform
and institutional building by aiming to increase the effectiveness of the public sector and
improve governance. The objectives remain relevant to the Joint Assistance Strategy
covering 2007-2010 (extended through a CAS Progress Report until June 2011), which
placed importance on governance and accountability in the forest sector and recognizes
the role of the sector in economic growth. Project objectives were also consistent with the
goals of the National Forest Program, which sets forth the framework for expenditure and
donor support to the forestry sector. The PDO remains relevant to Tanzania’s National
Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty 2005-2010 which recognizes the
importance of natural resource management and forestry under the Economic Growth and
Reduction of Income Poverty cluster. The GEO is consistent with the GEF Strategy for
Biodiversity Conservation, specifically Operational Programs 3 and 4 on Forest
Ecosystems and Mountain Ecosystems. GEF support is also consistent with Article 8 of
the Convention on Biological Diversity, which relates to in situ conservation.

2.56 Relevance of Design is rated Modest. The project included a clear statement of
objectives, though the term ―framework‖ could have been better defined.17 The key
performance indicators identified in the PAD included a mix of intermediate outputs and
outcomes, but the log frame in the PAD was weak. In the discussion of each component

17
  The term framework is not explicitly defined but it can be inferred from the discussion in the PAD that
―framework‖ refers to the ―institutional structure‖ of the forest sector. It is also clear from the discussion in
the PAD that the intention of the project is to create a new institutional framework.
                                             18


there was a clear link to the overarching objective of creating a cohesive institutional
framework for the sustainable management and conservation of forests.

2.57 During the course of the project, however, the relevance of design to the project’s
overall objective diminished. The project’s PFM activities were initially intended to
improve the capacity of the TFS to support the delivery of services to local communities.
The project was restructured, however, to channel most of its PFM resources directly to
local communities through the TASAF project. While this facilitated the expansion of
PFM agreements on the ground, the link between the project’s activities and enhancing
the institutional capacity to facilitate such agreements was weakened. Project
restructuring was carried out a second time, following the mid-term review, in an attempt
to address some of the factors that had stalled implementation of institutional reforms.
The emphasis of the project was shifted to activities to improve the sustainable
management of forest resources within the existing institutional structure, with less
emphasis on reform. This was a pragmatic approach in the sense that it focused on
activities that were under the control of the project management unit as opposed to
institutional reforms that required political leadership outside of the projects control. But
the project’s objective of establishing a framework for forest conservation and
management was not changed.

2.58 Finally, the link between the project’s third component and the rest of the project
also became less clear over time. Originally, US$275,000, of the US$7 million GEF
grants, was intended to support institutional reforms for forest biodiversity conservation,
which would be linked to the institutional restructuring proposed for the forestry sector as
a whole. This component was dropped during implementation, when the establishment of
the TFS had stalled, and the entire US$7m GEF grant was instead utilized to capitalize
the endowment fund.

2.59 Another shortcoming in design was that the time required to bring about the
proposed reforms was underestimated, which suggests that an Adaptable Program Loan
may have been a more appropriate choice of lending instrument to allow for longer-term
support with clear objectives and predefined parameters to move from one phase to the
next.

2.60 Efficacy of the first objective is modest. A critical element of the envisaged
institutional framework, establishment of the TFS, did not take place during the project’s
lifetime. Other measures designed to improve the framework for sustainable forest
management were not implemented in full and those that were implemented do not
constitute a cohesive ―framework‖. In addition, the various risks to development outcome
are also of relevance to overall efficacy as institutional reform, including the
establishment of endowment funds, are of little relevance unless they are sustainable.
Efficacy of the second objective is modest. The project exceeded its target for the
number of hectares of forests officially recognized under CBFM or JFM agreements, but
there is little evidence that capacity to deliver PFM services has been improved and there
is no mechanism in place to ensure the continued delivery of PFM services beyond
project closure. Efficacy of third objective is negligible. The project carried out an
inventory which improved the information base for industrial plantations and provides an
important basis for assessing concession bids. A concession agreement template was
                                            19


drafted, as well as guidelines for awarding concessions but neither has been approved and
the project did not pilot public-private management mechanisms as planned.

2.61 The efficiency of the project in meeting its objectives is modest. A formal cost-
benefit analysis was not made at appraisal or at project closure. The project appraisal
document includes an annex on economic and financial consideration which covers (a)
poverty impacts, (b) environmental values and the national economy, (c) carbon
sequestration, (d) industrial plantation production, and (e) fiscal revenue collection in
relation to FBD expenditures and budget allocation. The analysis, however, is limited to a
discussion of issues that have implications for costs and benefits, not a comprehensive
quantitative analysis. The project completion report estimated US$13.7 million per year
for potential direct and indirect benefits from select project activities, but costs are not
factored into the analysis. Further, the mechanisms required to capture some of the
benefits included in this estimate, such as payment for carbon sequestration and
watershed services, have not yet been put into place. In addition many of the benefits
included in this calculation will not be realized unless sustainable forest management is
maintained over a number of years, which is unclear given the high risk to development
outcome (see below).

2.62 In accordance with GEF requirements, an incremental cost analysis was prepared
at appraisal for the GEF financed project component focusing on conservation of Eastern
Arc Mountains forest biodiversity. The project completion report did not revisit this
analysis because by project closure the GEF dropped the requirement for cost analysis
and no other procedure was introduced in its place.

2.63 The project was not very cost-effective considering that all planned funds were
utilized but the project achieved far less than what was anticipated at appraisal. In
addition, project efficiency as a whole was adversely affected by inadequacies in
implementation. Weakness in procurement meant that some activities could not be
implemented or were not implemented to the extent intended. The timing of disbursement
created additional inefficiencies. Project files indicate that at times funds were not
received when needed or were received when no activities could be undertaken. For
example, funds for boundary demarcation were released in the rainy season when forests
were inaccessible. As a consequence of the delays in establishing the TFS, the strategic
plan and other framework documents that were prepared early in the implementation
period became out of date and had to be updated. In addition, the project completion
report notes that complex contract amendment procedures triggered by poor financial
management could have been avoided by timely reporting. ―Particular weaknesses
existed in management of civil works contracts, specifically the construction of the (TFS)
offices. Notably, there was improper application of the exchange rate formula and
substantial cost over-runs, which were only formally reported at a very late stage,
triggered complex contract amendment procedures that could have been avoided by
timely reporting.‖ (ICR, pg.11)

OUTCOME

2.64 The outcome of the TFCMP/EAFCMP is rated Unsatisfactory based on the
substantial relevance of its objectives, but only modest relevance of design, modest to
                                                     20


negligible achievement of its three objectives, and modest efficiency in meeting those
objectives, major shortcomings, which corresponds to an unsatisfactory rating.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.65 The risk to development outcome is high. The extent to which project gains are
fully institutionalized and sustainable is questionable. Activities that aimed to improve
revenue collection capacity and forest enforcement are at risk due to insufficient funds
for implementation. Gains from strengthened forest surveillance have not been sustained
since project closure. The FBD reports that there has been a marked decrease in the
frequency and duration of patrols due to insufficient budget to operate patrol vehicles and
cover staff per diems. While FBD technical staff expressed enthusiasm for the potential
of tools to improve surveillance and revenue collection capacity identified through
project consultancies, such as the log tracking system, they currently lack the budget to
operationalize these systems. Until the TFS becomes functional, it is premature to judge
the extent that it will utilize the tools developed by the project.

2.66 There are several risks to the gains made in expanding the area of forests under
management arrangements with various stakeholders. Sustainability of forests managed
under JFM Agreements is at risk because benefit sharing has not been resolved at the
policy level.18 The benefits under CBFM agreements are well established legally.
However, support provided through the TASAF PFM window only supports
communities in the process of obtaining VLFR status and many stakeholders noted that
communities need additional support beyond this point to improve their capacity to
actually implement their management plans. The sustainability of TASAF as a
mechanism for facilitating additional PFM agreements is in question because there is no
additional source of funding for the PFM window since the TFCMP/EAFCMP has
closed. Private sector actors involved in plantation management under MOUs are at risk
until formal contracts are signed. Supervision reports consistently noted that private
sector interest in public-private forest management arrangements has waned due to the
delay in contract formalization.

2.67 The financial sustainability of the endowment fund is at risk because the
secretariat has not yet implemented its fund-raising strategy and current investment
income is insufficient to cover the full area under its mandate. By project closure, the
endowment’s capital had not grown to a level where the investment income would be
sufficient to cover operating costs and sustain grant-making activities. Nonetheless, since
the TFCMP/EAFCMP’s closure the EAMCEF has had to rely on the income generated
by its investment to cover operating costs, limiting growth of capital through the
reinvestment of revenues. The EAMCEF Activity Implementation Report (November
2010) notes that ―following a persistent volatility in the world economy and international
financial markets, the EAMCEF investment had been adversely affected during the past
18
   The main benefit of this arrangement in the absence of approval of an official benefit sharing formula has
been that communities are able to utilize forest products from government reserves for self-consumption,
where as in the absence of a JFM agreement communities are completely excluded from utilizing any forest
products within these reserves. The potential for JFM arrangements has however been questioned in the
literature because these arrangements usually take place in government forest reserves with conservation
status, as a result there is limited scope for economic benefits.
                                           21


period and in turn, its future sustainability has been put at a serious threat.. EAMCEF
cannot afford to meet its financial needs exclusively from its already weakened
investment. In order for EAMCEF to effectively sustain its achievements and maintain its
biodiversity conservation agenda, it needs more financial assistance from the
Government of Tanzania, multilateral and bilateral donors and other stakeholders for the
enhancement of the endowment capital as well as for direct funding of its operations and
programme activities.‖ The IEG mission was informed by the Royal Norwegian Embassy
of their intent to fund operating expenses for the fund and subproject grants for the next
five years, but it is not clear when the funds are anticipated to be disbursed.

BANK PERFORMANCE

2.68 Quality at Entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The basic framework of
design drew on the experience of an earlier Bank-supported forest management project
and the Bank delayed preparation of the TFCMP/EAFCMP until the completion report of
the earlier project was issued to ensure that its lessons would inform project design.
Nonetheless, project design was complex and the scope of the proposed reform program
was overly ambitious. The project responded to priorities outlined in the national forest
policy but the time required to bring about change was underestimated and information,
such as inventory data, needed to make informed decisions on some activities was
lacking. Some key risks were underestimated and insufficiently mitigated.
Implementation of the proposed reforms depended on continuity in political commitment
which was ultimately beyond the control of the project, and there was no contingency
plan for how to build momentum in the event that political will was not forthcoming. A
comprehensive M&E system was not developed until five years into implementation.

2.69 Supervision quality is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Supervision in the first
three years of implementation was weak. Project implementation was rated satisfactory in
supervision reports even though disbursements were low and progress on many activities
was slower than anticipated. M&E was noted as a concern in supervision reports and
aides memoire but no action was taken to improve it until the mid-term review in 2006.
Indicators were improved at that point and were used to guide supervision missions for
the remainder of the project.

2.70 Supervision was affected by multiple changed in of the TTL. The TTL who
prepared the project left the region before the project became effective and task
management was transferred to a marine specialist who was new to the country and
unfamiliar with the sector. The subsequent TTL was a sector specialist but was based in
another country office which limited opportunities for face to face engagement with key
decision makers and for follow up. In October 2005, task management was passed to a
forestry/natural resources management specialist who was placed in the country office
and managed the project to completion. This arrangement reportedly improved
supervision and dialogue with the government and also improved the Bank’s ability to
respond to challenges in real time.

2.71 Following the mid-term review, the Bank attempted to revive the project by
restructuring to focus on activities that under the control of technical staff of the
implementation agency that had shown strong ownership of the project but the changes
                                           22


that were introduced were insufficient to achieve the PDO, which remained unchanged.
The Bank proposed to remove the establishment of the TFS as a key project performance
indicator was not accepted by the core team of project implementation staff, feared that
this would send negative signals to political decision makers and further decrease the
likelihood that the TFS would be established. However, the Bank's decision, as part of the
2007 restructuring exercise, to increase the percentage of financing parameters to be
financed by credit proceeds for all categories helped to overcome implementation delays
caused by the lack of counterpart funding. Positive changes in supervision, however,
occurred too late in the implementation period to make up for the time and momentum
that had already been lost.

2.72 The moderately unsatisfactory ratings for quality at entry and supervision results
in an overall bank performance rating of moderately unsatisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

2.73 Government performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. On the positive
side, the Government’s commitment to the project was reflected by the relatively quick
approval for the establishment of the TFS on the part of the Public Service Management
in the President’s Office. The Government also gave strong weight to environmental and
social safeguards. However, this is outweighed by several less than satisfactory aspects
of government performance including the failure to establish the TFS despite receiving
all necessary clearances (due in large part to opposition from within the MTNR itself);
the MoF’s indecision on sharing of benefits and revenue generated by JFM agreements
that jeopardized the sustainability of some community management achievements; delays
in putting in place the National Forest Advisory Committee; contract management
problems; and the lack of delivery on funding commitments for the National Forest
Resources Monitoring and Assessment.

2.74 Implementing agency performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Three
implementing agencies were involved with the project: the Forest and Beekeeping
Division within the MNRT was the main implementing agency; the project management
unit of TASAF was responsible for the participatory forest management subcomponent;
and the Eastern Arc Mountain Conservation Endowment Fund implemented the
IDA/GEF Eastern Arc Mountain component. The performance of TASAF and Eastern
Arc Mountain Conservation Endowment Fund were on the whole satisfactory but there
were significant shortcomings in the performance of FBD. The FBD is credited with
adopting a pragmatic approach to project implementation in the absence of the TFS but
project achievements were undermined by a lack of counterpart funding during the first
five years of implementation because the FBD failed to request the financing provisions
as agreed under the DCA in its budget submission to the MNRT. Supervision reports
indicate that money did not arrive when it was needed or arrived too late to be used for
intended activities. Procurement, contract management and financial management
capacity constraints resulted in slow disbursements and were exacerbated by frequent
transfers of FBD fiduciary staff. Project implementation staff were reportedly supportive
of the project’s proposed reforms, but their ability to focus on the reform process was
constrained by competing demands on their time. Supervision reports indicate that staff
                                            23


were often redirected to address other pressing concerns such as an illegal logging
scandal, fires, and the degradation of water catchment areas.

2.75 The moderately unsatisfactory ratings for both government and implementing
agency performance results in an overall borrower performance rating of moderately
unsatisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)

2.76 Design. The project appraisal document contained a Project Design Summary
rather than a full-fledged Results Framework. Key performance indicators were identified
but baselines were not defined and targets were not established against which project
progress could be measured. The project implementation manual clearly states the
expectation that a monitoring system would be established during implementation.

2.77 Implementation. Supervision reports repeatedly flagged the lack of a project
specific M&E system as an issue of concern, but little was done to address the problem
until 2006. Project files also indicate a lack of capacity within the MNRT to conduct
project M&E. During the mid-term review, carried out in 2006, a Results Framework
was established, intermediate outcome indicators were added, and baselines were
defined. The 2007 amendment to the DCA further revised the results framework to
improve the measurability of indicators. Progress against indicators in the revised results
framework was recorded during supervision missions from 2007 onward. However, the
link between some reported achievements and project activities is somewhat tenuous, as
the M&E system lacked controls to isolate project achievements from other factors.
Rather than utilize a project specific M&E system, the FBD anticipated that the project’s
results framework would be harmonized with the National Forestry and Beekeeping
Database that was under development in parallel to project implementation. The objective
of the database was to provide a single, institutionalized, national system into which
relevant forestry data can be captured, as opposed to individual project based monitoring
systems that cease to function once projects close. Its roll out experienced multiple
problems and ultimately it was not operationalized as planned. The completion report
indicates that majority of the TFCMP/EAFCMP indicators were not updated into the
system.

2.78 Use. The indicators in the results framework were used to asses project progress
during supervision missions, but the mission found no other evidence of the use of M&E
to guide project management decisions.

2.79   Overall monitoring and evaluation is assessed as negligible.

3. Environmental crisis or sustainable development
opportunity? Transforming the charcoal sector in
Tanzania: a policy note
Context
3.1      Charcoal production and utilization in Tanzania is largely unregulated and is
perceived to be one of the key drivers of forest degradation. Deforestation of watersheds
for charcoal production had also received attention in the press in Tanzania for its
contribution to irregular water flows in reservoirs, impeding hydroelectric power. At the
same time the charcoal sector plays an important socio-economic role as a source of
energy and productive activity. According to the 2003 National Energy Policy, wood
fuels (charcoal and fire wood) account for over 90 percent of Tanzania’s energy supply.
Charcoal is particularly important as a cooking fuel in urban areas. Several features make
it an attractive and preferred option over other available cooking fuels: low cost, wide
availability, ease of transport, and availability in small quantities as needed (World Bank
2009). Between 2001 and 2007 the proportion of households in Dar es Salaam using
charcoal as their energy source grew from 47 percent to 71 percent19 and demand is
projected to grow (World Bank 2009). The annual revenue generated by the charcoal
industry in Dar es Salaam alone is valued at US$ 350 million. Activities related to the
production and trade of charcoal employ more than 100,000 people (PREM 2007).
Charcoal production is especially important as an income source for the poorest
households who have limited alternatives (World Bank 2009).

3.2      Previous attempts to address ―the charcoal challenge‖ in the country had met with
little success, partly because they addressed a single issue on the charcoal value chain in
isolation of others. An extreme example of a failed attempt occurred in 2006 when the
MNRT responded to negative press coverage of deforestation and illegal logging by
imposing a ban on charcoal. The ensuing public outcry caused the ban to be lifted within
two weeks.

3.3      This report is listed in the 2007-2010 Joint Assistance Strategy as an analytical
and advisory activity under the cluster for Growth and Reduction of Income Poverty. It is
classified in the activity completion summary as a client requested task. The request for
this sector work came through the MNRT when the TFCMP/EAFCMP was well under
implementation. The sector work originated to respond to a perceived gap in knowledge
of the wood fuel sector that would enable key decision makers in Tanzania to make
strategic decisions to achieve sustainable use of charcoal. The policy note introduction
states that ―the Government of Tanzania asked the World Bank to provide decision
makers in Tanzania with a policy note summarizing the fundamental characteristics of
charcoal use in the country and presenting policy options along the entire value chain of
charcoal production and consumption.‖



19
     During the same period the use of liquid petroleum gas declined from 43 percent to 12 percent.
                                                      25


3.4      The policy note was intended to be a relatively small product to provide ―just-in-
time‖ advice to the government on policy options that could turn the sector into a
sustainable activity that provides economic incentives as well as environmental benefits.
A number of studies had already been produced on the charcoal sector in Tanzania and
other countries. Therefore, rather than undertake additional research, the concept note
proposed to consolidate existing research into a comprehensive analytical overview of the
sector. Each component of the value chain (production, trade, and consumption) was to
be analyzed according to four dimensions: socioeconomic, environmental, policy and
institutional. The report aimed to add value by providing a comprehensive overview of
the sector and by identifying knowledge gaps where more detailed data analysis would be
required in the future and activities that would require piloting.

3.5     The final report discusses a range of policy measures along the entire charcoal
value chain in Tanzania: production, trade, and consumption (see Box 1). It begins with
a broad overview of the charcoal sector in Tanzania and its key challenges, followed by a
summary of the key legal and policy measures to address these challenges undertaken
over the past two decades and an assessment of how successful they have been. Key
policy recommendations are then set out along the production and marketing chains,
along with identification of knowledge gaps and piloting activities that will be needed. It
closes with an assessment of the likely impact of the reforms on reducing deforestation
and forest degradation, as well as the positive impacts on boosting employment and
improving rural livelihoods and concludes with an assessment of the costs of the policy
recommendations made.

Box 1. Recommendations of the Policy Note report
The policy note sets forth a number of recommendations that, would lead to an increased formalization of
the charcoal sector, changing the regulatory, fiscal, and pricing frameworks:
• Ensuring that charcoal revenue collection responsibilities of local governments are matched with an
ability to retain a higher share of revenue collected. It is proposed that the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Tourism, the Prime Minister’s Office–Regional Administration and Local Government, and the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs identify pilot districts with the commitment and political will to
reform charcoal trade.
• Supporting local governments in reinvesting charcoal income, with the objective to further improve
revenue collection and promote sustainable forest management.
• Introducing fiscal incentives that reward sustainably produced charcoal and place additional costs on
illegal production. To offset the increased investment costs associated with sustainably produced charcoal,
it proposed that a fiscal incentive scheme be developed.
• Introducing reduced licensing costs for charcoal coming from areas with an approved harvesting plan. At
the same time, tougher sanctions could be introduced for illegally produced or traded charcoal.
• Strengthening the government’s capacity for monitoring and enforcement of rules and regulations
regarding both transport and trade of charcoal.
Given the current political economy of charcoal in the country, bringing the charcoal trade into the tax-
based economy is a significant challenge, that needs to be tackled head-on and would require strong
political support if the vested and powerful interests that currently control the sector are to be confronted.
Furthermore, as reforms gather pace, increasing amounts of traded charcoal would enter the formal
economy reflecting the true costs of production (including raw material costs, and all fees and taxes). As a
result, the end price to consumers is expected to rise.
Supporting measures are proposed that would make the charcoal sector more sustainable, inclusive, and
                                                     26

achieve greater impacts on poverty reduction, if implemented alongside the policy reforms:
• Harvesting plans need to be developed for forest areas administered by central or local governments.
• Scaling up community-based forest management will help secure tenure for rural producers.
• Small-scale plantations and woodlots could increase supplies of wood for charcoal and trigger economic
opportunities and land-use planning in rural areas.
• Effective pricing policies of raw material by charcoal producers could provide an incentive to adopt
technologies improving the efficiency of charcoal production.
•The promotion of fuel-efficient stoves can compensate for expected increases in sustainable charcoal
prices.
• Fuel switching, targeted at better-off segments of the society, must be an integral part of policy measures
to achieve sustainable charcoal production.
In addition to the employment and income benefits the above measures would deliver, charcoal sector
reform would increase government revenue and a broaden the tax base. Furthermore, if measures are
introduced to improve the supply of raw materials for charcoal production (through tree planting initiatives
and participatory forest management), unsustainable production would gradually be replaced by regulated
production on a sustainable basis.
There is increasing interest inside and outside the Tanzanian government in climate mitigation and
adaptation, and in particular Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). For
charcoal sector reform, the following considerations for promoting stakeholder participation at the local
level, currently discussed under REDD initiatives, are of relevance: (a) strengthening rights and governance
through forest tenure reforms, mapping of lands, and recognition of rights to ecosystem services in support
to the ongoing expansion of participatory forest management; (b) providing incentives for tree planting,
woodlot establishment, and technologies improving the efficiency of charcoal production; and (c) using
REDD funding to develop stronger accountability structures, inclusive processes that engage a multitude of
stakeholders, and monitoring and control systems at the local level.

Process
3.6      According to the activity completion summary the report was produced over a
period of 16 months (from the date of the concept note to delivery to client). Work on
the report appears to have progressed smoothly. The concept note was reviewed on
November 15, 2007 and during the first year a literature review was prepared and
secondary data analysis completed. In October 2008 four stakeholder workshops were
held in Dar es Salaam to discuss and agree upon the specific policy measures to
incorporate in the report. Participants included representatives of various sector
ministries, district officials, charcoal producers, traders, NGOs and development partners.
A decision meeting was held in December 2008 and the final report was delivered to the
client (the FBD) in March 2009, approximately six months after the original estimated
delivery date. Dissemination was postponed to allow time to print a sufficient number of
copies of the report. The report was officially launched in a series of workshops in
Tanzania in August 2009.

3.7    The analysis was carried out by a small team comprising two Bank staff: a
Forestry/ NRM specialist based in the Dar es Salaam Country office, who was the final
TTL for the TFCMP/EAFCMP, and a Natural Resources Economist from the
Environment Department. Input was also provided by a local consulting firm active in
                                                       27


renewable energy and the charcoal sector. Staff of the MNRT/FBD facilitated the
organization of the workshops.

3.8     The final cost of the report, US$138,120, was above the original estimate of
US$70,00020 but there is no information in the project files to explain the cost overrun.
All costs were covered by the Bank’s administrative budget and Bank executed trust
funds from the Bank Netherlands Partnership Program Environment.

3.9    Economic and Sector Work (ESW) is assessed on four criteria21: results; strategic
relevance and ownership; quality; and, dissemination and sustained dialogue. The
following sections assess the evidence on each of the criteria. Detailed evidence is
presented in Annex D.

Results
3.10 In assessments of Bank lending products, results are assessed against an explicit
statement of objectives and key performance indicators. In the case of sector work a
statement of objectives is not always clearly defined. Expected results can, however, be
inferred from the discussion of the scope of the document, its intended audience and
expected outcomes found in different documents in the project files. Based on the
statement in the concept note, the inferred objectives of this policy note are: (1) to
consolidate and analyze information on the sector; (2) to present policy options and
implementation advice; and, (3) to identify knowledge gaps and piloting activities.22
With respect to outcome level results, the concept note and the final report clearly
indicate that the policy note would provide input to activities to be carried out under the
TFCMP/EAFCMP, specifically the development of a wood fuel action plan. The primary
audience is identified as the government. Secondary audiences are identified as the other
development partners, civil society, stakeholders in Tanzania and other countries in the
region.



20
   Different estimated costs are on record for this product. According to the Activity Completion Summary
in the Project Portal, the estimated cost was US$70,000, while the work program amount in the Project
System Module was US$207,500.
21
     An explanation of each of the criteria is presented in Annex C
22
  Objectives noted in the Activity Completion Summary (ACS), which is completed following delivery of
analytic tasks, where ―to (a) provide an analysis of potential and constraints for substituting wood fuels
with alternative energy sources taking into account environmental, socio-economic, political and
institutional dimensions; and (b) provide "on-time" policy advice to the GOT on how to potentially
integrate wood fuels into future energy strategies of Tanzania.‖ In addition to specific objectives, the ACS
includes a list of five development objectives and associated indicators recognized by the Bank’s
Operations Policy and Country Services for analytical products. The task team ticks what those that are
most relevant and rates progress against each but the basis for such ratings is not provided. In this case the
Indicators selected in the ACS template and self rating: (1) Inform lending. Results Indicator: New loan
under preparation/ implementation. Rated partially achieved. (2) Inform government policy. Results
Indicator: New government strategy adopted. Rated partially achieved. (3) Inform/stimulate public debate.
Results Indicator: Media widely reports Bank analysis. Rated largely achieved. (4) Influence development
community. Results Indicators: Shift in donor policy/priorities. Rated largely achieved. Other Donors
integrate results into new programs. Rated partially achieved.

3.11 The report achieved its immediate output-level objectives of completing the
proposed analysis, suggesting policy recommendations, and identifying both short and
long term interventions to implement each of the proposed recommendations, the key
institutions associated with each intervention, and pilot activities or further knowledge
that is required to implement each reform. With respect to outcome-level results, the
policy note provided input to a wood fuel action plan produced under the
TFCMP/EAFCMP. However, at the time of the IEG mission the wood fuel action plan
had not yet been implemented, nor had it informed a review of the Energy Strategy for
Tanzania. Progress in implementing the wood fuel action plan was affected by the
implementation experience of the TFCMP/EAFCMP itself.

3.12 The report has directly led to a follow-up study to assess the political economy of
the proposed reforms, which is reviewed in chapter 4. The combined analysis provided in
these two reports has been utilized by World Bank HQ based staff and the donor
community in Tanzania. Publication of the policy note was timely as it coincided with a
renewed interest in Biomass Energy among some sectors within the Bank (energy,
environment, forestry). There is awareness of the report among staff working on such
issues, in particular staff working on household energy issues. Staff interviewed by IEG
viewed the report as a solid descriptive piece that has contributed to the current state of
knowledge on biofuels. The report has been cited by at least two recent World Bank
publications on biofuels: ―Biofuels in Africa: Opportunities, Prospects, Challenges‖ and a
background paper prepared for the Bank’s Sustainable Energy Department, Household
Energy Access for Cooking and Heating. Lessons Learned and Way Forward. 23 Some
staff interviewed by IEG have also shared it as a reference for project implementation
teams working on charcoal issues in other countries.

3.13 In addition, there is preliminary evidence that the report is influencing a World
Bank Trust Fund program, the Africa Renewable Energy Access Program (AFREA),
which is developing an options paper for the AFTEG that discusses how to integrate
biomass options into the energy group’s work. The TTL charged with administering the
trust fund credits the report with helping to shape the way they are approaching charcoal
issues. The Trust fund is interested in financing biomass pilots that would incorporate
clean cooking initiatives and take the entire supply chain into account. Tanzania is under
consideration as a potential pilot country because of the analytical ground work that has
been laid by the policy note and the follow up political economy report.

3.14 IEG interviewed three donors in Tanzania who have found the report to be of use
to the development of their programs. The United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID) directly credits the report and the follow-up political economy
analysis, for its decision to allocate US $4 million in its new country assistance strategy
to address the charcoal sector. DFID was particularly struck by analysis that showed the
sector’s contribution to the national economy, valued at US$650 million, compared with
coffee and tea, the country’s main export crops, which contribute US$60 million and
US$45 million respectively. The Swiss Development Cooperation became aware of the

23
  The policy note has also been cited by work produced outside the Bank. For example, G. Shively, P.
Jagger, D. Sserunkuuma, A. Arinaitwe, C. Chibwana. 2010. ―Profits and Margins along Uganda's Charcoal
Value Chain‖. International Forestry Review 12(3):270-283.
                                                    29


report when they were already in the process of developing a proposal for a charcoal
sector intervention but note that they have drawn on the report to help them determine
which segment of the value chain to target. UNDP states that they regularly draw on the
report’s analysis in their dialogue with the government to strengthen the case for a
potential program to regulate the charcoal sector throughout East Africa. There is also
ongoing dialogue between the report’s authors and GTZ who proposed development of a
Biomass Energy Strategy in Tanzania. Each of the interventions mentioned above were in
preliminary stages of development at the time of this assessment so it is too early to
determine if they will in fact lead to implementation of the report’s recommendations.
None the less it is a clear indication that the report has raised awareness and is
contributing to the dialogue on the topic within the development community.

3.15 To date, the report has not yet found much traction with the government and there
is little evidence of its impact on the Bank’s country program in Tanzania. Interviews
with the Country Management team suggest that the report’s recommendations are
unlikely to be taken up under the Country Assistance Strategy currently under
preparation. A challenge has been the difficulty in identifying an institutional champion
willing to take the reforms forward.24 This may stem in part from the fact that no one
public institution in Tanzania has overall authority to regulate the charcoal sector. The
responsibility cuts across four Ministries: the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, the
MNRT, the Prime Minister’s Office for Regional and Local Government, and the
Division of Environment in the Vice President’s Office. Implementation of the proposed
recommendations also involves the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs. The cross
cutting nature of the topic has several implications for engendering ownership. Within
each agency, charcoal competes with other priorities of greater importance to the
institution. The fact that each agency is only responsible for regulating one segment of
the charcoal value chain may reduce its priority. Within the Bank the subject also falls
under the sphere of different sector units. Conducting an effective dialogue across all of
the relevant agencies may be confined by competing priorities in each of the individual
sector units within the Bank. The lack of follow through by the government may be tied
to the process by which the policy note was produced. 25

3.16 It is a challenge to determine the appropriate length of time to judge intermediate
to long term outcome level results from this sector work. The report was printed in March
2009 and outcome level results may take some time to materialize. Moreover, with the
change in several key Ministers following the elections that took place in October 2010,

24
  The Assistant Commissioner for Renewable Energy is reported to have been a proponent for charcoal
sector reforms and supportive of the Bank’s work but took a position in a different government agency
shortly after the policy note was completed. The challenge of identifying an institutional champion to move
the reforms forward is not new; staff working on charcoal in Tanzania reported similar challenges in the
1980’s. IEG interviews with the donor community in Tanzania as well correspondence between the Task
Team and other development partners attempting to address the sector indicate that this challenge is not
unique to the Bank.
25
  IEG’s evaluation of Economic and Sector Work and Technical Assistance found that ―close collaboration
with clients, from task initiation through the formulation of recommendations, was important for ESW and
TA to be effective, whether clients actually produced part of the task or not.‖ (IEG 2008) In addition the
evaluation found that where champions did not already exist, they could be cultivated through substantial
efforts in collaborating with clients.
                                              30


there could be improved scope for engagement with some government agencies. In fact,
the recently elected Minister of Environment has expressed preliminary interest in
addressing charcoal (see the section on dissemination and dialogue). Moreover, the report
coincides with a renewed interest in biofuels within the Bank and new energy strategies
under preparation that incorporate biomass as a renewable energy, which may increase
scope to influence future Bank activities and for follow up with the government.

3.17 Results are rated satisfactory. The report to date has contributed to the state of
knowledge on the charcoal sector in Tanzania. It led to a follow-up sector work that
assessed the political economy of the proposed reforms and has also served as a reference
for World Bank staff working on household energy issues and other development
partners in Tanzania. The diagnostic ground work laid by the report is credited with
Tanzania being considered as a potential pilot country for a trust fund clean cooking
initiative and for potential inclusion of the topic in one donor partner’s country program.
But to date there is no discernable impact on government policy.

Strategic Relevance and Ownership
3.18 Given the sheer magnitude of the sector and it socioeconomic importance,
charcoal is clearly an important development issue for Tanzania. It has been identified as
a long standing development constraint in the literature and it is an area that received
attention from the Bank in the past. In the late 1980’s the Bank financed a pilot program
for improved charcoal stove distribution and more efficient charcoal production that was
financed as part of the Energy I Project. During the same time period, wood fuel supply
(firewood and charcoal) was also addressed under the UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). The Bank subsequently moved away from
the topic. The report is timely in that is coincides with a recent resurgence of interest in
the topic within the Bank in conjunction with the climate change agenda. In addition,
there are four national policies that recognize charcoal as a development challenge: The
National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (Tanzania’s PRSP); The National
Energy Policy; National Environment Policy; and the Forest Policy. However, rather than
promote reform of the charcoal sector, the solution that is advocated is to replace
charcoal with other sources of energy. Only the forest policy explicitly supports the
development of biomass energy resources (including charcoal). (GTZ/UTR Ministry of
Energy and Minerals 2010) The literature documents how charcoal has been perceived
negatively by most policy makers (GTZ/UTR Ministry of Energy and Minerals 2010).

3.19 The fact that reforming the sector is not advocated by most government policy
documents should not be viewed as a lack of relevance on the part of the policy note. It is
a sector that has implications for poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability,
including forest health. In fact, the policy note is strategic in the sense that it attempts to
raise awareness of a missed opportunity. An implicit objective of the report appears to be
to contribute to a shift in the prevailing negative perception of the sector: ―Significant
changes need to be introduced to regularize and legalize the currently informal sector.
This would require a major shift both inside and outside government with regard to how
charcoal is viewed and managed from a policy perspective. Currently, the sector is
viewed almost entirely negatively, and as a result, prevailing policies and laws tend to
focus on regulation, enforcement, restriction, and, where possible, moving away from the
                                             31


sector altogether to other energy sources. This policy note argues that this perception will
need to be changed, and instead a more enabling environment created that allows for
responsible, sustainable, and profitable enterprises to flourish within the sector. This
policy note provides recommendations that, if implemented, would lead to an increased
formalization of the charcoal sector, changing the regulatory, fiscal, and pricing
frameworks.‖ (World Bank 2010).

3.20 The report was included in the 2007-2010 Joint Country Assistance Strategy,
which was agreed upon with the government. But beyond the initial request for the policy
note the government has shown very little ownership of the production of the report. It is
not clear to what extent key decision makers participated in defining the scope or in the
actual production of the report. Prior to the stakeholder workshops in October 2008, an
email was sent to the MNRT and the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, copied to other
relevant ministries, informing them of the initiation of field work and requesting their
leadership in the process. Interviews indicate that an Advisory Committee was put
together with policy makers from each of the key ministries responsible for regulating the
sector but it is not clear to what extent they actually provided input. The final draft,
addressed to the Permanent Secretary of the MNRT and copied to other relevant
Ministries, was delivered on March 31, 2009. Project files indicate that the government
was provided with an opportunity to comment but there is no record of any comments
being received. The final report acknowledges the support of the Director of FBD/MNRT
and the Assistant Commissioner of Renewable Energy in the Ministry of Energy and
Minerals and their respective staff. Technical staff in the FBD provided logistical support
for production and dissemination of the report but were not included in providing
substantive input and lacked buy in. Interviews suggest that the government felt
disengaged from the process and viewed the report as a ―World Bank / Civil Society
initiative‖ rather than a government produced document that they have a mandate to
operationalize.

3.21 On balance, Strategic Relevance and Ownership is rated satisfactory. The report
addresses a recognized development constraint in Tanzania and many other Sub-Saharan
African countries. It was delivered as the government embarked on a revision of its
energy strategy and also corresponds with renewed interest within the Bank. The report
aimed to be strategic by highlighting a potential opportunity that is has not yet been
picked up in government policies. A local NGO was involved in the production of the
report, and input to the recommendations was solicited from an array of local
stakeholders through participation in workshops. But the government’s role in defining
the scope of the report and in its production appears to have been limited.

Quality
3.22 Stakeholders interviewed by IEG unanimously viewed the policy note as a high
quality diagnostic report. A literature review of the charcoal sector in Tanzania carried
out as a scoping exercise for a GTZ initiative, describes the report as ―the most thorough
review of the charcoal industry in Tanzania to date.‖ (GTZ/UTR Ministry of Energy and
Minerals 2010) Some stakeholders interviewed by IEG also praised it for its concise and
user friendly presentation that in their view increases its accessibly to policy makers.
                                            32


3.23 The report appropriately drew on the existing knowledge, including the
experience from other countries, and analyzed how it would work in Tanzania. It
provides specific policy recommendations and suggests short and long term actions
required to put the recommendations into practice. The recommendations are made more
operational through the identification of the key institutions to lead each process, and
where pilot activities are needed, as well as indicating knowledge gaps that need to be
filled to implement the proposed reform. The information is presented in a concise and
readable manner that is accessible to many audiences.

3.24 The policy note also appears to have received appropriate input from relevant
experts and adequate managerial oversight during preparation. The concept note and the
final draft were reviewed by Bank staff and an external expert. Peer reviewers comments,
which suggested tightening the report to bring out key messages and make it more
readable for policy makers, appear to have been taken into account. A criticism noted by
one reviewer was the ―failure to ask questions about who were the primary actors which
controlled the charcoal trade.‖ But this was addressed in a follow up report on the
political economy (assessed in chapter 4). With respect to management oversight, the
sector manager chaired the review of the concept note as well as the final decision
meeting and the authors report that the country director was very supportive of the work
and encouraged the team to proceed with a follow-up study when trust funds later became
available.

3.25 Quality is rated highly satisfactory. It provides a comprehensive description of
the state of the charcoal sector in Tanzania. It drew appropriately on existing knowledge
but analyzed how it would work in the Tanzanian context. The work was adequately peer
reviewed by experts within and outside of the Bank. The information is comprehensive
but presented in a concise and readable format that is accessible to policy makers and
provides clear and actionable recommendations.

Dialogue and Dissemination
3.26 The report was officially launched in Tanzania in August 2009. A series of
dissemination workshops were held targeting the same stakeholder groups that had
participated in the workshops carried out as part of the report’s preparation. Journalists
were also invited to attend the dissemination events. The IEG mission found a high level
of awareness of the reports in Tanzania, particularly in Dar es Salaam. Stakeholders
interviewed by IEG who attended dissemination workshops described the launch as a
high quality event, though some commented on the absence of government decision
makers from the MNRT. Stakeholders noted that there was some media coverage at the
time of the launch. A criticism of the dissemination workshops is that the Bank largely
convened people who already bought into the need for the proposed reforms and thus
missed an opportunity to engage other important actors. That is not to say that the sector
work is not of value to the stakeholders convened but that to take the recommendations
forward, traction also is required with decision makers who may not currently buy in to
the solution advocated.

3.27 The Team made an effort to reach different audiences by publishing the report’s
findings in different formats. The full report was printed in English and is easily
                                                     33


retrievable from the Bank’s external website. A four page summary was prepared in
English and Kiswahili and was distributed to officials at the district level through a local
NGO. A 15-minute documentary film based on the policy notes findings was also
produced in an English and Kiswahili version. While the report was pitched to policy
makers, the documentary was targeted to the general public with the intention of creating
the basis for an informed discussion about the future role of charcoal in Tanzania. Both
versions of the documentary are posted on the World Bank’s You Tube Channel. The
documentary was screened in Dar es Salaam in June 2010, at the launch of a follow-up
report on the poverty and social impacts of the reforms proposed in the policy note.
Copies of the documentary were also provided to the FBD’s zonal extension mobile
cinema units, which host movie nights in each of the districts. The report’s accessibility
on the Bank’s website, the effort to disseminate key messages in Kiswahili and the film
are notable improvements over past efforts to disseminate Bank sector work in client
countries.26

3.28 Beyond the official dissemination events, there is little evidence of strategic
follow up by the Bank’s country office. To date, the report has not served as an input to a
sustained dialogue with the client. 27 The TTL relocated to another country office within a
year of the report’s launch. His replacement was familiar with the report but at the time
of this assessment she had only begun her post in the country office and her work
program was unclear. At the time of this assessment, the scope for policy dialogue with
the FBD or MNRT, the official counterpart agency for the report, was limited because
since closure of the TFCMP/EAFCMP there have been no further Bank-funded
operations under MNRT implementation. Substantive engagement with the MNRT on the
follow up ESW appears to have been limited (see chapter 4). It is unclear whether
support for the FBD or the MNRT will be included in the new CAS that is under
preparation. The Bank’s support for the Energy Sector, another relevant ministry to
implement the report’s recommendations, is focused on electrification. In the future there

26
   Background work on Analytic and Advisory Activities that was carried for IEG’s recent evaluation of
Agriculture and Agribusiness provides a useful benchmark to compare dissemination of the policy note
with past ESW dissemination efforts. Only seven of the 19 reports examined for that review had been
translated into the local language and less than a third of the reports were made available on a website.
While most of the reports examined for that paper had been presented at a seminar, only 18 percent of these
seminars were reported in the local media. Similarly an internal quality assurance report carried out in 2004
found that ―(r)eports too often were not translated into local languages or formally published, which
reduced impact. Also, the Bank needs to make more use of Web-based dissemination for AAA reports.‖
27
   IEG’s evaluation of ESW and TA (2008) found that sustained follow-up after the completion of the tasks
was important for effectiveness. Yet, the lack of sustained dialogue appears to be a common flaw with
World Bank AAA. IEG’s Agriculture and Agribusiness Evaluation (2010) note that ―less than a quarter of
the AAA reviewed led to sustained engagement on a particular topic in the country, suggesting that
inadequate dissemination may be limiting the results achieved. Most reports were presented at a seminar
and discussed with senior policy makers, but dissemination tended to stop there.‖ A background paper on
AAA commissioned for the same evaluation pointed to several institutional factors that contribute to the
lack of sustained follow-up ―(i)n the Bank’s business processes, AAA is viewed as a discrete activity and
once the report has been delivered to the client and the seminar given, the task is complete. Dissemination
is still viewed quiet narrowly as a seminar or series of seminars, and is something of a residual. Bank
procedures do not require a ―sustained dialogue plan‖ as part of the concept note. Also the concept of
―sustained dialogue‖ is not part of business of budgeting processes, is difficult to measure and monitor, and
thus tends to be minimized.‖
                                          34


may be scope for taking up the issue with the Department of Environment. A World Bank
mission participating in the climate change conference in Cancun (December 2010) held
preliminary discussions with the newly appointed Minister of Environment who
reportedly expressed interest in addressing charcoal. However, it is premature to assess
whether this will evolve to an opportunity for sustained dialogue.

3.29 Follow-up has been somewhat greater within the Bank. One co-author has been
proactive in reaching out to colleagues working on related issues, primarily through
informal follow up. However, stakeholders interviewed by IEG note that there is a need
to reach out beyond those within the Bank who already buy into the issue.

3.30 Dissemination and Sustained Dialogue is rated satisfactory. The Team made an
effort to reach different audiences by publishing the reports information in different
formats. Its translation into the local language, the production of a short film and
availability on the Bank’s external website set it above the dissemination of many other
Bank ESW products. However, there is little evidence of a plan for sustained engagement
by the Bank’s country office.

4. Enabling reforms: a stakeholder-based analysis of the
political economy of Tanzania's charcoal sector and the
poverty and social impacts of proposed reforms
(Report)
Context
4.1     This report was a Bank initiated Knowledge Management Product. It was
prepared as a follow-on analysis to the charcoal policy note discussed in chapter 3. It
was intended to be a short note that would take the policy note a step further by providing
a better understanding of the potential poverty and social impacts of the policies proposed
and to test their feasibility by looking at the political economy of charcoal sector reform.

4.2     Three key questions guided the overall analysis: (1) what are effective,
environmentally sustainable policy measures to halt the rapid rate of deforestation and to
address the loss of government revenue due to unregulated charcoal production, trade,
and utilization? (2) Which of these policy measures could be feasibly and successfully
implemented, given the political economy of the charcoal sector? and (3) What would be
the poverty and social impacts of such policy measures if they were to be implemented
with the aim of making the sector more socially sustainable?

4.3     Two types of analysis were employed: (1) Political economy analysis, which is
concerned with the interaction of political and economic processes in society, the
distribution of power and wealth between different groups and individuals, and the
processes that create, sustain and transform their relationships over time. Political
economy analysis looks at how actors use their position to protect or strengthen their
political or economic interests; and (2) Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA),
which assesses the intended and unintended consequences of policy reforms on the well-
being or welfare of different social groups, with particular emphasis on the poor and
vulnerable groups.28

4.4     For the Political Economy Analysis two key hypotheses were tested: (1)
Influential networks in the charcoal sector maintain a system of informal institutions (i.e.
rules, processes, organizations) that effectively undermines the establishment and/or
enforcement of formal charcoal sector governance. (2) The incentive structure that
governs the charcoal sector - both from the bottom up (local governments not partaking
in charcoal revenue collection) and the top down (policy makers involved in the charcoal
business profiting from the status quo) - inhibits the design and enforcement of effective
sector regulation.



28
  The bulk of the report is devoted to political economy analysis. With respect to the PSIA analysis, the
report notes that due to very limited data availability and the informal nature of the charcoal sector
business, an exploratory quantitative approach was chosen and cautions that the findings and
recommendations of the should be treated with care.

4.5      Three hypotheses were explored through the PSIA analysis: (1) Influence and
profits in the charcoal value chain are concentrated in the hands of a limited number of
powerful actors or institutions. (2) Implementation of the proposed key reforms in
Tanzania’s charcoal sector will result in a more equitable distribution of profits along the
charcoal value chain, given that rules governing the sector will be effectively enforced.
(3) Implementation of reforms and effective enforcement of rules will result in higher
consumer prices, thus negatively affecting poorer households and their ability to pay for
energy supply.

4.6     The final report identifies key disincentives, weaknesses in the charcoal sector
governance structure, and power relationships that favor the environmentally
unsustainable and economically inequitable status quo and inhibit the design and
implementation of a coherent reform strategy. It also points out key steps towards making
the sector more environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. The final
conclusions of the report are summarized in Box 2.

Box 2. Conclusions of the Political Economy report
   The fiscal disempowerment of village and district governments, combined with the uncertainty about
    forest asset ownership and user rights, and the limited policy implementation and monitoring capacity
    of government agencies at all organizational levels, create substantial disincentives for sustainable
    management of the charcoal sector by government institutions and for sustainable production, trade,
    and use by non-governmental stakeholders.
   An open conversation within and among key government agencies and a strategic decision are needed
    on the direction of the charcoal sector toward a stricter sanctions regime.
   New policies (or changes in existing policies) need to be based on realistic goals and expectations.
    They need a coherent communication strategy that translates the legal provisions of the policy into
    actionable instructions to district or village governments, even in remote areas of the country.
   Matching institutional responsibilities of village and district governments to implement and enforce
    charcoal sector policies with the right to retain a percentage of charcoal revenues seems imperative to
    create incentives for better policy implementation and monitoring at the sub-national level.
   In this respect, vertical accountabilities and reporting mechanisms within existing systems and
    structures in MNRT, PMO-RALG and MEM should be strengthened to ensure compliance with
    centrally formulated policies and directives at the sub-national level, and to gather real-time
    information about the de facto functioning of the charcoal sector in practice.
   MNRT, MEM and other key central government agencies need to scope out a mode of engagement
    with the dealer-transporter-wholesaler networks that exercise substantial de facto control over the
    charcoal sector. Converting the currently irregular and informal interactions with this stakeholder
    group (mainly through village and district level authorities) into a more formal relationship with
    regular meetings, also including central government agencies, might contribute to a better
    understanding of how the sector functions in practice and inclusion of this critical stakeholder group in
    the design of charcoal sector policy reforms.
   A realistic short to medium term goal might be to increase the share of payable taxes and fees collected
    from 20 percent to 40 percent and to impose a sustainability premium of 10 percent, encouraging
    sustainable forest management and charcoal production while discouraging the production, trade, and
    use of unsustainably produced charcoal. This could result in a 7 percent increase in the retail price of
    charcoal, which consumers might still be able to absorb. However, one should engage in a deliberative
    process of developing policy measures that promote sustainable charcoal production while including
    wholesalers and retailers in sharing the higher costs of a more sustainably operating sector.
   Other non-governmental stakeholders need to be empowered through information campaigns,
    promotion of more efficient technology, and more sustainable management practices. This applies first
    and foremost to producers, but also to charcoal consumers, women, bicycle transporters, improved
    stove producers, and alternative energy providers.

Process
4.7      The report was produced over a period of seven months. A virtual review of the
draft Concept Note was conducted over the period November 13 - 30, 2009. A
preliminary mission to Tanzania was carried out between December 6 - 22, 2009 to
gather data and refine the research design. A second mission was carried out from March
16 to April 2, 2010 in which participatory research was conducted with various
stakeholder groups. Three workshops were held with development partners and central
government policy makers (Ministry of Finance; Natural Resources and Tourism; Energy
& Mining; Environment; Local Government & Decentralization; Health & Social
Welfare) to scope out the feasibility of proposed key policy reforms in the charcoal sector
through political economy discussions. Eleven focus group discussions were held with
charcoal sector stakeholders (producers, consumers, traders and transporters, wholesalers,
retailers, local government and administration, women's groups) in Dar-es-Salaam and
the surrounding districts and villages to provide input to the political economy and PSIA
analysis. IFPRI's Net-Map approach was used a tool for qualitative data collection.29
Project files indicate that the interactive discussion meetings, lasting up to 4 hours each,
provided a platform for mutual experience sharing, learning and awareness raising of
critical (political, economic, social and environmental) issues surrounding charcoal sector
reforms. The team reported that feedback received from the participating stakeholders on
the process and outputs of the workshops and focus group discussions was strongly
positive. This view was corroborated in interviews with participating stakeholders. The
team synthesized information from the qualitative discussion and quantitative data on
household income and government charcoal revenue, and charcoal and fuel prices, which
was used to model the expected effects of changes in charcoal / fuel prices on household
behavior and income. A final draft was produced on May 21, 2010. The report was
launched in Tanzania in June 2010.

4.8    The report was prepared by an interdisciplinary team comprising four Bank staff,
the two authors of the policy note (a forestry / natural resource management specialist
and an environmental economist), two social scientists, and three local facilitators with
environmental resource management expertise. Two hundred stakeholders participated in
focus group discussions. The team describes the process as highly participatory but Bank-
led and directed. Estimated at US$80,000,30 the final cost of the report was US$ 77,288,
financed by TF-ESSD resources provided by the Governments of Finland and Norway
and the Bank’s administrative budget.

4.9    The following sections assess the evidence on four criteria used to rate AAA
products: results, strategic relevance and ownership, quality, and dialogue and


29
  Net-Map is described as an innovative interview-based power mapping tool that helps people visualize,
discuss and understand how different actors, institutions and processes can have an impact on policy
outcomes.
30
  Estimated costs differ in the Bank’s data system. According to the Activity Completion Summary in the
Project Portal the estimated cost was US$80,000, while the estimate in the Project System Module is
US$118,114.

dissemination. An explanation of the criteria for each rating is presented in Annex C and
detailed evidence is noted in Annex D.

Results
4.10 According to the concept note, ―(t)he key objective of this activity is to inform the
discussions around reforms in Tanzania’s charcoal sector by providing policy-relevant
knowledge on key issues. As such, the objective of this activity is twofold: (1) Providing
relevant stakeholders with a profound analysis of the political economy of the charcoal
sector in Tanzania. This includes mapping networks and power relations persistent in the
charcoal sector to better understand the role of different players; (2) Analyzing the
poverty and social impacts of proposed policy reforms in the charcoal sector.‖31 Two
main audiences were identified: (1) policy makers and charcoal sector stakeholders; and
(2) the World Bank and other development partners.

4.11 Many stakeholders view the political economy report and the policy note that
preceded it as a combined product. Thus, much of the assessment of the results of the
policy note pertains to this report as well. The report fulfilled the its immediate output
level goals in terms of providing the proposed analysis of policy alternatives to design the
most viable pro-poor policies. It has also contributed to the broader development
dialogue on charcoal issues in Tanzania. The report has succeeded in informing World
Bank staff and other development partners in Tanzania on the political economy
surrounding the charcoal sector in Tanzania. Bank staff felt the report has contributed to
the current state of knowledge on the topic. The report has also raised awareness of the
utility of the political economy analysis approach in general. One respondent commented
on the unique analysis: ―I have never seen a report like that one. It doesn’t just tell you
the state of affairs but really shows you why things are the way they are. This kind of
analysis is very useful for figuring out where you can intervene.‖ Another planned to
replicate the analysis in his work in countries in other regions.


31
   Additional results were identified in the concept note’s discussion of the intended audience: ―It is also
expected that the results of this activity would give sector stakeholders the knowledge and opportunity to
engage more effectively in the policy dialogue around charcoal sector reform…Opponents and proponents
of reform will be identified with whom development partners can seek further engagement to facilitate
much needed policy reforms. The results from the poverty and social impact analysis will allow them to
provide support in policy areas that are deemed most critical for equitable and pro-poor policy reform
outcomes in the charcoal sector.‖ No specific indicators were defined at inception but the concept note
spells out four expected short-term to medium-term outcomes, aiming at improvements in policy design
and donor support in the charcoal sector:
• Policy makers, in-country stakeholders and development partners gain an improved understanding of the
key political economy impediments to charcoal sector reform.
• The poverty and social implications of proposed charcoal sector policy reforms are understood and,
following from this, policy alternatives can be developed and considered to provide decision-makers with
options to design the most viable pro-poor policies.
• Following from the above, entry points (institutional, individual, processes) for charcoal sector reform can
be identified for further engagement.
• The results from the political economy analysis (including stakeholder and institutional analysis) inform
and facilitate policy dialogue and stakeholder participation/consultation in the preparation and
implementation of policy reforms in Tanzania’s charcoal sector.‖
                                             39


4.12 The report has also been highlighted in the Governance and Anti-Corruption
(GAC) Knowledge and Learning Portal as a best practice example of political economy
analysis at the sector level. It has also been cited as a reference by at least one non-Bank
publication: Impacts of Pollution on Ecosystem Services for the Millennium Development
Goals. Stockholm Environment Institute, Project Report – 2010. The report has not yet
led to a new lending operation, but due to the analytical ground work represented by
analysis in this report and the policy note, Tanzania is under consideration as a country in
which to pilot a trust fund program on clean cooking initiatives. The report has also been
utilized by other the development partners in Tanzania, notably DFID and UNDP. The
Swiss Development Cooperation, however, which utilized the policy note to focus its
proposed program of work on charcoal, was not aware of this follow-up report.

4.13 As with the policy note upon which this report built, there is no evidence of the
report having impacted government programs in any of the relevant line agencies or the
Word Bank’s country program to date. Results have been hampered by the same
challenges facing the policy note. It is worth noting, however, that it may be too early to
assess the full results. The report was published in June 2010, elections were held in
Tanzania in October 2010, and the IEG mission took place in November 2010.

4.14 Results are rated satisfactory. The report has provided stakeholders with a better
understanding of the political economy of the charcoal sector in Tanzania. It has served
as a reference for staff working on similar issues within the Bank and other development
partners operating in Tanzania. It has also raised awareness of the utility of political
economy analysis as an analytic tool within the Bank. There has been little influence to
date on the government of Tanzania, though it may be too early to assess this dimension
of the report.

Strategic Relevance and Ownership
4.15 The strategic relevance issues are similar to those of the policy note. The report
addresses a topic of high relevance to Tanzanian society, based on its socioeconomic
importance and identification as a development constraint. The production and utilization
of charcoal (and other biofuels) have been identified as a development constraint due to
their adverse health effects and pressure placed on natural resources through
unsustainable production. While charcoal is not explicitly mentioned by name it is
relevant to each of the clusters in the Joint Country Partnership Strategy. The report
provided important analysis of the political economy of charcoal reforms, which was
missing from the policy note that preceded it. The report is timely. Its publication
coincides with a renewed interest in biofuels among various sector units (e.g. energy,
environment) within the Bank.

4.16 The report was produced in a participatory fashion and included workshops in
which over 200 local stakeholders, including government officials, participated in the
generation of qualitative data. Beyond the workshops, however, it is not clear to what
extent the government was involved in defining the scope or in preparation of the report.
In December 2009 the team held preliminary discussions with the Assistant
Commissioner for Renewable Energy and other officials from the Ministry of Energy and
was encouraged to initiate the analytical activity. Project files indicate that central
                                            40


government policy makers from Ministry of Finance; Natural Resources and Tourism;
Energy and Mining; Environment; Local Government and Decentralization; Health and
Social Welfare attended the political economy analysis discussions. There is no record in
the project files of a request for government comments on the final draft and interviews
suggests that the government felt disengaged from the process of producing this report as
well as the policy note that preceded it and that some view it as a ―World Bank/Civil
Society‖ initiative rather than a government document that they have a mandate to
operationalize.

4.17 Strategic Relevance and Ownership is rated satisfactory. The report addresses a
key development constraint for Tanzania and is relevant to the priorities in the Joint
Country Partnership Strategy. Its publication is timely. The report was produced in a
participatory fashion with the participation of over 200 local stakeholders but there is
weak evidence government interest or engagement in producing the report, beyond their
participation in focus groups.

Quality
4.18 The report employed a solid methodology. Specific hypothesis to be tested were
identified at the planning stage, and IFPRI's Net-Map approach was used as a tool for
qualitative data collection with local stakeholders to conduct the analysis in a
participatory yet structured manner. Stakeholders interviewed by IEG viewed the report
as a high quality document and the political economy perspective of the report was seen
by many as filling an important gap in knowledge on the sector. One source noted that
both pieces of sector work were ―head and shoulders‖ above other reports on the topic in
terms of quality and value added, adding that the Bank said things that needed to be said
in a non-confrontational manner. Although the report itself cautions that results of its
quantitative analysis are tentative, some stakeholders also comment that given the data
poor environment in Tanzania in general and of the charcoal sector in particular, the
report also makes a valuable contribution in providing quantitative data on the sector,
albeit limited. The GAC Knowledge and Learning Portal’s feature of the report as a best
practice example as noted above is a further indication of the report’s quality.

4.19 The report was reviewed by an appropriate mix of technical specialists. Written
comments on the concept note were received from peer reviewers in the Bank’s
environment and social development units in the Bank. Peer reviewers felt their
comments were taken into account to the extent possible. The final report indicates that
the draft was peer reviewed by three specialists from the Bank’s environment and social
development units but there is no record in project files of minutes from the review of the
final draft or peer reviewer comments. It provides a clear understanding of the local
context and provides clear and actionable recommendations.

4.20 Quality is rated highly satisfactory. Stakeholders interviewed view the report as
a high quality document. It employed solid methodology and was subject to adequate
peer review. The report received appropriate managerial attention and both the concept
note and the final report were reviewed by appropriate sector experts. It provides a clear
understanding of the local context and provides clear and actionable recommendations.

Dialogue and Dissemination
4.21 While the policy note was pitched to a broader audience, this report was targeted
to decision makers in government and the donor community. Initial dissemination
consisted of a formal launch in Dar es Salaam in June 2010 through a series of
workshops. One workshop was held for donor partners and the press and a second
workshop was held for government officials. During the workshops the documentary
based on the findings of the earlier policy note was also presented. The report was
emailed to Bank staff in the Africa region and the forestry community and a brown bag
discussion was held for staff in December 2010. The report is easily retrievable on the
Bank’s external website and is featured on the Governance and Anti-Corruption
Knowledge and Learning Portal. The authors have been proactive in bringing the report
to the attention of relevant Bank staff. There is little evidence, however, of sustained
follow up in the country office, but it may be too early to assess this dimension of the
report.

4.22 Dissemination and Dialogue are rated satisfactory. The authors have been
proactive in disseminating the report to relevant staff within the Bank. Sustained
engagement by the Bank in Tanzania has been limited, but it may be too soon to assess
this dimension of the report.

5. Lessons
5.1       The experience of the TFCMP/EAFCMP suggests the following lessons:

         A reform agenda that depends on the buy-in of key individuals can be stalled
          unless there is: (a) a contingency plan for the loss of political will and (b)
          sufficient flexibility in project design to enable adjustments to changes in the
          level of ownership. In the case of the TFCMP/EAFCMP, the right mix of people
          appears to have converged during preparation but the project did not prepare for
          the likelihood that personalities would change.

         Late and incomplete restructuring can result in a failure to complete project
          activities within the project timeframe and, as a consequence, to achieve
          project objectives. In this case, the Bank proactively refocused credit proceeds
          on activities that were under control of the project implementation unit and could
          improve forest management within the existing institutional structure, but the
          objective of changing the institutional structure remained unchanged. Some of the
          activities added through restructuring were delayed by procurement challenges
          that had plagued the project since inception.

         The use of demand-driven approaches for forestry or natural resources
          management activities may be constrained by insufficient demand, as
          communities often have other priorities.

         Small grant monitoring that narrowly focuses on ensuring that grant monies
          were used for their intended purpose, is insufficient to demonstrate outcome
          level results and is a lost opportunity for learning. In the case of the EAMCEF,
          an opportunity was also lost to learn which activities generate greater returns in
          terms of conservation and livelihoods goals. In the case of the TASAF PRM
          window, an opportunity was lost to gather information that would allow for a
          comparison of two different modalities to deliver support for the establishment of
          PFM agreements.

         The financial sustainability of endowment funds can be compromised
          without sufficient and early attention to developing the fund-raising skills of
          Endowment Fund staff.

5.2       The experience of the two pieces of sector work yields the following lessons:

         High quality analysis is insufficient on its own to prompt action from
          government decision makers. The policy note and follow up political economy
          analysis were both viewed as high quality documents that addressed a relevant
          topic but that alone was insufficient to generate results. More attention should be
          given to how to foster ownership of the process and objectives up front.

         Reform of sectors in which responsibility cuts across multiple agencies may
          be difficult without a sustained dialogue through multiple sector units in the
          Bank (forestry, environment, energy).
                                            43


5.3 The following lessons emerge from the experience of both the
TFCMP/EAFCMP and the Sector Work:

      Changes in mind-set may be difficult to bring about without a strategy for
       generating broad-based consensus up front. In the case of the
       TFCMP/EAFCMP, consensus was there during preparation but was lost once core
       members on the borrower and bank side moved on. While consultation workshops
       were held during preparation, interviews with stakeholders suggest that a
       relatively small group of people fully bought into the reforms, understood what
       they were trying to accomplish, and were involved in the project’s design. When
       key personalities changed there was an insufficient base of people who
       understood and bought into the proposed reforms to inform new leadership. In the
       case the sector work, the Bank attempted to change the way that charcoal is
       viewed by presenting reform of the sector as a missed opportunity. Despite
       producing high quality documents there has been no buy-in from decision makers.
       A strategy is required to engage government decision makers from the beginning
       and keep them engaged throughout the process.

      One project cycle may not be long enough to bring about institutional
       changes. Similarly dissemination of analytic work without a program for
       sustained dialogue may also limit results. One project was not long enough to
       ensure that the new institutions had sufficient capacity to be effective and ensure a
       shift in the way that forests are managed. Similarly the brief period of
       dissemination was insufficient to ensure that the charcoal studies remain visible
       and are on hand for political windows of opportunity.

                                                          Background
 This report is listed in the 2007-2010 Joint Assistance Strategy as an analytical and advisory activity under the cluster for
 Growth and Reduction of Income Poverty. It is classified in the activity completion summary as a client requested task. The
 request for this sector work came through the MNRT when the TFCMP/EAFCMP was well under implementation. The
 report was initiated on November 15, 2007, delivered to the government in March 2009, and officially launched in
 dissemination workshops in Tanzania in August 2009. Originally estimated at US$70,000, the final cost of the report was
 US$138,120. The topic of the report is one for which much had already been written, therefore the authors did not generate
 new analysis but consolidated available material including recent studies on charcoal utilization and trade conducted in the
 country. The report discusses a range of policy measures along the entire charcoal value chain in Tanzania: production,
 trade, and consumption. It begins with a broad overview of the charcoal sector in Tanzania and some of the key challenges
 being faced. It includes a summary of the key legal and policy measures that have been taken over the past two decades and
 an assessment of how successful they have been. It then sets out key policy recommendations along the production and
 marketing chains. It closes with an assessment of the likely impact of the reforms on reducing deforestation and forest
 degradation, as well as the positive impacts on boosting employment and improving rural livelihoods and concludes with an
 assessment of the costs of the policy recommendations made.

                                                     Overall Assessment
 The report addresses issues of high relevance to Tanzania and was timely. It coincides with a renewed interest in bio-fuels
 among some sectors in the Bank. Stakeholders view it as a high quality diagnostic assessment that has contributed to
  to the broader development dialouge on charcoal and woodfuels in Africa. It has served as a reference for Bank staff
 working on related issues within the Bank and has been utilized by other development partners in Tanzania in the
 development of their programs. Implementation of the recommended reforms, however, has not advanced with the
 government of Tanzania. A key challenge has been identifying an institutional champion willing to take the reform forward.
 Results to date also suffered from limited follow-up in the country office. That said, the report has come at an opportune
 time within the Bank, it coincides with a renewed interest in biofuels. New energy strategies under preparation that
 incorporate biomass as a renewable energy, which may increase scope to influence future Bank activities and for follow up
 with the government.

                                                              Lessons
    High quality analysis is insufficient on its own to prompt action from government decision makers.
    Failure to engage government decision makers from the beginning and keep them engaged throughout the process is
     can hinder sector work results, particularly work that attempts to challenge the status quo view.
    Lack of sustained dialogue through multiple sectors of the Bank hinder attempts to reform sectors in which
     responsibility cuts across multiple agencies.

Results                      Satisfactory          Results are rated satisfactory. The report has contributed to the broader
                                                   development dialogue on the charcoal sector in Tanzania..It is viewed as a
                                                   valuable reference among donor partners and staff within the Bank. While
                                                   it has not led to a new lending operation or change in policy, it has provided
                                                   input to activities implemented under the TFCMP/EAFCMP, which was
                                                   ongoing at the time. It also led to a follow-up sector work that assessed the
                                                   political economy of the proposed reforms, and is attributed with Tanzania

                                                 preparation. Other donors in Tanzania have drawn on the report’s analysis
                                                 in the development of their own programs and it has served as a reference
                                                 for World Bank staff working on household energy issues. As a result of
                                                 the diagnostic ground work laid by the report, Tanzania is under
                                                 consideration as pilot country by a trust fund program that intends to
                                                 finance clean cooking initiatives. There is little evidence, however, of
                                                 impact on government programs or policy. That said the report has come at
                                                 an opportune time within the Bank coinciding with a renewed interest in
                                                 biofuels. In light of new energy strategies under preparation that
                                                 incorporate biomass as a renewable energy, there may increased scope for
                                                 the policy note to influence future Bank activities and provide an entry
                                                 point for future follow up with the government.
Strategic relevance         Satisfactory         Relevance and ownership in Tanzania are rated satisfactory. The report is
and ownership                                    listed as a AAA product in the 2007-2010 Joint Country Partnership
                                                 Strategy. The topic is a recognized development constraint in some
                                                 government policies and the report is strategic in its attempt to highlight
                                                 this constraint as a potential opportunity. Local stakeholders were engaged
                                                 in conducting the work but level of government interest and engagement in
                                                 conducting the work appears to have been limited.
Quality                 Highly Satisfactory      Quality was highly satisfactory. Stakeholders consistently ranked it as one
                                                 of the best descriptive pieces of work on the current state of the charcoal
                                                 sector in Tanzania. The report appropriately drew on the existing
                                                 knowledge, including the experience from other countries, and analyzed
                                                 how it would work in Tanzania. Several features of the report, however,
                                                 were seen as setting it apart from the multiple studies that had already been
                                                 produced on the topic. First, the report was comprehensive in the scope of
                                                 the analysis and the recommendations that spanned the entire charcoal
                                                 value chain, whereas other studies focus on one aspect or one segment of
                                                 the production or marketing chain. Second, the report conducted a valuation
                                                 of the sector’s contribution to the national economy and lost revenue due to
                                                 unregulated activities. Multiple stakeholders pointed to the compelling
                                                 argument for action made through this aspect of the report. In addition,
                                                 many felt that the concise presentation and readability of the report was an
                                                 asset, making it more accessible to policy makers. The report provides
                                                 clear and actionable recommendations.
Dissemination and           Satisfactory         Dissemination and sustained dialogue are rated satisfactory. Formal
dialogue                                         dissemination was carried through a series of workshops in Tanzania in
                                                 August 2009. The team made an effort to reach out to different audiences
                                                 through production of differentiated products. Its translation into the local
                                                 language, the production of a short film and availability on the Bank’s
                                                 external website set it above the dissemination of many other Bank ESW
                                                 products. However, there is little evidence of a plan for sustained dialogue
                                                 or strategic follow up by the Bank’s country office. The scope for
                                                 sustained dialogue in Tanzania to date has been limited. However, within
                                                 the Bank the report authors have been proactive in bringing the report to the
                                                 attention of Bank staff working on topics covered by the report.

                         The primary audience identified in the concept note is the Government of Tanzania. Secondary
                         audiences are identified as the other development partners, civil society, stakeholders in Tanzania and
                         other countries in the region.

                         The objectives set forth in the final report are ―to identify a number of policy options, which if
                         implemented together, will result in: sustainable and long-term management of forest and woodland
                         resources; sustainable supply of energy, especially to the urban poor; increased revenue capture by the
                         government from the charcoal sector as a whole; greater security and increased incomes for small-
                         scale charcoal producers and traders. The report goes on to note that the policy note will serve as an
                         input to the development of a Woodfuel Action Plan, currently under preparation by the GOT. The
                         Woodfuel Action Plan in turn was intended to inform the review of the Energy Strategy for Tanzania‖
                         (World Bank 2009).

                         A clear statement of objectives is presented in the Activity Completion Summary, created after the
                         note was completed: ―to (a) provide an analysis of potential and constraints for substituting woodfuels
                         with alternative energy sources taking into account environmental, socio-economic, political and
                         institutional dimensions; and (b) provide "on-time" policy advice to the GOT on how to potentially
                         integrate woodfuel into future energy strategies of Tanzania. This ESW will provide the GOT -
                         particularly FBD of MNRT - with a basis for developing a long-term strategy and immediate action
                         plans to achieve sustainability in the charcoal sector.‖

                         export crops, which contribute US$60 million and US$45 million, respectively. The Swiss
                         Development Cooperation became aware of the report when they were already in the process of
                         developing a proposal for a charcoal sector intervention, but note that they have drawn on the report
                         to help them determine which segment of the value chain to target. UNDP states that they regularly
                         draw on the reports analysis in their dialogue with the government to strengthen the case for a
                         potential program to regulate the charcoal sector throughout East Africa. There is also ongoing
                         dialogue between the report’s authors and GTZ, who proposed development of a Biomass Energy
                         Strategy in Tanzania. Each of the interventions mentioned above were in preliminary stages of
                         development at the time of this assessment so it is too early to determine if they will in fact lead to
                         implementation of the report’s recommendations. But they are a clear indication that the report has

                        to assess this aspect of results. The policy note did provide input to a wood fuel action plan that was
                        prepared under the TFCMP/EAFCMP that was under implementation at the same time but the wood
                        fuel action plan had not yet been implemented and it has not informed the review of the Energy
                        Strategy for Tanzania as anticipated in the report’s concept note. The report has also had some
                        influence on Trust Fund activities. Africa Renewable Energy Access Program (AFREA), a trust fund
                        for the Africa Region, is developing an options paper for the AFTEG that discusses how to integrate
                        biomass options into the energy group’s work. The TTL charged with administering the trust fund
                        credits the report with helping to shape the way they are approaching charcoal issues. The trust fund is
                        interested in financing biomass pilots that would incorporate clean cooking initiatives and take the
                        entire supply chain into account. Tanzania is under consideration as a potential pilot country because
                        of the analytical ground work that has been laid by the policy note and the political economy report.
..Bank strategy         The Bank is in the process of preparing a new energy strategy that will include a chapter on biofuels
formulation?            and the Africa Region’s Energy Team is preparing its own Biomass Energy Strategy. The policy note
                        has not informed these sector strategies but stakeholders note that the scope for incorporating the
                        report’s recommendations into future Bank activities may increase once the strategies are
                        implemented. The policy note is timely even if it has not been a direct input to these strategies.

                        reference for a recent background paper on household energy produced by the Energy Anchor. It has
                        also been cited by two recent World Bank publications on biofuels: ―Biofuels in Africa Opportunities
                        Prospects Challenge?s and a background paper prepared for the Bank’s Sustainable Energy

                        institutions that could potentially play a key role in implementing the report’s recommendations but
                        they are focused other priorities. No clear institutional champion has been identified to carry the

IMPACT: Did the

impact on results?
 Discussion of results: The has resulted in a follow up study which analyzes to feasibility and political economy aspects of
 the proposed reforms. It has served as a reference for Bank staff working on household energy issues and other development
 partners in Tanzania. The report has been cited by recent publications on biomass energy. The diagnostic ground work laid
 by the report is credited with Tanzania being considered as a potential pilot country for trust fund activities and for potential
 inclusion of the topic in one donor partner’s country program. The report also served as an input to the production of a
 woodfuel action plan for the FBD which was carried out under the TCMP. However, the action plan has not in turn
 contributed to a nationwide strategy as anticipated in the report’s concept note. To date there is little evidence of the report’s
 impact on the Government. Some stakeholders interviewed by IEG view the new strategies as potentially opening up
 opportunities for the report’s recommendations to be picked up in future Bank activities, but it is too early to assess this
 outcome.

 Discussion of Strategic relevance and ownership: The report addressed a topic of high relevance to Tanzania, based on its
 socio economic importance and identification as a development constraint. Charcoal, along with fuel wood, accounts for 90
 percent of Tanzania’s energy supply. It is the main cooking fuel in urban areas among all income groups. Its use has
 increased in recent years and demand is projected to increase. Activities associated with charcoal, trade, production and
 consumption provide are estimated to contribute $650m to the national economy, yet most of the potential revenue is lost to
 the government because the sector is largely unregulated. Moreover the sector provides employment for 100,000 people.
 The unsustainable production of charcoal has been identified as a long standing development constraint in the literature.
 Bank supported operations in the late 1980’s/early 1990’s attempted to address the topic but since then the Bank moved
 away from the topic. However, the reports publication coincides with a renewed interest in biofuels among various sector
 units (e.g. energy, environment) within the Bank. While charcoal is not explicitly mentioned by name it is relevant to each
 cluster in the PRSP. Charcoal has also been identified as a development constraint in several national policies but the
 solution promoted is typically to replace charcoal with other fuel sources, rather than reform of the sector. The literature also
 documents how charcoal sector is widely perceived in a negative fashion by policy makers. The policy note attempted to
 challenge the status quo view of charcoal by presenting it as a sustainable development opportunity.

 The report was included as an AAA activity in the 2007-2010 Joint Country Assistance Strategy. Client engagement
 included stakeholder workshops to discuss and agree upon specific policy measures to incorporate in the report’s
 recommendations. Periodic discussions on the report and the topic of charcoal reforms were also carried out by the TTL
 with the Director of Forest and Beekeeping and the Assistant Commissioner in the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, at
 inception and during the production of the report. However, Government ownership of the report has been weak. Interviews
 with technical staff suggest that the government felt disengaged from the process of producing the policy note and that some
 view it as a ―World Bank/Civil Society‖ initiative rather than a government document that they have a mandate to
 operationalize. Weak government ownership may also be due in part to the fact that responsibility for regulating the sector
 cuts across multiple government agencies, the solutions advocated require convergence of these various actors, and the
 politically sensitive nature of some aspects of the sector.

 Discussion of quality: The report earned high marks by all stakeholders interviewed by IEG for its quality. It drew on a
 wealth of studies that had already been completed on the topic, including drawing on global experience, which were
 analyzed to understand how such experience would translate to the Tanzanian context. Aspects that made it stand out from
 the wealth of existing studies on the topic include its comprehensive analysis across the full spectrum of production and
 consumption activities, the concise and readable manner in which the analysis is presented, and the valuation of revenue lost
 due to unregulated activities. The final point was viewed as particularly compelling to some donor partners who attribute the
 report with putting the topic on their radar. Others highlighted the report’s contribution to the knowledge base on charcoal,
 particularly in light of the scarcity of data in Tanzania on informal sectors. The report was peer reviewed by Bank and non
 Bank experts and appears to have received appropriate managerial oversight.. It provides clear and actionable
 recommendations and indicates specific government agencies relevant to carrying out each recommendation.

DIALOGUE
Did the product serve as an

 …policy dialogue?                 To date, there is little evidence that the report has served as an input to a sustained
                                   dialogue with the client, though at the time of the IEG mission additional copies of the
                                   documentary were being produced for dissemination in the country. The scope for policy
                                   dialogue with the FBD, the official counterpart agency for the report, is limited.
                                   Following the completion of the TFCMP/EAFCMP there is no longer an natural
                                   resources management operation under the implementation of the MNRT and the
                                   country management team has indicated that it is unclear whether support for the FBD or
                                   the MNRT will be included in the new CAS under preparation. The Bank’s support for
                                   the Energy Sector, another relevant ministry to implement the report’s recommendations,
                                   is focused on electrification. A mission to the recent climate change conference in
                                   Cancun the Bank’s environment team held preliminary discussion with the newly
                                   appointed Minister of Environment who indicated an interest in charcoal and expressed
                                   an interest in Bank support but it is premature to assess whether this will evolve into an
                                   opportunity for sustained policy dialogue.

                                   the Forestry and Beekeeping Division, but the FBD has not implemented the action plan.
                                   The concept note anticipated that the wood fuel action plan would inform the review of
                                   the Energy Strategy for Tanzania but there is no indication that this happened.

                                      officials, in the course of producing the report.
Discussion of Dissemination and Dialogue: The report was officially launched through a series of workshops with various
groups of stakeholders. Those in attendance interviewed by IEG describe the launch as a high quality event. The launch is
reported to have received limited media coverage. A criticism of the dissemination workshops is that the Bank convened
people who already buy into the need for the proposed reforms. The team attempted to reach out to various audiences
through differentiated products. The full report was published in English and targeted decision makers in the government
and donor community, a 4 page summary produced in English and Kiswahili was distributed through a local NGO to
stakeholders at the district level, and a 15 minute documentary film based on the policy notes findings was also produced in
an English and Kiswahili version. While the report was pitched to policy makers, the documentary was targeted to the
general public with the intention of creating the basis for an informed discussion about the future role of charcoal in
Tanzania. Both versions of the documentary are posted on the World Bank’s You Tube Channel. The documentary was
screened in Dar es Salaam in June 2010, at the launch of a follow-up report on the poverty and social impacts of the reforms

proposed in the policy note. Copies of the documentary were also provided to the FBD’s zonal extension mobile cinema
units which hosts movie nights in each of the districts. These initial dissemination efforts are a notable improvement over
many past efforts to disseminate Bank knowledge products.

Evidence of sustained engagement is limited. Follow-up in the Bank’s country office is unclear and monitoring of results
has been absent. To date, the report does not appear to have served as an input to a sustained dialogue with the client. The
TTL relocated to another country office within a year of the reports launch, his replacement is familiar with the report but at
the time of this assessment, she had only just arrived and her work program was unclear. The scope for policy dialogue with
the FBD or MNRT, the official counterpart agency for the report, is limited as there is no follow-on project to the
TFCMP/EAFCMP. The country management team indicated that it is unclear whether support for the FBD or the MNRT
will be included in the new CAS that is under preparation. The Bank’s support to other relevant sectors, such as Energy, is
focused on other priorities. While there is no formal mechanism for dissemination of the report within the Bank, the final
report was emailed staff in the Africa region, and the authors have been proactively disseminating the report to staff in the
Bank who are working on the issues addressed by the report.

The concept note for this report was produced in November 2009 and the final report was launched in Tanzania in June
2010. Originally estimated at approximately US$ 80,000, the final cost of the report was US$ 77,287. This report builds
directly on the Policy Note on the charcoal sector in Tanzania (published in August 2009). While the Policy Note explored
the impact of the charcoal business on Tanzania’s forests and woodlands and the country’s environment, this report provides
an analysis of the key political economy factors that can facilitate or inhibit a comprehensive approach to reforming the
sector. The report’s objectives as set forth in its concept note were ―to inform the discussions around reforms in Tanzania’s
charcoal sector by providing policy-relevant knowledge on key issues. As such, the objective of this activity is twofold: (1)
Providing relevant stakeholders with a profound analysis of the political economy of the charcoal sector in Tanzania. This
includes mapping networks and power relations persistent in the charcoal sector to better understand the role of different
players; and (2). Analyzing the poverty and social impacts of proposed policy reforms in the charcoal sector.‖

                                                     Overall Assessment

 The report succeeded in its goal of providing analysis to understand the barriers to charcoal sector reforms and has informed
 World Bank staff and other development partners in Tanzania. The recommendations have not been incorporated into a new
 lending operation or new government policy but it may be too early to assess such outcomes. The report was published in
 June 2010, national elections were held in Tanzania in October 2010 and the IEG mission to assess this report took place in
 November 2010. The report has been featured within the World Bank as a good practice example of political economy
 analysis and stakeholders interviewed found the document to be of good quality. The strategic relevance of this sector work
 is satisfactory. The report addresses a relevant development topic for Tanzania and many other Sub-Saharan African
 countries. The report is also timely in that it coincides with a renewed interest among some segments of the Bank in biomass
 energy. A difficulty has been the lack of an institutional champion to take the proposed reforms forward. As of the IEG
 mission in November 2010, there had limited follow up in Tanzania, though it may be too early to assess this dimension of
 the report.

                                                            Lessons
    High quality analysis is insufficient on its own to prompt action from government decision makers.
    Failure to engage government decision makers from the beginning and keep them engaged throughout the process is
     can hinder sector work results, particularly work that attempts to challenge the status quo view.
    Lack of sustained dialogue through multiple sectors of the Bank hinder attempts to reform sectors in which
     responsibility cuts across multiple agencies.

                          The concept note also spelled out expected outcomes from the analysis (see below under indicators).

                          The objectives are formulated slightly different in the actual report: ―to assess the viability of policy
                          reforms that have been proposed to make Tanzania’s charcoal sector more environmentally,
                          economically and socially sustainable, based on an analysis to the political economy of the sector
                          and by looking at the likely poverty and social impacts of the proposed reforms.‖ The text of the
                          report also states that it ―aims to facilitate the policy dialogue around charcoal sector reforms by
                          providing analytical information on the political economy of the charcoal sector and on the potential
                          poverty and social impacts of a sustainability-oriented reform agenda.‖

                          The strategic objectives presented in the ACS are to ―understand the social and poverty dimensions

                          • Policy makers, in-country stakeholders and development partners gain an improved understanding
                          of the key political economy impediments to charcoal sector reform.
                          • The poverty and social implications of proposed charcoal sector policy reforms are understood and,
                          following from this, policy alternatives can be developed and considered to provide decision-makers
                          with options to design the most viable pro-poor policies.
                          • Following from the above, entry points (institutional, individual, processes) for charcoal sector

                         workshops during production of the study found the mapping exercises to be particularly useful, in
                         terms of validating what had previously been viewed as anecdotal information. There was less

                         is clear that the PSIA on proposed charcoal sector reforms in Tanzania will be based on information
                         collected through key informant interviews, focus group discussions and other
                         consultative/participatory processes and may thereby stimulate debate and raise awareness of
                         important policy issues. However, it remains to be seen whether the analysis can serve as a vehicle
                         for building coalitions for change, given the sensitive nature of reforms in this sector and the likely
                         involvement of influential/key figures in Tanzania.‖

  Discussion of results:
  The report has successfully achieved both of the immediate objectives that it set for itself. It has provided relevant
  stakeholders with analysis of the political economy of the charcoal sector in Tanzania and has also analyzed the poverty and
  social impacts of proposed policy reforms in the charcoal sector. Policy makers, in-country stakeholders and development
  partners appear to have gained an improved understanding of the key political economy impediments to charcoal sector
  reform and it has added value to policy note’s findings. Participants in the stakeholder workshops who were interviewed by
  IEG noted that the report was useful in that it documented what everyone suspected but no one had documented. The report
  provided a well documented analysis of the political economy surrounding proposed reforms to the charcoal sector. It is
  highlighted as a best practice example of political economy analysis for a sector by the GAC knowledge portal. Several
  Bank staff interviewed by IEG value the report for demonstrating the utility of political economy analysis methodology.
  Including staff working in other regions who report that they plan to replicate the analysis in the countries in where they
  work. The results of the report in Tanzania have been constrained by the difficulty in identifying an institutional champion
  to the take reform forward, due in part to the cross cutting, multi-sectoral nature of the topic and the political sensitivity of
  some of the reforms. The report seems to be making some traction as a knowledge product within the Bank. But it may be
  too early to assess such outcomes.

findings?
  Discussion of Strategic relevance and ownership: These issues are identical to the policy note that preceded the report.
  The report addressed a topic of high relevance to Tanzania, based on its socio economic importance and identification as a
  development constraint. Charcoal, along with fuel wood, accounts for 90 percent of Tanzania’s energy supply. It is the main
  cooking fuel in urban areas among all income groups. Its use has increased in recent years and demand is projected to grow.
  Activities associated with charcoal, trade, production and consumption provide are estimated to contribute $650m to the
  national economy, yet most of the potential revenue is lost to the government because the sector is largely unregulated.
  Moreover the sector provides employment for 100,000 people. The unsustainable production of charcoal has been identified
  as a long standing development constraint in the literature. Bank supported operations in the late 1980’s/early 1990’s
  attempted to address the topic but since then the Bank moved away from the topic. However, the reports publication
  coincides with a renewed interest in biofuels among various sector units (e.g. energy, environment) within the Bank.
  Charcoal has also been identified as a development constraint in several national policies. The literature also documents how
  charcoal sector is widely perceived in a negative fashion by policy makers. While charcoal is not explicitly mentioned by
  name it is relevant to each of the clusters in the Joint Country Partnership Strategy. The report provided important analysis
  of the political economy of charcoal reforms, which was missing from the policy note that preceded it.

 The report was produced in a participatory fashion and included workshops with various local stakeholders (over 200
 stakeholders participated), including government officials. Beyond the workshops, the extent of government engagement in
 conducting the work is unclear. There is no record on file of government comments on the final draft of the report and
 ANNEX D                                                    68

 interviews suggest that the government felt disengaged from the process of producing this report as well as the policy note
 that preceded it and that some view it as a ―World Bank/Civil Society‖ initiative rather than a government document that
 they have a mandate to operationalize. Weak ownership may also be due in part to the politically sensitive nature of the
 topic responsibility and that responsibility for regulating the sector is fragmented across multiple government agencies.

Discussion of quality: The report is considered by all stakeholders to be a high quality document. It employed solid
methodology and was subject to adequate peer review. The report received appropriate managerial attention and both the
concept note and the final report were reviewed by appropriate sector experts. It provides a clear understanding of the local
context and provides clear and actionable recommendations. Stakeholders also commented that it did a good job of saying
what needed to be said in a non-threatening manner.

 …policy dialogue?           To date, there is little evidence that the report has served as an input to a sustained dialogue
                             with the client. At the time of the assessment, the scope for policy dialogue within Tanzania
                             was limited. Since the closure of the TFCMP/EAFCMP there are no lending operations
                             implemented by the FBD. The TTL relocated to another country office since the reports
                             publication and his replacement began her post in the country office in November 2010, at the
                             time of the IEG assessment. The country management team has indicated that it is unlikely that
                             support for the FBD or the MNRT will be included in the new CAS under preparation. The
                             Bank’s support for the Energy Sector, another relevant ministry to address charcoal issues, is
                             focused on electrification. A mission to the climate change conference in Cancun in November
                             2010 met with the newly appointed Minister of Environment expressed an interest in
                             addressing charcoal but it is premature to assess this as evidence of a sustained policy dialogue.
 …sustained                  At the time of the IEG mission in November 2010, there had been no workshops or discussions
    workshops/discussion     in Tanzania beyond initial dissemination. But it may have been unrealistic to expect this since
    s with stakeholders      the report was launched in June 210 and national elections were held in October 2010. Within
    beyond initial           the Bank, the authors have been proactive in informally disseminating the report to staff

Discussion of Dissemination and Dialogue: The report was officially launched in Tanzania, in June 2010, with a series of
workshops targeting different stakeholder groups. Dissemination within the Bank has been largely through informal efforts
on the part of the authors to bring the report to the attention of staff working on similar issues. With the revision of the

Bank’s corporate energy strategy, taking into account biofuels, as well as new biomass energy strategy for Africa, there may
be greater scope to disseminate to a larger audience in the Bank in the future. At the date of assessment, November 2010,
there was little indication of a strategy for sustained follow up in the country office but it appears to be too early to
adequately assess this dimension of the report.
