INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN FOR THE INDUSTRIAL BANK OF SUDAN PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of the Sudan for the equivalent
of $4 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the Industrial Bank of
Sudan (IBS) Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission from the Bank visited the Sudan in November/
December 1971 and its report entitled "The Economic Development and
Prospects of the Sudan" (Report No.AE-27, in four volumes, dated June 9,
1972) was distributed on June 30, 1972.   This was the first fill economic
mission to the Sudan after a lapse of several years but, owing to continued
political unrest in the southern part of the country at that time the mission's
coverage was limited to northern Sudan.   In March 1972 the government reached
an agreement (The Addis Ababa Accord) with the southern dissident elements,
as a result of which peace returned to the south and a Southern Regional
Government was established in Juba with a large measure of autonomy. At
this time, the Bank was requested to assist the reconstruction and development
of the Southern Region which had suffered much physical destraction during
a prolonged strife.  A special economic mission visited the Region in
Nove,mber/December 1972, and its report on development problems and prospects
in the Region was distributed on June 25, 1973 (Report No. llya-SU, dated
June 1, 1973). Country data are attached as Annex I.
3.        The Sudan has an area of one million sq. miles and as such is
the largest country in Africa. Much of the land is unoccupied. Tne soils
of the Sudan are sandy in the northern third of the country, clay in the
central -third and lateritic in the southern third.  According to the 1955/56
census the population totalled 10.4 million and with a rate of growth of
2.8 percent per year, the population at present would be about 16.6 million.
Per capita GNP is estimated at US$120 and the Sudan has been included among
the 25 least developed countries by the United Nations.
4.        The White Nile and the Blue Nile have endowed the country with an
abundance of water which has enabled it to develop the biggest irrigation
system in tropical Africa. While $he Sudan has increased its utilization
of the Nile water to 11.7 maliard min, it still has not reached its share of
18.5 milliard m.3 specified in the Nile Water Agreement with Egypt. Rainfall
varies from about 20 mm. in the arid northernmost parts of the country to 1500 mm.
in the south. The Sudan thus has a considerable supply of unutilized water
in addition to about 200 million feddans of land suitable for crop and pastoral
farming. Unlike in many developing countries, there is no population pressure
on presently developed land and indeed in some parts of the Sudan, a shortage
of labor has limited the expansion of agricultural production. As the



cultuivated area a,ioun-os to no mriore t;han 10 percent of the potentially
cultivable land, for the foreseeasble future the availability of land will
not be a limiting factor to the expansion of agricult[.ural and pastoral
activities.
5.        The Sudanese econoRr is based largely on cotton.   It is an
importarit producer of long and ext-ra-long staple cottron, and also of gum,
sesane and groundnuts.  Its cons-derable li-vestock resources have hardly
been tapped. The manufacturing sector is relativeLy small and, apart from
the processing of somie agriculturl commodities, it is limited to the pro-
duction of corsumer goods mno some building materials. T'here is some
potential for mining (chrome, iron ore and copper). T'nere have been some
exports of chrome ore and the feasibility of developing the iron and copper
deposits needs to be thorough'ly investigated.  The inadequacy of transport
could prove to oe the biggest, bottleneck in the development of the mining
sector.
6.        With an area of 2.6 million sq. km. the Saudan is highly dependent
on its railways. Sudan Railways have a total route of about 4,750 km, all
of which is arn unballasted single-track railway.  The railway was originally
built for administrative purposes and for opening the country, but has
performed a very valuable ecorLmic function by carrying the country's steadily
rising imports ana exports.   However, under the pressure of growing traffic
and the inadequate utili2ation of the present stock of locomotives and
rolling stock, the railways   capacity is becoming severely strained.  The
road system is vi-rtually non-existent, there being only a total of 300 Ion
of bitumenized roads and some stretches within municipal limits. The fact
that some traffic does move by road reflects not so much the suitability
of roads but the considerable difficulty of getting wagon space on the
railway.  Nile River transport co-Lld play a more important role than at
present.  Improving `omestic air transport will require significant invest-
ments to improve -the domestic air-orts and in particullar to provide night
landing facilities which are now only available at Khartoum.
7.        Compared with most other countries in Africa, the Sudan has
less of a problem with regard to the availability of high-level manpower.
This is attr_butable in tart 'to the fact that the educational system has
evolved over a longer period.   One of the features of the system is that,
aLthough the rumbe_r of children in elementary and secondary schools is still
small ir relation to their total age group, enrollme-nt in universities and
other institutions of higher 'Learning has increased rapidly.   On the other
hand, there has3 been a growing -problem in absorbing some of the output of
the educaticnal system, part-cuD arry university graduates with general arts
degrees. Althughr the gcven,-m.ent has in the past stood ready, as a matter
ofl nolicy, to  aire  l university graduates needing jobs, t-his clearly
entails consud-rahle wastage.   Moreover, it detracts from the need to
-oroceed with thie -proper planning of the educational system so as to make it
more responsive to the requirements of economic development.
c.       .The nublic sector has long been do.iminant in the Sudanese economy.
It embraces acl modern irrigated agricullture, the railways and virtually all
power and water supply. After the nationalization measures of 1970/71,



a significant proportion of industry, commerce and finance was also
transferred to the public sector, so that an estimated 50 percent of the
GDP is now generated within this sector.
9.        During the period 1965-72, the Sudanese economy was characterized
by low growth, bordering on stagnation. It suffered from a declining level
of investment - private and public - a marked decline in external assistance,
excessive monetary expansion resulting in complete depletion of its net
foreign assets and in inflationary price increases. The main reason for this
poor performance - despite relatively favorable conditions - was the
preoccupation of the government with acute political problems, among which
was the problem of dissidence in the south which not only divided the country
but was a drain on its resources.
10.       The 1971 Bank economic mission concluded that the country's economic
stagnation could be overcome if the government were to increase public savings
to finance an increasing level of investment magnitudes comparable at least to
the levels achieved in the early 1960s, which could be achieved by curtailing
the growth of recurrent expenditures which have been increasing faster than
revenues.  The MF has had a series of stand-by arrangements with the Sudan,
the latest of which is for 24 million SDRs up to July 1974.    Both in the IMF
consultations and the Bank mission discussions with the government, specific
recommendations have been made regarding budgetary and fiscal measures needed
to improve the economic situation; the stand-by agreement with the INF stipulates
credit ceilings and hence acts as a check on unbridled increases in public
sector expenditures. Moreover, with the successful solution to the internal
strife in the south and with the adootion of the new Constitution, it is felt
that the goverrment has the opportunity of turning its full attention to the
tasks of development.
11.       The key problem of the Sudanese economy is the low level of
investment which is causing the present stagnation and hence the most important
task is to step up the volume of investment and to ensure its financing in a
matter which will not lead to a serious debt burden.    It is estimated that
to increase C-NP at 4 percent per year in real terms over the period 1973-77 -
which would be a very modest target, considering the population growth rate
of 2.8 percent - would raquire minimum investment of the order of US$ 250.
million per annum.   If half of this is financed by private sources, as is
the government's hope and expectation, public sector investment would have
to increase to U3$ 125 million per annum from its present level of US$ 81
million. This would be a sharp increase in public sector development
expenditure but it is no more, in monetary terms, than was achieved in the
early 1960s. Considering the general price increase over the last decade,
such a level of public investment would in real terms still be less than
what was achieved ten years ago.
12.       Assuming the public sector can increase its volume of annual
development expenditures to the levels attained in the early 1960s of
about US$125 million per annum, the problem then is to mobilize domestic
and external resources to finance such a level of expenditures. At present
public savings are not adequate to finance even half of the projected level
of development expenditures and the potential for a sharp improvement in
the near future is slim. Consequently the level of public sector investment
in the Sudan over the next few years will be to a great extent a function
of the inflow of external assistance.



13.       To step up the level of inrvestamenT and to mobilize internal and
external resources requires an adequate planning mechanism and procedures.
Therefore, the Bank is executing a planniang project financed by the UNEDP
to strengthen the central planning organization in t;he country.   The Bank
is also sending a mission to review the statistical system of the Sudan and
to prepare a plan to fill the gaps in the system.   This should result in
further improvements in the planning ard evaluation functions.
14.       The financial and adrmlinistrative Troblens of the public sector
preclude a sharp increase ir its devealopment progra in The shorn run.
Therefore, the role of the orivate sector in maintaining growth is crucial.
Although the public sector plays a major role, historically the attitude
towards private investment has at most times been favorable.    The decline
in private activity since 1965 was mainly d-ue to the unstable political
environment and the feeling of* -neasiness following the nationalization and
conffiscation measures of 1970 and 1971. The government has taken the
necessary steps to settle the compensation claims, has returned confiscated
property and has enacted legislation providing incentives and guarantees
for private enterprises - foreign and local.
15.       At the end of 1971, the Sudan's total external public debt was
US$,438.9 million equivalent, zicluding undisbursed commitments of
US$137.4 millicn.   The breakdown. of the total debt outstanding by source
shows that the Bank Group followed by Arab bilateral, sources and China are
the three principal creditors with shares of 27.6, 22.8 and 18.5 percent
respectively.  Debt service payments on long-term debts amounted in 1971 to
12.1 percent of the value of exports of goods and non-factor services.
16.       The Sudan's capacity to service additional loans on conventional
terms over the next few years is severely liaited by its budgetary and
foreign exchange position which are likely to remain strained for some time.
The Central Government current surplus which averaged about Ls 8 million a
year in the. period 711962-71 has turned into an increasing deficit, reaching
Ls 17 million in FY73.
17.       While the Sudan has a good record in mneeting its repayment
obligations, such obligations over the next few years will strain the
availability o-f foreign exchange, particularly if full account is taken
of the repayments of the compensation payments for the nationalized assets.
Sudan's export earnings are expected to grow at the modest rate of 3.5 percent
annually, but being heavily dependent on cotton production, they are subject
to fluctuation on account of weather, pests and international prices.    The
ne- foreign re,3erves of the cou-ntry have been depleted since 1968 and at
present they stand a-> a nega±- ve figure of US$115 million.  Imports,
particularlly capital impzrts, have to expand in proportion to the projected
increase i- in-vestment, private and public.  Therefore, while a rapid increase
in private and publ-ic capital is essential, it is paramount that the terms
0fplublic eapitiL inflow shoulLd be as soft as possible.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATONS IN THE SUDAN
18.       Since the Sudan's independence in 1956, the Bank Group has helped
finance various development projects with commitments totalling $210.75
million and has been the country's largest source of foreign aid. A major
portion of our past lending was to help finance irrigation and railway
projects; in addition we also helped with one power project and an education
project. Annex II contains a sumnary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC invesuments as of September 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
19.       While no loans or credits were made to the Sudan between September
1968 and June 1972, largely because of the government's failure to take
measures necessary to overcome its economic difficulties, we believe the
situation is improving. The government has given more attention to the
resolution of its domestic economic and political problems. The ending of
the conflict in the south has been a major achievement although it is bound
to add to the immediate development resource requirements of the country.
Resumption of diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany and
the United States and efforts to work out continuing stand-by arrangements
with the IMF are further evidence of the government's determination to find
sclutions to the Sudan's pressing problems. A clearly more receptive attitude
to the Bank and the pressing needs of the south are strong justification for
more active Bank Group operations in the Sudan.
20.       Our economic missions have enabled us to prepare detailed analyses
of the major economic sectors and identify several high priority projects,
some of which could be suitable for Bank Group lending.   While the Southern
Region has special rehabilitation requirements, it is evident that our lending
strategy, for the country as a whole, in the near future should continue to
emphasize agriculture and transportation, wnich hold the key to increasing
both production and exports, and should support the revitalization of industry.
The recently approved Rahad Irrigation Project will substarntially help
agriculture and we expect to negotiate shortly a railway project which will
improve rail transport and port facilities.   The proposed Credit to the
Industrial Bank of Sudan will help reactivate the private industrial sector.
For the future there are further power and highway projects, a domestic
aviation project and a project for rural development in the Southern Region.
21.       In response to a specific request by the Sudanese government to
reactivate the Consultative Group for the Sudan which, established in 1963,
has been largely dormant since 1964, a meeting of the Consultative Group was
held in July. Most of the original member countries as well as some new
countries participated in the Group and have expressed positive interest in
helping the Sudan.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN THE SUDAN
22.       Industrial statistics in the Sudan are inadequate for a detailed
analysis of the sector. As a general trend, industrial development in the
country began during World War II and accelerated after independence in 1956.
Local and foreign capital established a number of industries to meet domestic
demand in consumer and intermediate goods and by 1971 the share of the
manufacturing sector was about 9 percent GDP.



_ 6
23.       Until 1960 manufacturing had beer. undertakern orly by private
interests.  In 1961, the governmnent decided that the establishment of certain
industries was vital to the economy but felt that the private sector would
not have either the interest or resources to undertake the required
investment.  Accordingly, the first government owned manufacturing operation,
a tannery, went into production in November 1961 fol owed by a large sugar
mill in 1962 and a cardboard factory in 1963. The government established
the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) in 1965 to manage the goverrnent
investments in industry and to undertake new investments.   The nationalization
measures of May 1970 exparnded public ownership in the industrial sector and
the TDC was replaced by the IndustriaL Productlon Corporation (IPC) . The IPC
started as a holding company "or 46 state enterprizes of which some have
since been returned to the private sector which, is now estimated to account
for about 65 percent of total manufacturing assets.
24.       In recent years private investment in manufacturing industries was
low due to uncertainty about the govern-mnentIs intentions towards the relative
roles of the private and the public sectcrs, culminating in t-he nationalizations
of 1970.  In 1971 the government made it clear, however, thatJ it will rely on
the private sector for the bulk of new industrial investments and that it will
limit its own involvement to those projects which are too large for private
investors such as sugar mills, tanneries, and fertilizer factories.   The
current tentative list of new industrial projects in the public sector, most
of which are still preliminary proposals not backed by feasibility studies,
includes a factory for agricult-uril machinery, two tanneries, a kenaf factory,
a sugar mill and a fertilizer factory. New legislation has bteen enacted
providing for several incentives for local and foreign investors.   The
incentives include exemption 1from corporation income tax for five years;
accelerated depreciation rates; exemption from customs duties on machinery,
spare parts, r2w materials, etc. for five years; drawback of duties on raw
materials and packing used in the manufacture of goods for export; tariff
protection in selected cases; guaranteed remittance of profits and repatriation
of foreign investment; and guarantees against nationalization without fair
compensation.  An Industrial Sector Mission will visi-t the Sudan shortly to
study the effects of these incentives. There is evidence that these concessions
have resulted in renewed interest from both domestic and foreign investors in
industrial development in the Sudan.
25.      Given the reasonable size of the domestic market, the scope for
industrial investment, particularly for import substitutiorB is considerable.
This is evident from the fact that imports of consumer goods and of inter-
mediate goods dluring FY72 constbituted 49 percent and 40 percent respectively
of total imports.  Cotton spinn.ing and weaving have already interested both
local and foretgn investors and is likely to remain an attrac-tive area for
further investment for so-ne time to come.  Investments are also likely to
increase in other agro-based industries using local raw materials, a fair
portion of wh,ioh is still exported unprocessed or semi-processed, such as
hides and skirs, groundnuts, oii cakes and gum arabic.
26.      ITS is still tlhe only specialized financial institution catering
to the long-te.ri crecit require.men-s of the private industrial sector.
however, because of itts la ck of resources and the low level of investment
activity in the late 1960s, the role played by IBOS has renmained rather modest.



- 7 -
IBS has, however, been an important source of long-term finance for the
relatively small projects of the new Sudanese industrialists who did not
have easy access to coimmercial banks or suppliers' credits. The commercial
banks, which were nationalized in 1970, appear to have met most of the demand
for long-term industrial credit during this period by rolling over short-term
credit and, in some cases, through direct long-term loans. Although accurate
statistics on suppliers' credits are not available, they are believed to have
been a major source of financing for imported industrial machinery in recent
years. This pattern of industrial financing is not appropriate for meeting
the long-term credit needs of the expected increase in industrial investment.
Because of credit ceilings and exchange restrictions, it is difficult to
utilize comnercial bank credits to finance impor-ted equipment. The tied
nature of suppliers' credits and their fairly short term have imposed an
increasing burden both on the Sudanese economy and the project beneficiaries.
It is important, therefore, that external credit be provided on suitable
terms to meet the growing demand expected from the Sudanese industry.    This
is the purpose of the proposed project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       A report entitled "Appraisal Report - The Industrial Bank of Sudan"
(No. 200(a)-SU, dated October 15, 1973) is being circulated separately.
A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
28.       The Sudanese Government has for some time been exploring with the
Bank Group the possibility of a credit line for IBS. Bank staff have visited
the country on several occasions in this connection between 1969 and 1972.
The project was appraised in February/March 1973 and negotiations were held
in Washington in August 1973. The Sudanese delegation was led by Dr.Nasreldin
Mubarak, Director General of the National Planning Commission, and included
Mr. Mahdi Ahmed, Managing Director of the Industrial Bank of Sudan.
Objectives
29.       The Industrial Bank of Sudan (IBS) was established by an Act in
1961 and is wvholly owned by the Bank of Sudan (the central bank).   Originally
limited to financing only private industrial enterprises, the Act was amended
in 1973 to allow IBS to participate in the financing of public sector projects
also. IBS operating policies have also been amended to delineate its maximum
exposure in industrial enterprises and to enable IBS to make equity investments.
Board of Directors
30.       The IBS Board of Directors has eight members consisting of the
Managing Director (who is also the Chairman), the Deputy Managing Director,
one representative each from the Ministry of Finance and National Economy,
the Ministry of Industry and Mining and the Bank of Sudan, plus three members
from the private sector. The Managing Director and the Deputy Managing
Director are appointed by the Council of Ministers on the recommendation
of the Minister of Finance and National Economy whereas the directors from
the private sector are appointed by the Minister of Finance and National
Economy after consultation with the Chairman. The Board meets once a month
and approves all investments in excess of Ls 5,000.



Management and Staff
31.      The Managing Director is a senior civil servant with experience
in the Ministries of Finance and Economics and Planning and was also the
Chairman of a government-owned commercial bank. The organization and
staffing of IBS need considerable strengthening, especially in the fields
of financial and economic appraisal of projects. IBS has also suffered from
excessive turnover of its best people due to inadeoquate compensation and
scope of work. IBS has recently improved its salary scales and agreed to
an integrated program of staff recruitment and development and to the
appointment of an Advisor f'or one or two years to help improve project
appraisal ard investment sulpervision capabi-lities. UNDP has agreed to
finance this technical assistance and maKe IDA the executing agency.    A
suitable Advisor is likely to be appointed soon.
Operations and Portfolio
32.      Since its inception, IBS has financed primarily small and medium
scale industry; 87 percent of its borrowers have received loans for less
than Ls 50,000 in each case. Most IBS loans have gone to Sudanese entre-
preneurs. The average maturity of IBS loans is about seven years and the
average interest on past loans about 8.25 percent per annum. The loans are
fairly diversified by industry and no single sector accounts for more than
15 percent of IBS's total lending. The industries which have benefited are
focd processing, textiles, printing and packagirng, oil mills, chemicals and
engineering workshops. The volume of operations has fluctuated widely,
indicative of the changes in the investment climate of the country.    As of
December 31, 1972 IBS had an outstanding portfolio totalling Ls 1,823,000
covering 71 projects. Of these, 31 loans representing 57 percent of the
portfolio were affected by arrears while actual overdues amounted to about
23 percent of the outstanding portfolio. As recommended by its auditors,
IBS has made adecuate provisions to cover doubtful deb-ts. It is expected
that the measu-res agreed with LBS to improve the appraisal and supervision
skills of its staff will lead to an improvement in -the quality of its
portfolio in the future.
Guarantees
33.      In addition to its loan portfolio, IBS has been providing guarantees
to secure suppliers' credits for its clients. This business, necessitated
by IBS's lack of foreign exchange resources, has increased sharply in recent
years and, as of December 31, 1972, twenty guarantees involving a total amount
of Ls 818,000 were outstanding.   The duration of the guarantees ranges from
two to six years, but most of them are for four years and according to
present indications, no losses are likely on the guarantee portfolio.
Financial Results
34.      The I3S operations have not been profitable; it incurred losses in
1967 and 1968, broke even in 1969, and made a nominal profit in 1970 and 1971.
Profits in 1972, before provisions, amounted to Ls 36,000 but the need to
make large provisions in one year for the long-standing problem projects
resulted in a net loss of over Ls 237,000. Total provisions, including



-
Ls 101,000 provided for in 1971, amolnt to Ls 374,000. In 1972 IBS's
revenue amounted to 8.6 percent of the average loan portfolio but earnings
are expected to improve in the future as IBS has recently increased its
interest rates in line with prevelant market rates.
Forecast of Operations
35.      Forecasts of IBS operations through 1977 indicate that total
commitments are expected to increase from the current level of about
Ls 0.6 million to almost Ls 1.0 million in 1974, Ls 1.2 million in 1975 and
thereafter to increase by about 11 percent annually. Given new resources,
more effective staff and a more liberal charter, it is expected that IBS
could play an increasingly important role in the industrial developnent of
the country.  The pipeline of active projects consists of over 60 private
sector projects covering a wide range of industries including cotton textiles,
spinning and weaving, asbestos cement, glucose and starch, caustic soda and
animal fodder. The foreign component of IBS operations is forecast to be
about 65 percent, based on lBS assessment of requirements for imported
machinery and equipment for the active projects in its pipeline.   The pipeline
does not include any projects in the public sector, although it is expected
that IBS may finance some expansion projects in this sector in due course
as projects develop.
Project Profitability and Balance Sheet
36.      Net profits as a percentage of average net worth are projected to
increase to 3.9 percent before provisions and to 1.7 percent after provisions
in 1975.  The expected profitabilty, while an improvement on the past, is
still low mainly because of short-term investments yielding low returns of
3 percent per annum, no forecast returns or equity portfolio until 1977, and
relatively high administrative expenses. The average interest on IBS foreign
currency loa.-s is expected to be 9 percent, while IBS will pay the Sudanese
governmeznt 73ie percent for the funds on-lent from. the !DA credit. Total assets
are expected to grow at an annual average rate of about 20 percent.   The
debt/equity ratio is projected to increase gradually but would still remain
at a low level of 0.88 through 1977. It has also been agreed that IBS will
aimit its indebtedness to three times its net worth.
37.       In the Sudan the Auditor General's office has the statutory
responsibility to audit the accounts of all gover-maent corporations, unless
it agrees to delegate this responsibility.   Given the heavy work lcad of the
Auditor Generals office and the rather detailed audit requirements applied
by the Bank on DFC operations, it has been agreed that IBS would in future
be audited by auditors acceptable to the Association.
Resource Requirements
38.       As of December 31, 1972, IBS had no uncommitted resources.   The
Bank of Sudan has agreed to increase IBSts paid-in share capital by Ls 500,000
to Ls 3,000,000.  IBS has drawn down from the Bank of Sudan Ls 300,000 of the
increase, and the balance of Ls 200,000 is to be paid in before June 1974.
Government has also agreed to relieve IBS by 1975 of its unremunerative eauity
holdings for which it would receive about Ls 445,000 by 1975.    These new domestic



-10 -
resources plus internal cas:n generation will cover the local currency component of
forecast IBS lending through 1977.   IDS's requirements to finance the
foreign component of its investments for the two-year period through 1975
amount to Ls 1.4 million ($4 million).   IDA being the only prospective
foreign lender to IBS at present, the proposed credit of US$4 million is needed
to provide IBS with the foreign resources essential to enable it to carry
out its projected program of financing industrial development.
Relending Terms
39.      The IDA Credit will bDe on-lent by the Sudanese government to IBS
at 74 percent interest for a maximumn period of 15 years and with a flexible
amortization schedule conforming to the aggregate amortization schedules of
IBS sub-loans under the credit.   IBS's borrowers will bear the exchange risk.
However, considering IBS's low level of operations and the need to build up
its financial position, IBS will be granted concessional treatment regarding
commitment charges, which will accrue at 3/4 percent on the loan from the
government; only from the date investments are authorized for withdrawal by
IDA. The agreed free limit for individual sub-loans would be $75,000 with an
aggregate free limit of $1 million. Sub-loans will be made at IBS's prevailing
interest rates which are 8.5 percent for medium-term loans (two to six years)
and 8.5 to 9.5 percent for long-term loans (six to fifteen years).
Benefits and Justification
40.      The investment climate in the Sudan has improved considerably in
the past two years as a result of a series of measures taken by the Sudanese
government to attract foreign investment and to encourage the development of
industries in the private sector.
41.      The IBS, which was operating on a modest scale until 1970 due to a
shortage of resources and to the political and economic situation in the
country, has good prospects to expand its operations and to assume a large
role in providing finance both to the small industries and to the larger
industrial enterprises in the Sudan. Given the necessary staff training
and development, envisaged as an integral part of the IDA credit operation,
IBS has the potential of developing into a sound institution and an important
channel for supporting productive investm-ent in the industrial sector. The
relationship with the Bank Group will enable IBS to imrprove its financial
and economic apraisal skills resulting in better resource allocation.     It
will also help IBS to make a more substantial contribution to the formulation
of industrial policy.
PART V - LEOAL INSThiUIMENES AND AUITHORITY
42.      T'he draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of the Sudan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and the Industrial Barik of Sudan, the Recommendation
of the Commiittee provided for under Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed
Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 11 -
43.       The draft agreements follow the normal pattern for credits for
development finance projects. The relending of the proceeds of the Credit
will be governed by a subsidiary loan agreement between the Democratic
Republic of the Sudan and IBS, satisfactory to the Association.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

The Bank and DA have so far made six loans and five credits to
the Sudan. D.sbursements are in progress or will shortly commence for
five projects.
Loan lIo. 522 Po;;er Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of January 15, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973r
The 1968 loan to the Central Electricity and Water Corporation
(CEWC), a semi-autonomous government agency, was for a power project
comprising a 90 Mfd hydroelectric powerhouse at Roseires, related transmission
lines and substat;.ons, as well as management consultirg services. The pro-
ject is now completed, but accounting and administrative inadequacies of the
CSFWC continue to require special attention of supervision missions. The
projecE has successfully made additional power available to the Khartoum
