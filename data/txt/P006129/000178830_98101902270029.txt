REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA FOR AN URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Bolivia for the equivalent of US$11.5 million to help fi-
nance an urban and rural communities water supply and sewerage project. The
loan would have a term of 20 years, including four-and-one-half years of
grace, with interest at 8.9% per annum. A total of US$6.7 million of the
proceeds of the loan would be relent to the Sanitary Works Administration of
Potosi (AAPOS) and to the Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Sucre (ELAPAS)
for 22 years, including 3 years of grace, with no interest during the grace
period and at 8.9% per annum thereafter.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Bolivia" (786a-BO) dated July 28, 1975, was distributed to the Executive
Directors. An updating economic memorandum is near completion and will be
distributed to the Executive Directors in the near future. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Despite the increasing Importance of petroleum and natural gas
exports, as well as significant mineral deposits, Bolivia remains one of the
poorest countries in South America. The majority of Its population is engaged
in traditional agriculture. Only a small part of the labor force is employed
in the modern sectors. The infrastructure is primitive and the road and rail
networks cover only a fraction of the country. The combination of strong
traditional ties within the Indian communities and geographic, health and
educational obstacles to population mobility has perpetuated the demographic
concentration on the inhospitable 10-15 thousand foot plateau, the Altiplano.
About half of Bolivia's population lives a physically, culturally and econo-
mically isolated subsistence existence in this region, which is rich in mineral
deposits but limited in agricultural potential.
4.        The 1952 revolutlon sought to put an end to the dual structure
which had characterized Bolivia's economy since colonial times and to
deprive the landowning and mining oligarchy of its economic base. This
objective was only partially achieved. Progress was made in eradicating
fuedal relations, distributing the land and eliminating obstacles to social
mobility. The agrarian reform and the nationalization of large mines,
however, were followed by falling production. GDP declined in the 1950s and

did not recover to its pre-1952 level until 1961. During the subsequent
decade, output increased steadily at an average annual rate of around 5%,
providing for per capita income increases averaging 2.5% p.a. As a result,
GNP per capita, which had fallen by 24% in the 1952-60 period, had recovered
by 1970 to its 1952 level and was more equally distributed. However, the
momentum of economic growth was again lost in 1969/71 when political insta-
bility lead to declining private investment and deterlorating public finances.
The deterioration of public finances reflected a structural flaw in the eco-
nomy. Bolivia's public sector is proportionately one of the largest in
South America and a source of livelihood for a sizeable segment of the popu-
lation. With scarce employment opportunities in the private sector, pressures
to expand the ranks of public servants proved difficult to resist. Increased
expenditures on wages and salaries, combined with a weak tax system, left
few resources for investment. Moreover, the inability of the public.sector
to generate adequate savings limited its capacity to utilize available external
capital assistance.
5.        On coming to power in 1971, President Banzer faced the need to
provide jobs for the unemployed and to revitalize investment and output growth.
Initially, this task was faced in the context of a sharp deterioration in
Bolivia's terms of trade which produced a weakening in the balance of payments
and a further deterioration in public finances and eventually resulted in a
substantial devaluation in 1972. At the same time, however, more rational
economic policies were put into effect and a more favorable climate for private
investment established. New laws offering guarantees and Incentives to
private investors especially in the hydrocarbon field were promulgated and
claims arising from earlier nationalizations were settled. The Government
also improved public administration and the pricing policies of some public
undertakings. These policies were successful in increasing private investment
and in bolstering the rate of growth.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
6.        The most important events affecting recent economic performance
have been the substantial improvement in the terms of trade in 1974 and the
subsequent deterioration last year. The sharp increases in petroleum and
mineral prices in 1974 allowed a simultaneous and large expansion of both
consumption and investment and brought about an unprecedented improvement
in public finances, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves.
After current deficits in 1970-73, the Central Government achieved savings
equivalent to one-third of its capital expenditure. For the public sector
as a whole, savings in 1974 exceeded 10% of GDP and covered nearly 90% of
capital expenditure. On the balance-of-payments side, the terms of trade
gain in 1974 was equivalent to about 11% of GDP; the trade surplus exceeded
US$150 million; and net capital inflows approached US$90 milllon, nearly four
times their 1973 level, as a result of substantially higher loan disbursements
to the public sector and increased foreign investment associated with hydro-
carbon exploration. However, part of this improvement was lost in 1975 when
Bolivia's terms of trade and export volumes declined under the impact of the
world economic recession, which brought once again the extreme dependence



- 3 -
of the economy on its external sector into focus. Mineral exports fell by
well over 20% as mineral prices declined by approximately 13%, on weighted
average, and shipments of most minerals fell as a direct result of the
recession and unloading on international markets of speculative stocks
accumulated during the commodity boom of 1973/74. Exportable surpluses of
crude petroleum were significantly reduced for the second year in a row due
to falling production and rapidly rising domestic consumption of hydrocarbon
derivatives. A significant price increase for natural gas exports to
Argentina could not compensate for the overall decline In export earnings. On
the whole, merchandise exports in 1975 declined by 18% whlle imports rose by
nearly one-third in the wake of the start-up of new public investment projects
and the liberalization of imports for consumer durables and motor cars earlier
In the year. Despite further substantial increases in disbursements of
medium-term loans to the public sector, net foreign exchange reserves fell by
US$60 million to US$100 million, or about two months of imports. The Central
Government's current surplus was just about 1.7% of GDP, after 2.6% in 1974,
and some borrowing from the banking system was necessary to finance growing
public Investment. However, some public utilities attained stronger financial
results due to improved rates.
7.        Bolivia's terms of trade are expected to again improve in 1976 and
beyond. Mineral prices have bottomed out In 1975 and hydrocarbon prices have
resumed their rising trend. Furthermore, with gradual economic recovery in
industrialized countries, mineral exports volumes should increase. Government
measures taken in late 1975 to increase prlces of domestically consumed petro-
leum products by about 70% on the average, especially of gasoline, should
slow down the rise in domestic demand, thus contributing to preserve export-
able surpluses. The outlook for 1976, therefore, is for somewhat accelerated
growth and an improved fiscal and balance-of-payments position.
8.        Economic growth prospects over the medium- to longer-term depend
on the Government's ability to increase savings and stimulate investments,
particularly those for developing the hydrocarbon, mineral and agricultural
resources. Government measures taken since about 1973 and designed to broaden
the fiscal revenue base are now beginning to show results. Firm wage policies
applied since 1974 have resulted in a reduction of inflation to an annual rate
of well below 10%. Investment in mining and hydrocarbons is accelerating.
Intensified exploration for hydrocarbons by the state-owned petroleum company
and private foreign companies is underway and may lead to significantly in-
creased production and export of crude petroleum and natural gas which would
stimulate an acceleration of economic growth towards the end of the decade.
Debt Service and Creditworthiness
9.        Service on external public debt in 1975 amounted to 16.8% of exports
of goods and non-factor services net of investment income abroad. Average
terms of the external debt outstanding have remained soft, reflecting the
high proportion of concesslonary aid channeled to Bolivia. Average interest
in 1975 was 4.4% and average maturity about 22 years.



- 4 -
10.       This position is bound to change, however, as it can be expected
that lending terms will become harder and the share of loans on conventional
terms will increase. Of new loans attracted during 1974 and 1975, over 25%
were financial and suppliers' credits. With substantial disbursements
envisaged during the next five years, the service on external public debt
will move well above its historical average (12.8%) by 1977/78; but in line
with growing exports, the debt service ratio should decline in subsequent
years. In view of the nature and growing size of Bolivia's debt, prudence
in selecting and utilizing external capital will have to be an essential
element of debt management.
11.       Bolivia enjoys a substantial resource base in agriculture, minerals
and hydrocarbons which has to be developed to sustain rapid economic growth
and, in particular, rapid expansion of export earnings in the foreseeable
future. If production in the export sectors can be increased as planned and
prices for major export products are adequate, Bolivia can be considered
creditworthy for substantially increased amounts of external lending on con-
ventional terms. Nevertheless, some additional lending on soft terms (&vail-
able from the Inter-American Development Bank and the USAID) is justified by
Bolivia's poverty and its large and continuing external capital requirements.
The country will require substantial external financing of investment to
supplement the domestic savings effort at least until the early 1980s. While
the Government is making a serious effort to mobilize domestic resources and
prepare a development program, implementation of this program will require
external assistance well in excess of the foreign exchange component of
suitable projects presently available for international financing. Although
substantially increased suppliers and financial credits will probably become
available, they should prudently cover not more than 35% of the public capital
inflows required during 1976-80 for meeting a GDP growth target of 5-6%
annually. The remainder should be obtained on softer terms from bilateral
and international development financing agencies, including an expanded Bank
lending program.
PART II - THE BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOLIVIA
12.       Although Bolivia is an original member of the Bank, it did not
obtain any Bank Group resources until 1964. Bank Group assistance to Bolivia
until 1974/1975 was limited by the country's tight budget and restricted
capacity to service external debt. Lending to Bolivia was in the form of
IDA credits except for a 1971 Bank loan to help finance an "enclave" project.
Because of the narrow scope for private investment, IFC became active in
Bolivia only in 1973 through an investment of US$400,000 in a firm producing
cables and plastic products. With expanding opportunities for private invest-
ment, however, IFC has most recently agreed to take an equity participation of
$550,000 in Banco Industrial (BISA) in conjunction with a Bank loan for
the same institution to assist in financing medium-sized industrial and mining
enterprises, and US$337,500 in the Banco Hipotecario Nacional to assist in the
development of mortgage banking. The latter two IFC investments also aim at



contributing to establish a local market for long-term securities. Annex II
contains a summary statement of the status of Bank Group operations in Bolivia
as of July 31, 1976, and notes on the status of ongoing projects.
13.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's sixth and the Bank Group's
seventeenth operation in Bolivia. Net of undisbursed balances, Bolivia's debt
to the Bank and IDA in 1974/75 represented 8.3% of its external public debt
and the share of the Bank Group in total debt service is now about 4%. Both
figures are expected to increase marginally by 1980. Although the Bank Group
has ranked below the US Government and the IDB as a source of financial
assistance to Bolivia, its role has been expanding.
14.       Future Bank lending will continue to support Government efforts to
strengthen and expand the productive base of the economy, in particular the
export sectors, while simultaneously emphasizing improved distribution of the
benefits of economic growth. In the social sectors, Bank activities will
focus on helping the less developed regions of the Altiplano and the interme-
diate valleys which contain the majority of Bolivia's rural and urban poor.
15.       A project to assist small privately owned mining firms is in the
final stages of preparation. Agricultural projects under consideration are
designed to meet the needs of the poorer farmer and an education project will
seek to improve rural and vocational education. The financing of further
economic infrastructure is also contemplated in the transportation and power
sectors. In transportation, project preparation is underway for a project to
provide access to remote areas of the country through a program of airport
development, and continued support for the railway rehabilitation program is
planned as well.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Present Situation
16.       Bolivia compares poorly with most Latin American countries in pro-
viding water and sewerage services: only 22% of its 5.5 million inhabitants
had water services and 10% had access to sewerage facilities in 1973. Ser-
vices in urban areas were better than in rural communities: about 56% of the
1.7 million urban dwellers benefitted from water services and 23% from sewerage
facilities in 1973. Generally, the supply of water is irregular, transmission
and distribution networks are run-down and the ratio of water lost due to
leakages is high. Sewerage services are available only to those who happen to
live in-the central and commercial sections of the eight largest cities. With
the exception of the city of Santa Cruz, sewage is discharged directly into
streams which are utilized downstream for irrigation and domestic purposes.
17.       In the rural areas, less than 5% of the 1973 population of 3.8
million have benefitted from water services and only about 3% have access to
sanitary facilities. The majority of the people depend on the supply of water



- 6 -
from shallow wells, springs, streams and rivers which are often of poor
quality. During the dry seasons, supply of water is uncertain and villagers
have to haul water over long distances. The Government has been aware of
these conditions and has prepared a National Plan to construct or improve
water systems in about 500 rural communities. The objective of the Government
under the National Plan is to provide water to about 16% of the rural popu-
lation by 1980. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) made a loan of about
US$1.8 million to finance the first stage of the National Plan in 1969-74.
This was implemented by the Water and Sewerage Corporation (CORPAGUAS) which
completed the construction of water systems in 68 rural communities in 1974.
Subsequently, IDB has decided to concentrate its efforts in urban centers like
Oruro, Trinidad, Tarija rather than in rural areas. In general, the Govern-
ment's investment in rural sanitation works has been confined mainly to
financing sanitation facilities in schools and health centers.
18.       Investment programs in the water supply and sewerage sector have
relied heavily on external assistance because competing claims from other
sectors and insufficient domestic savings left little resources for construct-
ing water supply and sanitation systems. Bolivia has received about US$75
million in soft funds mainly from IDB and the Federal Republic of Germany for
water supply and sewerage projects during the past seven years. In spite
of Government efforts, the tariffs for water have remained inadequate because
the majority of the public continues to believe that: (i) water should be
a free social good; and (ii) the low quality of services does not justify
tariff increases. The Government intends to modify these attitudes through
educational programs and by upgrading the quality of services.
19.       With the exception of the National Plan for provision of water to
rural communities, Bolivia did not have a coherent development plan for the
overall water supply and sewerage sector until the issuance, on April 15, 1975
of the Bank/WHO Water Supply and Sewerage Sector Study (No. 712-BO). Based on
the Sector Study recommendations, the Government established minimum targets
for provision of water services to 67% of the urban population and 16% of the
rural population by 1980. The 1980 minimum targets for provision of sewerage
facilities are 26% for the urban population and 4% for the rural population.
The Sector Study also recommended that the Government give priority to decen-
tralizing the responsibilities for the construction and supervision of rural
water supply and sewerage projects and that it establish, on a national level,
adequate tariff policies to finance the development needs in the sector.
20.       There are various entities involved in the water supply and sewerage
sector: (a) CORPAGUAS, a semi-autonomous agency, established in 1967, under
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs which builds
water supply sytems for communities with population between 200 and 10,000
people; (b) Division of Urban Engineering of the Ministry of Housing and Urban
Affairs, which establishes sector policies for urban areas; (c) Departmental
Development Organizations 1/ of Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca which have been

constructing water supply systems; (d) the Community Water Committees which
represent rural communities in matters concerning construction and maintenance
of water system; (e) the semi-autonomous public utilities in the eight largest
cities, including AAPOS and ELAPAS; and (f) the Division of Environmental
Sanitation of the Ministry of Public Health, which installs latrines for
communities of 2,000 inhabitants or less. Many of the entities which manage
water supply and sewerage systems lack adequate management, technical and
administrative personnel and their systems for accounting, billing and collec-
tion of charges, warehousing and purchasing are poor.
Organizational Changes
21.       At present, CORPAGUAS is the single most important agency for pro-
viding water supply in rural communities. However, servicing the needs of
these communities from La Paz has strained its manpower and financial resources.
In order to increase efficiency, the Government has agreed to prepare plans
for a gradual transfer of CORPAGUAS' present responsibilities for rural water
and sewerage systems to the four additional Departmental Development Organiza-
tions in which the 70 rural water systems will be constructed under the
project. CORPAGUAS agreed to retain consultants satisfactory to the Bank to
prepare a plan for such transfer by June 30, 1978 (Part C Project Agreement,
Sections 2.02 (a) and (b) and 3.06). However, in order to ensure that the
construction schedule is maintained, CORPAGUAS will keep its responsibilities
for the implementation of the project. Thereafter, CORPAGUAS will continue to
assist the Departmental Development Organizations in designing rural water
supply systems and building or supervising projects which require special
skills unavailable to them.
Legal and Institutional Changes
22.       To date, investments in the urban water supply and sewerage sector
have often been made without adequate coordination and without proper project
evaluation. Moreover, revenues from these projects seldom covered direct
operating costs. As a first step to improve this situation, the National
Tariff Council was established with powers to approve all new tariffs and a
National Tariff Standard (Decree No. 133) was published in April 1974. In
order to improve project evaluation, the Division of Urban Engineering will
act as a project evaluation unit with authority to approve or reject applica-
tions for financing of water supply and sewerage projects in urban communities
with 10,000 or more inhabitants. Projects will be approved only if they
represent the least cost solution and the proposed tariffs are consistent
with the guidelines set forth in the National Tariff Standard. The Government
agreed to issue the necessary regulations to effect the proposed changes in
the approval procedure and to retain consultants satisfactory to the Bank to
carry out the study of tariffs and to train the Division of Urban Engineering
staff for project evaluation (Loan Agreement Sections 3.01 (a) and 4.03 (a)
and (b)).



-8-
Tariff Policies
23.       The National Tariff Standard as amended in July 1976 stipulates that
rates in cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants should generate revenues
sufficient to cover operation, maintenance, debt services and a reserve for
future capital expenditure. In cities of less than 50,000 but more than
10,000 inhabitants, revenues shall cover operation, maintenance and debt
services. Rural communities are exempt from repaying interest and principal,
but they will have to make every effort to meet operation and maintenance
costs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The project, which is based on studies prepared by foreign and local
consultants, was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Bolivia in October
1975. A report entitled "Appraisal of the Urban and Rural Communities Water
Supply and Sewerage Project," No. 1076b-BO dated August 30, 1976, is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary
is presented in Annex III. Negotiations took place in Washington from July 26
to July 28, 1976. The Bolivian delegation was headed by Mr. Floyd Foster,
Undersecretary of Urban Affairs of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.
The Setting
25.       The project would be the first Bank operation for water supply and
sewerage in Bolivia, although a small component for potable water and sanita-
tion was included in the Ingavi Rural Development project (Loan 1211-BO). A
typical rural community which will benefit from the project has a population
of about 1,500, who are mainly Altiplano subsistence farmers with low incomes.
Most of the villages do not have a community water supply system, and where
one exists, it is very old, and the quality of water is poor and shortages are
common.
26.       The master plans for the expansion of the water supply and sewerage
systems for Potosi and Sucre are part of the overall urban development studies
for both cities. The city of Potosi, which has a population of about 75,000,
is the oldest and most important mining town in Bolivia and practically all
its labor force is employed in mining. The present water supply services are
inadequate for its expanding residential and industrial sections. Sucre is
the historical capital of Bolivia with about 55,000 people. The city is the
commercial center for the Department of Chuquisaca and an important center for
training teachers and physicians. Water losses in both cities are high--about
48% in Sucre and 62% in Potosi. The average water consumption for new users
in both Potosi and Sucre is projected to be only about 20 cubic meters per
household per month, in view of their low income.

Project Description
27.       The project has the following components:
(i) Water Supply for 70 Rural Communities: The construction of about
70 water systems additional to the 68 systems constructed under the
first stage of the National Plan (paragraph 17) and establishment
of a Community Water Committee in each of the participating rural
communities. A typical rural water system will consist of intake
works, chlorination facilities, storage and distribution tanks,
and distribution networks including house connections and public
faucets. Detailed studies and designs for 35 of the water systems
have been prepared and the remaining 35 will be ready by December
1977. Construction of the water systems is expected to be completed
in four years.
(ii) Water Supply for Potosi: The second stage of a 20-year program
to improve the water supply system for Potosi. The project will
repair the existing dikes, line the main conduits, enlarge the
treatment plant, extend the distribution network, reduce leakage
from 62% to 23% and carry out a survey of house connections and
public faucets. These works will take about two years.
(iii) Water Supply and Sewerage for Sucre: The project will improve and
protect the main canal, increase storage facilities, extend the
distribution network and install house connections and water meters.
The project will also improve and extend the sewer system in Sucre,
install about 4,000 additional house sewerage connections and
construct a sewerage treatment plant. These works will take about
two years.
(iv) Technical Assistance: (a) Training of the staff of the Division
of Urban Engineering, AAPOS, CORPAGUAS and ELAPAS; and (b) studies
on tariffs for water supply and charges for sewerage services and
the effects of metering water consumption.
28.       The project includes an estimated 47 man-months of consultant ser-
vices for technical assistance to train the staff of the Division of Urban
Engineering to improve its project evaluation systems and to introduce in
CORPAGUAS, AAPOS and ELAPAS improved management, accounting, and financial
systems. An additional 44 man-months of consultant services are included
for engineering design and supervision.
Project Implementation
29.       The project would be constructed by CORPAGUAS, AAPOS and ELAPAS.
The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs would open an account in the Central
Bank on behalf of the three beneficiaries. The proceeds of the loan will be
provided as a grant to CORPAGUAS and will be relent to AAPOS and ELAPAS
for 22 years, including three years of grace, with no interest during the
grace period and at Bank interest rate thereafter.



- 10 -
30.       CORPAGUAS has extensive experience in designing and building rural
water supply projects and is adequately staffed. For the purposes of the
project, it needs to improve its accounting procedures, and the project
provides consultants for this purpose. CORPAGUAS will supervise construction
of the community water supply systems. It will promote the establishment of
a Community Water Committee in each community and will enter into a separate
subloan agreement with each Committee for the construction of water supply
systems. The Committees will be responsible for obtaining the communities'
contributions for water supply projects and for carrying out routine main-
tenance and record keeping functions.
31.       In order to ensure rapid implementation of the proposed project,
CORPAGUAS has already begun forming Community Water Committees in 35 villages
which have been selected according to practical criteria. The criteria includes
such indicators as per capita cost for a system, initiative of the community
and its organization, willingness and ability to pay for services, capacity to
contribute funds, labor, materials, etc. CORPAGUAS will use the same criteria
in the selection of the remaining 35 villages (Part C Project Agreement, Section
3.08). In the event that the participating communities fall behind schedule
with their contributions, the respective Departmental Development Organizations
will be required to make up any shortfalls (Part C Project Agreement, Section
3.07 (a) and (b)).
32.       AAPOS, established in 1972, has the necessary managerial and techni-
cal staff for the execution of the proposed project. Financial management of
AAPOS as well as its commercial and accounting systems still need to be
improved. The project provides for consultant services to AAPOS for this
purpose. ELAPAS is a well managed autonomous entity with extensive experience
in constructing and maintaining a water supply and sewerage system. ELAPAS
has been, for over a year, the only water company in the country which has
successfully installed water meters to a majority of its users. Its financial
and costing systems still need improvement and the project provides consultants
for this purpose (Part A and Part B Project Agreements, Section 3.05). Staff
from both entities, with the assistance of consultants, will prepare detailed
designs, cost estimates and bidding documents for works in Potosi and Sucre.
Personnel from AAPOS and ELAPAS, assisted by consultants, will also supervise
the construction of the respective water supply systems and the sewerage
facility in Sucre.
Cost Estimates
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$15.0 million,
including contingencies. Interest during construction amounts to an addi-
tional US$1.4 million and will be financed from local contributions. The pro-
posed US$11.5 million Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange costs
(US$11.1 million) and local consultant costs (US$0.4 million). The average
cost per man-month for consultant services is estimated at US$4,000 for
foreign consultants and US$2,000 for local consultants. Further details of
the cost estimates and the financing plan are summarized in Annex III.



Procurement
34.       Pipes, accessories, meters and related equipment (estimated to cost
about US$7 million) would be procured through international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Local manufacturers will receive a
margin of preference of 15% of the cif price, or the actual tariff, whichever
is lower. Contracts for civil works, estimated to cost about US$2.6 million,
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. The type and size of the
civil works are such that foreign firms are unlikely to be interested in
bidding although they would not be precluded from doing so. Because of the
specialized nature and limited amount of work involved, construction in some
of the remote villages would be undertaken by CORPAGUAS on force account,
using labor from the villages.
Disbursement
35.       Disbursements would be made for 100% of the foreign exchange cost
of imported equipment. Disbursements for civil works and locally procured
materials and equipment (if any) would be at the rate of 60%. Disbursements
for the engineering and technical assistance consultants would be for 100% of
total costs. Retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 equivalent for engi-
neering studies for the sewerage component of ELAPAS prior to the date of the
Loan Agreement and after July 1, 1975 is proposed. Disbursements for the
works in Potosi and Sucre are expected to be completed by early 1979, and for
the rural works by 1981.
Financial Situation
36.       The financial position will vary considerably between the rural and
urban components of the project.
(i) Rural Component: Under the project, communities with less than
10,000 inhabitants will pay only for operation and maintenance of
the water supply systems and the Government will repay CORPAGUAS'
portion of the Bank loan. Each community would contribute the
equivalent of about 15% of the construction cost in cash, labor and
materials. The cost of the house connection will be charged to
individual households.
(ii) Urban Component: AAPOS is financially weak due to an inadequate
water rate (a fixed monthly fee of about US$0.50 cents) and its
reluctance to install meters. AAPOS agreed that not later than
December 31, 1976, it will submit to the Bank a detailed meter
installation program for at least 80% of its users in order to
introduce charges based on the quantities consumed (Loan Agreement,
Section 2.02 (a) (v) and Part A Project Agreement, Section 3.06).
AAPOS will also complete a consumer survey by April 30, 1977 (Part
A Project Agreement, Section 3.07). ELAPAS' financial performance
has been somewhat better than AAPOS. However, its average monthly



- 12 -
water bill of about US$1.00 per connection has enabled ELAPAS to
cover only its operating costs. The financial position of both
AAPOS and ELAPAS will be strengthened under the project. Tariff
levels will be raised in steps from December 1, 1976 so that by
1979, revenues will cover: (a) operation, debt services and all
taxes; (b) the cost of any expansion other than a major expansion
and increases in non-cash working capital requirements for the
current year; and (c) 10% of the estimated average annual expenses
for any major expansion during a period of three calendar years
including the current year and the two years immediately following
it (Part A and Part B Project Agreements, Section 4.03 (a)). The
initiation of the tariff increase constitutes a condition for the
disbursement of the loan both for AAPOS and ELAPAS (Loan Agreement,
Section 2.02 (a) (iv) and (b) (iv). As the payment capacity of
those benefitting from sewerage facilities in Sucre is limited, the
charges for sewerage services will need to be partially subsi4ized
during the next few years. ELAPAS will recover part of its invest-
ment in sewerage either by way of an earmarked tax or by other
measures satisfactory to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 2.02 (b)
(v)).
Project Benefits and Risks
37.       The incremental financial rate of return can be calculated only
for two project components. The rate of return for the urban water supply
investments by AAPOS is estimated to be 6%, while that for ELAPAS is 10%. The
combined rate of return for these components, which account for 35% of the
total project cost, would be 8.1%. Meaningful rates of return could not be
calculated for the sewerage system to be constructed by ELAPAS or for the
rural water supply systems to be undertaken by CORPAGUAS.
38.       In addition to yielding a reasonable rate of return on the urban
water supply components, the project is also justified by the introduction of
major institutional, financial and investment reforms in the rural and urban
water supply and sewerage sector. The proposed reforms would improve the
overall technical and financial position of the sector by transferring respon-
sibilities for construction of water systems in rural areas to four Depart-
mental Development Organizations, establishing additional Community Water
Committees and strengthening the executing agencies, including the Division of
Urban Engineering.
39.       From a social point of view, the project will help to provide clean
water for the benefit of about 100,000 rural poor whose access to uncontamina-
ted water is at present limited. About 50,000 people will benefit from im-
proved water supply systems in Potosi and Sucre while about 30,000 people in
Sucre will also benefit from sewerage facilities. Provision of water supply
in the rural communities, Potosi and Sucre will help to improve living
conditions and health standards by controlling water borne diseases and
thereby, over time, improving the productivity and incomes of the poor in
Bolivia.

40.       Delay in implementing the tariff increases in Potosi and Sucre in
accordance with the financial covenants (para 36 (ii)), could delay disburse-
ments against the respective project works and thereby constitute the main
risk for the timely completion of the project. Although the Government and
the local entities support the tariff increases, the population in both cities
is likely to be opposed. To secure acceptance by the public, it is proposed
that the bulk of the increases be spread over two years and an intensive
educational program be launched. Also, the Government is confident that
opposition to the tariff increases will subside as soon as the project works
start providing better service. The other risks are no greater than can
normally be expected with operations of this type.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreements between the Bank and, respectively, AAPOS,
ELAPAS and CORPAGUAS, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III
(Section 4 (iii)) of the Articles of Agreement, and a draft Resolution approv-
ing the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
42.       Features of the Loan and Project Agreements of special interest are
referred to in paragraphs 21, 22, 31, 32, and 36 (ii) of this report.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Credit 261-BO - Third Livestock Development Project, US$6.8 million, June 25,
1971; Effective Date: September 15, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
After implementation slowed down in 1974, the project is now proceeding
as scheduled and the credit should be fully disbursed by the closing date of
June 30, 1977.
Credit 346-BO - Railway Project, US$8 million, December 1, 1972; Effective
Date: February 21, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
All of the funds under the project have been committed. Due to
inflation, however, the funds available under the credit have been insuffi-
cient to procure all of the items included in the project'. About 50% of the
items planned for procurement for the first project, have been deferred for
purchasing under the second railway project. Materials and equipment ordered
under the project did not begin to arrive in Bolivia until the last quarter
of 1974. Improvements have been made in the management operations, financial
condition and tariff structure of the railway.
Credit 433-BO - Third ENDE Power Project, US$6 million, October 17, 1973;
Effective Date: December 11, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project was initially delayed due to unexpected long delivery
time for the gas turbines originally planned to be installed at Santa Cruz.
Project progress is now satisfactory. Cost overruns are currently at about
34% over the 'original estimates of project cost. ENDE will finance the
overruns with its own funds.

Loan 1121-BO - Second Railway Project, US$28.7 million, June 5, 1975;
Effective Date: August 8, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The Borrower has arranged bilateral financing for locomotives
in the project and in accordance with the understanding reached with
the Bank, the loan amount has been adjusted downward from $32 million to
$28.7 million. Project progress has been satisfactory with performance
targets either having been attained or exceeded.
Loan 1238-BO - Fourth ENDE Power Project, US$25 million, June 2, 1976;
Effective Date: August 23, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.

1976; Effective Date:                    '   ; Closing Date:  June 30, 1982.
It is anticipated that the loan will become effective in the near
future.

Procurement Arrangements:      Pipes, accessories, meters and related equipment
(estimated to cost about US$7 million) would be
procured through international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with the Bank Guidelines.
Local manufacturers will be accorded a margin of
preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price, or the
actual tariff, whichever is lower. Contracts
for civil works estimated to cost less than
US$2.6 million would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally and in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
The type and size of the civil works are such that
overseas firms are unlikely to be interested in
bidding although they would not be precluded from
doing so. Because of the specialized nature and
limited amount of work involved construction in
some of the remote villages would be undertaken
by CORPAGUAS on force account, using labor from
the villages.
Consultants:                   About 91 man-months of consultant services
(US$402,000), to assist in the preparation of
engineering plans, specifications, bidding
documents, improvement of organizations,
management and accounting; and the training of
personnel.
Rate of Return:                The average incremental financial rate of return
on the urban water supply components which
account for 35% of the total project cost is
8.1%.
Appraisal Report:              Report No. 1076b-BO dated August 30, 1976.
