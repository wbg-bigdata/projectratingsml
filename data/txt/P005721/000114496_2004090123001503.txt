sites to control sedimentation, and rehabilitation and modernization
of port infrastructure so as to ensure its compliance with
international standards for sea product quality.
9.    Carrying out of a program to protect and conserve the
Borrower's soil and natural resources from erosion, consisting of:
(i) mechanical terracing and bunding, gully consolidation,
biological stabilization of contour ridges, range planting, and
development of a monitoring and evaluation system and research for
said program; and (ii) a pilot program to test alternatives for
carrying out soil conservation activities through contracting with
farmers' associations, and provision of training as required for
this Section A.9.
10.   Carrying out of a program of water resources mobilization
through construction of small-scale rural works consisting of ponds,
infiltration dams, and weirs for spate irrigation.
11.   Development, on the basis of a pilot action identified by a
study on land consolidation, of land tenure options for voluntary
consolidation of fragmented parcels of land in the Borrower's
rainfed areas, and carrying out of small-scale rural infrastructure

tional and planning capabilities of the MOA and the Borrower's
agencies responsible for implementation activities in the agri-
culture sector, including:

budgetary monitoring procedures so as to ensure the timely avail-
ability of information on the implementation status of investments
to the MOA's organisms responsible for the implementation of
investment programs, strengthening of the CRDAs units responsible
for budget monitoring and evaluation functions, and provision of
equipment as required therefor.
2.    Development and carrying out of a medium-term plan by the MOA
to implement adequate organizational, staffing and budgetary
adjustments necessary to rationalize and improve the decentra-
lization process of its activities to the CRDAs.
3.    Development of a national program to improve and rationalize
on-farm irrigation water use, including measures designed to
develop, evaluate, and diffuse new adaptive research technologies

and strengthen the institutional capabilities of the Rural
Engineering Research Center (Centre de recherche de genie rural).
4.    Development and carrying out of a suitable strategy to improve
the procedures applied by the MOA: (i) in the design of animal
health programs, so as to ensure, inter alia, the proper analysis of
the impact of public investments in livestock disease control; and
(ii) in the economic appraisal methodology for new port infra-
structure, in order to optimize the size of harbor facilities and
the use of equipment and facilitate the determination of port
tariffs, and strengthening of the institutional capabilities of the
Directorate for Veterinary Public Hygiene (Direction d'hygiene
publique veterinaire) to improve the program of hygiene and quality
control of animal and sea products.
5.    Development and carrying out of medium-term plans at the
regional level to enhance and foster the MOA's investment management
capabilities in soil and water conservation activities through
expanded research, establishment of a suitable monitoring and
evaluation system therefor, and provision of equipment.
6.    Reinforcement of the MOA's capabilities in environmental
assessment activities, so as to ensure the adequate preparation and
review of impact evaluation studies and the suitable implementation
of mitigation plans in accordance with the requirements of the
national legislation thereon, and provision of training.
7.    Strengthening of the institutional and operational
capabilities of the Borrower's agency responsible for implementing
Part A.11 of the Project, including provision of equipment for
socio-economic and technical surveys and vehicles as required
therefor.
9.    Development and carrying out of a strategy to support: (i) the
promotion of the associations of users of rural potable water; (ii)
the creation and promotion of associations of users of hill ponds;
(iii) the progressive introduction of association of users of water
in public irrigation perimeters; and (iv) on the basis of the
foregoing, the suitable expansion of the activities of the users'
associations support units within the CRDA.
                               * * *
      The Project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1998.
