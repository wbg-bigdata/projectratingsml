3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background:
3.1.1   The gas system in BiH was developed starting in 1975 under the Bank financed Sarajevo Air
Pollution Control Project (Loan 1264-YU). Russian gas is supplied via Hungary and the Federal Republic



of Yugoslavia and enters BiH at Zvomnik, in Republika Srpska. Before the 1991-1995 war in BiH, the gas
supply system consisted of 182 km of transmission mains and offtake pipes. Consumption peaked in 1990
with 610 million cubic meters, constituting 8% of total energy consumption in Bill Gas consumption was
concentrated on industrial users in Zenica and Kakanj and on 15,000 household connections and a few
industrial/commercial users in Sarajevo. in addition, all major boilers of Sarajevo's district heating
network had been converted from coal to gas-firing. Within Bil, gas transmission and distribution were
the responsibility of Sarajevogas.
3.1.2  During the war, the high pressure transmission lines and associated facilities transporting the gas
from the international border to within BiH were not maintained, resulting in a significant deterioration in
safety and reliability of the transmission system. In addition, unauthorized use of gas upstream reduced the
supply coming into Sarajevo to such an extent that gas use for industry and much of the district heating
system became impossible. Combined with the destruction of the district heating system in Sarajevo early
on, and given a sharp reduction in electricity generation in BiH, gas suddenly assumed major importance
for the inhabitants of Sarajevo as a means to stay warm and to cook. Consumption of gas was made
possible through improvised connections and appliances which, combined with the absence of a gas
odorization system, often resulted in explosions and highly inefficient gas use.
3.1.3 At the end of the war, gas consumption constituted about 70% of all energy consumption and the
network had expanded from 15,000 to 89,000 household connections. Thirty-four thousand households
were returned to the district heating system during implementation of a parallel project, the Emergency
District Heating Reconstruction Project (Trust Fund Credit No. 024034), reducing the total number of gas
consumers to about 55,000 (most of which had improvised connections).
3.1.4  The total bill for gas supplied to BiH by Gazexport during the war was about US$105 million.
Settlement of the debt outstanding as of October 1, 1995 was expected to take place as part of the
commercial debt renegotiations. An interim contract for delivery of gas to both the Federation and
Republika Srpska was established for the period October 10, 1995-December 31, 1996. Agreement was
reached in January 1997 on a new three-year gas supply contract. However, Gazexport insisted on
payment of an unpaid amount of US$16.2 million under the October 1995 interim contract. When BiH
failed to come up with the full amount the gas supply to BiH was gradually reduced and fina:ly cut-off on
April 1, 1997. Since the major issue was a dispute between the Federation and RS about their respective
shares of the arrears, the Bank mounted a major effort to resolve these differences. As a result the
Federation and RS agreed to an arrears settletment scheme as well as to having separate gas supply and
transit contracts for each Entity. The Federation settled all its arrears to Gazexport and the flow of gas
resumed to the Federation on October 31, 1997. Gas supply to RS resumed soon after its arrears to
Gazexport were paid. The Emergency Natural Gas System Reconstruction Project was approved by the
Executive Directors in December 1997, following the establishment of these gas supply arrangements.
Project Objectives:
3.1.5  The principal objective of the project was to restore a safe and reliable gas supply to BiH, and in
particular to Sarajevo, as soon as possible by repairing or reconstructing the gas transmission and
distribution systems. This included the rehabilitation of the transmission line, distribution network and
connections of large users, including the Toplane-Sarajevo District Heating Company, and disconnection of
34,000 flats as soon as they were reconnected to a functioning district heating system. The second
objective was to enhance safety and energy efficiency and reduce environmental pollution by converting
self-made gas connections to industry standards. This included installing new meters and regulators on
42,000 connections, repairing meters and regulators on other connections, and replacing home made
-2 -



heating and cooking devices of low-income families with 10,000 simple wall heaters and two plate cookers.
Other objectives were to enhance cost recovery, strengthen the institutional capacity of Sarajevogas, and
identify alternative sources of gas supply. The project included US$0.1 million for repair of transmission
facilities in Republika Srpska and which were vital for a safe supply of gas to Sarajevo.
3.1.6  The project objectives were clear, realistic and consistent with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy
dated March 5, 1996, which included a series of emergency rehabilitation projects to support priority
needs, such as transportation, water supply, district heating, power and war victims rehabilitation as well
as natural gas. The restoration of a safe gas supply was critical to serve basic needs for heating and
cooking, particularly in Sarajevo. in parallel, the Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project
aimed at restoring district heating services in Sarajevo. The district heating system itself was fueled by
natural gas. These two reconstruction projects were well received and supported by the Government of
Bil, the implementing agencies and the donor coxnmunity.
3.2 Revised Objective:
3.2.1  The project objectives were not revised during project implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
3.3.1  The project consisted of the following major components: (i) engineering analysis of the gas
transmission and distribution systems; (ii) physical reconstruction of the gas system (except the
Semizovac-Zenica branch of the transmission pipeline); (iii) technical assistance to Sarajevogas to
implement the project and enhance its institutional capacity in management, technical and
commercial/financial aspects; and (iv) a district heating component covering goods and works to refund a
Project Start-up Advance of US$5 million provided to the Gas Project under the earlier approved District
Heating Project.
3.4 Revised Components:
3.3.2 The original components generally remained the same with a few minor changes: (i) there was a
reduced need for expenditure on household gas heating and cooking appliances as customers purchased
these with their own resources to a larger extent than anticipated; (ii) the scope for the billing and collection
software and hardware component was reduced as the billing and collection system was upgraded and
integrated by Sarajevogas using own resources and with a contribution outside the project from a UN Trust
Fund; and (iii) the Alternative Gas Supply Study was deleted from the project scope and is being
undertaken under a separate initiative aimed at identification of future gas sector projects financed by the
Danish Govemment.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.4.1  The ICR evaluates the quality at entry as satisfactory. The Rapid Quality at Entry Assessment
gave an overall rating of satisfactory, with a rating of good for the project concept, objectives and
approach, a rating of satisfactory for technical, economic and financial analyses, environment analyses,
readiness for implementation, project assessment, and Bank inputs and processes, and a rating of marginal
for social and stakeholder analysis, institutional capacity analysis, and risk assessment and sustainability.
This was an emergency project prepared on the basis of a single mission in January 1996 almost
immediately after the signing of the Dayton agreement and intended to become effective by mid-I 996.
However, negotiations were delayed until April 1997 and Board presentation until December 1997 pending
- 3 -



the establishment of satisfactory gas import and transit contracts. The project was part of a package of
three projects (including also the Emergency District Heating Project - Trust Fund Credit 024034 - and the
Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project - Credit 2903-BOS) that were designed to, inter alia,
restore full energy services to Sarajevo. Although Board presentation was delayed, the Bank was still able
to provide early financing through an innovative "Project Start-up Advance" of US$5 million from the
Credit for the Emergency District Heating Project, which was approved by the Executive Directors on May
2, 1996. The great importance given to the project by the citizens of Sarajevo is demonstrated by the
substantial amount of voluntary labor they contributed to dig the channels for gas distribution piping. The
Bank rightly identified from the start the two principal issues: first, the need to establish secure gas import
and transit arrangements; and second, the difficulties consumers could have in paying gas bills until the
economy revived and their incomes were raised above very low post-war levels. The handling of these
issues at entry was satisfactory. The Bank was right to wait until satisfactory import and transit
arrangements were made before approving the project. The project was designed to reduce gas losses and
waste, thereby reducing the cost to consumers. The Bank accepted, realistically, that it would be several
years before consumers would be able to pay the full costs of gas service, but, at the same time, insisted on
actions to gradually improve revenue collection.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1 The overall outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. There was a delay of approximately
two years (from January 24, 1996-December 23, 1997) between project appraisal and Board approval due
to the lack of a sound long-term contract for gas supply and transit arrangements (see Section 3.1).
However, during this period, the funds available in the PSA from the Emergency District Heating Project
were spent, as was much of the confinancing. IDA funds became available upon project effectiveness in
April, 1997 and the project closed on schedule on July 31, 1999. The project met all of-its physical
objectives by the closing date and there was progress - albeit not sufficient to comply with key financial
covenants - towards the financial and institutional objectives under difficult post-war circumstances. All
facilities rehabilitated under the project are operating satisfactorily and Sarajevogas, together with the
Government of Sarajevo Canton, is making efforts to continue to improve the financial and institutional
performance of the sector (see Section 4.5 Institutional Development Impact). The economic rate of return
is 37%, which is well above BiH's cost of capital (around 15%).
4.2 Outputs by components:
4.2.1  The project consisted of the following components: (a) engineering analysis of the gas
transmission and distribution system; (b) physical reconstruction of the transmission system; (c) physical
reconstruction of the distribution system; (d) technical assistance; (e) billing and collection software and
hardware; (f) land mine clearing; and (g) alternative gas supply study.
The following outputs were achieved per component:
(a) engineering analvsis of the gas transmission and distribution system: This component included local
and foreign expert services for analyzing the transmission and distribution systems using smart pig
analysis. The findings of the analysis were used as a basis for estimating the physical reconstruction
requirements of the transmission and distribution systems. The component output is rated satisfactory.
(b) physical reconstruction of the transmission system: This component was fully completed in 1998 and
- 4 -



included the following: (i) reconstruction of the gas pipeline between Zvornik and Sarajevo, including
landslide stabilization equipment and installation of chromatographs for the gas quality control; (ii)
rehabilitation of the Sarajevo city gate stations in Hum and Butila and (iii) construction of the metering
station and supporting infrastructure in Kladanj on the inter-entity border between the Federation of BiH
and Republika Srpska. The component output is rated satisfactory.
(c) physical reconstruction of the distribution system: This component was fully completed in 1999 and
included the following: (i) reinstallation of 300 meters and regulators for large consumers; (ii) rehabilitation
of 11,000 metering and regulating sets (MRS) in pre-war household connections; (iii) installation of 47,000
new MRS for individual consumers; and (iv) replacement of 300 km of distribution gas pipeline.
Completion of the component ensured that all consumers were equipped with metering and regulating units,
resulting in increased security and efficiency of gas usage and an improved basis for billing and collection.
The component output is rated highly satisfactory.
(d) technical assistance: This component included the Gas Sector Restructuring Study, the Tariff Study
and the Billing and Collection Study and partial financing of the 1997 and 1998 audits of company and
project accounts. The Gas Sector Restructuring Study, the Tariff Study and the Billing and Collection
Study have been completed. The key recommendations in the studies are as follows: Gas Sector
Restructuring Study: (i) enact a single law at the State level for the sector with a single State-level
regulatory agency, (ii) create one (or more) gas transmission company(ies) which would be licensed to
transport gas and possibly supply gas through legally separated subsidiaries; (iii) create gas distribution
companies which would be licensed to supply gas in defined geographic areas; and (iv) allow gas supply
companies to be formed which would be licensed to supply gas direct to eligible large consumers. Tariff
Study: (i) a cost-based tariff adjustment program should be introduced that, inter alia, gradually increases
the tariff to residential consumers and reduces the tariff to industrial and commercial users and the district
heating enterprise; and (ii) tariffs to the residential and commercial segments should be structured with a
fixed annual or monthly fee and a fixed fee, a capacity charge and a variable charge to the industrial users
and the district heating enterprise. Billing and Collection Study: (i) all meters in the distribution system
should be owned and operated by Sarajevogas; (ii) incentive payments should be made to staff who detect
and report illegal connections; (iii) meters should be read every three months whilst billing should be on a
monthly basis and the meter-reading/billing gap should be reduced to one-two days; (iv) the monthly bill
should include amounts unpaid from previous periods; (v) pre-payment meters should be considered for
customers with severe payment problems (these meters are expensive but a fixed charge could be imposed
to recover the cost of the meters over a number of years). The studies are being used to implement reform
and institutional development, tariff and billing and collection improvement measures in the sector. The
component output is rated satisfactory.
(e) billing and collection software and hardware: The scope of this component was reduced to focus on a
study for improving billing and collection performance since the billing and collection system was upgraded
and integrated by Sarajevogas using its own funds and UN Trust Fund resources prior to project start. The
component output is rated as only modest due to Sarajevogas' relatively poor achievements in revenue
collection (see section 4.5 Institutional Development Impact).
(f) land mine clearing: This component was reduced in scope when more accurate estimates of the affected
areas became available. The component was fully completed in 1998 and is rated satisfactory.
(g) alternative gas supRlv study. The Alternative Gas Supply Study was removed from the scope of this
project and is being undertaken under a separate initiative focused on identifying new projects in the gas
sector. The study began after project completion and is expected to be completed in June 2000.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
4.3.1  Calculations were made of the economic benefits and costs following the same approach as was
used in the Technical Annex (November 13, 1997). The starting point is the assumption that, in the
absence of the project, consumers would continue to use irregular gas connections. The benefits of the
project were taken to be: (i) avoided costs of new or replaced irregular connections; (ii) avoided gas
transmission and distribution losses; (iii) avoided costs from gas explosions; (iv) avoided uneconomic
consumption of gas due to the introduction of meters and regulators; and (v) the avoided cost of substitute
energy that would be needed if the irregular connection system had to be shut down for safety reasons
because of the danger posed by ever greater leaks over time. Costs were taken as the total project cost less
the cost of studies. Since the cost of studies was small this meant that 990/o of the project cost was included
(compared to 92% in the Technical Annex). The cost and benefit estimates exclude indirect taxes and
import duties. Shadow prices were not used for the foreign exchange rate or wage rates since the original
calculations did not use shadow prices.
4.3.2 The recalculated internal rate of return is 37% compared to the original 30%. The higher return is
due almost entirely to a higher benefit for the avoided cost of alternative energy (heating oil for space
heating and LPG for cooking). The original analysis assumed that the cost of heating oil would fall from
US$0.34/liter to US$0.27/liter, in line with prices in neighboring countries. This failed to happen, and the
ex-post analysis used the actual price of US$0.36/liter.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
4.4.1 There was no Financial Rate of Return (FRR) calculated for this project.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.5.1  Sarajevogas' operations were severely affected by the war damages and the proliferation of
unauthorized connections following the shutdown of large parts of the district heating system. By order of
the City Government, consumers did not have to pay for their gas consumption during the war.
Sarajevogas continued to operate its facilities during the war, but incurred substantial losses, which were
financed mainly through non-payment to creditors, notably Gazexport (see Section 3.1.4).
4.5.2  A key problem facing Sarajevogas is the lack of collection of sufficient revenue. Although direct
payments from consumers themselves have improved (from 32% of total billings in 1997 to 47% in 1998
and 55% in 1999), total collections (including subsidies from the Canton Government) have actually
deteriorated from 75% in 1997 to 70% in 1998. Collections remained at the 1998 level in 1999. Although
disconnection of non-paying consumers is technically possible, Sarajevogas' has been hesitant to disconnect
due to the loss of sales implied. In addition, there has been significant political pressure not to disconnect
consumers. Key reasons for the unsatisfactory revenue collection are a lower than anticipated increase in
direct payments from consumers and an overall reduction in Canton Government assistance. Revenue
collection from the Toplane District Heating Enterprise remains particularly problematic. Approximately
35%-40% of gas sales are sold to Toplane, yet the annual collection rate (including subsidies from the
Canton Government) remains at less than 50%. The reason for the poor payment by Toplane is its own
difficulty with revenue collection. Toplane's customer base comprises 90% households living in apartment
buildings, many of which are among the poorest segment of the population and often refugees.
4.5.3  At the time of project appraisal it was recognized that Sarajevogas would only gradually be able to
-6 -



achieve full cost recovery. A financial covenant measuring revenue collected as a percentage of total
annual cash operating expenses was agreed to in order to track progress towards cost recovery.
Sarajevogas complied with the covenant in 1997 but was unable to meet the 1998 and 1999 targets.
1997                  1998                  1999

4.5.4 To improve its collection performance, Sarajevogas has initiated a number of measures, including
aggressive legal action, increasing the number of payment points through the establishment of consumer
centers, and disconnections of non-paying consumers. Furthermore, it is working with the Canton
Government to implement additional measures identified in the Billing and Collection Improvement Study,
including targeted Cantonal assistance to consumners with payment difficulties and more efficient
procedures for taking non-paying consumers to court.
4.5.5  Sarajevogas complied with the financial covenant to have entity and project accounts audited each
year. In its Management Letter, the auditors stressed that the unfavorable relationship between the gas
selling price (Pf3O/m3 for households and the Toplane District Heating Enterprise, which together account
for 80% of gas sales) and the gas purchasing price (Pf23/m3), along with poor revenue collections, are the
key reasons for Sarajevogas' weak financial performance.
4.5.6  Performance with respect to financial and institutional objectives is rated as modest.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
5.1.1  A factor that very positively affected the outcome of the physical objectives under the project was
the volunteer labor by Sarajevo's citizens to assist in the installation of gas piping valued at US$9.1
million. Their contribution had a substantial impact on the project as it contributed substantially to the
project financing plan and facilitated quick project implementation (15 months from effectiveness).
5.1.2  Key factors outside Government and Sarajevogas' control that negatively affected the outcome of
the financial and institutional objectives were lower than expected gas sales and poorer than expected
revenue collection. At the time of appraisal, gas consumption in 1998 and 1999 had been estimated to be
190 million m3 and 200 m3, respectively. However, actual gas consumption in 1998 and 1999 was 125
m3 and 182 m3, respectively, resulting in less revenue for gas sales than anticipated. This proved
problematic since the average costs (including fixed costs) per m3 sold rose as a result. At the time of
project appraisal, it was recognized that households would only gradually be able to fully pay for their gas
consumption. However, their ability to pay remained poorer than anticipated and Sarajevogas continued to
rely on Government subsidies to make up for shortfalls in revenue collection from household consumers
and the Toplane District Heating Enterprise in particular (see Sections 4.5 Institutional Development
Impact and 5.3 Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control).
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
5.2.1  Three key factors that negatively affected the outcome of the project and which were subject to
Government control were: (i) delay in finalizing a sound long-term gas supply contract, including credible
payment mechanisms, with Gazexport and problems associated with transit of gas through the Federal
- 7 -



Republic of Yugoslavia. This resulted in delayed project processing as the Bank decided to postpone
Board presentation of the Credit until such a contract and the transit arrangements were in place; (ii)
despite several requests by Sarajevogas to the Canton Government to raise gas tariffs to cost-recovery
levels, tariffs remained below cost-recovery levels resulting in net losses each year which are rapidly
undermining Sarajevogas' financial viability; and (iii) allowing an inordinately high gas purchasing price to
be charged within Bil in which gas transit charges completely lack transparency.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
5.3.1   A key factor which very positively affected the outcome of the physical objectives under the project
was the staffing of the PIU with some of Sarajevogas' most experienced staff. This ensured timely
implementation of project components within the original closing date, despite a significant delay in project
effectiveness.
5.3.2   However, much less progress than anticipated was made in achieving the project's financial and
institutional objectives. Part of the reason for this is insufficient management attention to financial
performance of the enterprise. Although it is recognized that circumstances were difficult following the
war, initial lack of monitoring and control of revenue collection resulted in a deterioration in overall
revenue collection from billings. This resulted in non-compliance with the key financial covenant, revenue
collected as a percentage of cash operating expenses in 1998 and 1999 (see Section 4.5 Institutional
Development Impact).
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
5.4.1   At the time of appraisal, the project was estimated to cost US$43.55 million equivalent, of which
US$10 million was to be financed by IDA. Actual project expenditures have been 7.5% less than the
appraisal estimate due to a reduction in scope regarding household appliances for gas heating and cooling,
billing and collection system hardware and software and the removal of the Alternative Gas Supply Study
from the project.
5.4.2  Other changes to the project costs were: there was less spending required for the engineering
analysis component than anticipated (US$1.3 million compared to US$1.9 million) by using more local
expert services. Furthermore, this analysis led to the conclusion that the transmission line was in better
shape than anticipated at appraisal, thus less spending (US$6.4 million versus US$7.11 million) was
required to reconstruct the transmission system. However, greater spending was required for
reconstruction of the distribution component than anticipated (US$32.2 million versus US$30.3) due to the
need to procure a greater number of metering and regulating sets than anticipated. Forty-seven thousand
new metering and regulating sets were installed during project implementation compared to the 42,000
estimated at the time of project appraisal and another 11,000 metering and regulating sets were repaired.
Less spending was required for the studies carried out under the technical assistance cornponent (US$0.4
million rather than US$ 1.1 million) and the billing and collection component (US$0.03 million rather than
US$0.6 million). The reason less spending was required for the latter is that Sarajevogas, using its own
funds and aid funding from the UN, re-established the billing and collection system prior to project
effectiveness and only the Billing and Collection Improvement Study was carried out under this component
using project funds. The landmine clearing comnponent had to be completed by foreign experts as no local
firms were able to secure the required license to carry out the work at the time. This resulted in the entire
project component cost being a foreign cost, as opposed to a local cost as estimated at the time of project
appraisal. Less spending was required than anticipated (US$0.23 million rather than US$0.3 million).
There was no need to utilize the project cost contingencies of US$1.45 million.

5.4.3  Due to the emergency nature of projects in BiH, funds had to be mobilized very quickly. As a result, Regional
Management decided to create Project Start-up Advances (PSAs) . The PSAs permitted funds to be made available
to three emergency energy projects before Board approval and effectiveness. A PSA for the Emergency Natural
Gas Project (US$5 million) was included in the Emergency District Heating Project, which became effective in
July 1996. This allowed disbursements to be made to the Gas Project before it became effective.
Arrangements were made to allow the District Heating Project to withdraw amounts equal to the PSA from the
Gas Project Credit when it became effective. The PSA for the Gas Project closed on March 31, 1998, less than one
month before the Credit became effective. In addition to the PSA, two Dutch Trust Funds administered by the Bank
were used to help settle the Federation's October 1995 interim contract debts to Gazexport (Dutch TF 20875; US$4.7
million and Dutch TF 20876; US$6 million).
5.4.4 Cofinancing, primarily from the EU, the Governments of the UK and the Netherlands, amounted to US$16.2
million compared to the appraisal estimate of US$21.59 million.
The reduction in available cofinancing from other donors forced an increase in the contribution from Sarajevogas,
the Canton of Sarajevo and Sarajevo's citizens (through voluntary labor) to US$14.73 million compared to the
appraisal estimate of US$11.96 million.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationaleforsustainability rating:
6.1.1 It is likely that the achievements of the project will be sustained. Sarajevogas has demonstrated the
technical ability to reconstruct, upgrade and operate the gas transmission and distribution systemn by
successfully implementing the project. With proper maintenance and operating practices, the reconstructed
facilities will be productive for many years. However, a key requirement for the viability of Sarajevogas -
and the gas sector as a whole - is a significant improvement in cost recovery by improving revenue
collection and reducing operating costs, particularly the cost of gas. Revenue collection improvement
measures such as aggressive legal action, increasing the number of payment points through the
establishment of consumer centers, disconnections, targeted Cantonal assistance to consumers with
payment difficulties and more efficient procedures for taking non-paying consumers to court should all help
improve the revenue collection performance. Much improved financial monitoring and control by the
management of the company is required. However, the basis for these measures has been laid under the
project. In addition, the Government of BiH needs to launch a major restructuring program which will
ensure a viable gas sector with transparent and reasonable pricing policy, including the implementation of
recommendations of the Gas Tariff and the Gas Sector Restructuring Studies. The Alternative Gas Supply
Study currently being undertaken should be helpful in identifying options for decreasing the cost of natural
gas to Bosnia and Herzegovina and establishing more secure and reliable gas supply.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
6.2.1 The project has been fully integrated into the regular operations of Sarajevogas and all facilities are
operating satisfactorily. To further improve the performance of the sector, additional investments in the
following areas are planned: (i) additional repairs to the main 50 bar pipeline from Zvornik to Sarajevo;
(ii) implementation of a design hardware and software system (TERMS), for the 8 bar distribution line in
Sarajevo, allowing complete monitoring of the pipeline; (iii) replacement of selected valves on the 8 bar
pipeline to prevent gas leakage; (iv) implementation of the key recommendations in the Gas Tariff Study
and the Gas Sector Restructuring Study, including drafting of a State Law for the natural gas sector and
creation of gas sector regulatory framework; (v) improvement in management information systems and
-9-



organizational structure within Sarajevogas, including better monitoring and control of financial matters;
(vi) implementation of a remote monitoring and control system for gas supply.
6.2.2 The following key monitoring indicators will be used by Sarajevogas: (i) reduction in gas
distribution losses; (ii) improved safety in the gas distribution system measured by a reduction in gas
explosions and accidents; (iii) improved collection rates; and (iv) gas purchase and sales price based on
cost-recovery.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
7.1.1  The Bank's performance in the lending phase is rated as satisfactory. The Bank responded very
quickly to the Borrower's request for emergency reconstruction and took the lead role among donors to
identify, prepare and appraise the project during a confusing and difficult time in BiH. Bank involvement
served as a catalyst for financing by other donors.
7.1.2  The Bank worked very quickly to help the Borrower prepare the project and, through its rigorous
approach, was able to highlight key institutional issues that needed to be resolved, such as the need for a
sound, long-term contract, with a viable payment mechanism, for natural gas. The Bank took a leading
role in assisting the Borrower to renegotiate such a contract with Gazexport. The Bank team also helped
obtain donor funds to settle gas payment arrears, a prerequisite for Gazexport to resume gas supply to Bill
again.
7.2 Supervision:
7.2.1  Given the need for close Bank supervision of this project, a Bank consultant in the Resident
Mission assisted the Borrower with day-to-day project issues. This helped the project get off the ground
and allowed it to be implemented within a relatively short period of time. Through its supervision efforts,
the problems with financial cost-recovery were addressed early on and stressed to the Canton Government
and the implementing agency. Based on the Bank's recommendation, a study was included under the
project on how to improve billing and collection performance. The study results are now being
implemented by Sarajevogas, with strong support and involvement by the Canton Government, as
appropriate. The Bank's performance in the supervision phase is rated as satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
7.3.1   Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.4.1  The Borrower's performance in the preparation phase is rated as satisfactory. By the time of Bank
involvement in the post-war gas sector, the implementing agency (Sarajevogas) had already prepared an
assessment of emergency reconstruction investments required in the gas transmission and distribution
system in BiHL In addition, some donor funding had already been secured by the Government of BiHl to
undertake urgent repair work. Sarajevogas's assessment of investment requirements was very useful in
-10-



designing the objectives and scope of the Emergency Natural Gas System Reconstruction Project.
Although much technical data had been destroyed during the war, Sarajevogas made all the necessary staff
available to provide information and background as needed to the Bank team. Both the Government and
the implementing agency demonstrated strong commitment to the overall reconstruction of the gas sector
and this particular project itself
7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.5.1  The Canton Governments implementation performance is rated as satisfactory. The Canton
Government remained committed to the reconstruction effort through the project cycle and is currently
working alongside the implementing agency in improving the financial performance of the sector and
Sarajevogas through, inter alia, targeted subsidy schemes. More attention is required from the Canton
Government on improving the financial position of Sarajevogas, particularly with regards to cost-recovery
based tariffs and a transparent and economical gas purchase price.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.6.1  The implementing agency's performance with regard to the physical components is rated as
satisfactory. The implementing agency demonstrated strong skills in the preparation and implementation of
the project's physical components. Project management, cooperation with foreign experts, and coordination
with the Bank were undertaken in a competent and reliable manner by Sarajevogas PIU, including excellent
record keeping. However, Sarajevogas' performance with regards to the other institutional aspects of the
project is rated as modest as a result of inadequate monitoring and control of the financial performance of
the company, particularly revenue collection.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
7.7.1  Overall Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory
8. Lessons Learned
8.1 The key lessons learned are the following:
(a) The project demonstrated that a strong PIU within the beneficiary can bring about successful and
timely project implementation. Factors contributing to the effectiveness of the PIU were: (i) appointment
of highly qualified staff to manage the PIU; (ii) adequate quality, quantity and continuity of staff; and (iii)
sufficient autonomy.
(b) Adequate attention needs to be provided to financial and institutional objectives under emergency
projects to ensure these are achieved. This requires the involvement of Government in identifying how it
can best help achieve these objectives and its support for the overall financial and institutional development
of the imnplementing agency.

3/ Losses of 4.7% in 1997 and 5.8% in 1998 and after of household consumption valued at import
prices plus O&M of US$0.16/m3 in 1997, $0.171m3 in 1998 and $0.151m3 in 1999 and 2000.
4/ Damages from 28 explosions per year repaired at a cost of $71,000/building damaged.
The 1997 total is lower since only 1/3 of the connections were regularized by the project.
5/ extra consumption is assumed to be 43% of household consumption of 22 million m3 in 1997,
58.7 million m3 in 1998, and 97 million m3 in 1999 and 2000. The 1997 number is the estimated
consumption of metered consumers. The cost of the extra consumption was valued at the import
price plus O&M. the benefit was valude at 1/4 of the extra consumption times the retail price of
$0.12/m3. The net cost is the difference between the cost and the benefit.
61 The estimate is equal to the difference between the cost of heating with oil/LPG and the cost of
heatina with aas (Column 8 minus Column 5 in the table on comparison of heating options).

ANNEX 8: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
Introduction
1.   The natural gas system  in Bosnia and Herzegovina is comprised of the
transportation pipeline, transporting the gas from Russia, and several distribution
systems, mainly for the supply of the city of Sarajevo, Zenica Steelworks and minor
consumers along the pipeline. 117 km transmission pipeline and 65 km branch to Zenica
were designed for the supply of 1,200 million m3/year. The consumption peaked in 1990
and was 610 million m3/year. The gas system construction was financed by the World
Bank in 1975 through Loan 1264 - YU in the amount of US$ 8 million for the air
pollution control project for Sarajevo. Today in Bosnia and Herzegovina, this system
supplies mainly Sarajevo, where natural gas has become the main energy source, and the
industrial consumption in Kakanj and Zenica is still considerably smaller. As a war
effect, the number of household connections in Sarajevo has gone up to the current
58,000 from the prewar 15,000. Additionally, District Heating in Sarajevo is fueled by
gas, supplying 36,000 households and the major part of public institutions. The war
actions caused destruction of the whole gas system, mines were planted around the
transmission pipeline and the number of clandestine technically-incorrect connections
was exceptionally increased in households, causing frequent explosions leading to serious
injuries and often deaths of users of the gas installations. During the war, and more
intensively after the Dayton Agreement had been signed, the gas system was rehabilitated
under the Emergency Natural Gas Sector Reconstruction Project financed by IDA Loan
(Loan 3029 BOS, TF 24026) and under parallel financing of project components by IRC
- USA, EU, Holland, Denmark, Turkey, ODA of Great Britain, the Sarajevo Canton, the
Sarajevo citizens and some other donors.  This final implementation report is a report
prepared by the Borrower on finishing the Project, the closing date for which was 31st of
July 1999.
Project Goals
2.   The utmost project goal was safe and reliable gas supply of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, especially of Sarajevo, through the reconstruction of gas transportation and
distribution systems. This encompasses the rehabilitation of transmission pipeline,
distribution network and connections of large consumers, Toplane included. Another
goal was to increase energy and system efficiency and reduce environment pollution by
the replacement of makeshift gas connections with the connections performed according
to industrial standards. This included the installation of new metres and regulators on
42,000 connections, repairs to meters and regulators on other connections and
replacement of the makeshift burners and heating and cooking devices for the low
income families. Further goals are to increase the return on costs, strengthen KJKP
Sarajevogas institutional capacity, and to identify alternative gas supply/delivery sources.
The Project also covered repairs to the transmission facilities in the RS territory.
Achievement of Project Goals
3.   The Emergency Natural Gas System Reconstruction Project achieved the majority
of its main goals. The goals were achieved in a satisfying manner and new bases were



ANNEX 8: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
created for safe operation and professional maintenance, which is also a basis for further
gas system development.
Project comprised several components:
(i) Engineering analysis of the overall gas transmission and distribution systems -
component A;
(ii) Transmission system physical reconstruction (except for transmission pipeline
Semizovac-Zenica) - component B;
(iii) Distribution system physical reconstruction - component C;
(iv) Technical assistance for KJKP Sarajevogas with Project implementation and the
upgrading of the management, technical, commercial capacity  aspects and
finances -components D and E;
(v)  Mine clearance and preparation of a study for alternative gas supplies -components
F and G;
(vi) Project reserve -component H.
Of which the following has been realized:
Package A. - Engineering Component has been completed including foreign and local
expert services for smart pigging on the 50 bar Zvornik-Sarajevo pipeline, smart pigging
on the 8 bar high pressure ring in Sarajevo, analysis of 3 and 0.1 bar distribution
networks. All the findings were used as a basis for the procurement planning and repairs
to damages on the gas system. This component was contributed to by Verbundnetz Gas
AG, Leipzig, Germany, whose engagement and donation completed this part of the task.
Package B. - Gas Transmission system component has been completed including
Zvornik - Sarajevo gas pipeline reconstruction and its accompanying installation,
landslide stabilization, installation of chromatographs for the gas quality control,
rehabilitation of the city gate stations in Sarajevo (Hum and Butila), construction of the
metering station and accompanying infrastructure in Kladanj on the inter-Entity border
between the Republika Srpska and the BiH Federation.
Package C - Gas distribution system component was completed including procurement,
gauging and re-installation of 300 metres and regulators for large consumers, gauging
and replacement of 11,000 metering-regulating units, procurement of 47,000 new MRS
sets for individual consumers, replacement on 300 km of inadequate distribution gas
pipeline. This meant that the majority of the consumers in Sarajevo were equipped with
metering-regulating units, which increased security in using gas, economical
consumption and collection based on consumption, which prevented the waste of gas, and
avoided the use of gas under different conditions (subsidies for consumption for those
using more gas through flat rate collection).
Package D. - Technical assistance components are financed only partly from IDA Loan

prepared. The Study is being implemented and it includes the construction of LPG
facilities which will be used for peak shaving of daily and weekly consumption.
Implementation is based on a "Joint Venture" arrangement between Sarajevogas and
Plena Luxemburg.
Implementation course and main factors affecting the Project
4.   Sarajevogas demonstrated an exceptional technical ability  in the Project
implementation by staffing PIU Gas with its most experienced experts. Such an approach
resulted in an efficient realization of the Project and within the deadlines fixed by the
Agreement.  This was certainly achieved due to the timely preparation for the
reconstruction, which had started back in 1993 by the implementation of donors' projects,
definition of the Reconstruction Project and gas system development, preparation of
distribution network projects for the areas which did not have gas, preparation of
databases, etc. Reconstruction and Development Programme was developed during the
war, in April 1994, and was offered as a basis for the gas system reconstruction to donors
and financial institutions. Part of the Programme was implemented in the course of the
war through the UN Trust Fund set up by the UN Special Coordinator for Sarajevo
(SCS). Sarajevogas at the time implemented a number of projects which contributed to
security of the gas system and prevention of its further decay.
5.   Assistance projects were financed by several Middle East countries, Great Britain,
Holland and the USA. Implementation was primarily coordinated by Sarajevogas with
its considerable participation in the implementation itself, and with the Sarajevo citizens
themselves in civil engineering works. Some projects were financed by the
municipalities, too.  The projects financed by donors in this phase included the
replacement of about 10,000 makeshift connections and installation of about 200 km of
network, significant reconstruction of city metering-regulating stations Hum, works on
the cathodic protection of the system with steel pipes in the city, as well as delivery of a
significant number of heating and cooking devices. Early 1996, the Programme was
offered to the World Bank as a comprehensive programme, when the World Bank
decided to finance part of the Programme under the Emergency Natural Gas
Reconstruction Project. The Project was accepted in its original form in total amount of
US$ 43.5 million, of which US$ 10 million was IDA Loan. Advance payment for the
works opening under the World Bank Project in the amount of US$ 5 million was
approved for Sarajevogas on 1st April 1996 to enable the financing of urgent repairs
before the Agreement became effective, and the resources started to be used as of 8th
October 1996 as TF24026. Agreement for US$ 10 million was conditioned by the
renewal of gas delivery by the Russian supplier Gaspromet which was cut off, owing to
the debts from the previous period, from April - November 1997. When the debts were
settled, gas supplies were re-established and Agreement was signed for the
EMERGENCY NATURAL GAS SYSTEM RECONSTRUCTION. The Agreement for



ANNEX 8: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
the amount of US$ 10 million was signed on 20 January 1998, funds were effective on 17
April 1998, while the "closing date" was 31 July 1999.
6.   Financing was continued parallel from donors' funds provided by EU, the
governments of Holland, Denmark, Turkey, Great Britain, the Sarajevo Canton,
Sarajevogas, the citizens of Sarajevo, and some other donors. The other donors were:
Cities: Ankara, Modena, Bolzano, Barcelona, Brescia, and Istanbul;
Non-governmental organizations: Qatar Relief Fund, Saudi Arabia/IRC, USAID,
IRC, MDD Merhamet, IIHO,
States: Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Egypt;
Foreign gas companies: Gastec-Holland, EGO and IGDAS - Turkey and
VerbundnetzNG-Germany.
7.  IDA Fund was mainly used to supplement donor components, so that IDA sources
were closely related to the implementation of the co-financed projects. In April 1996
PIU Gas was set up, organized for the implementation of the Emergency Natural Gas
System Reconstruction Project.  PIU Gas in association with the World Bank, in
compliance with the World Bank procedures, in a 15-month period, realized 42 contracts
for equipment, works and services. In equipment procurement, 12 foreign and 12 local
companies were engaged. For the works, 1 foreign and 10 local contractors were
engaged. For services, 7 foreign companies were engaged.
Project sustainability
8.   This Project of Emergency Natural Gas Reconstruction stopped further destruction
of the BiH gas system and created conditions for further operation and maintenance.
However, for the improvement of the gas system, several facts need to be assessed, which
refer to the environment and conditions for business running. In spite of the fact that the
Project was realized with exceptional efforts on the part of the management and all
Sarajevogas staff members, with the engagement of local and foreign experts, the
financial situation in Sarajevogas is approaching its critical point. Revenue from
collection has remained a big problem, so that total revenue makes loss and losses are
made in further operating; as losses are not covered, this continues to rapidly destroy
Sarajevogas assets.  Additionally, Sarajevogas lacks costs coverage due to inadequate
ratio between purchase and sales gas prices. Current tariffs cannot cover operational costs
related to gas sales. As a result, every year Sarajevogas suffers substantial losses both in
operation and in assets. Gas interruption risk eased by the conclusion of long-term
agreements with Gazexport and transport companies in Hungary, the FRY and the
Republika Srpska respectively. Unless urgent measures are taken to improve financial
operations, this condition will result in new interruptions of gas supplies for the whole of
BiH.
9.   Sarajevogas did take additional measures to improve collection by creating better
technical conditions and establishing closer relations with its consumers through
Consumers' Centers (three centers) and the "door collection". This resulted in instant
better collection from individual consumers. As for the rest of collection from Toplane,
Sarajevogas initiated solution to the problem via the Government of the Sarajevo Canton,
which also requires the support from the World Bank, both financially and institutionally.



ANNEX 8: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
Financial support would be the setting up of "Implementation Fund" for the study
implementation which would include, e.g., resources for the preparation of Gas Law at
the BiH state level and one-year operation of an independent Regulator for entire State.
Institutional support would be participation of the World Bank in negotiations between
the two Entities about the solutions leading to a higher transparency of the gas system
and separation of the gas industry from overwhelming influence of policy on the gas
industry operation.
Bank's effect
10. The World Bank completely satisfied the requirements of the situation in which
BiH found itself in the post war period and the status of the gas system, including
professionals and experts in all the Project phases, from the needs identification through
the assistance in the preparation of documents and approvals, and with adequate
monitoring contributed to the efficient implementation of the Project. Beside very
competent individuals in the function of the Sector Manager, Programme Leader, energy
and finance consultants, and gas specialists, the World Bank demonstrated particularly
prominent professionalism in the team work, as well as the competence to recognize
special features of the client. Its most prominent role was in training which it organized
in order to educate the Project Management and Procurement Management. It particularly
manifested competence in understanding the current needs and condition related to the
local situation expressed operationally through the assistance with preparation and timely
decisions concerning each demand. Our evaluation of the World Bank's effects in this
Project as excellent is supported also by the fact that they exceptionally contributed as
intermediary in the negotiations about the operation and maintenance of the part of the
pipeline in the RS territory, initiating solutions to the institutional differences, and
assistance with finding donors.
Borrower's effect
11.  Beside its technical ability in this Project, Sarajevogas succeeded in manifesting its
ability to assess the situation in which it found itself and to clearly define the needs, being
at any moment ready to adopt the world's best practice. In this Project, it also proved its
readiness to take on and execute the tasks in the agreed manner. The initial lack of
material resources was made up for by clear engineering approach and expertise in
Project management. Material conditions created, it also demonstrated the ability to
build, operate and maintain the gas system, which was its major role. Despite its growth,
Sarajevogas has had losses in financial operations, the reasons for which lie in depressed
sales gas prices, slow industry development, and consequently low paying ability of the
citizens as gas consumers. Sarajevogas has taken all measures to improve the billing and
collection system expecting further improvement. The basic expectations are in the
application of the solutions offered by the Studies, which should be supported by
institutional arrangements and better transparency un the BiH gas sector.
Outcome evaluation
12   The activities carried out under this Project raised the reliability of the gas
transmission and distribution systems to a satisfactory level thus preventing its further



ANNEX 8: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
decay. To keep the Project sustainable, additional measures should be considered, which
would enable firm operating and development of the gas system.
Future operation
13. The Project created satisfactory conditions for operation and maintenance of the
gas system. To maximize the results achieved, the following projects are thereby
proposed:
l.Main 50 bar gas pipeline Zvornik - Sarajevo: the whole pipeline 117 km long was
tested by Pipeline Integrity International, UK, and the Inspection Report stated all the
damaged spots. On the basis of this Report, an analysis was done by the experts of
Verbundenetz Gas AG, Germany and Sarajevogas, and the priority spots were repaired
within the resources available at the time. To repair further 20% priority spots on the 50
bar pipeline and to apply TERMS, it is necessary to provide US$ 0,5-0,6 million.
2. Steel 8 bar distribution pipeline in Sarajevo (High-Pressure Ring): (a) 8 bar pipeline:
Sarajevogas, in association with Transwave International, USA, did the measuring on 87
km 8 bar steel pipeline. The use of advanced computer TERMS monitoring systems was
recommended, which enables precise insight into the status of the pipeline, cathodic and
anti-corrosion protection, and signaling of all potential effects that could lead to the
destruction of the pipeline or insulation. To introduce TERMS (Designing, Hardware and
Software), it is necessary to provide US$ 0.4-0.5 million. (b) Valves on 8 bar pipeline:
Sarajevogas experts did the control of all 50 to 400 mm valves on the 8 bar pipeline in
the city of Sarajevo and confirmed that the majority of the valves leak. Parallel repairs
were done to the places where it was possible, but it is estimated that, after 20-year
exploitation, it would be necessary to replace about 40% of the existing valves 50 to 400
in this year in order to stop uncontrolled gas leakage. To procure valves and do the
excavating, it is necessary to provide US$ 0.4 - 0.6 million.
3. Restructuring and Tariff Study in the BiH natural gas sector - Implementation phase.
According to the results of the Studies, to create better (economic) conditions for
business, at the BiH level it is necessary to: Create a State law on natural gas and set up
an independent Regulatory Committee and regulation arrangements which would lead to
transparency in procurement, transmission and distribution of gas. Provided the first two
solutions are implemented, Tariff Study would help to resolve the issue of the gas price
by installing a mechanism which defines the gas price depending more on economy as
different from the current situation, when it is more policy related and to solving social
problems. Study "Implementation Fund" should cover the expenses for the creation of
State Gas Law, regulating arrangements and one-year independent work of the
Independent Regulatory Committee in the amount of US$ 0.5-07 million. Apart from
the financial support, the presence of the World Bank is necessary to play the role of a
mediator at the BiH level in the Study Implementation, in selection and implementation
of solutions, which can be done through the activity of the Independent Regulatory body
by delegating its representative.
4. Improvement of Sarajevogas business system (organization, information system and
QA). Project for the improvement of business system started in 1998 and it focused on



ANNEX 8: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
the internal organization, information system and assurance of quality. This Project's
feature is to deal with the causes of the effects of today's status. This Project's purpose is
to increase the overall Sarajevogas potentials and to establish coordinated activities in
Sarajevogas and with the environment, solving simultaneously both causes and effects. In
all the three quoted segments, there are the areas of which the most important is
permanent education and training of the employees and management. The respective
areas would be management, new technologies, communications, safety, use of
computers and networks, processes and procedures. To document the business system,
implementation of solutions and certification systems of independent and authorized
agencies, it is necessary to allocate US$ 0.3-0.4 million.
5. SDMNU - Remote Control System: Before the war, Sarajevogas had a remote control
system - telemetry, which was destroyed during the war. In the computer technology era,
natural gas supplying and remote control have been made optimal. The need to upgrade
the SDMNU is even greater because of LPG introduction in the Sarajevogas system. For
design, procurement of equipment and software, installation and training, investment of
US$ 2.0 - 3.0 million is required.
Indicators for monitoring the future operations:
1.   Technical - higher system reliability rate (reduce risk rate)
2.   Financial - collection rate
3.  Institutional and legal - creation and adoption of Gas Law, establishment of
independent Regulatory Committee, licences for purchase and sales of gas, transport and
distribution.
