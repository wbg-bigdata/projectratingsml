                         Overall progress on program implementation is satisfactory. The Program continues to provide critical support across all core areas of MOF. In State Finances, there has been good
                         progress in the implementation of Financial Management Information Systems upgrades; strengthening capital expenditure analysis; and strengthening medium-term budgeting. In

                         Revenue and Customs, there has been good progress since the PFMCBP Mid-Term Review in stabilizing core tax administration functions; customs clearance and post-clearance
                         audit. In Policy Analysis and Research there have been: improvements in data sources for macro modeling and analysis; increased analysis and reporting on revenue performance;
                         increased expenditure analysis and forecasting; and first provision of estimates of national accounts (2004 - 2010). Corporate Services have led a major process to develop the MOF
                         Strategic Plan, which will provide the basis for future TA support. Program management has improved over the past twelve months, particularly since the appointment of a Senior
                         Program Manager in November 2009. The team was further strengthened with the additional appointments in the areas of procurement and financial management.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Government in November 2010 requested an eighteen-month extension (July 2011 - December 2012) of the Program. The proposed extension is necessary to start the
                         implementation of MOF’s Strategic Plan (SP) which is fully aligned to the program results matrix and expected outcomes. This was discussed at the last PFMCBP Supervisory
                         Committee on 4 April 2011, and the extension is subsequently being processed.
