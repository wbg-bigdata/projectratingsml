                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1. The major changes to the project and rationale are the following:

   a) The Results Framework - including indicators, baseline, and targets – has been
      revised with updated available statistics to increase clarity and reduce repetition
      by improving the accuracy of indicator definitions and data.
   b) Proceeds have been reallocated to transfer resources not utilized by the states, the
      Federal District and municipalities by March 30, 2013 to the federal component
      (Component 3).
   c) The closing date has been extended by 21 months from March 30, 2013 to
      December 31, 2014 to allow the Government sufficient time for implementation
      and goal achievement of three new priority activities under Component 3 of the
      Project.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.     The Second Family Health Extension Project was approved by the Board on April
25, 2008 and declared effective on October 15, 2009. As of March 7, 2013 US$38.4
million (46 percent) have been disbursed. The Project represents the second Phase of the
seven-year US$ 550 million Family Health Extension APL Program (PROESF), which
was approved by the Bank’s Board in 2002 and is planned to be implemented in th ree
phases. Phase I was successfully completed on June 30, 2007.

3.      Consonant with the Program goals, the Project’s Development Objectives (PDOs)
are to: (i) increase access to family health-based primary care in large, urban
municipalities; (ii) raise the technical quality of and patient satisfaction with primary
care; and (iii) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of family health service providers
as well as the broader delivery system. The Project has three components: Component 1
– Expansion and consolidation of family health care in municipalities; Component 2 –
Strengthening state capacity for supervision, monitoring and technical support of family
health services and Component 3 – Strengthening federal oversight of the family health
program.

4.      The Project progress towards achieving its development objectives is rated
“Satisfactory?, and the overall implementation progress is rated “Moderately
Satisfactory?. The population coverage of the Government’s Family Health Program
(PSF) in participating municipalities increased from 36.4 percent in 2009 to 39.5 percent
in 2011 and the average coverage rate in those municipalities is higher than among non-
participating municipalities of similar size. Population coverage increased by 5 percent
per annum on average. One of the two PDOs – decrease of infant mortality per 1,000
births in participating municipalities – has already been achieved. Most of the
intermediate results indicators are on track or have been achieved, including the
establishment of a results-based management system at the federal level linking project

                                            6
finances to states and municipalities, establishing performance agreements, and almost
100 percent of states and municipalities participating in quality assessment programs.
Intermediate results already achieved by the Project include an increase in PSF teams
applying quality evaluation instruments from 7 percent in 2006 to 75 percent in 2011, and
an increase in the proportion of patients with hypertension registered by PSF teams from
23 percent (2006) to 51 percent (2012).

5.     While performance as measured by progress on Project indicators is good, the
slow execution of Project funds is a reason for concern. Project resources were especially
underutilized under Component 2 and Component 3. The reason for this is related to an
increase in the Government budget for the Department of Primary Care (DAB) of almost
40 percent under the current administration, as well as to an increase in funding at the
state and municipal levels. At the same time, the political environment fostered a
refocusing on primary health care, which in turn led to the development of new
programmatic priorities for primary care, including family health.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Monitoring and Results Framework

6.    The following changes have been made and the revised Monitoring and Results
Framework is included as Annex 1:

PDO Indicator Two (indicator revised; baseline and target revised). The indicator
measuring per capita contacts with primary care providers has been specified to include
not only doctors but also nurses in the definition of primary care providers. This
definition is in accordance with the one adopted by the Ministry of Health (MoH). The
baseline was corrected accordingly, using the best available data from the primary health
care information system (SIAB). The target for phase 2 (current phase) has been defined
as an increase of 5 percent compared to the baseline.

              Revised indicator: “Increase of per capita contacts with primary care
               providers (doctors and nurses) in participating municipalities?

           -   Baseline in PAD:               1.4 percent in 2003
           -   Target in PAD:                 N/AP1

           -   Baseline revised:              1.7 percent in 2003
           -   Target revised:                1.8 percent in 2014

      A. Component One:

Indicator Two (indicator revised). This indicator measures the percentage of registered
people with high blood pressure among the estimated hypertensive population aged 15
and older in participating municipalities of the year considered. The indicator was


1
    According to Table 3.1 on page 50 of the PAD, the target for phase 2 was not applicable (N/AP).
                                                      7
formally calculated as a ratio of these two groups and will now be calculated as a
proportion, to better align with the Government’s monitoring system.

          Revised indicator: “Proportion of patients with hypertension registered by
           PSF teams, among estimated population with hypertension (15 years of age
           and older)?

Indicator Three (indicator unchanged; baseline and target revised). This indicator
measures the vaccination coverage of DPT + Hib (tetravalent) in children less than one
year of age in the participating municipalities. The Brazilian vaccination program was
upgraded to a penta-, and hexavalent scheme. The indicator is hence calculated based on
the sum of completed tetra-, penta-, and hexavalent schemes in children below one year
of age.

          Original indicator from the PAD: “Percentage of infants < 1 with full
           vaccination regimen (DPT-H, polio, measles, tuberculosis)?

       -   Baseline in PAD:         71 percent in 2006
       -   Target in PAD:           85 percent in 2013

       -   Baseline revised:        100.8 percent in 2008
       -   Target revised :         ≥95 percent in 2014

Indicator Four (indicator revised; baseline revised). This indicator measures the
percentage distribution of women with live births, with 7 or more prenatal consultations
in participating municipalities. The baseline was updated based on actual data for 2006
from the SINASC information system.

          Revised indicator: “Percentage of women with live births, attended by PSF
           teams, that had 7 or more pre-natal consultations?

       -   Baseline in PAD:         53 in 2006
       -   Baseline revised:        60 percent in 2006

Indicator Eight (indicator revised) This indicator measuring the proportion of
municipalities applying quality evaluation instruments in the areas of PSF management
and coordination (AMQ parts 1&2) needed to be updated to reflect the evolution and
scale up of quality improvement instruments in Brazil. Besides AMQ 1&2, the system
now features two follow-on systems: AMAQ and PMAQ.

          Revised Indicator: “Proportion of municipalities that conduct self-
           assessment to improve access and quality of primary care?

The following Component 1 indicators have been dropped:

Former PDI (dropped). The indicator measuring the rate of hospital admissions of
children <5 for ARI in participating municipalities has been dropped. It was agreed that
this indicator is not adequately measuring the attainment of development goals. Both
                                           8
positive and negative changes to the indicator point at potential improvements in primary
health care, as envisioned by the Project.

Former PDI (dropped). For the same reason as above, the indicator measuring hospital
admissions for stroke in participating municipalities has been dropped.

   B. Component Two:

Indicator Nine (indicator revised; target revised). This indicator measuring the
percentage of states establishing performance agreements with eligible municipalities
with population smaller than 100,000 was revised to reduce unnecessary complexity.

          Revised indicator: “Proportion of states that establish performance
           agreements with at least 25% of municipalities <100,000 population?

       -   Target in PAD:            25 percent municipalities; 40 percent states in 2013
           Target revised:           40 percent of states in 2014

Indicator Eleven (indicator revised; target revised). This indicator measures the
percentage of municipalities with population smaller than 100,000 in eligible states
participating in the quality assessment program (AMQ), which includes self-assessment
and development of plans to address quality gaps. It was revised to reduce unnecessary
complexity and to transform it into a numeric indicator, eliminating ambiguity on how it
is being tracked over time. Further, AMQ has been replaced by follow-on systems,
AMAQ and PMAQ, which were implemented on a large scale. Hence, this indicator has
already been attained.

          Revised indicator: “Proportion of states with 10% of municipalities <100,000
           inhabitants that implemented self-assessment?

       -   Target in PAD:            10 percent municipalities; 50 percent states in 2013
       -   Target revised:           50 percent of states in 2014

   C. Component Three:

Indicator Fifteen (indicator revised; baseline and target revised). This indicator
which measures the proportion of primary health care teams that implement a results-
based management system has been updated to reflect the current development in results-
based management at the federal level, including the evolution of the AMQ system into
the new PMAQ system. The target was revised accordingly to better reflect continued
progress on this indicator.

       -   Revised indicator: “Proportion of family health teams participating in the
           Program of Improving Access and Quality (PMAQ-AB)?

       -   Baseline in PAD:          0 percent in 2006.
       -   Target in PAD:            model developed & tested in 2013

                                            9
        -    Baseline revised:              50 percent in 2011
        -    Target revised:                60 percent in 2014

Indicator Sixteen (new). This indicator will monitor the upgrading of information
systems and integrated data systems to support performance monitoring of primary health
care and the family health program.

        -    New indicator: “Proportion of participating municipalities that implemented
             the Health Information System for Primary Care (SIS-AB)?

        -    Baseline:              0 percent in 2011
        -    Target:               70 percent in 2014

Indicator Seventeen (new). This indicator will monitor the upgrading of primary care
units to units with Tele-health access points. These access points play a key role in
raising the technical quality of primary care and have a direct role in promoting continued
professional learning for family health professional across the Tele-health network.

            New indicator: “Proportion of primary care units (UBS) in participating
             municipalities that have a Tele-health access point?

        -    Baseline:              0 percent in 2011
        -    Target:               20 percent in 2014

The following Component 3 indicators have been dropped:

Former PDI (dropped). This indicator measuring the completion of at least three out of
six major research projects on PSF has become obsolete due to the fact that the
Government is funding research projects with its own resources.

Former PDI (dropped). For the same reason as above, the indicator monitoring the
preparation of an impact evaluation is dropped. The Government is funding the impact
evaluation of its major quality improvement initiative, PMAQ, with its own resources.
Furthermore, major research studies focusing on the Brazilian PSF have been carried out
and published by renowned research institutions.2 Therefore, the demand and need for
similar studies and evaluations funded with Project resources has diminished.

Former PDI (dropped). This indicator, which measures the development of a
proficiency test of PSF professionals, has become obsolete due to the introduction of the

Reallocation of Loan Proceeds

7.      Resources not utilized by the states, the Federal District and municipalities by
March 30, 2013 will be transferred to the federal Component (Component 3).
Municipalities and states underutilized available Project funds under Component 1 and 2
in part due to greater availability of own resources and are, therefore, not expected to
need Project funds in the future. Component 3 resources were used to co-finance the
International Seminar of Primary Care, which took place in July of 2012; however,
several studies planned under Component 3 were completed with the Government’s own
resources. The Government proposes that remaining Project resources be used for the
deployment of e-SUS-AB, financed under Component 3. This new programmatic priority
set by the Government is in accordance with the original PDO.

8. Proceeds will be reallocated as follows:

Extension of the Closing Date

9.       The closing date has been extended to December 31, 2014. This extension is
necessary to give the Government time to (i) achieve the PDO; (ii) consolidate the
activities under Component 3 after restructuring; (iii) successfully implement the new
activities introduced into the scope of the Project with the goal of improving health
information systems and continued professional learning across the family health
network; and to (iv) attain the data and information under the revised Monitoring and
Results Framework to ensure complete monitoring of targets by the extended closing
date.

10.     Most of the activities currently supported under Component 1 and 2 of the Project
will be completed by the original closing date on March 30, 2013. By then one PDO and
eight PDIs will already have been achieved. The 21 months extension will allow
implementation of the activities under Loan Agreement Schedule 1. Section 1.(e) and
Section 5.(c)/ Component 3, namely:

           a. Deploy the new electronic primary health care information system,
              designated as e-SUS-AB (e – Sistema Único de Saúde - Atenção Básica),
              in primary care units in nine regions of the QUALISUS Project
              (P088716).
           b. Boost the functionality of the care networks for people with chronic
              diseases by outfitting primary care units with Tele-health access and in-
              service training.
           c. Establish areas of cooperation and synergy between the QUALISUS and
              PROESF projects to optimize the implementation, exchange of
              experiences and to align Bank projects under the MoH.

11.    The restructuring does not trigger any new safeguard policies nor affect the
environmental safeguard rating of the Project.
