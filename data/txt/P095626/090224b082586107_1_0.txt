                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Second Family Health Extension Project (PROESF) was approved by the Board on April 25, 2008, signed on September 9, 2009 and became effective on October 15, 2009. As
                         of June 16, 2014 US$42.4 million or 51 percent of loan proceeds have been disbursed.

                         The population coverage by PROESF increased rapidly in the initial phase and continues to grow in the second phase, but at a slower rate (currently at 3.8 percent per annum). From
                         2009 to 2013, coverage in participating municipalities increased from 36.4% to 41.9% of the population (based on latest available verified data, December 2013), exceeding the post
                         restructuring target of 40%. Average coverage is higher among participating municipalities than non-participating ones.

                         One of the two Program outcome indicators - decrease of infant mortality per 1,000 live births in participating municipalities - has already been achieved. Most intermediate results
                         indicators (PDIs) are on track or have been achieved, including the establishment of a results-based management system at the federal level, linking finances to states and
                         municipalities, establishing performance agreements, and almost 100 percent of states and municipalities participating in quality assessment programs. Other intermediate results
                         already achieved include an increase in Family Health Program (PSF) teams applying quality evaluation instruments from 7 percent (2006) to 92.5 percent (April 2012), and an
                         increase in the proportion of patients with hypertension registered by PSF teams from 23 percent (2006) to 61 percent (December 2012).
