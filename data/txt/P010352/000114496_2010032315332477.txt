                      SCHEDULE 6
                   Special Accounts
1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:
     (a)  the term "eligible Categories" means the
Categories set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of
Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
     (b)  the term "eligible expenditures" means
expenditures in respect of the reasonable cost of goods
and services required for  the Project and to be financed
out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to
time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
     (c)  the term "Authorized Allocation" means in
respect of the NHB Special Account an amount equivalent
to $7,500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited into the NHB Special Account and in respect of
the PR Special Account an amount equivalent to
$10,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited into the PR Special Account, all pursuant to
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.   Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with
the provisions of this Schedule.
3.   After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to
it that the NHB Special Account or the PR Special Account
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish such
Special Account shall be made as follows:
     (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or
requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit in the NHB Special Account or the PR Special
Account, as the case may be, such amount or amounts as
the Borrower shall have requested.
     (b)  (i)  For replenishment of the Special Account,
               the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank
               requests for deposits into the Special
               Accounts at such intervals as the Bank
               shall specify.
          (ii) Prior to or at the time of each such
               request, the Borrower shall furnish to
               the Bank the documents and other evidence
               required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this
               Schedule for the payment or payments in
               respect of which replenishment is
               requested. On the basis of each such
               request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
               Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
               and deposit into the relevant Special
               Account such amount as the Borrower shall
Page  17
               have requested and as shall have been
               shown by said documents and other
               evidence to have been paid out of such
               Special Account for eligible
               expenditures. All such deposits shall be
               withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
               Account under the respective eligible
               Categories, and in the respective
               equivalent amounts, as shall have been
               justified by said documents and other
               evidence.
4.   For each payment made by NHB out of the NHB Special
Account or by PR out of the PR Special Account, the
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably
request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make
further deposits into the Special Accounts:
     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the
Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the General
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
     (b)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories, less the amount of
any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the
Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the
Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the
Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow
such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in
the Special Accounts as of the date of such notice will
be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the NHB Special Account or the PR
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an
amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional
evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the
relevant Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special
Accounts shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the NHB Special Account or
the PR Special Account will not be required to cover
further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the
Bank such outstanding amount.
     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in either of the Special Accounts.
Page  18
     (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to
the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
