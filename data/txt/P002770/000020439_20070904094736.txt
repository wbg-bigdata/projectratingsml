F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The original objective of the project was to support the Government's economic recovery
program by reducing transport costs and improving accessibility to economically
productive areas, primarily agriculture, tourism and mining.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
 While maintaining the original objective, the restructured project also had the following
additional objectives:

  - increase accessibility and mobility in rural areas.

  - Develop an efficient and viable transportation sector through the implementation of
sustainable improvements in the administration and coordination of Sector activities,



                                              ii

including organization, management, and financing of road infrastructure, and
improvement of management of road transport services.

  The rationale for the revised PDO was to enable the project support changes in the road
sector and commit some of the available resources to the emergency rehabilitation of
trunk and district road networks and bridges destroyed by the El-Nino induced flooding
and to support transport infrastructure rehabilitation in Zanzibar which had not been
included in the original project design. Furthermore, provide support for road
administration, particularly the newly established Road Agency TANROADS, and for
contract and financial management in the sector.

  No specific indicators were included as part of the revised PDO.

1. Project Context, Design and Development Objectives

1.1 Project Context

Background
The Second Integrated Roads Project (IRPII) was designed as a follow up operation to
the first Integrated Roads Project (IRPI). Both projects were meant to support the
Government's economic recovery program through the rehabilitation and upgrading of
important airports and road links. This ambitious multi-donor funded project of
US$ 650.3 million had a projected annual disbursement of US$ 130 million. The Bank's
planned contribution to the IRPII was US$ 170.2 million. Other Development Partners
(DP) who co-financed the project were: the European Economic Community (EEC),
African Development Bank (AfDB), Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation
(NORAD), Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Japan, Kuwait,
Swiss Development Corporation (SDC) and Finnish International Development Agency
(FINNIDA).

A summary of their financial commitments is in Annex 1(b) of this Implementation
Completion Report (ICR). The IRPII was conceived as one project, however, individual
donors, using a Government of Tanzania (GOT) list, identified activities they would
finance.

Project preparation was completed in 1993 and a Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and
Memorandum for the President (MOP) of the World Bank compiled in March of the
following year. The project received Board approval in April 1994 and became effective
the following year in February, with a planned implementation period of five years
(1994-1999).

The project survived several challenges - among them poor governance, inadequate
preparedness and a weak implementing capacity. After a review it was restructured in
August 1998. Funding was then reduced to US$100.2 million and its implementation
schedule extended several times. In June 2004, it was partially closed. In December 2006,
12 years after inception and delivery of 53% of the appraisal amount, the project was
finally closed. By then the overall IRPII program had disbursed US$ 669.82m. A
summary of the achievements of the works component is presented in Chapter 7 of this
ICR.

Among key achievements of the Bank funded project were the rehabilitation of road
infrastructure destroyed by the El Nino floods of 1997/98 and implementation of reforms
in the transport sector, despite government's slow pace. Tanzania Roads Agency
(TANROADS) which took over the responsibility of the project's execution and the Road
Fund Board (RFB) were amongst new institutions established by the year 2000. These
new institutions were critical in turning-around the transport sector and the project
performance. The project also disbursed over 90% of the approved funding after
restructuring.




                                                                                       1

This ICR summarizes the design, implementation and outcomes of the IRPII project.
Although reference has been made to the overall program (and the IRPI), the report is
limited to an assessment of the IDA financed component of the project.

Context at Appraisal
In 1986 the Government of Tanzania embarked on an adjustment program to dismantle
the system of central economic controls and to encourage active participation of the
private sector in the economy. The program included the implementation of macro and
micro economic financial, monetary and institutional policies and rehabilitation of
infrastructure that had deteriorated due to lack of maintenance. These interventions and
increased external resources, exports and production, saw the economy grow at an
average of 4% between 1986 and 1988. However, in subsequent years the steady growth
was affected by severe deterioration of macroeconomic management requiring specific
interventions as outlined in the March 17, 1994 Memorandum of the President (MOP)
and in the joint Government/IMF/Bank policy paper of October 1992. The
Government/IMF/Bank policy paper focuses on reforms and economic growth. It
emphasizes interventions such as infrastructure rehabilitation, private sector development,
agriculture development and poverty alleviation strategy.

Weaknesses in domestic implementation capacity had severely constrained the success of
the Bank's investment projects in Tanzania. For instance, less than 20% of the proceeds
of credits had been disbursed from projects' funding approved three years prior to
appraisal of IRPII. Some improvements had however been noted in the FY93. Amongst
improved performers was the IRPI. To tackle internal weaknesses, a Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) held in November 1993, recommended actions the
government ought to take to improve project implementation. These included; (i)
improvement of compliance with financial covenants including audit, (ii) provision of
sufficient counterpart funding which would entail prioritization and funding of core
projects, (iii) improvement of government's procurement procedures, (iv) improvements
in the management of the Special Accounts, (v) decisive action to deal with four
problematic projects and (vi) better design of projects, with particular emphasis on
quality at entry, and avoidance of extensive legal covenants.

The MOP recommended effective utilization of available technical assistance, training of
government personnel and increased use of local consultants.

The government gradually embraced change. Political liberalization set in. Multiparty
elections took place in mid-1994 while the government agreed to improve macro-
economic policies, reform the public sector and create supportive legal and regulatory
environment for private sector operations. Donors became keener in providing substantial
support to Tanzania to help accelerate the economic turn around and rehabilitate
dilapidated infrastructure.

It is against this background of political and economic transition coupled with weak
internal implementation capacity that the IRPII was designed. It aimed to support
Government plans for economic growth and recognized the need to urgently build on the
ongoing IRPI which became effective in March 1991. IRPI performed exceptionally well



                                                                                        2

within three years of effectiveness. It helped improve the dilapidated road network in
Tanzania from 85% trunk and 90% rural roads reportedly in bad condition in 1990, to
70% trunk and 50% rural roads in bad condition in 1994. IRPI had a significant positive
impact on rural mobility and transportation of goods by reducing travel time and cost on
many routes and increasing economic and social activities.

Finally, the IRPII would provide support to the government's ten-year road network
stabilization program formulated towards the end of the 1980s and whose specified
objectives were to: (i) improve the condition of trunk and regional roads networks and
strengthen its administration and management; (ii)improve resource mobilization and
allocation in order to provide for adequate maintenance of the networks and (iii) enhance
road maintenance capacity in the country through promotion and use of domestic
contractors and availing of equipment through the private sector.

Both IRPI and II were designed to contribute to the government's ten-year road program
and economic recovery strategy. The IRPI was considered by the Bank as a first phase
project, which had performed well initially with 65% of the credit committed by February
1994. IRPII was prepared as a second phase project to increase resources for
rehabilitation of transport infrastructure. The two projects were to run concurrently in the
early years with the IRPI scheduled to close in 1998 and IRPII in 2000.

Since the IRPI was perceived to be well implemented by the time the second project was
prepared, lessons from its poor performance later on could not be incorporated in the
design of the IRPII. Indeed, the design of the IRPII in many ways mirrored that of the
IRPI and, as explained later, its implementation was negatively affected by the
performance of the earlier project. However, the IRPII later benefited from a review of
both projects.

A summary of the financing arrangements for the IRPII under the multi-donor facility is
presented in Annex-1(b).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

Project Development Objective
The principal objective of the project, as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report dated March
17, 1994 for IRPII was to support Tanzania's Economic Recovery Program by reducing
transportation costs, improving accessibility to economically productive areas,
primarily agriculture, tourism and mining and strengthening overall sector
administration and organizational and financing arrangements in the roads sector.
The project would support the implementation of:
        (a)     Upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance of high priority trunk, regional
                and essential district road networks (including bridges, and culverts);
        (b)     Policy and institutional reforms to improve sector administration,
                management and financing of the road network and provide for efficient
                road transport services; and
        (c)     Increasing rural accessibility and mobility by implementing a pilot
                program comprising rehabilitation of rural transport infrastructure,



                                                                                           3

                increasing access to intermediate means of transport and non-transport
                interventions.
         (d)    Resurfacing of Kilimanjaro International Airport runway to improve
                safety and ensure continuation of services.

 1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
 and reasons/justification

 Revised PDO
 Due to substantial cost increases and change in the scope of work, the Government in
 June 1998 requested the Bank to restructure the project and amend the Development



                                                                                         4

Credit Agreement (DCA). The request followed a review of both IRPI and II between
July 1996 and October 1997 (see section 2.2). During the restructuring of the project in
1998 the original objective of the project was retained and the following activities added
in view of the changed scope:

(e)     Increase accessibility and mobility in rural areas; and
(f)     Develop an efficient and viable transportation sector through the implementation
        of sustainable improvements in the administration and coordination of Sector
        activities, including organization, management, and financing of road
        infrastructure, and improvement of management of road transport services.

The rationale for restructuring and subsequent amendments to the credit was to enable the
project to (a) further consolidate reforms in the transport sector started under the IRPI,
particularly in the management of the various sub-sectors; (b) commit some of the
available resources to the emergency rehabilitation of trunk and district road networks
and bridges destroyed by the El-Nino induced flooding thus increasing access to hitherto
cut-off rural areas; (c) support rehabilitation of transport infrastructure in Zanzibar which
had not been included in the original project design; (d) provide support for road
administration, particularly for the Tanzania Roads' Agency (TANROADS), (e)
strengthening the management of the Road Fund (RF) through setting up of a Road Fund
Board (RFB), and (f) strengthen contract and financial management in the sector.

The restructuring was approved by the World Bank Board in August 1998.

A balance of US$5.2m was retained as contingencies.

1.6 Revised Components
During the implementation of the project, several amendments to the Development Credit
Agreement were made (see paragraph 1.7 below). Most of the original works components
were replaced to cater for rehabilitation of roads destroyed by the El Nino floods and
others added to respond to in-country circumstances. The new components were:

(a) El-Nino - Emergency Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Trunk and Feeder
Roads and Bridges. (PDO:- restore accessibility and mobility in rural areas)

(b) Preparation for upgrading and rehabilitation of trunk roads:
     (i)    Feasibility study for Tunduma-Sumbawanga road (223km),
       (ii)    Feasibility and environmental study for Makuyuni-Ngorongoro-Musoma
               road,
       (iii)   Feasibility study and preparation of detailed design and Bid
               documentation for the rehabilitation of 167km of Tanzania-Zambia
               Highway (TANZAM) Highway,
       (iv) Development of a National Road Safety Masterplan,
       (v)     Preparation of a 10 year Roads Sector Development Investment Program.

(c) Zanzibar Components
((PDO:- reducing transportation costs and improving accessibility to economically
productive areas and strengthening overall sector administration)
     (i)    Emergency rehabilitation of the Mkoani-Mtuhaliwa-Chake road, in
               Pemba,
     (ii)    Emergency rehabilitation of the Zanzibar Airport Runway,
       (iii) Policy and investment planning and selected capacity building measures,
       (iv) Feasibility study and detailed design for the rehabilitation and upgrading of
       three roads in Zanzibar (57km).

(d) TA and Operational support (strengthening overall sector administration)
       The TA primarily supported the newly created institutions while operational
       support provided them with operating funds.




                                                                                        8

Amongst components cancelled were;
    (i)     Rehabilitation and backlog maintenance of trunk roads, culverts and bridges
            (in Tabora, Shinyanga, Sumbawanga, Kigoma, Songea and Lindi regions),
    (ii)    Rehabilitation and backlog maintenance of rural roads, culverts and bridges
            on essential districts and regional roads.
    (iii)   Proposed upgrading of the Singida-Shelui road.

These revisions had an effect on the overall project financing, eventually reducing
funding available to the project from US$170.2m at appraisal to US$100.2m by May
2002.

1.7. Other significant changes

(a) Amendments to the Credit
The original credit was in the amount of US$ 170.2 million, with a closing date of
December 31, 2000.
     In August 1998, the project was restructured to correspond to changes in the road
        sector and concentrate on emergency rehabilitation of the trunk and district road
        networks and bridges affected by El-Nino, including the upgrading of the Singida-
        Shelui road
     On December 28, 1999, the credit was amended to include certain priority
        activities in Zanzibar--emergency resurfacing of Zanzibar airport runway--that
        were within the objectives of the restructured project, and the project closing date
        was extended from December 31, 2000 to June 30, 2004
     On May 24, 2000, the credit was amended to add a new category for operating
        costs for TANROADS
     On January 30, 2002, the credit was amended again to support the rehabilitation
        of roads in Zanzibar and to include preparations for the rehabilitation of ferries,
        feasibility study of selected trunk roads and preparation of road safety plans
     On May 1, 2002, an amount of US$70 million was cancelled. This cancellation
        was warranted by substantial delays in the preparation of one of the major
        components of this Project--upgrading of the Singida-Shelui Road (110 Km) to
        bitumen standard. Preparation included engineering design, contract packaging,
        bid documentation, pre-qualification of contractors, evaluation of bids and
        construction supervision services. Thus civil works could not be implemented
        within the remaining period before closure of the credit. GOT and the Bank
        focused on different options available to implement this component, including its
        transfer into Roads Rehabilitation Support Project (RRSP)--which was under
        preparation--or a special credit for the Central Transport Corridor. Eventually, in
        a letter dated April 18 2002, the Ministry of Finance requested the Bank for an
        immediate cancellation of the related component of the credit, with provision of a
        new special credit when the tender documentation would be ready for bidding.
        This resulted in cancellation of approximately 40% of the credit proceeds.
     On February 12, 2003, a reallocation of credit proceeds and a modification of
        Schedule 2 of the DCA were made to include training of MOCT Zanzibar staff
        and acquisition of equipment to support TANROADS' management information
        systems.


                                                                                          9

      On December 23, 2003, the credit was extended by one year, from June 30, 2004
         to June 30, 2005, exclusively for the Emergency Rehabilitations of Zanzibar
         Airport Runway and its extension.
      All other components of the credit were closed as scheduled on June 30, 2004
         except one, Category 1(e)  relating to Part D of the Project "Emergency
         Resurfacing of the Runway at the Zanzibar Airport, which had a closing date of
         June 30, 2005.
      On June 30, 2005, an amendment to the credit agreement was made and the
         closing date extended by 18 months to December 31, 2006 to complete the
         rehabilitation of the airport runway and fencing to enhance airport security; and to
         rehabilitate a 3.8 km link road to complete the whole length of the road between
         Pemba's main port at Mkoani, the airport, and the main administrative centre at
         Chake. The airport rehabilitation contract was eventually terminated because of
         poor performance and the project finally closed on December 30, 2006.

(b) Changes in implementation arrangements
As described in section 2.2 below, the implementation arrangements for the project
changed after the formation of TANROADS in 2000 with the management unit,
Coordination Office for Donor Assisted Projects (CODAP), being transferred to the new
agency from the Ministry of Works, Communications and Transport (MOWCT).
Secondly, with the inclusion of projects in Zanzibar, its Ministry of Communications and
Transport (MOCT) also became an implementing agency.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

(a) Project Design and Quality at Entry

Perceived Risks and Mitigation
The significant risks identified at appraisal were: (i) possible failure to improve or
maintain institutional capacity to effectively manage the road network; (ii) inadequate
domestic resources for development expenditure to complement the foreign resources;
(iii) slow development of the construction industry; and (iv) unavailability of road works
equipment.

Mitigation measures to address these risks were identified and included in the project
design. The issue of weak institutional capacity was to be addressed through the inclusion
of various training programs and Technical Assistance (TA) in the design of the project,
as well as creation of a semi-autonomous road agency (TANROADS) with authority to
establish staffing and remuneration policies independent of civil service regulations.
However, since the government could not commit to the timetable, it was decided that, as
an interim measure, an incentive scheme for staff working on the IRP program be
implemented/adopted by the Government before the project commencement. However,
the incentive scheme was never approved by the Government. Some very weak
alternatives were decided upon. The Bank, unfortunately, decided to waive this condition.
During the first six years, however, little capacity was available to implement the project


                                                                                          10

through the IDA Specific Donor Projects (IDA/SDP) office that was mandated to manage
the project. The Government also dragged its feet in embarking on essential reforms
including creation of the Road Fund Board and the Roads Agency agreed with DP. Under
these circumstances, the TA contribution, that was meant to serve as a stop gap measure,
eventually became ineffective and unsustainable.

Regarding domestic resources, Government contribution to project finance was not a
problem even after the project was restructured. Nevertheless, funding for road
maintenance remained a problem with the GOT unable to meet its obligations agreed
upon under the IRPI in FY95/96, 96/97 and 97/98. Better management of the road fund
was only achieved with the creation of the RFB which resulted in a reliable source of
funding for road maintenance. This in turn meant steady flow of funding for works and
an increase in the number of local contractors specializing in road works from fifty
recorded in 1997 to over 600 today.

Government's initial intention to provide an equipment pool to support the local
construction industry was not achieved although success was noted in some areas.
Eventually the idea was abandoned and PEHCOL, the Private Equipment Hire Company
Limited, was privatized.

Appropriateness of Design
At appraisal the IRPII design envisaged an annual disbursement of about US$130 million
with the Bank disbursing 26.2% (US$34m) of this amount. This level of disbursement
was too ambitious and unrealistic if one were to take into account the risk factors
enumerated above, Tanzania's absorption capacity and modest contracting experience at
that time and poor portfolio performance (described in section 1.1 above). Secondly,
although the CPPR of November 1993 had identified certain weaknesses (that are
enumerated in section 1.1 above) scheduling did not fully take these into account.

Regarding costs, at the time of preparation of the staff appraisal report, the unit rates used
for estimating construction costs were based on experience gained under the IRPI. At that
time, the bids received indicated declining unit costs as the economy was liberalizing and
competition was increasing in the sector. The assumption was that the risk of higher costs
was less. Due to procurement and start up delays, the costs increased substantially as
demonstrated in the "Comprehensive Review of the IRPII and IRPI" report dated June
1997. The increased costs were not due to passage of time alone; they also reflected
increased scope due to further deterioration of the candidate roads. The method for
estimation used at appraisal was inaccurate because for the bulk of the
maintenance/rehabilitation works, estimates were not based on well considered
preliminary design which would have provided reliable quantities for estimation of the
scope of work.

Lastly, although a Project Preparation Fund had been made available, it would appear
that by the time the credit was approved, preparatory work such as bid documentation
and procurement for works and services, had not been done except for one works and one
consultancy services assignment. Hence, the bulk of the project was not ready for
immediate implementation.



                                                                                           11

Government Ownership and dialogue
Judging from the Borrower's ICR, the IRPII was an important project that would build on
the good performance of the IRPI by 1994 and help turn around the economy. There was
considerable goodwill and enthusiasm amongst DP in the sector and the sector wide
approach (SWAP) adopted was a novel idea. As stated earlier, the environment in
Tanzania was difficult and the MOP recognized the uncertainties in government due to a
climate of macro-economic instability prevailing in 1993/94. The Government's slow
commitment to change, poor governance and corruption had a major impact on the
project as explained in paragraph (b) below. In hindsight, although the Government
clearly needed massive funding to reverse the poor condition of its transport
infrastructure, there was little enthusiasm to create a conducive environment for
implementation. DP's enthusiasm to implement the programs did not help the situation.
Clearly, strong focus on reforms and improved sector management, backed by
conditionality for further support, should have been central to Donor/ GOT dialogue at
this critical stage.

(b) Impact of other factors

Design and performance of the IRPI
The performance of the IRPI had an impact on the design and subsequent implementation
of the IRPII. As explained in section 1.1 above the two projects had similar PDO and the
latter was designed to compliment the former. The IRPI was supported by 17
Development Partners (DP) to the amount of US$790.6 million equivalent with the Bank
contributing US$180.4 million and was started in 1990 with a scheduled closure in mid
1998. It eventually closed in mid 1999 and disbursed US$ 149.2 million, about 83% of
the appraisal amount. The project was rated as unsatisfactory. Key performance ratings
were as follows:


     Parameter                                      Rating
     Achievement of Program Objective               Unsatisfactory
     Project Sustainability                         Uncertain
     Bank Performance (identification and           Satisfactory
     preparation)
     Bank Supervision                               Marginally Satisfactory
     Borrower Performance (identification and       Satisfactory
     preparation)
     Borrower Performance ( implementation)         Unsatisfactory (inferred)
     Project Outcome                                Unsatisfactory

The rating contrasts with the perception of the project performance during its first three
years of implementation. At the time, all indications were that it was performing
exceptionally well, having turned around the poor road network in Tanzania, and its
impact felt in many areas of the country. The euphoria of this initial success persuaded
the Bank and other donors to vouch for increased funding and hence the IRPII.



                                                                                       12

However, as reported in the ICR for IRPI prepared in February 2000, this early success
turned into a liability. It obscured the ability to detect and respond to implementation
problems which occurred soon thereafter. The influx of funds and the complexity of the
project combined with the inability of the implementing agency to increase its capacity at
a rate commensurate with the growing volume of works and the overall poor governance
environment led to major mismanagement of the program and corruption. The
government had by 1995 lost control of the program. The ICR enumerates the factors
affecting implementation as being: (i) difficult environment for implementation; (ii)
inadequate design of the project; (iii) poor performance of the consultants and contractors,
which were partially outside government control (iv) corruption and bad governance; (v)
failure to apply lessons learned from past projects; (vi) lack of proactive response; (vii)
frequent re-organization of implementing arrangements; (viii) inadequate counterpart
funding and (ix) poor staff incentives. Other factors included: (x) substantive change of
scope without proper documentation and agreement with the Bank; (xi) pro-longed
procurement processes; (xii) poor contract administration and (xiii) poor project and
financial management. Some of these issues came to the fore by 1995 and manifested
themselves in increased contract overruns. It became apparent that a review/audit of the
project was necessary.

By this time, the IRPII had come into effect. Unfortunately, its preparation and design
had been predated and thus did not benefit from the "real" experience of the IRPI. IRPII
also replicated the same design parameters i.e. large scope with fragmented activities and
massive funding without full consideration of implementation capacity  which
subsequently became a problem in IRPI. Because of the similarity in the design of the
two projects, it was decided that they would both be reviewed/audited. As stated in
section 2.2 below, once the decision to review was made, further procurement was
stopped. The IRPI was eventually closed in June 1999.

The IRPI ICR's observation, that reforms needed to enhance institutional capacity were
not implemented under the IRPI and were a hindrance to government's capacity to
deliver on budget and schedule, is significant. Unfortunately this wisdom came too late to
sway the earlier behavior of donors pushing too many activities on the ground without a
corresponding requirement for reforms to create competent institutions  which had
influenced the design of IRPII. It is also ironic that many of the factors enumerated
above that affected implementation could have been resolved through modern road
management institutions as is the case currently with TANROADS.

Poor governance
Poor governance had a serious impact on the IRPII. While poor governance was not
confined to the transport sector alone but to the whole government establishment as
reported in the Warioba Report on "State of corruption in the country", it had significant
repercussions for the sector. The 1996 report indicted officers of the Ministry of Works,
Communications and Transport (MOWCT) for taking bribes to award tenders, inflate
contracts and conceal poor performance by contractors. It recommended an overhaul of
the ministry and the removal of the management team. The establishment of
TANROADS which launched operations in 2000 and the Road Fund Board legislation
which established the Board in 1999 to collect, manage and monitor the usage of the road



                                                                                        13

fund improved governance. Other institutions formed include the Contractor's
Registration Board (CRB) and the Engineer's Registration Board, both of which act as
regulators for the contracting industry. The creation and facilitation of operations of these
institutions by Government has had a considerable influence on the improved operations
of the industry which has become more transparent and less prone to corruption.
Poor governance had a serious impact, especially delays, on the implementation of IRPII.

2.2 Implementation

(a) Project Management
The project was originally managed by the Department of Roads in the Ministry of
Works. A Coordination Office for Donor Assisted Projects (CODAP) was set up to do
quality control on documents to be sent to donors. With the set up of TANROADS in
July 2000, the majority of the Ministry's staff was moved to TANROADS to handle
maintenance activities while the remaining staff continued to implement the IRPII project.
In September 2001, CODAP was transferred to TANROADS with the task of
implementing specific donor projects and was renamed the IDA/SDP unit.

The project experienced fundamental implementation problems including: (i) seven
months delay due to Borrower un-preparedness; (ii) management weaknesses and (iii)
delays in procurement processing for engaging consultants to carry out engineering
design. Some of these delays were related to increased Bank oversight in the context of
the governance problems alluded to earlier. The low remuneration and motivation of staff
also became an obstacle to achievement of results. An incentive program implemented as
part of the IRPI was discontinued by GOT in 1996. It was not until the project staff were
transferred to TANROADS that they started benefiting from the new and better salary
structure. Even then, the IDA/SDP unit remained understaffed. Efforts were made to
recruit more staff. Technical Assistance was also sourced to enhance the unit's capacity.
Further, various training courses were organized to enhance the capacity of the staff.
With TANROADS fully operational, TA and training provided has had positive impact
on performance.

Frequent changes in the leadership of the Ministry also had negative impact on the
project. The project's life span was under the oversight of six different Ministers and five
different Permanent Secretaries. These changes affected the project implementation since
implementing officials had to deal with new perceptions and styles of incoming officials
thus interrupting smooth progress and continuity.

As a result of these problems, the project's initial implementation performance was rated
unsatisfactory in the implementation status reports (ISR/PSR).

(b) Project Review and Restructuring
After effectiveness of the project in February 1995, a consultant was engaged to review
the project. The objective of the review, which covered both IRPI and II, was to conduct
a comprehensive technical and financial appraisal of all the project components in order
to ascertain the status of the individual components and to establish, under the Directorate
for Roads, improved reporting and monitoring systems for all road projects. Amongst the



                                                                                          14

reasons for the review from the Bank's perspective were: (i) problems of financial
management under the IRPI, (ii) poor contract management resulting in increased
contract prices and claims, (iii) lack of acceptable budgetary controls and weak
monitoring and (iv) in-country governance issues that could impact on the performance
of the sector. Selection of the consultant took about nine months and the review was
carried out between July 1996 and October 1997. Following the review, the credit was
restructured in July 1998. The major purposes of amending/restructuring the credit were:

    (i)    To improve the managerial capacity of the Ministry of Works,
           Communications and Transport (MOWCT) through a timely review and
           adjustment of the remuneration package for the roads staff; and to enhance
           performance by making a provision for operating costs;
    (ii)   To provide institutional support to TANROADS and Zanzibar MOCT,
           namely: technical assistance,     development of a national transport sector
           strategic plan for Zanzibar, training of Zanzibar MOCT staff in road works
           and equipment management;
    (iii)  To provide support to the aviation sector through the supply of revenue
           accounting software package and CRT terminals for Air Tanzania Corporation
           (ATC), areas originally identified to be addressed under IRPI;
    (iv)   To address an emergency situation and provide for repair of roads and bridges
           damaged by El Nino;
    (v)    To address the increased costs due to delays in project implementation as well
           as introduce new items, namely: emergency rehabilitation of Mtuhaliwa-
           Chake road (31 km) on Pemba Island, rehabilitation of Zanzibar Airport
           runway and feasibility studies for new roads including the rehabilitation of
           Tanzania-Zambia (TANZAM) and Korogwe-Mkumbara-Same highways ;
    (vi)   To address the delays in the preparation of the design of Singida-Shelui road
           by canceling the funds allocated for the civil works. The basis for this was as
           follows: The initial design of this section, financed by the Africa Development
           Bank (AfDB) as part of the Central Corridor (Singida-Nzega) and the relevant
           documentation was found inadequate and not acceptable by the Bank and had
           to be revisited. Unfortunately, due to procurement delays, subsequent poor
           performance of the appointed design consultant and inherent weaknesses in
           supervision within GOT, it was found prudent to cancel the civil works
           component and transfer it to the then proposed Central Transport Corridor
           Project (CTCP), where it is currently being implemented.

While preparation for the review and its execution was in progress, procurement
activities were suspended because of poor governance and financial management
resulting in a four-year loss in implementation time. The closing date of the credit had to
be extended to June 2004 to allow for completion of the restructured project and the
Results Framework was adjusted accordingly.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The MOWCT and IDA developed a monitoring list for IRPII for the Ministry to update
monthly. However, both the Ministry and TANROADS did not adhere to this



                                                                                        15

arrangement because of low capacity to perform the monitoring and evaluation function
expected of a project of this nature. However, through regular missions, close monitoring
of implementation progress was done.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

No major environmental issues were expected at design stage. For the one road designed
under the IRPI and implemented under this project and the other rehabilitation works
under the El Nino emergency roads rehabilitation, measures to mitigate against the
adverse effects of construction and related construction traffic were included in the works
contracts. This also included arrangements to protect the environment and the
communities during construction.

The project also prepared guidelines on sound environmental design and management
strategies for design and implementation of inland surface transport projects. The
guidelines are now used as a standard document in the design of the transport investment
projects.

After restructuring, fiduciary aspects of the project and audits were carried out in a timely
manner with TANROADS gradually building acceptable capacity in financial and project
management. However, procurement had issues that arose regarding the choice of
consultant and contractor for the rehabilitation of the Zanzibar airport runway. The
client's preferred lowest bidder for the works contract that was supported by Bank
procurement team turned out to be a non-performer. The design and supervision
consultancy issue was satisfactorily resolved with the appointment of a competent firm,
after the first was terminated. However, the appointment of the construction firm to
complete the assignment remained a problem which will hopefully be resolved during the
ongoing re-bid under the CTCP repeater project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The transition from the Ministry to TANROADS was successfully done, although this
took about one year from the commissioning of TANROADS. Transfer of development
and maintenance of trunk and regional roads from the Ministry to TANROADS was
gradual and is still not complete seven years later. Furthermore, it was envisaged that
TANROADS would, within five years, progress to a fully fledged road authority with its
own board to guide its operations and protect management from excessive outside
interference. This has not happened and is still a subject of the ongoing DP/GOT
dialogue.

The Road Fund (RF) was established in July 1992 with the support of the Sub-Saharan
Africa Road Maintenance Initiatives (RMI). In 1995/96 the RF faced a crisis. Following
shortfalls in the government revenues, GOT diverted the RF to the general account. The
Audit reports for 1995/96 and 96/97 showed misappropriation in the use of the RF and
this led several donors to question its transparency and accountability. The GOT
undertook confidence building measures including establishment of the Road Fund Board
(RFB) with the responsibility of managing the Road Fund, mobilizing road maintenance



                                                                                          16

funds and overseeing their utilization. Its creation was amongst key reforms agreed with
the GOT under IRPI but implemented under IRPII.

Fuel levy is a key source of revenue for the road fund. Collection of fuel levy continues
to be done by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) with funds sent to Ministry of
Finance (MOF), then Ministry of Works (MOW), now Ministry of Infrastructure
Development (MOID), before reaching the RFB - a lengthy process. RFB has
recommended that funds be sent directly to them by TRA. Nevertheless, disbursement
from RFB to executing authorities (TANROADS and Local Authorities) has been on
course and performance audits are carried out annually. The RFB collected US$69.6
million in FY07 which was about 40% of the assessed road maintenance requirements.
The government's budget for FY07/08 proposed an increase of the road fund revenue to
US$173m equivalent which would fully cover the maintenance requirements.

Reforms have been slow in Zanzibar although a Road Fund to finance road maintenance
was formed in 2004. Strengthening institutional arrangements and capacity to execute
projects and maintain investments is still a challenge.

As part of post-completion operation of investments, the project assisted the preparation
of the Central Transport Corridor Project (CTCP). This included the preparation of
design and bid documentation for upgrading of Singida-Shelui road, upgrading of three
roads in Zanzibar and rehabilitation of the TANZAM highway, all currently being
implemented through the CTCP and funding from DANIDA. The project also helped
review the status of road safety in Tanzania resulting in the development of a draft road
safety policy.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Under the economic environment in which the project was prepared, the objective was
relevant since Tanzania's goal was to turn around the economy and provide access to: (i)
areas of economic growth in agriculture, tourism and mining which together with
transport and communication contributed to about 73% of the GDP and (ii) rural areas
where over 80% of the population lived. Reliable transport was therefore considered
critical to achieving this objective. Secondly, the implementation of the project required
strengthening of Tanzania's ability to manage large projects and its road network (and
other transport modes) in a sustainable manner. These objectives were adopted in an
environment where the entire road network was in a very poor condition, requiring urgent
attention and a massive injection of funds. Furthermore, the capacity of the implementing
institutions was weak while the experience and number of competent personnel
responsible for implementation was inadequate.

The design of the project and its programming did not adequately recognize the extent to
which weak capacity would adversely affect implementation, although this was identified
as one of the risks. It also did not foresee the grave governance problems that seriously




                                                                                       17

impeded progress. In retrospect, the scope of the project was too ambitious and activities
were fragmented.

The factors that eventually contributed to poor performance under IRPI -- delayed
reforms -- would have benefited the IRPII if they had been implemented earlier (or if
IRPII effectiveness, at least for the works components, had been conditioned on them).

In retrospect, perhaps the four years delay in full scale-roll out of the works contracts
under IRPII may have helped both the Bank and GOT to deal with the issues and agree
on a more realistic project. With reforms accepted and implemented in 1998-2000,
substantial achievements were made. See Annex 2 (a)

In 1997/8, Tanzania was hit by the El Nino induced floods which destroyed transport
infrastructure in many regions, cutting off access to large populations. The Government
was keen to restore accessibility as soon as possible and since the funds set aside for
IRPII had not been utilized because of the review, it was decided that the rehabilitation of
the destroyed infrastructure would be a priority in the restructured project. The inclusion
of the El Nino component in the restructured project was in line with the PDO of
improving access to economically productive areas and hence relevant. The
implementation of this component was successful.

Lastly, the objectives and the design of IRPII were consistent with the Bank's CAS
whose principal goal was to assist the government in reducing poverty through
acceleration of structural reform, the provision of infrastructure and social services
targeted at the poor, while ensuring an environmentally sustainable development path. It
is also consistent with the current country CAS for Tanzania which focuses on higher
growth, poverty reduction, and institutional reforms to improve governance and service
delivery and to strengthen Tanzanian ownership of its development agenda, improve the
partnership between Government and key stakeholders, and enhance aid effectiveness.

Hence, taking into account the factors discussed above, the rating of the outcomes in
terms of relevance to PDO is satisfactory while that relating to design and
implementation is moderately satisfactory. Overall rating is assessed as being
Moderately Satisfactory

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)

To assess the success of the IRPII in achieving the PDO, three key parameters are
identified and analyzed. These are: (a) reducing transport costs and improving access to
economically productive areas by upgrading and rehabilitation of transport infrastructure
 roads and airports; (b) institutional and capacity building in the transport sector to
strengthen overall sector administration through policy and institutional reforms and (c)
providing basic transport in rural areas (measures to improve rural travel and transport).

The IRPII had mixed achievements in infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading. It
succeeded in implementing a number of projects, key amongst these being the
rehabilitation of the Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA), upgrading of the Nzega-



                                                                                         18

Shinyanga/Mwanza border road, rehabilitation of the Mkoani-Mtuhaliwa-Chake road,
rehabilitation of Trunk Road bridges and rehabilitation of devastated roads in 13
packages under the El Nino emergency works. It however failed to deliver on some key
components i.e. upgrading of Singida-Shelui road, rehabilitation and spot improvement
of several trunk and regional roads and rehabilitation of the Zanzibar Airport runway.
Apart from costs increasing as a result of delays in implementation, the original plan to
provide equipment to contractors under the PEHCOL arrangement was also shelved.
However, reduced transport costs were realized on the rehabilitated road network. From a
financial standpoint, of the appraised funding for infrastructure, only 51% was delivered.
The scenario however changed after restructuring and the project delivered 91% of the
approved funding. Considering all facts, the objective related to provision of
infrastructure is assessed as marginally achieved.

In institution building, substantial success was achieved. The project supported the
creation of key institutions started under the IRPI that have continued to grow, perform
reasonably well, and remain critical to the growth and sustainability of the transport
sector in Tanzania. Amongst these are: TANROADS, RFB, CRB, Tanzania Civil
Aviation Authority (TCAA) and Tanzania Airports Agency (TAA). The project also set
the foundation for training of local contractors.

The net outcome is that: (i) the Tanzania road network has improved to it's current status
where over 83% of the National/core road network is in good and fair condition because
of better management and financing, resulting in reduced transport costs; (ii) road
maintenance funding is predictable and has been increasing gradually from US$41.7m in
FY 96/97 to US$60.2m in FY 03/04 and US$69.6m in FY06/07. This has seen an
increase in the number of local contractors who, jointly with local Engineering
Consulting firms, are responsible for execution of over 90% of the works funded by the
Road Fund and (iii) air communication has improved. These outcomes have contributed
to Tanzania's Economic Recovery Program by reducing transportation costs and
improving access to economically productive areas throughout the country. By offering
staff better incentives and operating in a business like manner, the capacity of the new
institutions has grown substantially resulting in increased output due to reduced
procurement cycles, good financial management and improved project management
capability.

The project has also succeeded in helping formulate policy and sector operational
guidelines. Amongst these are (i) private sector participation in provision of services in
the transport sector with the concessioning of KIA standing out as a successful
pioneering PPP in the sector and (ii) GOT divestiture in public transport resulting in the
private sector controlling over 90% of this market. The project also supported the
preparation of medium and long term investment plans for the road sub-sector and
specific projects some of which are currently being implemented with Bank or other DP
support (such as upgrading of Singida-Shelui road, rehabilitation of TANZAM highway).
The project has also supported the preparation of environmental guidelines and
management strategies for design and implementation of road projects. The guidelines
are used in the implementation of all new projects.




                                                                                       19

The above achievements are in line with the PDO and have helped develop an efficient
and viable transportation sector through the implementation of sustainable improvements
in the administration and coordination of Sector activities, including organization,
management, and financing of road infrastructure, and improvement of management of
road transport services.

From the aforesaid, the objective related to policy and institutional development was
substantially achieved. However, a few risks threaten its sustainability as explained in
chapter 4 below.

With respect to rural transport, the project successfully supported GOT's village travel
and transport project (VTTP) in six districts (Masasi, Mbozi, Morogoro, Muhezi, Iramba
and Iringa). IDA only supported Iramba district, the others getting support from other DP.
Overall achievement in the six districts included repair of 550km of community roads
and 23 bridges and construction of 546.6km of foot paths and 30 foot bridges. The VTTP
sub-project objective was to improve the livelihood of people by making sustainable
improvements in the village travel and transport situations in order to reduce the time
and energy spent on travel and transport and in this regard develop effective Rural
Travel and Transport approaches and models which can be replicated in other areas of
Tanzania. Furthermore, to empower communities to build capacity in: (i) development
and maintenance of transport infrastructure in their locality; and (ii) promote the use and
maintenance of appropriate intermediate means of transport: The project has also
supported the use of donkeys and canoes to ferry farm produce. Although the Bank no
longer financially supports the VTTP other DP continue to show interest. However,
sustainability is a challenge because internal funding is a problem, even though the
program is popular. Nevertheless, the achievement of the VTTP component has
substantially met the PDO.

The overall rating is Moderately Satisfactory and combines ratings for: providing
transport infrastructure; institutional and capacity building and providing rural transport
infrastructure.




3.3 Efficiency

For the IRPII, the appraisal EIRR was 21% which was the average for all sub-
components as evaluated then. A discount rate of 12% was used and projects with EIRR
above this considered economical viable. Most of the civil works carried out after
restructuring were primarily emergency maintenance and no economic appraisal was
done. However, two of the roads funded by the Bank (one before and the other after
restructuring) were appraised. For these two, and two others executed under the IRPII
with funding from another DP, a post appraisal was done at the closure of the project to
assess their impact on the economic development of the country. Details of the
methodology used are presented in Annex 3.




                                                                                         20

The results of the post evaluation for the four roads, which were rehabilitated or upgraded
to bitumen standard, are summarized in the table below. The outcome of the analysis
shows that all the four roads indicate post construction EIRR values exceeding 12 per
cent, indicating that the upgrading/rehabilitation of the roads was justified in economic
terms and has a positive impact on the socio-economic development of the country. For
the first two roads, (funded by DANIDA), there were increases in construction costs
which impacted on the EIRR. However, the economic return on the Mwanza/Shinyanga
border  Nzega, which is part of the Central Corridor, is robust and justifies the
investment. The evaluated EIRR for the fourth road, which is in Pemba where traffic
volumes are low, also justifies the investment.

The socio-economic benefits of the emergency restoration of the infrastructure destroyed
by the El Nino flooding were not evaluated. However, access was restored in regions
most affected by the phenomena namely Dodoma, Singida, Mwanza, Tabora and Kigoma
and along six trunk roads. The gradual improvement in the condition of the trunk and
rural roads network has improved accessibility and reduced transport costs. No specific
impact assessment has been done; however, transport is a major contributor to Tanzania's
economy which has continued to perform well with GDP growth of 4.9%, 5.7%, 6.2%,
5.7%, 6.7% and 6.8% in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 respectively.

Rehabilitation of KIA was completed in 2000 and although it has not been possible to
carry out a post construction economic appraisal for the airport due to lack of data, there
has been substantial growth in service delivery as demonstrated in Table 3 below. The
growth between 2000 and 2004 in aircraft movement, passengers, cargo and mail was
22%, 41%, 80% and 100% respectively. Nevertheless, for KIA as an international airport,
there is still room for improvement.

Although it is difficult to determine fully the effect of the four year delay because the
project changed substantially after restructuring, with new components being added and
many of the original ones in the SAR dropped, it suffices to state that globally, the cost in
1995-99 was higher than in 2000-04. There is also an economic aspect. The planned
infrastructure did not become available until a later date with some (Singida-Shelui road)
still under construction.

On balance, the efficiency of implementation was moderately satisfactory due to higher
costs and loss of use of the facilities on the one hand and good return on investment,
reduction in transport costs, and restoration of accessibility on the other.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Considering the economic conditions in Tanzania in 1994 the IRPII remains relevant,
although ambitious, as approved. Initial implementation was slow due to various factors
which can be attributed to the Borrower's low capacity and institutional weaknesses,
mainly due to issues related to the implementation of IRPI and in-country governance
concerns that emerged.

Suspension of all procurement under IRPII resulted in four years loss of critical
implementation time at the beginning of the project. The serious governance issues that
were emerging left the Bank with little choice but to be especially vigilant on its
oversight of this operation.

Once GOT stabilized project management by creating TANROADS and other institutions
and the credit was restructured, substantial progress was made. The project has met many
development objectives and completed components have a positive impact on the
economy. The relative costs of the components that were implemented including studies
were competitive and in all cases executed within the approved contract sums. 90% of the
restructured credit finance was utilized and generally all project components' outcomes
support the PDO. Furthermore, and as described in section 3.5 below, the project had
other important outcomes and impacts. Therefore, although during the earlier years the
project was in danger of becoming a problem project, subsequent progress was
satisfactory and resulted in substantial gains.

On balance, and taking into account the ratings for relevance, efficacy and efficiency
above, which are all moderately satisfactory, the overall outcome is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.




                                                                                          22

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Better management of the road network has resulted in improved conditions resulting in
increased accessibility to the market and social amenities for the rural poor.
Implementation of VTTP has had a positive impact on the social development of affected
communities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The creation of TANROADS and RFB has resulted in increased capacity for road
management and finance. Reliable funding and improved project management in the
sector has resulted in sustained growth of the construction industry. New and competent
local engineering consultants have emerged and the number of local contractors has
grown in numbers and in the volume of work they are able to execute. For instance, over
90% of road works funded by the Road Fund is executed by local contractors with
engineering design done by local consultants and TANROADS. It is also noted that in
almost all Bank financed consultancy services (over 35 under IRPII, CTCP and East
Africa Trade and Transport Project) a local consulting firm is included. The Contractor
Registration Board (CRB) has intensified its regulatory role and clout in maintaining
standards amongst the contractors which has contributed to the improved quality of work.

TCAA's ability to deal with requests and safety in a timely and orderly manner has
enhanced confidence in its role as the aviation industry's regulator amongst airline
operators and ICAO. TAA has embarked on the upgrading of seven more airport runways
and is considering engaging private sector management of selected airports based on their
experience with concessioning of KIA. The combined actions are expected to support and
stimulate more scheduled flights within Tanzania.

(c) Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
An off shoot of the increased visibility of the development of the road sector is the
formation of the Tanzania Road Association (TARA) which is a stakeholders' forum that
advocates for better roads. On the negative side, with improved roads particularly paved
trunk roads, traffic accidents have increased making Tanzania one of the countries with
high accident rates. The GOT with support from WB and other DP has recognized the
problem and has developed policies and strategies to deal with it that are awaiting
Cabinet approval. One other negative aspect is the spread of HIV/AIDS by truckers and
construction workers. In mitigation, both the Bank and GOT have supported campaigns
to educate construction workers, affected villagers and truckers and offer protection
against the spread of the disease through education programs embedded in all works
contracts and free issue of condoms.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome




                                                                                      23

Rating: Moderate
The envisaged risks to DO are: (i) slowing down of reforms; (ii) poorly planned and or
politically (as opposed to economically) driven investments; (iii) non-competitive
privatization and (iv) reduced road maintenance funding. These risks are rated moderate
because on the one hand, the GOT acknowledges their potential impact but on the other
hand, it has been slow in dealing with them effectively as explained below.

The GOT policy for the transport sector is to separate the policy and planning roles from
execution. In establishing the various institutions discussed in this report GOT has shown
commitment to implement this policy. However, the ministry has been slow and reluctant
to relinquish necessary authority to enable the institutions grow and operate more
independently.

Tanzania's economy has been growing consistently in the last seven years and demand
for transportation services remains high. With scarce resources available to the sector the
need for prudent allocation of resources becomes critical and GOT is encouraged to
develop transparent investment criteria for its resources and those from Development
Partners (DP) for prioritizing investments. This has not always been the case and partisan
politics and various interests have weighed heavily on the decision making process. This
remains a challenge, which if not addressed could derail sound investments for economic
development.

Although the performance of KIA concession has been satisfactory, an open and
transparent bidding method was used in procurement. Secondly, it is understood that the
contract has some monopolistic clauses that are detrimental to the growth of the industry.
Tanzania has several such concessions which have tended to create situations that are not
in the best long term interests of the country. The new government has embarked on the
review of such contracts.

The condition of both the national and local road network has improved considerably due
to better management, predictable road maintenance funding and low age of the paved
road network. Major problems are still posed by the Government's proposed expansion
and upgrading of the network without provision for adequate periodic and routine
maintenance. It is currently estimated that only 40% of the maintenance funding
requirement is available. The government has proposed to increase the Road Fund
revenue in the FY07/08 to an estimated US$173m. This amount meets current
requirements but has to be reviewed regularly to factor inflation and increased demand.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The design of the IRPII albeit overly ambitious, was a timely response to the critical
situation considering that 70% of the main road network in Tanzania and airports had
deteriorated and their condition was an impediment to economic recovery. Nevertheless,



                                                                                        24

critical aspects of project implementation were not systematically considered at the
design stage resulting in the delayed roll out. Amongst these were: (i) most sub-projects
were not ready for implementation at the time of project effectiveness; (ii) the Borrower
had not put in place proper financial and project management structures to support such a
large investment (US$650.3m with a proposed annual disbursement of US$130m,
US$34m of which was to be financed by the Bank); (iii) the local private sector driven
construction industry was still in its infancy; (iv) reforms agreed under the IRPI had not
been implemented. The appraisal had foreseen some of the risks to the project as
enumerated in section 2.1 however, the planning and subsequent approval of the project
did not give sufficient time for the mitigating factors. Structured dialogue between GOT
and DP, and amongst DP, could have ameliorated the risks.

The issues enumerated above had critical negative impacts on subsequent implementation
of the project. Therefore, although the project became effective in February 1995 only
two sub-projects commenced before 1998 with less than 10% disbursement occurring
during the first four years of the project. Following a comprehensive review of IRPI & II
commissioned in Sept 1996 the project was restructured in July 1998 after which
implementation picked up substantially.

Considering all factors, Bank's oversight responsibility to ensure quality at entry is rated
as moderately unsatisfactory. The rating is due to the fact that although the design
seemed appropriate in relation to the needs, the scope of the project was overly ambitious
in relation to the depth of advance preparation of components and uncertainties' of
Government buy-in.

(b)Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Supervision of this project, even with the assumptions made about absorptive capacity,
would have been challenging, given the number of activities, and the ambitious
disbursement schedule. The thorny issues of governance and the review necessitated by
the deteriorating performance of IRPI and the need to ensure transparency all added
fodder to growing difficulties.

Only 53.3% of the originally appraised funds were used by closure of the 12 year project
in December 2006. A key component (the Singida-Shelui road which is a portion of the
Central Transport Corridor) was cancelled due to delay in preparatory activities for its
implementation and procurement.          The government also notes that there lacked
appropriate dialogue on the Bank's side to resolve emerging issues in a timely fashion
(also see Chapter 7 of this ICR). All of these factors leave one begging question whether
the Banks' supervision role was appropriate, especially in the earlier part of the
implementation period.

Once the credit was restructured, close supervision resulted in substantial
accomplishments. All aspects of financial, procurement management and audits were
satisfactory. Problematic issues were expeditiously dealt with. Over 90% of the approved
funding after restructuring was utilized. Social and environmental issues were dealt with
effectively as they arose.



                                                                                         25

Finally, it could be argued that the loss of four years of implementation could have been
avoided through timely advice, proactive supervision, and special procedures to speed up
procurement and disbursements. It is however, fair to note that this was a period when
governance concerns were becoming a much more visible issue in the Bank and among
donors, and this would undoubtedly have had a chilling effect on implementation plans
(and dialogue) in the then prevailing environment.1

Considering all these factors, the overall supervision is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project has broadly achieved many of the intended PDOs. Moreover after the
restructuring, implementation was, for the most part successful. It is plausible that the
project could have achieved much more in a timely fashion and with more realistic
expectations. Better dialogue between the Bank's supervision team and the Borrower and
with the Bank providing timely guidance and advice would have improved the situation.
Initial planning for the project was inadequate and lacked an in-depth analysis of the
implementing capacity in Tanzania. In retrospect, perhaps a better awareness of the risks
involved and tighter monitoring with clear proactive guidance by Bank Management,
could have helped resolve some of the issues highlighted in this report. In consideration
of all these issues, the overall bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
From a broader perspective, the Government has continued to support investment in
infrastructure and provided counterpart funding throughout the life of the project. It has
also embraced policies and reforms although belatedly, that have resulted in more
efficient and effective transport sector institutions and increased participation of the
private sector in management and execution of transport sector activities. There are
inherent issues, some of which are discussed in section 2.2 and 4 above, that impacted on
the success of the IRPII and may continue to impact on the entire transport program in
Tanzania unless they are addressed. These include (i) slowing down of reforms, (ii)
poorly planned and or politically (as opposed to economically) driven investments, (iii)
non-competitive privatization, (iv) reduced road maintenance funding and (v) low
remuneration and motivation of staff.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

                                            reforms and poor project and financial
                                            management. Poor governance in the early stages

                                            managed the restructured sub-projects under IRPII
                                            and provided reliable financial accounting for the
                                            project. It has also managed the road maintenance
                                            program satisfactorily.

                                            supervision, MOCT delivered one road project and

PMORALG (VTTP)




(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Borrower had initial capacity setbacks which constrained the implementation of the
project. However, after embracing reforms and empowering its implementing agencies
and with substantial DP support the project picked up and performed reasonably well.
Sustainability of reforms to enhance the management of the sector for improved delivery
of service is critical and still considered a challenge. The agencies responsible for
implementation performed reasonably well after the project was restructured delivering
the components within budget and taking proactive steps to deal with problematic ones
like Zanzibar Airport runway rehabilitation and upgrading of Singida-Shelui road. For the
implementing agencies this would result in a satisfactory rating but the ministries poor
initial performance and current issues listed above negate this, hence the moderately
satisfactory rating.

6. Lessons Learned

    1. Both the IRPII and IRPI, which was closed in 1999, had similar developmental
        objectives, outcomes and issues. It would have made much sense to delay the
        commencement of the IRPII and have the reforms planned under IRPI
        implemented first. If this had been followed, the design of IRPII would have



                                                                                         27

    benefited from the experience of the former project which was rated
    unsatisfactory.

2. Though it was absolutely necessary for the Bank to support the GOT's economic
    recovery program, the design and implementation arrangement of the project
    should have given more attention to improving the limited capacity of the
    implementing agencies and prepared a less ambitious project.

3. The impact of institutional reforms on performance of the sector has been
   significant and this must be followed up particularly in regard to TANROADS
   and TAA which should be strengthened and their operational capability enhanced
   through further reforms.

4. Performance of implementing agencies that have resisted reforms e.g. Zanzibar
   MOCT, continues to be relatively poor. Because it has been demonstrated that
   reform enhances performance, the Bank should peg further development support
   on appropriate reforms.

5. Attempts to build institutional capacity without appropriate reforms are likely to
   be frustrated and become unsustainable. Bank support should aim at building in
   country capacity within departments responsible for policy and planning,
   implementing agencies and the construction industry. Assessment of the capacity
   and performance of these institutions should form part of infrastructure projects'
   appraisal.

6. The IRPII was amongst the first Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) projects and
   aimed to support the Government's economic recovery objectives. The fact that
   several DP were willing to buy into the Government's plan demonstrates the
   robustness of the strategy. The approach which links development of transport
   sector infrastructure with overall country development programs should be
    encouraged. The SWAP design should take into account all aspects that could
    affect performance including appropriate institutional and financial reforms to
    improve efficiency in service delivery. Currently this is being pursued, with
    mixed results, under the GOT Transport Sector Investment Program (TSIP) 2006-
    2015, which is supported by transport sector DP.

7. In-country presence of Bank staff is critical for success of projects, particular
    transport infrastructure development, that have lengthy preparatory and
    procurement phases.

8. A strong monitoring and evaluation capacity should be inbuilt in project
    preparation and supervision.

9. The Government should establish a strong mechanism for coordinating and
    working with key stakeholders in the transport industry including DP and the
    private sector. This is likely to translate into better outcomes and ease
    government's burden of providing services and funding as was observed with
    liberalization of the public transport, in which, 90% of services are currently
    owned and managed by the private sector.

10. Twelve years is too long for a project to run because it is difficult to accurately
    assess its impact.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/DP

(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies Comments

Borrower/implementing agencies comments to Bank ICR
The comments by the Borrower (See Annex 7) do not take into account the rating of the
IRPI ICR that was unsatisfactory and which it accepted. Most of the issues raised in this
ICR regarding IRPII mirror those noted under IRPI. The Borrower also fails to accept the
obvious fact that delayed reforms had an impact as demonstrated by better performance
of various reformed organizations. Financial, procurement and contract management
remained issues of concern that have only lately improved to acceptable levels.

Summary of issues raised in the Borrower's version of the ICR
The Borrower has prepared their version of the ICR and the following are the
summarized highlights from the report. According to the report, the project has helped;
(i) strengthen the road network management by creating strong institutions that are
responsible for management and mobilizing of funds and ring fencing of road
maintenance funding, (ii) strengthen technical, financial and managerial capacity in the
sector, (iii) develop domestic construction industry and Road transport companies, (iv)
improve regulation and management of civil aviation and (v) design policies to guide the
sector in future. The report also indicates that despite the low disbursement by the Bank
other DP continued with their support resulting in substantial delivery of the original
program (see Annex 1(b)) and table below.

The report enumerates factors that affected the project which include; (i) slow start of the
project because of late signing of agreements by some of the DP and (ii) delayed
effectiveness of the Bank funding and subsequent halting of implementation during the
review. It also says that the Bank did not initially support TANROADS and was reluctant
to transfer its projects to them, opting instead to remain with the ministry, until they were
convinced TANROADS could perform. The report has flagged availability of road
maintenance funding as a threat to sustainability of the development outcomes.

On performance of the Bank, the report says that project identification, preparation and
appraisal were properly carried out by the Bank team but goes ahead to fault the
supervision. Amongst issues they are critical of are; (i) the review, the cancellation of
US$70m, (ii) the performance of the TTL prior to 2004 and (iii) the duo responsibility of
the TTL, who was also responsible for procurement. The report supports the
decentralization which it says has substantially reduced decision making by TTL and the
time it takes to procure various components. The report rates the performance of the
Borrower as satisfactory.

While agreeing with many aspects of the Borrower's report and also noting that by 2004
overall the IRPII had disbursed beyond the original appraisal amount of US$650.3
million (it is silent on inflation and cost overruns), the report is silent on critical issues of
poor governance, weak institutions and reluctance to implement reforms as agreed under
IRPI, which had a critical impact on the performance of the project.

Only two comments (from AfDB and DANIDA) were received from the co-financiers
after a copy of the draft ICR was sent to them inviting comments. The poor response
could be attributed to institutional changes over the long implementation period and/or
the current local representatives not having information about the project. The AfDB
while acknowledging the SWAP adopted as good have faulted the frequent amendments
to the IRPII which had a disruptive effect on project implementation and negated the
objective of stabilizing the road network. They have also concurred with Bank
conclusions regarding quality at entry and supervision. Unfortunately they have not
provided information regarding the performance of their components in the overall IRPII
program. DANIDA, who have also responded, have clarified that although TANROADS
regarded their contribution as part of the IRPII program, it was a parallel financing.
However, they too have not provided information on performance of their component.
Nevertheless, as will be noted in Annex 1(b) other than the Bank, EU and OPEC, the
other DP disbursed fully on their appraisal commitments and substantial progress was
made in the implementation of the works component as recorded in the summary below
that was adopted from the Borrower's ICR. As will be noted, some of the works were still
being implemented in 2006! The IRPII's achievement in road works components against
the original target is as follows:

Rural Roads, Culverts and Bridges
The Government had initially targeted rehabilitation and backlog maintenance of a total
of 4,370km of district and essential roads. At the time of restructuring, the roads allotted
to the Bank totaling 2,215km were cancelled. Eventually, with the entry of more DP
partners the Borrower was able to deliver 2,559 km of the identified network.

Trunk Roads
Substantial progress was made in the implementation of the trunk roads components and
the Borrower emphasizes that they were able to achieve over 70% of the target.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction
Most of the civil works sub-projects carried out under the project were of an emergency
nature and no economic appraisal was done. However, an appraisal was done for three
civil works components amongst those executed with Bank finance, namely, (i)
Kilimanjaro International Airport (ii) Upgrading of 47 km of the Nzega- Shinyanga-
Mwanza border road and (iii) Rehabilitation of Mkoani-Mtuhaliwa-Chake road.

The appraisal presented here is for four roads projects, two funded by IDA and the other
two by DANIDA. Data for KIA was not available for the appraisal.

Methodology for the Roads Projects
The projects have been broadly evaluated on the basis of data available within
TANROADS, MOCT Zanzibar and Ministry of Works on construction costs, periodic
maintenance costs, past and present road condition and traffic and vehicle operating costs.

The economic evaluation has been done using HDM-4 for which project related capital
and maintenance costs have been compared with the economic benefits resulting from
savings in vehicle operating costs.


The HDM-4 model automatically calculates deteriorations in road roughness resulting
from traffic levels and forecasts maintenance activities. During the appraisal of the IRPII,
project economic evaluations were done using the TRRL Road Model (RTIM2) which is
outdated. In view of this, it was necessary to make assumptions about rates of road
deterioration in terms of International Roughness Index (IRI) values between successive
years. These assumptions were made in accordance with experience in other projects
undertaken in the country.

The evaluations have been performed using economic values at 2004 prices for all costs
and benefits. The economic analyses have been carried out taking into account the
following assumptions:

     Two alternatives have been adopted; (i) without project: maintain a gravel road
       and (ii) with project: upgrade the gravel road.
     The analysis has been carried out for a 20 year period for benefits.
     The discount rate applied for calculating the present value of benefits is 12%.
     Benefits are a function of savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) between the
       without project case and with project case.
     Data on VOC and Value of Time (VOT) have been obtained from TANROADS
       database and the most current ones reflecting 2004 prices. Traffic data, traffic
       growth rates have been obtained from existing reports and studies.
     Unit costs are obtained from TANROADS and MOW database
     Exchange Rate used is; 1 US$=Tshs 1100 and an inflation rate of 4.3%.



                                                                                        46

While these evaluations are post-construction in the sense that they take place soon after
completion of works, they reflect positive benefits that will continue to be enjoyed for
many years to come.

Data Sources

Capital Costs
Capital costs were based on actual expenditure for the particular project. The costs
exclude VAT, inflation and shadow pricing for labour and other input factors. Capital
costs were all quoted in US dollars.

Periodic Maintenance Costs
The Standard costs for periodic maintenance on paved roads (typically for a reseal every
seven years) were estimated at US$ 27,000 per kilometer for paved surface dressing at
2004 prices.

Road Condition Data
Data on road surface and condition was available in TANROADS database. It classified
all road sections on the main and secondary network as being: paved, gravel or earth, and
as having surface condition which was: very good, good, fair, poor, and bad. For practical
purposes it has been assumed that for paved roads these surface conditions could be
equated to the following IRI values for road roughness:

                 Paved Roads        Gravel Roads
Very Good          2.0              8.0
Good               3.0              10.0
Fair               5.0              12.0
Poor               8.0              15.0
Bad                12.0             25.0

Traffic Data
Traffic data is collected by TANROADS/Ministry of Works on an annual or ad hoc basis,
at a number of designated count stations around the country. The data is transformed to
an average daily traffic (ADT) by applying traffic adjustment factors. Estimates for road
sections where no count has been conducted are generally made on the basis of
interpolation between traffic levels recorded at adjacent count stations. It was thus
possible to make reasonable estimates of traffic flows and growth rates over the past few
years on the various project roads.

Vehicle Operating Costs
TANROADS has currently standardized vehicle operating costs (VOC) and the latest
version has been used in this analysis. The VOC are specified for a wide range of road
roughness values, and results were extracted for the four vehicle types and for IRI values
between 2.5 and 12.0.




                                                                                       47

Summary of Results
Table1 below presents a summary of results for economic indicators for all four roads.
These include Net Present Value (NPV) and Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR).
All costs and benefits are expressed in 2004 US dollar prices, and all discounted values
are discounted at 12 per cent per annum to the first year of construction.

From this analysis it is clear that all four roads indicate post construction EIRR values
exceeding 12 per cent, with a range from 14.4 to 45 per cent. If these results are
compared with the estimates during appraisal, it emerges that upgrading and
rehabilitation of the roads has had positive impact on the socio-economic development of
the country as projected. The lower EIRR for the first two roads funded by DANIDA is
attributed to increased construction costs.

It has not been possible to carry out a comprehensive post rehabilitation appraisal of the
airport due to lack of critical data such as pavement condition however, the table below
demonstrates substantial growth of the airport business in all aspects which would justify
the investments made.
