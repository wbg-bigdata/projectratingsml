F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To establish the basis for community-driven development and the protection and
management of natural resources on indigenous community lands.                This includes
strengthening social organization and culture and building indigenous capacities for
sustainable development in a gender-sensitive manner, as well as improving the delivery
of government services to indigenous peoples, reinforcing the links between government
agencies and indigenous communities.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    At the time of appraisal, indigenous people were among the very poorest citizens of
Argentina with little or no access to basic socio-economic infrastructure and services, the result of
historical exclusion and discrimination. The indigenous population was estimated at around one
million or about 3 percent of the total population. However, they represented about 25% of the
rural population and a disproportionate share of the rural poor.

1.1.2    Actions taken by the Government: The 1994 Constitution acknowledged indigenous
people as an important part of the social and cultural fabric of the Argentine nation, and for the
first time recognized their pre-existence with respect to the nation as well as their rights over
communal territories. In 1995, Law No. 23.302 "Indigenous Policy and Assistance to Indigenous
Communities" created the National Institute for Indigenous Affairs (INAI), with a mandate to
develop legal and administrative mechanisms for individual and collective land tenure, identify
development needs of indigenous people (IP) and coordinate public sector investment in IP
development. The law also created a National Registry of Indigenous Communities under INAI.

1.1.3      Environmental management: From an environmental management perspective the
Project's timing was also right. An important aspiration of indigenous communities was to have
their territories declared as indigenous protected areas (IPAs). It was evident however, that many
issues needed to be addressed before IPAs could be made operational and sustainable, including
the design of sustainable-use systems for scarce resources and vulnerable eco-systems, addressing
agro-ecological constraints on resource-use practices, and strengthening indigenous managerial
capacity. In response, the Natural Parks Administration declared officially that it would reach
agreements with national and provincial entities responsible for the protection and development
of indigenous cultures to coordinate community development plans, provide guidance and control
over natural resource management through such plans; promote indigenous communities'
participation in preparing and acting on these plans; and promote the implementation of
development projects. Moreover, the Government of Argentina (GOA) was involved in an
ongoing effort with GEF support to develop norms, policies and practices to implement the
International Convention on the Protection of Biodiversity (1992), and to establish priorities and
action plans.     For this purpose, INAI had organized several national encounters among
indigenous peoples to ensure their participation in this process and the inclusion of indigenous
rights in any new legislation on protected areas.

1.1.4 The Government's strategy: In this context, GOA's strategy was to build on and strengthen
the social capital of indigenous organizations by supporting community-based management
systems and developing small-scale investment operations to be managed by indigenous
organization themselves. To support these efforts, in 1996 the Bank approved an Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) grant designed to strengthen the capacity of indigenous organizations
for planning, administration and dialogue with the government. The proposed project was a direct
product of the dialogue initiated by the Bank with elected indigenous representatives and GOA
officials, and was viewed as an early step in a long-term process of engagement (see 2.1).

1.1.5 Country Assistance Strategy: The Argentina CAS (dated June 27, 2000) underscored the
importance of improving the targeting and effectiveness of social assistance, and included as a
social development benchmark, the establishment of community-based projects in rural areas and
innovative partnerships for poverty reduction.        Environmental actions included promoting



                                                  1

sustainable growth with conservation of natural resources, and a key progress benchmark was
establishing and properly managing protected areas.

1.1.6 Bank involvement: The rationale for Bank involvement is implicit in the learning and
development issues described in the PAD (Section B3). The main issue to be addressed was how
to give operational expression to the concept of indigenous community-driven development.
While some progress had been made in strengthening INAI and substantial progress had been
made in land tenure security, further progress was hampered by lack of proven methodologies for
formulating sustainable development alternatives for indigenous groups, while issues of gender
discrimination in indigenous communities posed an additional development challenge.

1.1.7 The project was therefore proposed as a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) which would
explore different technological alternatives combining traditional and modern knowledge. The
expected implementation results would demonstrate the feasibility and potential for replication
under a scaled-up, follow-on operation that could cover a larger number of indigenous
communities and community clusters.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1    The Project development objective was to establish the basis for community-driven
development and the management and protection of natural resources on indigenous community
lands. This included strengthening social organization and culture, formulating local development
and natural resources management plans, and testing innovative approaches for addressing key
socio-economic and environmental issues in a gender-sensitive manner, as well as improving the
delivery of government services to indigenous peoples, reinforcing links between government
agencies and indigenous communities (cf. PAD Annex 1).

1.2.2    Key performance indicators for the Project Development Objective, cited explicitly in the
PAD (Section A1 and Annex 1) as the criteria for achieving success, were: (i) local and
indigenous social organizations legally recognized and functioning; (ii) indigenous communities
participating in capacity-building activities; (iii) mechanisms for solving land tenure conflicts in
communities developed and tested; (iv) legal framework for the creation of Indigenous Protected
Areas developed; (v) five-year community sustainable development plans designed; (vi) at least
two successful new types of economic alternatives identified and tested in each targeted area,
including activities led by women; (vii) increased adoption rates for sustainable productive
activities; and (viii) National Plan for Development of Indigenous Communities formulated.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

1.3.1    Neither the PDO nor the Key Indicators were revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1    The    main    beneficiaries   of  the    project  were   expected   to   be   indigenous
communities/peoples in the project's three original Indigenous Pilot Areas (API, not to be
confused with the aforementioned IPA or Indigenous Protected Areas): (i) the Mapuche territory
of Pulmari in Neuquen Province; (ii) the Diaguita-Calchaqui territory of Amaicha del
Valle/Quilmes in Tucuman Province; and (iii) the Kolla territory of Finca Santiago in Salta
Province. After the Project expansion of geographic areas/inclusion of new indigenous pilot



                                                   2

areas in 2004 (Section 1.7 below), the Project's target area was widened as follows: (i) expansion
of coverage in the Mapuche territory of Pulmari in Neuquén Province, and addition of the
Mapuche territory in Rio Negro Province; (ii) inclusion of the Kolla/Omaguaca/Atacama and
Guarani territories in Jujuy Province; and (iii) inclusion of Mbya Guaraní territories in Misiones
Province.

1.4.2   The direct and indirect beneficiaries from community subprojects under the two
Components of Social and Cultural Strengthening of Indigenous Communities and Sustainable
Natural Resources were expected at the time of appraisal to exceed 10,000 people, of which more
than 4,500 were expected to be women. Following the above-mentioned restructuring, and taking
into account the devaluation of the Argentine Peso versus the US dollar, the total number was
expected to increase to around 20,000 people. Finally, the proposed actions were expected to
strengthen INAI's capacity to take legal and regulatory actions related to project implementation,
although this was not spelled out explicitly in the PDO.

1.5 Original Components

The Project had three components and 15 subcomponents (see PAD Annex 2):1

1.5.1   Component 1: Social and Cultural Strengthening of Indigenous Communities
(US$1.6 million, 27.2% of total Project cost) financing capacity-building for self-development
and social/cultural strengthening, promoting activities closely-related to their traditional
knowledge and culture; technical assistance in legal and conflict resolution related to creation of
Indigenous Pilot Areas; and specialized technical assistance for INAI and indigenous
organizations to strengthen their capacity to take legal and regulatory actions in support of Project
implementation.     Sub-components included: (i) capacity-building and studies; (ii) technical
assistance in legal matters and conflict resolution; (iii) local planning; (iv) cultural exchanges and
gender workshops; (v) learning events; and (vi) improving basic social services.

1.5.2   Component 2: Sustainable Use of Natural Resources (US$2.20 million, 37.4% of
total Project cost) financing the formulation of a community-based natural resources management
plan for each API, delineating priority resources for conservation, defining areas for sustainable
development investments, and financing specific development subprojects. Subprojects would
require preparation of specific environmental mitigation mechanisms. The Bank loan would
finance environmental analyses, resource assessments, applied research, extension services,
soil/water/forest management planning and marketing studies for selected subprojects.
Subprojects would be financed on a demand-driven basis. A gender-sensitive approach was to be
adopted to ensure equal access to project goods and services, and a participatory social
assessment process launched during preparation was to be continued by community-based
organizations to identify social issues, conflict management mechanisms and potential equitable
solutions. Subcomponents included: (i) pilot water management and agricultural diversification
subprojects; (ii) pilot pasture and livestock management subprojects; (iii) pilot forestry and agro-
forestry subprojects; (iv) handicrafts production; (v) pilot eco- and ethno-tourism subprojects; and
(vi) basic infrastructure for production. Subproject eligibility criteria were included in the
Project's Operational Manual.




1Contingencies account for the remainder of total cost. See Annex 1, Table (a).




                                                          3

1.5.3     Component 3: Project Management (US$1.43 million, 23.3% of total Project cost).
This component financed the following subcomponents: (i) Project administration: incremental
costs of a Project Management Unit (PMU) in INAI and Local Management Units (LMU) in each
pilot area; hiring of technical advisors; and incremental equipment needs; (ii) Monitoring and
evaluation: financing consultants for a Technical Group to support design, implementation and
evaluation of subprojects; workshops, stakeholder events, beneficiary meetings; mid-term review
and an independent Development Impact Assessment; and (iii) Communications and
dissemination: supporting media contact/communication with indigenous communities and
stakeholders including distribution of studies, lessons learned and implementation progress.

1.6 Revised Components
Components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1     Geographic Expansion/Inclusion of new Indigenous Pilot Areas (2004): In light of
difficulties in committing Loan funds during the first three years after Board Approval, and a
protracted dispute between the Provincial Government of Neuquen and INAI over signature of a
cooperation agreement,2 GOA and the Bank decided to expand the geographic area of the Project
to include additional indigenous peoples and communities. Five new pilot areas were added
(through expansion of original areas and inclusion of new ones), extending the project's coverage
to 39 additional indigenous communities (for a total of 79, or about 10% of all legally registered
indigenous communities in Argentina),3 and doubling the number of project beneficiaries. New
lines of activities were added, including housing and social infrastructure (indigenous habitat) and
support was provided to national level activities on the policy framework for indigenous peoples
(cf. Section 2.2).

1.7.2     Restructuring to deepen the decentralized management of the Project (2005): Due to
difficulties with the flow of funds to indigenous communities, the Project underwent a de facto
restructuring in 2004 and 2005 to resolve a series of logistical and administrative bottlenecks,
mostly the result of complex administrative procedures to approve subprojects, transfer funds to
the communities and conduct procurement.                     Discussions to devise solutions to subproject
processing bottlenecks initially focused on outsourcing services but this was discarded in favor of
streamlining administrative procedures and devolving execution responsibilities to the indigenous
community level. This was viewed by the counterpart project team as a fairly drastic solution at
the time, but was ultimately a successful exercise in local empowerment with positive effects on
the Project.4 The Operational Manual was amended and procedures changed but the restructuring
did not involve amending the Loan Agreement or obtaining Board approval.

1.7.3     Extensions: There were three extensions of the Closing Date: (a) December, 2003 to
December, 2004 due to the effects on the Project of the national political and financial crisis
between late 2001 and early 2003. The Loan was just 10% disbursed but the implementation
outlook was improving as the national crisis eased; (b) December 2004 to June 2005, which was




2As noted in PSRs, the Provinces of Salta and Tucuman were fully behind the Project and signed cooperation
agreements with INAI, but Neuquen Province was reluctant to sign a similar agreement (not required under the Loan
Agreement).
3In 2006, there were 914 legally registered communities. This status permits indigenous communities inter alia to
obtain land title, manage projects, engage in legally binding contracts and be appellants in legal cases.
4For example, subproject processing time fell from 12 months in FY04 to 6 months in FY05 and 3 months in FY06.



                                                            4

an interim six-month extension granted in response to a request for a 30-month extension, during
which time convincing action was required to address bureaucratic barriers impeding the flow of
funds to communities; and (c) July 2005 to December 2006, an 18-month extension agreed by the
Regional Vice President on the basis of sharply accelerated project execution in response to the
quasi-restructuring of the project via amendments to the Operational Manual that streamlined and
decentralized subproject approval processes.

1.7.4      Reallocation of Funds:            The Bank agreed to a reallocation of Loan funds totaling
US$775,000 in July 2006,5 due to higher demand for community subprojects following the
expansion of project-eligible areas and the resulting need for more specialist services/consultants.

1.7.5      External Evaluation: Section 3.06 of the Loan Agreement called for the Borrower to
contract an external review of the performance of the Advisory Council, PMU, LMUs and
Technical Groups in the execution of the Project, and the impact of the community subprojects
for the benefit of the API, together with an analysis of the economic, financial, institutional and
environmental aspects of project implementation. The reviews were to be carried out by
independent consultants no later than: 18 months before the Closing Date, and 6 months before
the Closing Date, or such later date as the Bank would establish. As described later on, an
external evaluation was carried out in 2004 by SIEMPRO (to support the Mid-term Review--
MTR), but contracting of the final external evaluation was repeatedly delayed. This should be
seen in the context of generally weak Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) by the Implementing
Agency throughout implementation, only partially overcome through extensive efforts of the
Ministry of Social Development (MDS) and support from the Bank supervision team. Finally,
Government decided not to request another extension of the Loan to do the external evaluation,
but rather committed to doing it after Closing and with its own resources. Bank management, in
turn, agreed to a partial waiver of the condition in the Loan Agreement and to extend the date for
delivery of the external evaluation to the Bank. The Government, under TORs acceptable to the
Bank, called for proposals in December 2006. The group selected to do the evaluation, the
Universidad de Cuyo, conducted the field work and presented the draft report to Government in
November 2007 (later than the date agreed with the Bank and reflected in the waiver). The delay
hindered production of the Borrower's Completion Report and the Bank's ICR.

1.7.6      GEF Operation: An associated/complementary natural resources management project
financed by a GEF Grant was to complement this LIL, supporting biodiversity and the creation of
indigenous protected areas, training indigenous communities to maintain forests, soil and water
resources, and promoting eco-tourism. The GEF project did not materialize in the end, due to
delays brought on by the crisis and subsequent changes in priorities.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1.        Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis:




5This included reallocating: (i) a total of US$560,000 from Unallocated, with US$530,000 reallocated to Category 3
Community Subprojects, and US$30,000 to Category 2 Consultancies; (ii) US$200,000 from Category 4 Training
reallocated to Category 2 Consultancies; and (iii) US$15,000 from Category 1 Goods to Category 2 Consultancies (i.e.,
a total of US$254,000 for consultants).



                                                          5

2.1.1. This was the first project directly targeting indigenous populations that the Bank had
supported in Argentina. The main issue to be addressed by the Project was how to put into
operation the concept of indigenous community-driven development. The Project made a series
of strategic choices through highly participatory project preparation, a detailed social assessment
and careful targeting, so as to build capacity and generate both lessons and replicable experiences.

2.1.2   Project preparation was highly participatory, as a series of local, regional and national
capacity-building workshops were undertaken under the IDF grant (1997) that engaged
indigenous communities, local government institutions, NGOs and national institutions; identified
the Project; and agreed that a LIL was the most appropriate instrument for testing and learning
from the promising but unfamiliar CDD approach in specific Indigenous Pilot Areas (API). The
Social Assessment conducted during Project preparation was the vehicle through which
communities in the three API participated directly in defining project objectives, designing
components, formulating implementation arrangements and structuring management procedures.
The technical content of this assessment, including historical information, socioeconomic
analysis, environmental analysis and institutional analysis, was the direct outcome of this
participatory approach. In addition, indigenous consultants were responsible for assisting INAI
staff and the Bank in major aspects of project preparation and consultations were held with
traditional authorities and indigenous organizations in each territory (PAD, Annex 11). The
Social Assessment identified key characteristics of targeted indigenous groups, among the poorest
in Argentine society, and gender sensitivity came to be explicitly included as a feature of the
project objectives.

Assessment of Project design:

2.1.3   Objectives: Project objectives were relevant to indigenous development and concerns.
However, they sought to achieve multiple goals simultaneously using a CDD approach - a level
of decentralization not previously attempted - with a disadvantaged beneficiary population, via an
organization with acknowledged capacity weaknesses and within the LIL timeframe of three
years. To support such objectives (and project components), the project needed far more front-
loading of training and technical assistance, decentralized implementation arrangements that were
operationally-ready and greater understanding of and commitment to CDD throughout the
project-relevant political and institutional hierarchy. While the PAD mentions extensive capacity
building under the IDF grant, this was completed well before the LIL was approved and became
effective, so that erosion of capacity was inevitable.

2.1.4   Components:      The multiplicity of sub-components (15) under the three components
supporting project objectives, including investments in productive, income-generating activities,
land registration and regularization of property rights, conflict resolution, local planning and
natural resources conservation and management, required very strong management skills at all
levels and did not take account of the steep initial learning curve of such a project.

2.1.5   Organization: Due to the long history of conflictive relationships between indigenous
populations and provincial governments, the former resisted the idea of project implementation
through provincial governments, while these in turn were reluctant to adopt a CDD approach.
Therefore, taking into consideration the decision at the federal level to test the CDD model, an
agreement was reached between the federal and provincial governments, by which they would




                                                   6

endorse the execution of the Project in a decentralized manner in selected pilot areas, through a
new type of entity to be created--the Local Management Units (LMU).6

2.1.6      Local Management Units: The LMUs were an innovative approach to decentralization,
initially comprising a Project Manager/Administrator and a Secretary/Accountant, supported by
local technical specialists with wide knowledge of local circumstances and understanding of the
development challenges faced by indigenous peoples. This model was particularly successful in
many areas, but in some areas it suffered a lack of local experts with relevant knowledge to
support the indigenous communities, an issue common to CDD operations in remote rural areas.
Moreover, the Project's Operational Manual (and successive revisions until 2004) contrasted with
the originally envisaged decentralized approach, increasing complexity by incorporating prior
review for virtually all processes by the MDS and INAI (e.g. the LMUs were supposed to
approve subprojects up to US$50,000, but in the Operational Manual this threshold was
eliminated) until the quasi-restructuring of the project.

2.1.7      Advisory Council: The creation of an Advisory Council (AC) was another organizational
innovation whereby all the participating communities selected were represented by two leaders.
The AC was absolutely critical in the relationships between the indigenous communities and the
Government, on one side, and the indigenous communities and the Bank, on the other. This was
particularly evident at difficult moments in project implementation, e.g., when the demand for
Loan funds for subproject investments greatly exceeded availability (and expected demand) after
the Project was expanded geographically in 2004. In this case, the AC met, discussed and
reached an agreement on the distribution of available resources among the APIs.

2.1.8      Geographic Dispersion:            The geographic dispersion that characterizes indigenous
populations in Argentina entailed project design difficulties, both within the communities and
API, as well as at the overall level of the Project, which was implemented in different, distant
provinces where the communities are located. On the other hand, focusing on one province or on
fewer ethnic groups would not have permitted the extraction of relevant lessons, given the
important cultural and development differences among groups.

2.1.9      Capacity of implementing agencies: INAI's capacity was extremely weak and the Bank
fully understood that the risks associated with having INAI as the implementing agency were
substantial. Nonetheless, the decision was taken to locate the PMU in INAI so as not to ignore
INAI's mandate, and to mitigate this risk by providing funding and opportunities for capacity
building even though it was not a specific PDO. The Bank appraisal team saw few if any,
alternatives to these arrangements.7

Adequacy of Government's commitment:

2.1.11       At the time of appraisal, GOA had taken several actions to address poverty and
exclusion of indigenous peoples, including recognition of the territorial rights of indigenous
peoples and creation of INAI; satisfactory implementation of the IDF grant; and advancing on the



6Legally, the agreement of the provincial governments was not essential for project execution since it was not a
requirement of the Loan Agreement.
7The Borrower Completion Report is critical of the design of the PMU stating: "A project with these characteristics
should have had, from the start, an independent management agency with professional, multi-disciplinary human
resources exclusively in charge of project management. The land area that the project eventually encompassed and the
difficulties of financial and administrative decentralization and of subproject execution were not considered in the
operation's original design." The ICR notes that possible expansion of the project land area was envisaged at appraisal.



                                                           7

idea of creating indigenous protected areas, as in the partnership with the Mapuche communities
in Lanin National Park. Despite the evidence of commitment, Argentina's severe economic and
social crisis in 2001-02 virtually paralyzed the Project and the entire Bank portfolio. The Loan
was signed just months before the fall of the Administration that supported project preparation.
This situation was especially challenging for a small, pilot project for vulnerable, but relatively
few, rural indigenous people at a time when poverty was soaring in Buenos Aires.

Risk Assessment

2.1.12     Longstanding controversy surrounding indigenous peoples' land aspirations and status
in society, a novel CDD approach for these actors, political stresses between the central and
provincial governments, novel institutional arrangements to overcome tensions between
provincial governments and indigenous peoples, and weak institutional capacity, merited a
broader review of risk areas and categories and a rating of Substantial. For example, it was
unrealistic to assume (and rate as only a moderate risk) that an acknowledged, fragile institution
such as INAI would "coordinate with other government agencies and donors to improve
indigenous communities access to complementary goods and services such as water and
sanitation, health and education" and "create the conditions for effective procurement". Bank-
wide experience shows that CDD-based procurement carries significant risk, especially due to
often-weak project management and systems. Similarly, the assumption that newly-established
indigenous micro-enterprises could ride out adverse economic conditions because they respond
largely to local demand carried a higher than Negligible risk. In any case, the paralysis of the
Project during the national crisis meant this assumption could not even be tested.

2.2      Implementation

2.2.1    The LIL was designed at a time of strong interest within GOA in working with
indigenous peoples to improve their legal, social, cultural and economic position in society, but it
was hard hit by the national political and economic crisis even before it became effective. The
crisis led to five changes in government in three years and froze the Bank's entire portfolio during
2002 and early 2003. The project was a relatively low priority early in the new Government that
assumed office in 2003, and it suffered from weak implementation as the PMU centralized
control in Buenos Aires through cumbersome procedures for subproject processing. Barely $1m
had been disbursed, and little of it had reached the communities via subprojects. The Bank's
supervision team therefore at first proposed third-party administration to break the impasse, but
agreement was instead eventually reached in 2004 to expand the eligible API and subsequently in
2005 to streamline procedures, decentralize project management, and increase indigenous
participation and technical expertise in the LMUs. This breakthrough was effectively a project
restructuring, but was largely implemented through changes in the Operational Manual. The
project was extended and project funds began to reach communities through the subprojects,
generating significant benefits in terms of economic returns and community empowerment. The
strong accompaniment by local facilitators in the LMUs was critical to project success, and the
loan was fully disbursed as demand exceeded project resources.

2.2.2    The Project financed a total of 77 subprojects, 32 under Social and Cultural
Strengthening of Indigenous Communities, and 45 under Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.
This is almost four times more than the 21 sub-projects expected at Appraisal (six for agro-
forestry and eco-/ethno-tourism, and 15 for basic infrastructure).       The bulk of subprojects
investments were in water management for consumption and irrigation use (33%); construction of
community centers (19%); strengthening local capacity for community planning (14%); and



                                                 8

productive planning activities (13%), e.g., home gardens and diversification of agricultural
production and livestock.

2.2.3     Subprojects implemented in the six provinces were: Misiones (14), Neuquen (16), Jujuy
(4), Salta (22), Tucumán (13) and Rio Negro (8). Community support ranged from a minimum
10% to 20% of the total investment in most cases. At Project Closing, 19 subprojects out of the
77 still had works pending that were expected to be completed by July/August 2007, and their
completion has been physically confirmed as of the writing of this ICR. Overall, the project
reached more than 18,000 beneficiaries, compared to the 10,000 expected at appraisal.

2.2.4     Average investment per subproject was US$ 47,886. Investments ranged from US$
242,503 for an infrastructure subproject in Quilmes, including US$48,501 of counterpart funding,
to US$3,900 for a land tenure study in the India Quilmes community, including US$780 in
counterpart funds. The subproject decision-making process and criteria are explained in Annex 2,
paras 2.14-2.15. The following provides insight into issues affecting the Project's trajectory.

A. Factor contributing to successful implementation:

2.2.5     Extraordinary and persistent commitment by indigenous leaders and their
communities: Critical for successful project implementation was the indigenous communities'
support and need for the Project. Their intense commitment at the grassroots tided the Project
through the crisis and periods when government interest declined. Indigenous leaders committed
their time and their credibility to containing the frustration of communities waiting for long
periods for subproject approvals.8 When funds began to be transferred to the communities for
subprojects, the enthusiasm of the indigenous promoters and community members was evident, as
reflected in supervision Aide Memoires in the final two years of the Project.

2.2.6     Critical role of the LMUs: Project decentralization would never have advanced without
the expertise and commitment of LMU technical experts and their local project promoters. Apart
from the LMU's advantages in overcoming obstacles, the communities relied heavily on their
support during implementation. LMU experts knew the local circumstances, were committed to
the aspirations of indigenous peoples, and had open access to the communities as a result of the
trust they inspired. They also had appropriate expertise, e.g. environmental and engineering
skills/qualifications.        It must be noted that the original LMUs were envisaged as more
streamlined, but the increased participation of often indigenous technical experts in the LMUs
after project decentralization was critical to their success. The Project could have not been
implemented by the central PMU alone, due to its lack of local knowledge and relationship with
the communities, or through provincial government units, for reasons mentioned above.9

2.2.7     Expanded project coverage (2004): The area covered in the eligible API expanded from
340,000 ha to 1.6 million ha while the number of beneficiaries doubled to around 20,000. This
expansion proved even more successful than anticipated in stimulating demand and contributing



8This is clearly reflected in the emotional testimony of a female community leader from the Kolla Community in Jujuy
included in the institutional video prepared by the Bank supervision team, which is available at:
http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=7DE9DE4FDA8332DF.             Weeping, she explains how she dealt with the
situation and how she encouraged three highly conflicted groups to work together through patient negotiations.
9It can be concluded that CDD projects require massive front-loading of training, simple and appropriate implementing
arrangements befitting CDD, and a decentralized institutional structure which empowers local leaders, communities
and authorities. With these in place right at effectiveness, even the three-year timeframe of a LIL might have been
workable.



                                                            9

to the full commitment of loan resources under the category of community subprojects; the
downside is that the Project was unable to satisfy the demand created, with available financing.

2.2.8    Restructuring (2004-05):      The changes in subproject processing procedures and
resolution of logistical bottlenecks through greater decentralization to LMUs cut subproject
approval times from more than one year to barely three months. The Bank's supervision team
and teams from MDS and INAI developed the simplified administrative procedures and the
changes were written into the Operational Manual.

2.2.9    Bank supervision was hampered by the crisis and changes in Government until 2003, but
became more dynamic and intensive over time, bringing in CDD expertise from Brazil at a
critical juncture and greatly increasing local oversight through local consultants and CMU-based
staff, and strong involvement of the Sector Leader. While much of the groundwork for the
restructuring was laid before the change in Task Team Leadership in 2005, this change brought
an added impetus to the supervision. Frequent field visits to remote areas by Bank supervision
were important in understanding problems and verifying progress throughout implementation.

B. Factors hindering implementation:

2.2.10 Financial/social crisis: The national political, social and financial crisis from 2001-2003
saw repeated changes of government and authorities, fiscal austerity and other factors which
prevented effective implementation. Tight controls over public expenditures delayed the
contracting of personnel for the PMU and LMUs, prevented the purchase of essential vehicles
and equipment, and delayed salary payments to local project administrators (LMU) and
promoters in the pilot areas, who worked diligently but without payment for close to one year. By
end-2003--the original Closing Date--barely 10 percent of the loan had been disbursed.

2.2.11 Institutional conflicts and bureaucracy:          The institutional context was difficult.
Coordination at the national level between the PMU, INAI and the International Unit for
Administrative and Financial Coordination (UCAFI) was bureaucratic and complicated by
repeated changes in government which affected decision-making and workflow. INAI was weak
and politicized. Managers and staff were replaced in all three entities causing paralysis in 2003.
Finally, the relationship between the provincial government of Neuquén and indigenous
communities was troubled, the result of a dispute over jurisdiction and policy issues affecting
Project implementation. Bureaucratic procedures and massive paperwork requirements for
community subprojects--documents, signatures and certifications totaling up to 130 pages--
caused serious delays in subproject processing and financing. Further, final packages went all the
way up to ministerial level for sign-off and release of financing. One of the five presidents
assuming office in this period signed a decree giving him exclusive rights to sign all GOA
contracts with consultants.

2.2.12 Financial management arrangements: Project financial and administrative norms for
the indigenous communities were unsuitable.         The requirement for community-level SOEs
created serious difficulties due to the predominance and realities of the informal economy.
Further, subproject financing was disbursed in three or four installments regardless of subproject
size and with complicated procedures for submission of SOEs to different institutions and unclear
guidelines for disbursement of Project funds the PMU at times supported LMUs from its own
budget to avoid paralysis of community subproject processing. Communities had difficulties




                                                10

evidencing counterpart labor contributions, and the need for fiscal registration of beneficiaries
created delays. Solutions were finally devised to alleviate these obstacles.10

2.2.13 Procurement arrangements: Participating indigenous communities lacked authority to
contract consultants, local promoters or acquire goods and services on their own account (a
common characteristic of CDD), depending instead on the PMU and LMUs, which created
additional delays. This occurred even though MDS rules under model agreements for executing
organizations permitted subcontracting of goods and services by communities. The requirement
for three price quotes under procurement rules also caused hardship for many communities with
limited or no access to suppliers in their zone and led to longer subproject preparation times.11

2.2.14 Complexity and readiness to implement: A longer learning period with massive front-
loading of training/TA proved necessary to enable the developmental phase to advance.
Communities initially had difficulties just opening a bank account to deposit project funds, or
issuing payments to local contractors. Moreover, cultural practices meant that communities
needed time to meet and discuss members' views and reach agreement via consensus, so that
establishing priorities took time. This improved once technical experts and promoters experienced
in working with indigenous groups at the local level were contracted under the project.

Mid-term Review (MTR)

2.2.15 A survey-based evaluation (SIEMPRO, 2004) was conducted for the MTR (November
2004), a largely qualitative exercise drawn from beneficiary opinions and perceptions of the
Project. The low level of project execution meant there were few tangible results at the time.
However, the evaluation found: (a) positive views of the correlation between subprojects and the
levels and types of training and technical assistance received, especially in relation to other social
programs in their locales; (b) negative views about protracted delays in subproject processing ­
attributed by beneficiaries to the Project's vulnerability to political interference and excessively
bureaucratic requirements for subproject submission and implementation; but (c) beneficiaries
nevertheless maintained a good image of the Project, especially of LMUs which were seen as
efficient and committed. The table below summarizes key responses from the evaluation:

2.2.16 Decisions taken as a result of the MTR included: (a) completing, not closing the Project;
(b) expanding the project area and types of activities financed, (c) increasing the number of
beneficiaries; (d) extending the closing date; (e) approving and financing investment subprojects
already submitted by communities; (f) simplifying bureaucratic procedures; (g) permitting the
preparation of new subprojects; (h) increasing the supply of technical assistance; (i) increasing
the numbers of community promoters and re-training some of them; and (j) increasing the
economic and political capital of communities through the accelerated approval and financing of
subprojects.

in two installments for subprojects expected to exceed six months; training in financial administration for participating
indigenous communities; seminars and workshops for PMU, DGFAFI and LMU technicians.
11Solutions devised included preparation of standardized price lists and budgets based on market reviews; and
permitting legally registered participating communities to contract directly.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1     Monitoring: M&E was the weakest aspect of project implementation, rated
Unsatisfactory until the final ISR upgraded it to MU. Given the learning role of the LIL, this was
an important failing. Project coordination evolved without a planning culture in the PMU or
LMUs and without the efficient production and utilization of managerial information/data. This
made efficient monitoring of the Project difficult, and meant that there was no organized, modern
database resulting from an innovative Project with high demonstration potential. The principal
problem not so much a lack of data but rather a lack of a systems approach, i.e., computerized,
organized storage/retrieval capacity of standardized, essential data. The LMUs were found to
have large amounts of good data but there was no unified data-keeping format and the planned
M&E system linking all information from project sites to the PMU database was not established.
While the supervision missions consistently pressed for better data, provided advice and offered
consultant support to strengthen M&E, there was little commitment to this aspect of the project in
the PMU, and supervision missions routinely received progress reports from the PMU with
incomplete, inconsistent and un-aggregated project data (on subprojects and beneficiaries, as
opposed to generally reliable fiduciary data), that had to be verified via field visits.

2.3.2 Evaluation:          The Bank team tried hard throughout project execution to establish a
systematic evaluation program, without success. Nonetheless, a largely qualitative evaluation of
project performance was produced for the MTR (SIEMPRO, 2004) and an external evaluation of
satisfactory quality was ultimately delivered and discussed with the Government (Cuyo/Escolar,
2007). 12 The final evaluation was delivered after the Bank agreed to a waiver amending the
timing specified in the Loan Agreement for the external evaluation as GOA committed to
delivering it after closing at its own expense.




12The meeting's observations on the quality of the draft study have been conveyed by Government to the external
evaluators for further work/clarification. The Cuyo University evaluation team and the current PMU/DGFAFI team
found the Social Assessment's baseline for the three original API not to be acceptable. There was also a reluctance to
construct a baseline for the new, expanded areas using basic profiles collected during the preparation of subprojects, so
that no organized before/after comparisons were possible. (See ICR Sections 2.4, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.6, and Annex 5).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1    The objective of the Project was inter alia to "establish the basis for community-driven
development and the management and protection of natural resources on indigenous community
lands". Six safeguard policies (Indigenous Peoples, Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats,
Forestry, Pest Management and Cultural Property applied to the project.

2.4.2    Indigenous Peoples: The GOA conducted a participatory Social Assessment that
concluded that indigenous communities were ready to proceed with the project, although with
hindsight the degree of readiness was overestimated. Compliance with additional safeguard
policies was to be assured through screening of sub-projects to be financed during project
implementation. The Project itself fulfilled OD 4.20 requirements since indigenous peoples were
the Project's direct beneficiaries and participants and broadly supported the project, influenced its
design and were routinely consulted throughout implementation.

2.4.3    Environment: The Project was assigned a "B" environmental classification. Diagnostic
analyses conducted as part of project preparation, identified key environmental issues and
opportunities. Site-specific environmental analyses were conducted for the three pilot areas and
later for the expanded new areas. Natural resources management frameworks and an
Environmental Management Plan were prepared to mitigate adverse impacts. The Operational
Manual included procedures for implementing subprojects (proposing, selecting, prioritizing and
approving) and criteria included environmental screening. A high proportion of community
subproject investments were explicitly designed to conserve the environment and natural
resources. With regard to water supply investments, communities signed agreements with outside
entities to provide training on rational water use, organization of communities for the proper
functioning of systems, for maintenance and administration of the resource and to implement
better resource management practices generally.13

2.4.4    The final evaluation reviewed environment and natural resources management practices
and outcomes in detail for a representative set of subprojects based on interviews, on-site
inspection and consultations with specialists. It notes that many subprojects were insufficiently
mature to permit definitive conclusions, but the outlook is generally positive and the evaluation
made constructive recommendations (see also Sections 2.4, 6.0 and Annex 5). In particular: (a)
for crop improvement investments, indigenous communities were provided with the requisite
instructions to use chemical products successfully and in future would benefit further from more
information on the potential environmental impacts of agro-chemicals; (b) beneficiaries of water
supply investments for irrigation and consumption reported major reduction in the incidence of
water-borne disease, although uniform standards for water quality need more systematic
attention; (c) eco-tourism investments were very successful, generating positive effects on local
eco-systems by providing services in a more organized manner. The evaluation noted the
potential for collateral eco-damage with the (desired) upturn in tourist traffic and suggested that
each such subproject have a Tourist Resources Management Plan in addition to the environmental
evaluation; (d) pasture management investments targeting better production of animal herds on
exhausted lands showed that biomass productivity in newly-enclosed versus open areas had
markedly improved. To balance the number of cattle with the ecosystem's regenerative capacity,
the evaluation proposed diversified, multiple-use systems that enhance productive options for



13During implementation, compliance with other applicable safeguards policies (natural habitats, forestry, pest
management and cultural property) was rated Satisfactory but few details were provided. The external evaluation
analyzed the Project impact on archaeological sites (see Cuyo/Escolar 2007 and Annex 5).



                                                          13

poor farmers; and (e) investments in forest enrichment and new techniques for wood crafts were
intended to limit biodiversity losses and enrich forest areas overcome with inferior plants and
exhausted by over-grazing. Reforestation and fencing of cattle were highly successful, suggesting
a strong potential for replication of subprojects with both a conservation and productive potential.

Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.5   Procurement: A Procurement Post-Review conducted in April 2006 concluded that the
Project was risky, due to weak project management and systems rather than misprocurement per
se. Nonetheless, procurement processes overall were rated Satisfactory with only minor issues.

2.4.6   Financial Management: A Financial Management mission in 2005 downgraded project
financial management from Satisfactory to Moderately Unsatisfactory. The mission concluded
that community subprojects were well-implemented and no questions were raised as to the use
and eligibility of expenditures. However, it was noted that recommendations by the Bank and
auditors had not been adequately addressed, and that a weak control environment and numerous
administrative deficiencies were affecting the preparation of timely and reliable financial
information and Project Management Reports. The rating was upgraded again to Satisfactory in
mid-2006 once corrective measures were taken.

2.4.7   Audits: With the exception of the final Audit Report (AR), delivery of all other AR
greatly exceeded deadlines specified in the Loan Agreement and compliance with audit Action
Plans and other related requirements was generally slow for this project--the same was true for
many projects in the Argentine portfolio. The PIU financial statements were consistently
Qualified-Exception but not on accountability issues, while Special Opinions were Unqualified.
There were no Qualified opinions on the Continuing Entity. The Bank followed up closely with
the Borrower on auditors' recommendations and no pending issues remained at Closing.

2.4.8   Disbursement: Disbursements were seriously delayed until 2005 as shown in Table 2.1.
As of mid-2005, they had only reached US$2.4 million, but surged to US$4.1 million by June
2006 and remained rapid until Project Closing. Counterpart funds availability was less of an
issue than cumbersome bureaucratic procedures (cited earlier) and other causes. It should be
noted however, that while disbursements were lagging in 2002-03, indigenous facilitators were
working diligently at the grassroots to promote project objectives, disseminate information and
build capacity, but this is not reflected in disbursement activity. The disbursement curve was
similar to that of other Bank-supported CDD operations with an initial lag due to the macro crisis.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1   Follow-on operation:        The GOA has not yet confirmed its interest in a scaled-up
operation, despite achievements on the ground. INAI expressed commitment to search for
resources from other sources (including donors) to finance similar types of activities, and the


                                                  14

Task Team recommended in December 2006 that Bank support for indigenous communities be
explored under the Bank's portfolio in health, education, rural development, environment and
infrastructure.   Currently within MDS, there are several projects supporting indigenous
community development financed by national budget resources and using the Bank-supported
LIL as a methodological reference. Finally, the Bank team distributed a brochure for indigenous
communities outlining all Bank interventions in Argentina with indigenous components and
indicating how to access them.

3    ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High overall relevance

3.1.1    The Project Development Objective continues to have high overall relevance for
indigenous peoples in Argentina. In design terms, decentralized approaches which build social
capital along with socio-economic and productive assets, and which target the poorest
populations, remain a primary development tool in the Bank with an established track record in
many regions. There is clear evidence that the methodology developed in the Argentine context
by the LIL has positive impact and is replicable. The LIL also remains consistent with the
strategy in the CAS for Argentina 2006-2008 (June 2006), which supports the transition from
crisis recovery to sustained growth with continued poverty reduction and improved equity.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1    The PDO of establishing the basis for community-driven development and management
of natural resources on indigenous lands by strengthening social organization and culture,
formulating local development and natural resource management plans, and testing innovative
approaches to addressing key socio-economic and environmental issues in a gender sensitive
manner has been achieved. This finding is based on the final supervision mission as well as ICR
missions, conclusions of the Borrower Completion Report and findings of the independent,
external evaluation based on field inspection of subprojects, focus group discussions and direct
interviews, as well as an opinion survey of beneficiaries and local stakeholders (Cuyo/Escolar
2007; see 3.6 and Annex 5).

3.2.2    The Project specified eight Outcome Indicators for the Project Development Objectives,
described below.     In addition, it identified two indicators for the Follow-on Development
Objectives (PAD p. 14). These were: (a) acknowledgment by indigenous communities that living
conditions are improving; and (b) objective measures of quality of life. As evidence of (a), the
economic analysis conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 2007, see Annex
3) found that investments in agro-productive activities, irrigation systems and handcrafts showed
actual/potential IRRs exceeding 20% with net incremental benefits per family/year of US$2,340,
US$ 4,200 and US$720 respectively, as well as substantial increases in production area and
yields, and diversification of production. In regard to (b), the Cuyo/Escolar (2007) evaluation
Opinion Survey (see Annex 5) saw 54% of respondents rate the Project as excellent, very good or
good.     Cuyo/Escolar also reported dramatic reduction in water-borne disease, especially in
children <3 years. The FAO (2007) field team noted improved nutritional status especially of




                                               15

children <3 years, a 20% decrease in malnutrition in some communities, improved school
attendance and access to health centers.14

A. Strengthening social organization and culture and formulating local development and
natural resource management plans

3.2.3      Local indigenous social organizations are legally recognized and functioning. At
Project Closing, there were a total of 914 legally registered and functioning indigenous
communities, an increase of 504 (123%) relative to the 410 that existed at Project outset in 2000.
Importantly, in some areas the most dynamic, participatory and strengthened groups were youth-
led with greater capacity for interaction with non-indigenous society and a stronger instinct for
publicly-challenging that society on key issues facing indigenous peoples. The final evaluation
pointed to a highly positive impact on consolidating and strengthening indigenous pueblos as
important actors in municipal and provincial affairs (not always without conflict with local
authorities, who began to experience demands from empowered indigenous organizations).

3.2.4      Indigenous communities participated in capacity building activities. An estimated
10,000 indigenous people participated in project-financed workshops to support the process of
registration and capacity-building of indigenous organizations, and there were community
subprojects in each API specifically aimed at strengthening the social and cultural conditions of
indigenous organizations. The Cuyo/Escolar (2007) evaluation found that project-sponsored
workshops and focus groups promoted greater community participation in demands for land
rights, health, education and control over resources. It observes that these efforts successfully
strengthened local indigenous organizations while having positive albeit variable impact (area to
area) on the strengthening and revaluation of cultural practices and values.15

3.2.5      Mechanisms are in place and working to resolve land tenure conflicts. Workshops on
conflict resolution and indigenous land rights and titling studies were financed for the first time
under CSPs in the API. These mechanisms have already contributed to resolving land tenure
conflicts. As a direct result of project activities: (a) one indigenous community finalized the land
tenure regularization process; (b) eight indigenous communities finalized land rights and titling
studies and made formal presentations to authorities for regularization; and (c) one indigenous
community was approved for land tenure. Further, four critical laws linked to land regularization
were enacted as a direct result of the Project, most importantly, Law No. 26.160: Emergencia de
la Propiedad Comunitaria Indigena. The Cuyo evaluation found convincing evidence that the
Project strengthened indigenous groups in their lands of origin, in a number of ways.16




14Project-induced capacity formation and better organizational skills had already been leveraged to obtain additional
benefits, e.g. electricity in some communities. Out-migration was slowing and former residents were returning,
attracted by better living conditions. Young people were a high proportion of these, indicating the expectation that a
better life was possible after the Project.

15Responses on whether cultural practices and values were strengthened could depend on the age/type of participants
in the respective focus group. Composition of the latter is not known. Older community members/leaders would be
better-equipped to answer such questions critically.
16 For example, the Land Study subproject in India Quilmes resulted in a body of documentation enabling the
reconstruction of communities' histories and establishing the legal basis for ratification of territorial rights. Similarly,
in Pulmari, Finca Santiago and Amaicha, many subprojects had the practical effect of strengthening communities'
control over territory, and in training communities and their authorities/leaders in resource management and indigenous
rights. Finally, in other indigenous communities the possibility of increasing agricultural production through the



                                                          16

3.2.6      A major achievement saw Mapuche indigenous communities and the Administracion
Nacional de Parques Naturales (APN) establish a partnership for the co-management of the
Lanin National Park in Patagonia. The Project provided support to strengthen this arrangement
which was considered best practice and intended by APN for replication in nine additional
National Parks. Moreover, since project closing, APN has announced that it intends to work with
indigenous communities in all natural parks nationwide due to the success and potential of the
Lanin experience, which is further indication of the commitment and buy-in always displayed by
APN for project objectives.

3.2.7      The planned indigenous protected areas legal framework was not formulated. While it
had been proposed by indigenous communities during project design, the Project's Advisory
Council representing the indigenous beneficiaries decided not to develop it because it would
benefit very few communities included in the LIL and because the proposed GEF project that was
intended to support this initiative was never presented to the Board (see 1.7).

3.2.8      Local development and natural resource management plans were formulated. There
has been a successful integration of sustainable natural resources management plans and practices
into community development plans (CDPs) and into subproject investments.                                  CDPs were
prepared in the three original API during project design, and in two of the new, expanded API
incorporated in late 2004 (Pulmari and Finca Santiago).                       In all cases, the CDPs included
sustainable natural resources management practices, and these practices were implemented
successfully with Project support. Although CDPs were not prepared in three newly incorporated
API, sustainable natural resources management practices were built into subprojects, which in
turn were prioritized by communities. The final evaluation confirmed that the subprojects
fostered the improved use and protection of natural resources and saw this as a highly positive
outcome. Communities reported and demonstrated better habits, forms of production, crop
diversification favoring natural resources conservation, and better utilization of available
resources. This was manifested in three ways: (a) execution of natural resource-focused
subprojects with economic goals/benefits; (b) practices promoting greater sustainability of
resource use; and (c) the preparation and execution of integrated development plans and strategies
for larger-scale         management of           natural resources.             Indigenous communities also
applied/combined their own traditional knowledge of natural resources and agricultural
techniques. Important positive lessons (cf. Section 2.4 above) emerged from these experiences.

B. Testing innovative approaches to addressing key socioeconomic and environmental issues in
a gender-sensitive manner.

3.2.9      Several successful new types of economic alternatives were identified and tested in
each targeted area. The following subprojects were implemented in the API: Development of
productive farming (15); Provision of water for human consumption and irrigation (16); Micro-
credit/revolving funds (3); Development of handicrafts (2); Forest recovery and development (2);
and Eco-tourism (4). Both the Cuyo evaluation and FAO economic analysis indicate that these
types of investments can have good returns and are already helping to improve productivity and
social capital (see Annexes 3 and 5). For example, the micro credit/revolving funds (recuperation
of a traditional indigenous solidarity system), originally applied to the agricultural sector, are now




installation of irrigation subprojects, along with credit, permitted the actual/potential effective reoccupation of areas
previously in decline and/or de-population.



                                                           17

being extended to other economic sectors in view of their success, such as handicrafts and the
provision of water for irrigation.

3.2.10 There is an on-going process of technology adoption that should lead to increased
productivity and income for project beneficiaries. With support from LMU technical experts,
participating communities have adopted new technologies that are increasing or have a good
potential for increasing, productivity and income (cf. Annex 3). For example, in forest
management, communities living in the Nahuel Huapi National Park in Rio Negro have
incorporated the use of wood clearing/cutting and timber for deadwood management to prevent
potential fire hazard in the forest. APN is now contracting the management of deadwood to those
indigenous communities. For handicrafts, communities in Finca Santiago and Diaguita Calchaqui
introduced new technologies for the preparation of wool, clay and wood used to produce
handicrafts, improving the production process as well as the quality and price of the final product.
In agriculture, irrigated farming technologies were introduced in areas previously dependent on
rain, with positive (preliminary) IRRs (see 3.3 below).       In the cases observed where new
technologies were introduced, production, productivity and quality were rising, along with
product value. The prospects for income gains were good although obviously, definitive
assessments are premature and these technologies/experiences need to be consolidated, studied
further and expanded.

3.2.11 Gender sensitivity was addressed with promising outcomes. The Project was to promote
gender-sensitivity in all project activities to establish new avenues for women's empowerment
and expression. In some APIs they participated in both economic activities and leadership roles,
while a large number constituted project-related groups and associations. Some 8,000 women
were direct beneficiaries of training, workshops and capacity building; about 4,550 women
benefited directly from subproject investments, slowly gaining greater voice and potential to
derive economic benefits; 63 women were members of indigenous board commissions and 60
percent of the promoters and administrative auxiliaries in the API were indigenous women; and
about 60 percent of all subprojects involved women's participation in some form. In Amaicha
(Tucumán Province), five of the six Advisory Council members were women. Female heads of
household also became eligible to receive land title on an equal footing within communities titled.
These developments are very promising, paving the way for gender approaches under a wide
range of other public programs, including those supported by the Bank. Nevertheless, in some
participating API, women's empowerment remains incipient. Cultural traditions persist whereby
women cannot easily adapt to non-indigenous concepts of empowerment and autonomous action,
especially not in the course of one pilot project.

3.2.12 Government services delivery/reinforced links between indigenous communities and
government. There are important examples of improved government services in the APIs and
improved linkages between indigenous communities and government as a result of the Project:
(a) provincial governments are providing nurses and teachers for new health centers and schools
constructed or rehabilitated with Project support; (b) in Salta, the government has included a
budgetary allocation to construct a school in Volcan Higueras to complement Project support in
that remote community; (c) in Misiones, INAI committed to complement project support through
improved access roads to and energy connection for communities in Guiray (since confirmed);
(d) the aforementioned co-management model in Lanin National Park is being replicated other
national parks, evidencing greatly strengthened linkages between the APN and communities; (e)
an Indigenous Peoples Directorate has been created in the Secretariat of Environment and the
(Mapuche) Project Coordinator for the LIL has been appointed as Director; (f) federal, provincial
and municipal regulations were enacted to protect, develop, recognize and promote indigenous
people and culture; and (g) provisions on indigenous peoples' rights were introduced in the


                                                  18

provincial constitutions in Neuquén and Tucumán, with Project support. Finally, institutional
agreements were established between indigenous organizations and various governmental
agencies: 47 agreements were signed, including with APN, the Agro-livestock Social Program
under the Secretariat of Agriculture, the Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), NGOs,
universities, public hospitals, the National Secretariat of Human Rights, and national and
provincial Secretariats of Tourism.

3.2.13 National Plan for Indigenous Communities Development: In 2004, seven regional fora
in 2004 discussed and agreed on four priority themes--Legal Status, Territory, Biodiversity and
Cultural Plurality--for which indigenous leaders and their communities sought systematic policy
and programmatic responses from the national government. A National Forum in 2005, including
the MDS, INAI and the Project, presented the aggregate conclusions in the form of a national
plan now viewed as providing the organizing principles and framework for future programs and
policies affecting indigenous peoples in Argentina.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 The Indigenous Community Development LIL was the first project for indigenous people
applying a participatory approach and self-development. No economic or financial analysis of the
project was undertaken during preparation, limiting the evaluation of incremental benefits at end-
Project. However, two separate and independent economic analyses were conducted, by the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO,2007),               17  and by the Cuyo/Escolar evaluation team18 with
positive but uneven results. The ICR stresses that these analyses are preliminary given the
relatively recent completion and entry into operation of many community subprojects and need
for their consolidation and maturation. Nevertheless, the outlook is promising. The Cuyo analysis
shows generally higher IRR's overall than the more conservative FAO analysis, an important
reason being more conservative estimates of returns in the latter analysis.                            FAO's more
conservative approach yields IRRs ranging from 20.2% to 23.7% for an irrigation system and a
revolving fund, respectively, under an average scenario. In the case of Cuyo, IRRs range from a
low of 30% for a water supply for human consumption and irrigation, to 230% and 113%
respectively, for a revolving fund financing vegetable and alfalfa production. All cases examined
in both analyses show financial viability and IRRs exceeding the opportunity cost of capital (see
Annex 3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1     The rating is based on the following considerations:

(a) Project objectives were relevant to the needs of indigenous communities in the pilot areas and
components were consistent with Project objectives, even though this ICR considers both to have




17FAO analyzed ten subprojects, five in Tucuman: Handicraft activities (API Amaicha-Quilmes); Provision and use of
sustainable water (Community of         Quilmes); Sustainable use of natural resources (Torna-Amaicha-Quilmes);
Community irrigation system (Los Colorados);         Community water provision (El Paso);      and five in Misiones:
Productive activities (Peruti); handicraft house (Iriapú); Strengthening of socio-productive capacities (Community of
Fortín Mbororé); Productive activities (Guiray); and Productive activities (Fracan).
18Cuyo/Escolar analyzed five community subprojects: Tourism Support (campsites in Quilahintos, API Pulmari);
Water for Human/Irrigation Consumption (Anajuana Community, API Amaicha); Revolving Fund (API Amaicha
Quilmes); Eco-tourism (API Finca Santiago); and Productive Enterprise (API Misiones).



                                                           19

been ambitious for a small, US$5.0 million experimental operation with a short timeframe. The
development priority remains relevant;

(b) Project objectives were largely achieved but over a period longer than planned, a fact which
does not diminish project achievements given the late start of critical activities. There was a
sharp, albeit late, structural break in the Project's performance and trajectory resulting from the
combination of geographic expansion, institutional decentralization more appropriate to CDD and
simplified processing arrangements. The communities found the CDD methodology developed
by the project to be appropriate for their development, and the project was eventually fully
disbursed with positive results, including significantly positive (albeit preliminary) rates of return
on a majority of subprojects analyzed after Project Closing, (described in 3.2-3.3 and Annex 3);19
(c) The Project made important gains in human capital formation, environmental management,
and the legal rights of indigenous communities, achieving a complex set of Learning and
Innovation Expectations (of an economic, social, participation, environmental, institutional and
technical nature) outlined in the PAD;

(d) The Project produced important lessons for future, similar operations and for the national and
provincial governments of Argentina, which in and of itself is evidence of a successful LIL; and

(e) The Project reached significantly more beneficiaries through significantly more subprojects
than was considered feasible at appraisal, (18,000 beneficiaries versus 10,000 expected at
appraisal, in 77 subprojects rather than 21 as specified in Annex 1 of the PAD), and a majority of
beneficiaries surveyed considered the project to have been a success (see Annex 5).

3.4.2      Despite significant evidence of the project's impact, the ICR team rates achievement of
the PDO as no more than Moderately Satisfactory, given severe shortcomings in the project's
M&E and weaknesses in the Cuyo/Escolar external evaluation. Poor M&E can be seen as an
important missed opportunity, since there is substantial information available at the local level in
the LMUs and in communities, supporting the findings of project success, but systematic M&E
and organized aggregation of data could not be achieved. Moreover, another missed opportunity
was to strengthen INAI. This was not an explicit project objective, but it was supported and
tangible gains proved elusive.20

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1      Poverty impacts:       The potential for increases in family income and hence poverty
reduction are suggested by the results of the financial analyses summarized in 3.3 and detailed in


19 The CDD methodology involved five main steps: 1) communities were mobilized and the LIL was explained.
Community Promoters were selected by communities through a public competition; 2) communities discussed their
priorities in community meetings, documented in records known as Actas Comunitarias. In general only community
members participated in these meetings; 3) LMUs helped communities develop subproject proposals. Communities
accepted the project design, designating community members to be responsible for the execution and for the financial
aspects through an Acta Comunitaria. In many cases, the PMU was involved in this step of the subproject cycle. 4) The
subproject was submitted to PIU and when PIU approved (technical and financial aspects were revised), some
subproject were sent to WB for prior No Objection. 5) An agreement were signed between community and INAI (first
it was signed between the Minister of social Development and community)

20 The longer-term capacity of INAI is unclear. Issues of this kind were intended to be studied by the Cuyo evaluation
team, based on the Bank-approved TOR, but are not covered in the final evaluation report.



                                                         20

Annex 3. Further, the external evaluation found that while on balance the project's full economic
potential had not yet been developed, several types of subprojects already showed positive
income effects in the short to medium term, and were already covering beneficiaries' basic needs.
Another positive impact observed was reduced out-migration of young community members due
to increased prospects for income generation in their communities.

3.5.2    Distribution of benefits: The LIL effectively reached some of the poorest populations in
Argentina, namely indigenous rural inhabitants. Even so, the MTR study and the final evaluation
confirmed that there can be inequality within indigenous communities, project investments did
not reach every member within some communities, and there can be "inequities in the
representation of interests, participation and benefits within and between communities"
(SIEMPRO, 2004).             There were also difficulties associated with project information
dissemination (noted in supervision reports) and achieving reasonable participation rates in
dispersed, smaller and poorer communities with physical access issues (Cuyo/Escolar 2007).21

3.5.3    Social development: Interviews and focal group sessions by the evaluation team noted a
marked increase in social capital as a result of the Project. Bonding capital evolved as community
members (including large numbers of women) participated directly in seeking information,
organization and open/democratic management. Community organizations strengthened local
planning and came to resolve issues and conflicts through greater participation. Youth out-
migration slowed as they perceived the benefits of working cooperatively. Bridging capital was
also evident in community groups seeking direct interaction with municipal, provincial and
national authorities. One of the Project's critical gains was that LMU personnel and beneficiaries
acquired relevant knowledge and skills (e.g. legal/accounting) to interact effectively with diverse
institutions, including international ones such as the Bank. (See Section 3.2 C and Annex 5).
Indeed, a major development that went beyond expectations at appraisal was the empowerment of
indigenous communities to a point that they could leverage their new knowledge and experiences
to secure additional benefits and promote their interests in practical ways following completion of
their subproject and/or after project closing.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4    Institutional strengthening was a project development objective.                     While there were
shortcomings with respect to INAI, LMUs and the communities/organizations acquired
knowledge and practical skills in natural resource management techniques for varied subprojects,
simple accounting and book-keeping, administrative skills, procurement practices, subproject
operation and maintenance, and technical applications for specialized subprojects such as eco-
tourism promotion, pasture development and irrigated farming. As noted above, they also learned
to interact with diverse institutions, including international. Even after project closing, LMUs
remained active and part of the cadre of local community development specialists in the LMUs
was contracted by INAI under authority of the Ministry of Social Development. In all cases
cited, the Cuyo/Escolar evaluation found the Project was instrumental in either prompting such
outcomes or further strengthening them.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)




21While the 2004 geographic expansion complicated the distribution of resources and benefits, and created excess
demand that could not be financed by the Project, unsatisfied demand tends to be characteristic of CDD operations, a
follow-on project could have absorbed much of this demand, and some of it is being addressed with other resources.



                                                        21

3.5.5    A number of developments were not originally contemplated or expected, including the
degree of empowerment of indigenous organizations (described above), and the inclusion of
certain stakeholders traditionally excluded from political and managerial/development decision-
making within their communities, e.g. Mapuche youth in Neuquen Province, who have become
increasingly active within their communities and organizations. Also unforeseen but identified
by the Cuyo evaluation field interviews and focus groups, was that beneficiary families in some
communities said they could afford to send their children more regularly to school as a result of
their subprojects.22 The strength of GOA's commitment to working with indigenous communities
through co-management arrangements more broadly, modeled on the successful experience in
Lanin National Park, was also not foreseen. Finally, in relation to conflict management, evidence
suggests that expectation-driven competition over access to information, the project and hence
subproject resources arose in some indigenous communities and organizations, exacerbating
existing tensions which are both common and often protracted among indigenous groups in
Argentina.      Project conflict resolution activities were vigorous and effective, however. In
Pulmari, disagreements caused the north and south zones to have two separate councils but by
end-project, a unified council was created. Similarly, Quilmes and Amaicha signed an agreement
to jointly submit subprojects, which would have been impossible before the Project. The film
produced by the Bank project team graphically describes project-supported conflict resolution
efforts and outcomes.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

1.7.5    The National University of Cuyo (Mendoza Province) conducted the final, independent
evaluation and beneficiary survey (see Annex 5) using a multi-disciplinary team from the fields
of anthropology, sociology, biology, economics and civil engineering.23 Key findings of the
opinion survey of beneficiaries are summarized below:

(a) Communications: Communities were generally aware of the existence of poverty programs
in their areas. About 80% knew of the LIL specifically but only 30% well. Knowledge varied by
API and depended on when the community had entered the Project, with most entering after 2004
as area expanded and conditions improved. A high proportion had received an explanation of the
Project but this did not necessarily equate with understanding; the percentage not understanding
fully was higher than expected despite the many Project-sponsored workshops, seminars and
local diffusion activities.

(b) Participation: About 53% of interviewees had benefited from a subproject either individually
or as a household (a high of 97% in Misiones and low of 38% in Salta). About 36% responded
positively to having participated actively in both selecting and preparing subprojects. Reasons for
modest responses are suggested by the Cuyo study as: (i) some concentration of subproject
financing; and/or (ii) benefiting without knowing it within a fluid indigenous community context.
The ICR notes that an additional factor may be the small loan amount relative to the project area.




22This assertion implies income improvements but was not quantified by Cuyo.

23Evaluación de Cierre del Proyecto Desarollo de Comunidades Indígenas (DCI) ­ Informe Final, Escolar/
Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, October 2007. The evaluation was Government-financed. The report is of generally
adequate quality, although incomplete on some elements of the agreed TORs. Its methodology comprised beneficiary
opinion surveys, focus group discussions, direct interviews, and physical inspection of subprojects



                                                          22

(c) Technical assistance, resources management and objectives:                          Respondents were quite
positive about the frequency of TA visits, more commonly noting weekly or monthly intervals, a
positive sign for a CDD project. About half were not surprisingly critical of the delays in getting
a subproject approved and executed but responses from communities in late-entering APIs were
more positive (as implementing conditions had improved). About 45% felt the Project had
achieved its objectives and 50% of those felt all objectives were achieved, a significant result.
However, over 50% were unable to respond, possibly due to language barriers (Spanish is not
spoken in some APIs) and/or lack of information.

(d) Community views on project difficulties: Results were promising in regard to communities'
overall view of the project: 54% saw the Project as excellent, very good or good. Only 3%
viewed it as bad/very bad. Communities saw the primary success of the Project as its capacity to:
(i) resolve water supply deficits; (ii) foster the acquisition of learning/knowledge; and (iii)
provide materials for construction.

4.0 ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
Rating: Moderate

4.0.1     Sustainability: Several factors increase the likelihood that project development outcomes
will be realized and/or maintained. They include: enhanced recognition of indigenous people's
rights; enactment of federal, provincial and municipal laws supporting indigenous priorities;
linkages established between indigenous communities and government; alliances and
collaborative agreements with other outside entities; and the continuation of the work of LMUs
with staff and local specialists trained in decentralized administration of development subprojects.
In addition, this ICR highlights the human capital development and empowerment achieved under
the project, operation and maintenance arrangements for sustaining investments and
internalization of natural resources management practices on community lands.

4.0.2 Human capital and empowerment:                         Strong evidence from the field after closing,
especially in the Provinces of Salta and Misiones, demonstrates the extent to which the Project
fostered human capital formation and the empowerment of indigenous communities.                                   For
example, the communities have applied their knowledge to obtain investments from other public
programs in roads, energy and schools. Project-financed training and the subproject cycle
itself--from planning, budgeting, engineering design, supervision, financial accountability and
interaction with non-indigenous entities at all levels--have taught indigenous communities how
to represent their interests and needs persuasively at the highest levels.

4.0.3     Operation and maintenance (O&M):                     The ICR mission in May 2007 found that
irrigation and potable water investments visited had arrangements in place and were charging
user fees to cover O&M. All project-financed water investments included a workshop on
irrigation water usage laws, common rights to water resources and guidance on setting up a
community O&M fund to ensure longer-term operation of systems and replacement of parts.
Training and organization was financed to ensure correct O&M of equipment, and to designate
community members as operators.                   Water usage schedules, rights and obligations were
established.24 In the case of road improvement investments, the community leader generally



24Public consultations in February 2007 associated with the post-completion/learning phase showed broad awareness
of and participation in O&M training, revolving funds for O&M and water usage/conservation techniques for
agriculture, cattle-herding and craftwork, on the part of attendees from various API. Field visits showed such systems
in operation, and with maintenance procedures established.



                                                           23

handles O&M arrangements with community members supplying labor.                   Project-financed
community centers charge a small fee for community members using the center for product
marketing. In the case of the three Revolving Funds financed by the Project, the ICR mission
found them to be trouble-free, functioning effectively with social controls in place to
resist/penalize malfeasance.

4.0.4    Environmental Management: As described in 3.2A, with project support, sustainable
natural resource plans have been integrated into all community development plans and subproject
investments, and the Cuyo evaluation verified--through field interviews--that communities
understood how to establish and routinely apply sustainable natural resource management
practices.   Communities also demonstrated better NRM habits, forms of production, crop
diversification favoring natural resource conservation and better use of available resources.

5.       ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.1    The Argentina Indigenous Community LIL was one of a growing number of innovative
social development projects in LCR addressing the needs of indigenous peoples. It was based on
several background studies, in-depth consultations with local indigenous communities and an IDF
that provided extensive training courses.     The Project had a strong social rationale, sound
analytical foundations, was highly relevant to community needs and included appropriate
components to address them, and its preparation was inclusive, participatory and transparent.

5.1.2    As stated previously however, project design was overly ambitious. Program design was
not matched to the very real constraints imposed by a three year operation with inexperienced
stakeholders, and both the initial learning curve and risks were under-estimated.              One
shortcoming is that no ERR/FRR analysis was done at appraisal and project indicators were not
quantified until implementation. Given the learning goals of the LIL, M&E should have been
ready to launch at effectiveness, but the PAD provides little detail on M&E plans. Moreover,
INAI was institutionally unable to implement the project as conceived and the proposed capacity
enhancement activities had only a modest impact before or during the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3    Project supervision was challenging from the outset, as reflected in Aide Memoires. The
Project was approved in September 2000 and not effective until May 2002. The Bank's entire
Argentina portfolio was essentially frozen from shortly after effectiveness to 2003. National
crises, repeated leadership changes and tight fiscal policies implied a complex task of keeping the
project on track. The Administration which assumed office in 2003 lacked commitment to the
LIL and its decentralized methodology, and tried to re-centralize implementation, meeting strong
and successful counter-efforts from the Bank supervision team aimed at decentralizing the project
more effectively, simplifying persistent processing bottlenecks as part of a restructuring, and
improving overall performance.      The Bank's supervision team may have acted too slowly to
close the subproject pipeline, leaving a significant number of subproject proposals hanging
without defined financing options when loan proceeds were fully committed. Some of these



                                                24

subproject proposals have since been financed by INAI and others by GEF, while still others
continue to wait for financing.25

5.1.4     The supervision team conducted regular missions twice yearly--with four missions in
CY 2003--and made numerous field visits to remote communities.                                  Supervision missions
included environmental expertise and environmental aspects of the project were continuously
under review by the CMU including issuance of no objections for environmental design aspects
of specific subprojects. M&E, despite enormous efforts by the project Team, did not progress,
leaving a rich and valuable LIL experience without an organized database.

5.1.5     The approach to problem-solving was rigorous but this tough stance is not reflected in the
realism of DO and IP ratings which were uniformly Satisfactory until mid-2003, despite project
performance. At that point, IP was downgraded to Unsatisfactory, but DO stayed at Satisfactory
with under 10% of the Loan disbursed and few investment subprojects implemented. Fiduciary
reviews could have been more frequent for a CDD project however the problem with delayed
audits went beyond this project and was widespread throughout the Argentina portfolio, requiring
action at a CMU level. The proactivity and intensity of Bank supervision increased after 2004
and about 80% of project disbursements occurred over the last two years of the loan.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.6     The Project was innovative and sought to capitalize on the GOA's growing attention to
improving the lives of indigenous citizens. While the project contained significant design flaws,
described above, other issues would have derailed even the best-designed operation under the
circumstances and were beyond the Bank's control. Strong supervision leading to an informally
restructured operation gave the project the opportunity to implement in line with appraisal,
leverage important knowledge and lessons, and achieve its objectives, despite shortcomings
essentially in the area of M&E.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.7     Project design was consistent with the GOA's strategy for supporting indigenous peoples
at that time. INAI was established specifically to execute this policy. However the Administration
that prepared the Project and supported its goals was not the Administration that executed it.
Further, INAI remained an agency of low rank in the hierarchy and with little autonomy. Its
foundation law was never fully applied and it was vulnerable to political pressure. There was
little commitment to strengthening INAI even on the part of its own leadership, due to the
predominance of political pressures, and there was significant turnover during the project, as well
as limited budget resources and inadequate administrative and financial capacity or presence in
the countryside, all of which hampered performance.



25The ICR questions the wisdom of the geographic expansion pf project area. The appraisal TTL stated that such
expansion was contemplated at the project design stage but this does not resolve the doubt. The expansion prompted
(as intended) sharply increased demand which available LIL funds could only partly finance. Thus, at Closing a
significant portfolio of subproject proposals still existed with no defined financing options. Some have since been
financed by INAI, others by GEF, while others still await financing.



                                                            25

5.1.8    After an uneven relationship with the project in the initial years, MDS came to supply the
administrative, financial and legal capacity that INAI lacked. Its decision to strengthen its
involvement with the Project and its role and support in the countryside from 2004 onwards were
important elements boosting project performance and results in the final years. Similarly, the
Ministry of Economy was supportive of the project and adopted a strong stance on pushing
forward the changes introduced to speed project execution.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.9    PMU: During preparation, the Bank considered using INAI's own staff to coordinate the
Project but it was soon apparent that INAI lacked capacity and a separate PMU was the only
means to ensure implementation. The PMU was created within INAI in 2002, but due to the
crisis it was not fully staffed until 2004. Responsible for overall Project coordination and
monitoring, the mid-term review, evaluation and reporting, its performance suffered as a direct
result of its location in INAI, where it was deprived of adequate operating budgets, equipment
and personnel. Attempts were made to use INAI staff to complement the PMU's skills but INAI
staff resisted working with PMU personnel earning higher salaries. One of the key areas in which
it fell short was in its coordinating role on M&E.

5.1.10 LMU: The LMUs were decentralized branches of the PMU and DGFAFI in the eight
involved API. They oversaw daily implementation activities and monitoring, and were generally
more committed and effective than the PMU or INAI, especially on the participatory up-front
work of training communities in subproject objectives and procedures. This local effort, once
underway, was remarkable and the communities sustained their interest in the Project as a direct
result. LMU personnel were often indigenous people who knew the areas, peoples, languages
and traditions, and could work closely with the communities, an important factor for CDD. LMU
staff continued to work on incomplete subprojects with INAI funding even after project closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.11 The Borrower's performance suffered from generally modest commitment to the Project
at the central level, and inadequate capacity to implement at all levels until operational and
institutional changes that reduced bureaucracy and developed decentralized institutional capacity
rescued project implementation and facilitated rapid progress in the two years before closing.
Despite the excellent performance of the LMUs supported by their local promoters and
technicians, and the strong support of the Ministry of Social Development and Ministry of

6.0.1    The Project has generated a rich set of lessons including the following:

(a) The Project demonstrated unequivocally that indigenous communities have the capacity to
make decisions and to manage their own development, including the conservation and
recuperation of their natural resources. This requires appropriate technical support, training,
participatory mechanisms which transmit information, and rational procedures appropriate to a
decentralized operation. Of equal importance, indigenous communities showed they can



                                                 26

collaborate effectively with public authorities in maintaining and protecting natural resources in
national parks and represent their own NRM interests within the wider institutional and political
framework.

(b)   Beneficiaries acquired knowledge and skills empowering them to manage financial
resources and subprojects, interact with national and provincial institutions, NGOs and
international organizations, and obtain benefits beyond the Project. This was a major project
achievement. Beneficiary communities in several APIs have already leveraged this capacity as
well as their bridging and bonding social capital to obtain additional benefits, including roads,
energy and schools, from public programs and authorities. Indigenous groups involved in the
Project are better informed, trained and organized, and no longer hesitant about advocating for
their priority interests.

(c) The LMUs with their trained local promoters, commonly of indigenous origin themselves,
working with the communities and through the representative Advisory Councils worked very
well. Such arrangements, with the ACs advising the LMUs, are appropriate and replicable for
indigenous CDD, where a social intermediation function is required for marginalized
communities. Ideally, such decentralized representation should be established and operationally
ready at effectiveness, especially for a LIL of relatively short duration and with complex
objectives. Sustaining the trained local cohorts still in place also required advance planning.

(d) The representative, participatory Advisory Council (AC) was a successful organizational
innovation critical to the triangular relationship between indigenous communities, government
and the Bank. This was especially evident when demand for loan funds exceeded availability
after the Project was expanded geographically in 2004. The AC, comprising community-selected
representatives, met, discussed and agreed on the distribution of available resources among the
API, and it would have been challenging to resolve these issues without the AC.

(e) Complexity of Project approach, activities and implementation arrangements should be
commensurate with the analyzed capacity of stakeholders. The design of CDD-type operations
should strive for simplicity, transparency and appropriateness of objectives, components, learning
goals, participatory mechanisms and implementing arrangements/phasing. Such lessons were
available from a host of Bank-wide CDD operations under implementation or with evaluations
complete at the time of LIL preparation. Also, phasing of project activities should reflect the
learning curve.

(f) Adequate lead time is needed to front-load/apply intensive training and awareness-building
of indigenous communities and their local promoters before launching investment activities
which demand levels of organization, efficiency and knowledge of key functions, e.g. financial
management and procurement, which communities cannot initially manage independently. The
IDF grant capacity-building activities were effective but not targeted to the practical needs of the
community subproject investment cycle, and occurred a few years before effectiveness.
Moreover, the three-year LIL time-frame placed undue pressure on the execution of an innovative
and complex first-time indigenous peoples' pilot project.

(g) Systematic monitoring and evaluation is essential to support the learning goals of a LIL.
Deficient M&E has fundamental, practical implications for assessing the success and impact of
project activities and learning from them. Evaluation programs should be designed and agreed in
detail during preparation and launched at effectiveness. Alternative, simpler, but
methodologically valid forms of evaluation can be explored if the classic baseline and follow-up



                                                27

framework does not work as envisaged. Parallel training should build a "culture" supporting
data-based planning/policy-making.

(h) "Gender sensitivity" can benefit from a considered strategy, supervision and evaluation
focus which reaches beyond simple quantitative measures of participation to demonstrate
human/social capital evolution and socio-economic benefits for women by end-Project. Gender
sensitivity bisects cultural sensitivity: indigenous women do not necessarily have prominent roles
or easily adapt to non-indigenous concepts of empowerment and autonomous action. A targeted
strategy of awareness raising, capacity building and creation of opportunities is needed to achieve
gender goals with indigenous peoples.

(i) Sustaining official commitment can be a challenge, more so where the targeted
beneficiaries have little political power, the methodology is untested, the loan amount is small,
and government is changing. Politically savvy project preparation and subsequent supervision
should invest in building support for project objectives and methodology, building understanding
of the incentives driving all stakeholders, and might include physical visits by relevant authorities
(national and provincial) to successful subprojects/communities throughout implementation to
strengthen their support.

ANNEX 2: OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT             26


Investment Subprojects

2.1 The Project financed a total of 77 subprojects, 32 under Social and Cultural Strengthening of
Indigenous Communities, and 45 under Sustainable Use of Natural Resources. This is almost four
times more than the 21 sub-projects expected at Appraisal (six for agro-forestry and eco-/ethno-
tourism, and 15 for basic infrastructure). The bulk of subprojects investments were in water
management for consumption and irrigation use (33%); construction of community centers
(19%); strengthening local capacity for community planning (14%); and productive planning
activities (13%), e.g., home gardens and diversification of agricultural production and livestock.

2.2 Subprojects implemented in the six provinces were: Misiones (14), Neuquen (16), Jujuy (4),
Salta (22), Tucumán (13) and Rio Negro (8). Community support ranged from a minimum 10%
to 20% of the total investment in most cases. By end-Project, 19 subprojects out of the 77 still
had works pending and expected to be completed by July/August 2007 (their completion has
since been physically confirmed).

2.3 Average investment per subproject was US$ 47,886. Investments ranged from US$ 242,503
for an infrastructure subproject in Quilmes, including US$ 48,501 of counterpart funding, to
US$ 3,900 for a land tenure study in the community India Quilmes, including US$ 780 in
counterpart funds.

The following summarizes results by component and subcomponent.

Component 1. Social and Cultural Strengthening of Indigenous Communities (US$1.39
million, 87% of appraisal estimate and 23% of total cost)

2.4 The objective of the component was to support capacity building of indigenous communities
for self-development and the promotion of activities closely related to their traditional knowledge
and culture, including handicrafts, ethno- or cultural tourism, strategic planning and cultural
exchanges and networking. Special technical support would be provided to strengthen the
capacity of INAI and indigenous organizations to carry out legal and regulatory actions related to
project implementation.

2.5 Subcomponents included: capacity building and studies; technical assistance in legal matters
and conflict resolution; local planning; cultural exchange and gender workshops; learning events;
and improving basic social services.

2.6 Capacity-building: The Project financed a diversified training program that reached over
10,000 participants in courses and workshops covering the following subjects: technical and
managerial aspects of subproject administration; financial management; communications and
project information dissemination; and indigenous peoples' rights.                        Training improved
work/performance efficiency, promoted increased knowledge and skills development.




26The PAD, Annex 1, details key performance indicators under the hierarchical objectives; no table of estimated
outputs by component was provided. The PAD called for 6 pilot community subprojects in agro-forestry and "eco" and
"ethno" tourism by end-Year 2; and 15 community subprojects in basic infrastructure for production by end-project.
As a community demand-driven project however, such estimates were only notional.



                                                      30

2.7 Technical assistance: TA covered technical and practical aspects of natural resources
management; simple accounting and book-keeping; procurement processes; operation and
maintenance; specific skills related to specialized subprojects such as eco-tourism promotion,
pasture development and irrigated farming. INAI personnel provided technical assistance to
indigenous communities and their traditional authorities to consolidate the land regularization
process and secure indigenous rights over land and natural resources. As a result, one indigenous
community finalized the land regularization process; eight communities finalized land rights and
titling studies and made formal presentations for land regularization; and four critical regulations
linked to land regularization were enacted (see Main Text, 3.2). (Documentation/data on training
and beneficiaries is in project file).

2.8 Social and cultural development: Communities implemented local development plans; now
have access to social infrastructure; participated in subprojects to revitalize traditional practices;
and attended workshops and training in subproject preparation and management. See Tables 2.3
and 2.4.

2.9 Institutional strengthening: Training was delivered to INAI, the PMU, LMUs and
communities/organizations. Institutional agreements were reached with: (a) National Parks
Administration granting local indigenous communities the right to jointly manage the resources
of the Lanin National Park; (b) Secretariat of Agriculture regarding social and agricultural
programs; (c) provincial governments; (d) Provincial Secretariat of Tourism; and (e) local
universities. Laws, resolutions and rules for the protection, development, reorganization and
promotion of indigenous people were approved. Indigenous community organizations were
legally recognized, strengthening their legal, political, economic and social standing in society.
See Tables 2.3 and 2.4.

2.10 Rural infrastructure: Indigenous families acquired and now access potable water; houses
were repaired; roads and paths were repaired and cleared; a significant number of additional
families outside of the beneficiary communities benefited from those same roads/paths; families
benefited from water basins or water plants; students, teachers and non-teaching staff in local
schools benefited from renovation of school buildings; families used health services constructed
under the project; and, workshops were conducted in the management, operation and maintenance
of subproject investments in infrastructure. See tables 2.3 and 2.4.

Component 2: Sustainable Use of Natural Resources (US$2.30 million, 105% of appraisal
estimate and 39% of total cost)

2.11 The objective of this component was to formulate community-based resource management
plans delineating priority resources for conservation, areas for sustainable development
investments, and specific development subprojects. Originally, a GEF grant was to be fully-
blended with the Project, focusing on natural resource management. As noted in the Main Text,
this did not happen.

2.12 Subcomponents included: pilot water management and agricultural diversification
subprojects;    pilot pastures and livestock management;          pilot forestry and agro-forestry
subprojects; crafts production; pilot eco-and ethno-tourism subprojects; and basic infrastructure
for production.

2.13 In regard to the adoption of techniques for managing natural resources, a large number of
families from 13 communities learned and applied techniques for managing natural resources
sustainably; other families accessed and now use water for irrigation and productive activities


                                                 31

(see also Annex 3). The external evaluation addresses the features and performance of these
types of investments which were generally successful and provided important lessons. See
Tables 2.3 and 2.4.

CDD methodology and Subproject Decision-making Process

2.14 The CDD methodology involved five main steps: 1) communities were mobilized and LIL
was explained. Communitarian Promoters were selected by communities through                a public
competition; 2) communities discussed their priorities in community meetings, documented in
records known as Actas Comunitarias. In general only community members participated in these
meetings. 3) LMUs helped to communities to develop subproject proposals. Communities
accepted the project design, designated community members who were responsible for the
execution and for the financial aspects through an Acta Comunitaria. In many cases the PIU was
involved in this step of the subproject cycle. 4) The subproject was submitted to PIU and when
PIU approved (technical and financial aspects were revised), some subproject were sent to WB
for prior No Objection. 5) An agreement were signed between community and INAI (first it was
signed between the Minister of social Development and community)

2.15 To be eligible for financing, subprojects had to comply with a set of criteria specified in the
Operational Manual (OM) and be part of the community's Development Plan, including: (a)
prioritized and approved through participatory, consensual processes at the local level; (b) could
not duplicate the efforts/activities of other programs present in the community; (c) could be
demanded by legitimate indigenous organizations or groups as defined in the OM; (d) could be
executed by indigenous organizations and/or NGOs as defined in the OM; (e) could not be part of
the negative list established in the OM; (f) had to include a minimum 10% community
contribution to subproject cost, reviewable based on community poverty, experience and level of
unemployment; and (f) special cases/exceptions needed the Bank's no objection.

2.16 Subproject proposals were examined by technical specialists and scored by the LMU/PMU
based on the following: degree to which they served the common interest (numbers of families
benefited in relation to the API total); technical feasibility (ability to achieve expected results
with activities and funds allocated); relationship to the Community Development Plan (within the
medium to long-term planning strategy); and, sustainability of the activity (could continue
delivering benefits over time). On a points scale, subprojects receiving less than 40 points of a
possible 100 were not approved. Final approval for financing was given by the representative,
participatory Advisory Council within INAI and DGFAFI/UCAFI.

2.17 The project provided total funding of $3.686 million (of which US$2,960,000 financed by
the Loan) to support a total of 77 subprojects funded through community grants with beneficiary
contribution of a minimum 10 percent (mostly labor) up to a maximum 20 percent.

2.18 Project-created demand: In addition to the 77 subprojects financed, another 57 subprojects
were registered in a Project Bank created by INAI and the Indigenous Consultative Council,
valued at about US$4.0 million, ready for financing from other sources due to full commitment of
the Loan. This excess demand was created by the expansion of project areas in 2004 designed to
ensure full commitment of Loan funds, and a high proportion of this demand was from those new
areas. At Closing, Government was examining various options for financing these subprojects.
Some have since been financed by GEF and INAI.

2.19 The Project supported subprojects in varied productive activities and management of natural
resources. Subproject design was based on self-development; co-management; and consensus-
building. Providing support to indigenous communities to learn participatory approaches and how
to directly manage natural and human resources was a core project innovation.                These
experiences are potentially replicable under future programs.

2.20 Revolving funds: Revolving funds based on traditional methods called Torna enabled
community members to purchase seeds, and were later expanded to cover the purchase of small-
scale tools/equipment. They are the common property of the communities and only community
members are eligible to use them. Interest rates are lower than the financial market interest rate
and cover the operational costs of running the funds. Members borrow money during the planting
season and return the credit with interest during the harvest season. During field visits, the ICR
mission was told by the LMUs and users that the funds were running smoothly without problems,
due inter alia to longstanding, established social controls governing their use.

Component 3: Project Management (US$2.42 million, 169% of appraisal estimate and 39% of
total cost)

2.21 Subcomponents included project administration; monitoring and evaluation; and
communications and dissemination.




                                                    33

The Project Management Unit (PMU) was created and situated within INAI and consisted of the
Director of INAI, three INAI technicians, and administrative personnel. A subproject committee
to review and approve expenditures above a threshold was established on an as-needed basis.
Three local management units (LMUs) were created by INAI, one in each of the three pilot areas.
Expansion of eligible Project areas in 2004 and 2005 expanded the numbers of LMU. The PMU
and LMUs managed project implementation, and organized 143 workshops and meetings
covering diverse topics. They selected and evaluated 134 subproject proposals, finally approving
and financing 77.

2.22 Project monitoring and evaluation as stated in the Main Text, was weak, a key shortcoming
in a LIL. The MIS never reached a satisfactory level of operations and produced mostly
qualitative, and at times inconsistent, data. The issue was not a lack of good data--the missions
found much useful data at the LMU level--but lack of aggregation and organization. Data was
dispersed and not standardized between LMUs and with the PMU.

2.23 In terms of evaluation, the project financed (a) the SIEMPRO Mid-term Review study in
2004; and (b) Borrower Completion Report (MDS, 2007). No baseline survey was prepared
during project execution although a limited baseline was part of the pre-project Social
Assessment.     As noted in the Main Text, neither INAI nor the selected evaluation team
(Cuyo/Escolar) was prepared to use it as the basis for the evaluation, or prepare a new baseline
including the expanded project areas. The final project evaluation was financed by the Borrower
with its own funds. It was delayed and finally delivered in November, 2007. It is of reasonable
quality, reflecting solid fieldwork and stakeholder consultation on important project elements,
combined with a beneficiary opinion survey which captures diverse opinions/lessons. However it
omits key elements required under agreed TORs, especially on institutional aspects, and contains
certain inconsistencies in the analysis.

2.24 Communications and dissemination were somewhat inconsistent across APIs but the
project financed hundreds of workshops, seminars and meetings to explain project objectives,
access and implementing arrangements, as well as training in the many aspects of subproject
formulation, processing, implementation and O&M (documentation/data on dissemination
activities is in the Project file). The LMU indigenous promoters had specific responsibility to
handle much of the grassroots information dissemination effort.

ANNEX 3: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Introduction

3.1 The Indigenous Community Development LIL sought to establish the basis for community-
driven development and management of natural resources on indigenous lands by applying a
participatory, self-development approach. This included strengthening social organization and
culture, formulating local development and natural resource management plans, improving the
delivery of government services to indigenous peoples, and testing innovative approaches to
addressing key socioeconomic and environmental issues in a gender-sensitive manner.

3.2 No economic or financial assessment of the project was done during project preparation,
presenting difficulties for the evaluation of end-project incremental benefits. However, two
separate and independent economic analyses were conducted, by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, 2007) and the Cuyo/Escolar evaluation team, with disparate results. The ICR
opted to rely primarily on the more conservative FAO analysis, supplemented by two examples
from Cuyo/Escolar.28

3.3 All cases examined in both the FAO and Cuyo analyses show financial viability and IRR's
exceeding the opportunity cost of capital. In the case of Cuyo, IRRs range from a low of 30% for
a water supply for human consumption and irrigation, to 230% and 113% respectively, for a
revolving fund financing vegetable production. FAO's more conservative approach yields IRRs
ranging from 20.2% to 23.7% for an irrigation system and a revolving fund, respectively.29

3.4 The distribution of subproject funding by region and activity is summarized in Annex 2.
Most subprojects included an investment/productive component financing infrastructure;
purchase of equipment; capacity-building/technical assistance; and provision for recurrent costs.
Most subprojects took from 4-12 months to implement. The number of beneficiaries ranged from
23 to 280 families per subproject, with a total of over 18,000 for the 77 subprojects--compared to
the 10,000 beneficiaries expected at Appraisal (see Annex 2, Table 2.3). Some subprojects are
already generating economic benefits while others are expected to do so in the short-medium term.

A. FAO Analysis:

3.5 FAO's intention was to conduct a traditional financial and economic analysis of the overall
Project and its subprojects but the calculations have to be considered estimates, due to inadequate
economic data on production costs, areas planted before/after the Project, working hours per
activity and in total for the subprojects selected. In some cases, estimates of incremental net
benefits are proposed as current projections, although subject communities in Tucuman and
Misiones (selected as illustrative cases), had yet to start local marketing of their product. Only in
the case of handicraft producers is the incremental net benefit used for the calculations based on
craft-workers estimates of their increase in income before/after the Project.

3.6 Financial Analysis: With these constraints in mind, the quantitative evaluation: (a) looks at
the financial execution of subprojects per category of subprojects and per region, (b) presents
findings on 10 selected subprojects (5 in Tucuman, 5 in Misiones) resulting from a questionnaire
analyzed with technicians at the regional level; and (c) proposes two future scenarios of income



28The full study with all five cases is held in the Project archive.
29Similar types of subprojects but not the same subprojects, per se.



                                                             37

generation per family to assess at what point the investments would break even with a market rate
of interest set at >= 12%, and at what point the investment would have an acceptable IRR ranging
from 20-25%.

3.7 Subprojects selected for the Rate of Return Analysis: Assessment of an ex-post scenario of
the economic, financial and/or fiscal impact of the project was complicated by weak M&E
systems which could not provide needed data for the analysis. Data were not available in the
PMU and LMUs in a consolidated form. Progress reports were prepared for each subproject but
were mostly qualitative. This evaluation is therefore based on a selected sample of illustrative
subprojects in Tucuman and Misiones. These two provinces have comparatively more varied
types of subprojects and about one third of the overall total number financed.

Table 3.1 Selection of Subprojects Evaluated
 Tucuman       (1) Improvement of handicraft activities in the "Valle Calchaquies";

Findings from Subprojects in Misiones and Tucuman

3.8 Increase in economic activities. Before subproject implementation, most communities visited
had little/no productive activities since they lacked access to seeds and fertilizer, water and
technical assistance and/or raw materials for handicrafts production. Following subproject
implementation, most communities increased the productivity of their agricultural and craft
activities, e.g. in a sustainable water subproject for consumption and irrigation in the Community
of Quilmes (Tucuman), the total area planted increased from 77 ha. to 210 ha., with an average
increase of 0.6 ha to 1.5 ha per family, permitting families to produce alfalfa and sell it on local
market at AR$ 15 for 1 Fardo (20kg).

3.9 The communities of Torna-Amaicha and Quilmes also reported that since Project startup
more cell-phones were acquired/used which increased communication between community
members and their reliability as service providers.

3.10 Management of project funds: The cacique (local leader) and some elected community
councilors with subprojects, were handling subproject funds averaging US$ 47,886, assisted by
LMU technicians. This innovative and successful approach strengthened the social and
managerial capacities of community members. In a few cases however, it caused internal
conflicts due to a lack of transparency in the process and weak accountability of the person
responsible.

3.11 Increase in hours worked: Most productive planning and irrigation subprojects have
directly and indirectly, created more productive activities for community members. This has
increased the number of hours worked: (a) for household income and food security through the
provision of agricultural inputs and tools; and (b) by selling their labor in or outside the



                                                  38

community. For example, in the case of Valle Calchaquies, artisans worked 2-4 hours/day before
the Project and now work 6-8 hours, benefiting from access to basic materials, higher production
levels and sales.

3.12 Nutritional status improved: Nutrition status of indigenous people has improved, especially
that of small children under 3 years, in the communities. Diets improved by adding home-grown
fruits and vegetables. In almost all communities in Tucuman ancestral crops were revitalized and
incorporated into the diet. These include mostly indigenous maize varieties (yellow, black and
white) among others. Also, some villages started rearing poultry and small livestock, and thereby
brought the regular consumption of milk and meat into the daily diet. The provision of clean or
filtered drinking water at village or in some instances even at household level also played a major
role in improving the health situation of villagers. The use of clean water has provoked a drastic
reduction in diarrhea infection for children <3 years and even reduced the cases of child mortality.
In some communities like Torna Amaicha, malnutrition levels of 40 percent in urban areas and
70-80 percent in rural areas were reported to have decreased to 10 percent in urban, and 20
percent in rural areas.

3.13 Increased attendance and improved services. As the income of families improved, they
could afford to send their children more regularly to school. Further, in some instances,
community leaders sought improved access to the health centers, and electrification of
communities as a direct result of acquiring improved organizational skills and higher self-esteem,
facilitated by their subproject. In India Quilmes, Tucuman, a community centre was financed,
utilized for community meetings and with an exhibition hall for selling handicrafts. Some 139
families acquired access to irrigation water where only 13 families had access pre-project. In the
case of Colorado, water supply is available year-round avoiding the suffering caused by water
scarcity in the dry season. Torna ­ Amaicha - Quilmes built a well supplying water to the entire
community. Improved access to services stimulated the community of Calchaquies to plan for
restaurants, bars and small hostels in the near future.

3.14 Social capital improvement: Most subproject communities had little or no capacity to
manage the community and to plan community and/or productive activities. The subprojects
facilitated a process of social strengthening and community development in providing an
incentive to decide in what to invest, how to plan activities and how to implement them. Before
the project, there was little or no communication between the communities and government
agencies. The Project has been crucial in linking official service providers to the communities.
During project implementation, MDS and INAI organized two Forums to discuss benefits for
indigenous communities.

3.15 Natural resource management: The pilot activities of natural resource management were
initiated primarily in the areas of water management, revolving funds for both agricultural and
handicraft production as well as ranching. Besides increasing community water access for
irrigation and human consumption, the subprojects were improving production both for self
consumption and future selling at local markets. This gave an incentive to the farmers to diversify
their farming system and the varieties of crops for household consumption and sale. New crops
planted included garlic, potatoes and cash crops such as hot pepper.

The following subprojects were selected for financial analysis.




                                                 39

A. Tucuman

1.      Improved handicraft activities (Valle Calchaquies)

3.16 Objective: (a) re-establish the local handicraft market, (b) recuperate old techniques and
traditional designs and symbols; and (c) improve the marketing strategy and contribute to the
creation of a handicraft organization.

3.17 Activities included workshops to improve the quality of the handicraft, management of the
handicraft centre, and exchange visits with other craftsmen for example. The total investment was
US$ 50,097 with a community counterpart contribution of US$ 10,019. Some 280 families
participated in the subproject, including 180 women. The community centre served as an
exhibition hall for handcrafting families. The beneficiaries now collectively purchase raw
materials with greater bargaining power. The community centre is used as a community house for
representatives of 14 communities. It also hosted meetings of INAI-supported beneficiaries and
workshops.

2.      Provision and sustainable use of water (Community of Quilmes).

3.18 Objective: support the community of Quilmes Bajo, central and Rincon in developing
drinking and irrigation water systems.

3.19 The activities included (a) modernization of water management systems; (b) improvement of
the production base; (c) establishment of a water user association; and (d) improved quality of the
production and marketing strategy. Total investment was US$242,502 with community
contribution of US$ 39,000.

3.20 The subproject benefited 139 families. Based on the interview with the cacique of the
community, the production areas increased from 77.6 ha. to 210 ha. for vegetable and fruit
production, and 30-35 ha. for production of animal fodder. The subproject also improved
considerably the frequency of community meetings and facilitated training in sustainable natural
resource management.

3.      Sustainable use of natural resources (Torna-Amaicha-Quilmes).

3.21 Objective: improve family livelihoods through a revolving fund for purchasing seeds in the
two communities India Quilmes and Amaicha del Valle.

3.22 The activities included distribution of seeds, their multiplication and in-situ conservation of
the autocthonous germ plasma, and the re-valuation of traditional, individual food distribution
systems. Total investment costs were US$ 23,691 with a community contribution of US$ 4,738.

3.23 The subproject benefited 292 families which started agricultural and horticultural production
on 358 ha. comprising 72 ha. for animal fodder and 50 ha. for home-consumption. Production
patterns were also diversified. The farming system now includes wheat, onions, potatoes and
paprika, among other crops. Subproject activities provided incentives for 57 new producers, most
of them women, to grow new crops on their land.

3.24 Objective: (a) foster the capacity of rural communities for sustainable development; (b)
revalidate and increase productivity through improving water management; and (c) improve the
irrigation systems.

3.25 Activities included: capacity-building in water management, organizational development of
the water-user association, improvement of the water quality and marketing strategies. Total
investments were US$ 60,207 with a community contribution of US$ 12,041.

3.26 The subproject benefited 13 families, increased production area from 7 ha to 21 ha, and
increased yields by 30%. Diversification of crop production included alfalfa, maize, oats, and
potatoes, amongst others. The project helped to reduce production costs by organizing producers
to buy seedlings and seeds in bulk, which reduced costs from AR$6-8 to AR$4 per plant, and the
cost for 1 kg of alfalfa seeds from AR$22-24 to AR$23. Food insecurity status improved
significantly. Before the project, water was scarce during the dry season. After the project,
villagers had drinking water available at household level year-round. In Los Colorados,
community members started organizing themselves as a water user association with revolving
responsibilities for managing and cleaning the water system. Improved livelihoods attracted
people who had left the community to return and rebuild their lives. Beneficiaries received
training, in particular, on the sustainable use of water, reforestation, soil management and the
production of organic crops.

5.       Provision of Water (Community of "El Paso")

3.27 Objective: provide irrigation water for the community of El Paso to enhance the village's
ability to self-develop, and recover ancestral production techniques.

3.28 Specific activities were: construction of a well and development of a water administration
and distribution system for the community. The investment totaled US$ 88,182 with US$ 17,636
of community contribution.

3.29 The project benefited 32 families. Subproject implementation saw the production area
increase by 20 ha. Crop production was diversified, and the land area devoted to subsistence was
reduced from 100% to 20%. The community planned to harvest 700 fardos (equal 1,400 kg) of
alfalfa per year, which could be sold at US$ 4/fardo in local markets. During subproject
implementation, three ancestral techniques were recuperated. Food insecurity at the community
level has improved due to the consumption more milk and meat, vegetables and ancestral food
items.

B. Misiones

1.       Vegetable and fruit production (Perutí)

3.30 Objective: strengthen local organization's capacity to manage vegetable and fruit production,
and thus improve food security. The subproject benefited 80 families living in Perutí.

3.31 Subproject activities included: (a) strengthening of socio-economic community
organizations: and (b) revive and produce ancestral seed varieties. The total investment was
US$ 26 771 allocated to the following activities: animal feed (6%), tools (16%), equipment (20%),
capacity-building (45%) and recurrent costs and contingencies (7.6%). Counterpart funds were


                                                 41

US$ 5,354. In Peruti, they would produce maize, fruits and vegetables after receiving technical
assistance. The subproject resulted mainly in improving the food security situation for all families
at the household level by increasing consumption of vegetables and re-introducing ancestral foods
such as abachi tupy (yellow maize), morotí, abaty (white and black maize).

2.       Establishment of a handicraft sales promotion house in Yryapu.

3.32 Objective: contribute to organization and development of the indigenous community of
Iriapu to strengthen social cohesion between Guarani villages through the marketing of
handicrafts, the basic economic activity.

3.33 Subproject funds were invested in construction of the handicraft house (71%), equipment for
the sales hall and office (10%), capacity building for handicraft production and sales (6%) and
administrative costs and contingencies (13%). Activities also included handicraft training. The
centre is used by 56 traditional Mbya-Guarani handicrafts families. Total investments amounted
to US$ 41,666 of which US$ 8,333 were counterpart contribution.

3.34 At Closing, one handicraft community house still had some works pending (but since
completed). It was expected that the total sales volume would increase and the villages could
serve as a distributors of handicrafts for artisans living far from the centre of Iguazu. As income
increases, families are allocating some money to food purchases. During the subproject they
resumed religious practices. In addition, social cohesion in the community improved greatly,
especially in resolving and avoiding conflicts. Community members also received training in
natural resource management which was important for properly collecting and conserving the
plant material used to produce handicrafts.

3.       Strengthening of socio-productive capacities (Community Fortín Mbororé)

3.35 Objective: contribute to productive activities and strengthen community organisation to
improve rural people's livelihoods and food security.

3.36 Activities included strengthening of socio-productive organisation, purchase of machinery
(tractor) and other mechanised tools to increase productivity for self-sufficiency.            Total
investments amounted to US$ 31,787, of which US$6,357 was contributed by the community.
The subproject fund invested in animal feed (7%), agriculture and garden tools (11%), equipment
(22%), capacity-building (36%), administrative costs (6 %) and contingencies and bank costs (16
%).

3.37 The project benefited 156 Mbya Guarani families who diversified their production patterns.
The community incorporated ancestral crop varieties including yellow, white and black maize.
Area under production for self-sufficiency increased from 35 ha to 54 ha. The project also
reinforced handicraft production and developed tourism activities. Food security improved. The
community now has more meetings together to discuss community benefits and matters affecting
the community. Conflict incidence has declined. Community members also participated in
training in natural resource management.

4.       Productive Activities (Guiray)

3.38 Objective: strengthen local institutions and increase food production to achieve food security.

3.39 Activities included: (i) strengthening local organizations; (ii) revitalizing ancestral crops;
(iii) increasing poultry production per family; (iv) increasing the productivity of food and fodder



                                                  42

crops; and (v) developing the production of honey for consumption as well as medical use. Total
investment costs were US$ 23,893, of which US$ 4,778 were the community contribution.

3.40 The community of Guiray comprises 16 families descended from the Mbya-Guarani tribe.
Principal activity so far was agricultural production for self-sufficiency and selling their labor.
The subproject introduced vacunos as milk and meat providers in the production system,
recoveraed traditional planting techniques and increased the availability of fruits and vegetables
in the community. The project also encouraged the reconsideration and exercise of four
traditional practices. The subproject helped to contact the public energy provider to connect
electricity to the village, and to install a satellite for the school. The subproject also set up a
regular community meeting system.

5.       Productive integrative activities (Fracan)

3.41 Objective: develop a network and communication infrastructure for indigenous communities.

3.42 Activities included strengthening of socio-productive organizations, systematizing activities
for self-sufficiency, and introducing autochthonous indigenous varieties of seeds.            Total
investment costs were US$ 23,561 of which US$ 4,712 were the counterpart funds.

3.43 The community of Fracran has 45 Mbay-Guarani families who benefited directly from the
subproject. The subproject helped them to increase production for self-sufficiency through access
to irrigation water. However, no commercial activities have started yet. Four traditional planting
techniques and one religious ceremony were resumed. Food security improved considerably from
the consumption of more milk and meat in their diet. The community has been meeting regularly.
They also received training for capacity-building, and natural resources management.

Financial Analysis of Productive Subprojects

3.44 The following financial analysis was based on an assumption that the subprojects would
generate potential economic benefits. As mentioned above, 10 productive subprojects in the
provinces of Tucuman and Misiones were selected to be assessed for economic impact. It is
assumed that subprojects were targeting improved food security and increased income from a
diverse productive activity.

3.45 The models presented below were analyzed using a hypothesis that either minimum or
average scenarios would be needed by a family. The model analyzed uses the following
assumptions:

    · Total investment costs including Bank loan funds and community counterpart funds
    · Number of families at the regional level
    · On average, about 70 percent of community families participated in subprojects;
    · A discount rate of 12 percent was used for the estimate. The switching value would
         decide the minimum income the families would have to make. The Project had 5 years
         for implementation and the model used 10 years for agricultural production subprojects,
         and 20 years for irrigation and water infrastructure and community house projects.

The results are shown in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 below.

A. Cuyo/Escolar: Economic and Financial Analysis of Community Subprojects

3.46 The external evaluation conducted an economic analysis of five community investments to
demonstrate their potential capacity to generate family income and reduce poverty while
conserving the environment.      All investments analyzed were financially viable. Two cases are
summarized here.

API Amaicha: Revolving Fund (Torna Amaicha Quilmes)

3.47 Objective: To support self-sufficiency of production for low-income families through
distribution of seeds, tools and other necessary resources using the traditional system of
collective/solidaria distribution called Torna.

Financial evaluation:

3.48 Quantifiable benefits derive from the incorporation of 45 ha and an assumed increment in
activity of 10% annually. Two scenarios are considered: (a) estimated total production is only
vegetables; and (b) estimated total production is only alfalfa with income calculated/estimated for
each type.     Intangible benefits derive from: communities recovering their capacity for self-
sufficiency; in environmental terms, the production system stabilizes, guaranteeing the
availability of genetic resources; and, training received on production and organization by
communities will fortify the intellectual capital of communities. Operational costs include labor,
productive inputs (fuel), maintenance of equipment and tools and administrative costs. Cost
estimates are based on standard costs of production for similar activities equivalent to 50% of the
total cost of production. Costs are simulated to be equivalent to 40% since seeds are part of
operational costs but generated by own production. Total capital investment is US$71,724.

3.49 Assumptions: (a) income generation starting from Year 2; (b) incremental increases in
activity of 10% per year starting on 45 ha; (c) current expenses are calculated in annual form; (d)
capital investments are realized initially (Year 0) and considered in totality. 10 year horizon and
discount rate of 12% are used. Results show net benefit by Year 10 for vegetables: US$501,377;
and for alfalfa US$ 235,125

Results:
Vegetables: NPV = US$1,021,032 and annual IRR = 230%
Alfalfa: NPV = US$ 448,813 and annual IRR = 113%

Sensitivity:
Alfalfa producing at 50% = NPV US$190,387 and IRR = 59%
At 30% capacity, NPV US$88,616 and IRR = 36%;
Vegetables producing at 50%, NPV = US$478,496 and IRR 120%.
At 30% capacity, NPV = US$261,482 and IRR = 75%.

API Finca Santiago (Expansion): Development of Eco-tourism in Finca Potrero, Iruya

3.50 Objective: Tourist exploitation of camping cabanas in ecologically attractive areas with
income derived from various activities

3.51 Financial evaluation: Quantifiable benefits assume 1500-2000 tourists annually, equivalent
to 30 per week or 3 tourists per resident/year, somewhat below capacity but the maximum limit of



                                                 46

visitors which an area can support before generating negative ecological and social impacts.
Average visit is two days.      Income comes from the following: incomes from rents based on
similar premises in the zone, or about US$20/day/person, generating annual income of
US$80,000; income from food, based on other similar examples in the zone is equivalent to
US$12/person generating US$48,000 per year; and income from sales of crafts and other typical
items to tourists, assuming 3,600 units at US$45 each generating US$162,000/year; and other
income at US$18,000/year. Intangible benefits include: protection of the community environment
and natural resources; infrastructure generated by the Project (e.g., bathrooms, craft studio
rehabilitation); training in the provision of services to tourists strengthens intellectual capital,
reaffirms identity and cultural traditions; training and TA in administration and accounting; and
strengthening of community organizations through an activity which complements production.

3.52 Operational costs cover labor, services, maintenance and equipment, administration,
promotion/diffusion and regular expenses. Values assigned to these operational costs are based on
standard industry cost criteria that all operational costs for similar activities are equivalent to 25%
of the total cost of the enterprise. With operational costs related directly to the activity means that
they are variables based on level of usage of services. Total capital investment is US$391,050.

3.53 Assumptions include: (a) income generated by end-Year 2; (b) current expenses calculated
annually; (c) capital investments are made in the initial stage (zero) and considered in totality; (d)
assets cannot be sold or re-used in any other economic activity; (e) activity increases by 10%
annually through Year 5, then stabilizes. A 10-year horizon is used. The discount rate to
calculate NPV is 12% annual.

Results:
Net Benefit: US$323,408 by Year 10
NPV: US$1,116,910
IRR: 66%
Sensitivity Analysis:
Activity at 50%: Net benefits by Year 10 = US$161,604, NPV = US$383,879 and IRR = 33%.
Activity at 30%: Net benefits by Year 10 = US$97,022, NPV = US$90,666, IRR = 47%

ANNEX 5: BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS

5.1      An independent, external evaluation of the Project was conducted in 2007 by the National
University of Cuyo (Mendoza Province) using a multi-disciplinary team comprising academics,
independent consultants and researchers--mainly from the fields of anthropology, sociology,
biology, economics and civil engineering. The full report is of variable but generally good quality
and benefits from being candid and analytical. It contains the results of an opinion survey and
analyses of economic, environmental, infrastructure/civil works, management, archaeological,
social and cultural elements of the Project. Results of the economic analysis for two subprojects
are summarized in Annex 3. Principal results of other segments, including the beneficiary survey,
are synthesized below.30 The full report is filed in the project archive.

5.2      Methodology: Field teams visited 21 communities distributed throughout the project
areas and assessed 50 community subprojects via physical inspection (particularly for
environmental aspects), direct interviews with beneficiaries and technicians, and/or beneficiary
focal group discussions. Only the opinion survey is directly quantitative. The opinion survey
covers 188 randomly-selected members of distinct beneficiary communities in four provinces.
Some 54% were male, 46% were female and 45% were heads of household. The survey covered
areas with a relatively high concentration of families as well as small groupings distant from main
centers.

 participants

A. Opinion Survey (OS)

5.4      The OS asked a series of questions embedded in broad themes, comparing responses
across four provinces (Salta, Misiones, Neuquén and Tucumán). The results are quite striking for
Misiones which scored uniformly high on all questions.

(a) Communications strategies: Communities were generally aware of the existence of programs
to support their socio-economic and cultural development; in Misiones the response was 100%.
In regard to the Bank-supported LIL specifically, about 80% knew about it but only 30% very
well; again in Misiones, the response was 100% (with 79% having good/very good knowledge of
the Project). Knowledge of the project varied by area and was closely tied to when subproject
execution effectively started, in most cases from 2004 on. A high proportion of all interviewees

had received explanation of the Project but indications are that this did not always equate with
full understanding; many respondents said they lacked detailed understanding despite the large
number of workshops, training sessions and other diffusion activities.

(b) Participation and targeting: About 53% of interviewees had benefited from a subproject
either individually or as a household (with Misiones reporting 97%, Salta 38%, Neuquen 40%
and Tucumán 48%).31 The study suggests this may be due in part to: (i) some concentration of
subprojects with beneficiaries receiving several investments; (ii) inequities in the participation in
and distribution of, benefits, i.e. project targeting issues; and/or (iii) inadequate perception of
participation with some community members benefiting without knowing it. In terms of direct
community participation in the preparation of subprojects, about 36% responded positively with
79% in Misiones and a low of 26% in Neuquén.

(c) Technical assistance, resources management and achievement of objectives: Respondents
were quite positive about the frequency with which they were visited by technical specialists,
more commonly noting visits at weekly and monthly intervals, an important plus for a CDD
project of this type. Some 59% of Misiones interviewees reported weekly visits, while Neuquén
communities experienced visits at greater intervals, including annual in some cases.

About half of all respondents were critical of the time/processes involved in getting a subproject
approved and executed. Barely 20% thought the process easy, while the vast majority (about
80%) thought it difficult-very difficult or had no response. In the latter case, there is a correlation
with inadequate levels of participation in subproject preparation in some APIs, especially in
Neuquén which had the greatest difficulty in processing subprojects and lowest participation
levels in preparation.

In regard to the timeliness of delivery of approved resources (and contrary to the MTR
evaluation), respondents did not generally believe that resources were seriously delayed which
may reflect the marked improvement in the latter two years of the project when numbers of
communities entering the project increased sharply and these benefited from the greatly improved
subproject processing and implementation conditions.

About 45% of those responding to this question thought the project had achieved its objectives,
and about half of those felt all objectives were achieved. This is a significant result. However,
percentages unable to respond were well over 50% in all cases except Misiones.

(d) Community views on the project's main failings, flaws and difficulties: Results of the
survey show that no single issue stands out for special criticism. Within a range of comments the
issue of problematic implementation is marginally ahead followed by communications issues and
numbers of beneficiaries. However, more striking differences are evident between APIs. The
primary success of the project in general terms is seen as its capacity to resolve the problem of
water supply (13.3%) as well as provide materials for construction (11%), and followed by the
acquisition of learning (10%). Again, there were sharp variations between API but these three
issues remained constant. Finally, in regard to communities over-arching view of the project, the
result was positive: of the 63% who responded, about 54% saw the Project as excellent, good or
very good. Only 3% viewed at as bad, very bad or worse.




31The study notes discordance with the limited Project data on numbers of beneficiaries which are up to three times
actual total populations in Project areas.


                                                         50

5.5      Misiones, among all participating APIs, showed much higher level levels of satisfaction
with the Project. What made the difference and what can be learned? The Cuyo/Escolar study
defines the differences as follows, for Misiones: (a) subprojects markedly oriented to satisfying
basic needs and subsistence. Elements of Components 1 and 2 were always combined in the
same subprojects; (b) the subject population displayed living conditions far worse than any other
API and hence the project was of critical importance; (c) the size/cost of subprojects was in
general smaller than in other APIs; (d) the project was established in Misiones much later than in
the other APIs.     This permitted it to benefit from accumulated experience, under a more
continuous project management regime in the PMU and LMU, and with the presence of
representatives of DGFAFI (Ministry of Social Development) assisting with project
management/development; and (e) Misiones communities did not experience the severe delays in
initial project execution suffered by cohorts in other APIs.

B. Environmental Analysis:

5.6      The external evaluation presents a detailed discussion of environmental/natural resources
management aspects of the Project based on field interviews, on-site inspection and consultations
with environmental specialists. Subprojects were sampled from all principal types financed.
Many subprojects visited were only recently executed and insufficiently mature to permit
definitive conclusions but evidence suggests conservation practices and awareness were
established and important lessons learned. Selected observations are summarized below and in
the Main Text.

(a) Beneficiaries of water supply investments for irrigation and consumption reported major
reduction in the incidence of water-borne disease, but water testing in some subprojects indicated
the need for more systematic attention to regular water testing. In many cases, the expected
impact on production of irrigations systems was only starting to materialize due to the short time
since completion, but physical inspection and discussion with beneficiary families were
promising. The report advises that care is needed to ensure that in areas with fragile, over-
exploited soils (cattle lands) all actions which remove vegetation and promote erosion be avoided,
including the construction of tanks and pipes. Subprojects where the pipes were buried showed no
evidence of erosion and/or deterioration. The Project's standard procedures for O&M of water
investments (training, user groups etc) were working well but in some cases, closer follow-up was
required to ensure more consistent application of O&M so that systems which are otherwise well-
built and environmentally sound are not put at risk.

(b) Tourism investments inter alia, were quite successful, inducing positive effects on local eco-
systems by providing services in a more organized manner. While the improved services
generated - as intended - a marked upturn in tourist traffic, it was evident that this can have
environmental impact in its own right in fragile, natural areas. The report recommends that these
types of investments have a Tourist Resources Management Plan, in addition to the initial
environmental evaluation.

(c) Pasture management investments targeted better quality and production of animal herds.
Pastures pre-subproject were over-utilized, exhausted and of low productivity. The short time
since implantation meant that changes in productivity were hard to judge, and more time is
needed to assess the optimal recovery of degraded areas. However, biomass productivity
observed in enclosed versus open field areas was clearly very good. The wider sustainability
issue noted is the balance between numbers of cattle on a given area and ecosystem capacity to
regenerate. The report recommends more emphasis on introducing multiple use systems for lands
to increase the productive options of poor farmers while protecting/conserving the environment.


                                                  51

(d) Investments in forest enrichment and new techniques for wood crafts were intended to limit
biodiversity loss and enrich forest areas (that had been overcome with inferior plants and
completely exhausted pre-project due to over-grazing) with higher value wood. Reforestation and
fencing of cattle were highly successful, suggesting good potential for replication in other
zones/areas. These subprojects validated the idea that an organized activity can strengthen
conservation and generate a productive alternative to inefficient agriculture/herding.

(e) In regard to crop/diet diversification investments, more attention is needed to the fact that
pesticide and fertilizer use (for new types of crops) is not customary for many indigenous groups
and that they need more detailed information on the environmental impacts of usage quite apart
from crop application practices, per se.

C. General conclusions and recommendations/lessons

5.7     The evaluation makes a series of analytical observations drawn from field inspection of
subprojects, focus groups discussions and direct interviews, and draws a number of important
conclusions and lessons which have been incorporated in the Main Text.

Strengthening of cultural practices:

(a) The project had a positive impact on strengthening and revaluation of cultural practices and
values. In some areas, especially Neuquen, the most dynamic, participatory and strengthened
groups were youth-led with greater capacity for interaction with non-indigenous society and a
stronger instinct for publicly challenging that society. In Neuquen, traditionally marginalized
youth were brought into organizations and played an important role in the constitutional reforms
in that province. The report suggests that this group may have been more favored by the project
due to their capacity to develop subprojects and manage inter-institutional relationships, creating
some strains with older community members who remained the repository of traditional
practices/values.

(b) The Project also had a strong and positive impact in consolidating and strengthening
indigenous villages in the APIs as important actors in municipal and provincial affairs. However,
and similar to the above, this new-found visibility created conflict with provincial and municipal
governments who felt threatened, expressed in some cases in failure to provide basic services and
attempts to divide indigenous organizations, e.g., Neuquén and Misiones.

Institutional strengthening:

(c) The report states unequivocally that the Project's impact on local indigenous organizations
was strong, given the successful workshops, community discussions concerning rights and other
themes and links formed with other indigenous organizations at the regional and national levels.
Management capacity and formulation of strategies by indigenous organizations and local
authorities improved as did communities sense of belonging and willingness to engage with
indigenous demands.

(d) The workshops organized by the Project were described as critically important for resolving
conflicts and for enabling the Mbya groups for example, to put the land title issue on the table in
an open forum. Such forums also fostered greater community autonomy.




                                                 52

(e) The project strengthened/fostered greater community participation in demands for land
rights, health, education and control over resources and reduced conflict, e.g., in Pulmari, it
enabled indigenous groups to develop long-term strategies for confronting antagonistic
governments (e.g., Neuquen) and private interests, and promoted signing of cooperation
agreements, e.g., Lanin National Park. In Neuquen Province, workshops, training and
mobilization resulted in reform of the Neuquen constitution via Article 53. Workshops also
sponsored greater cooperation among formerly antagonistic groups within the Amaicha and
Quilmes.

Land Rights and Demands

(f) The Project strengthened groups in their lands of origin, in varying degrees depending on
circumstances. For example, the land study subproject for India Quilmes resulted in a body of
documents enabling reconstruction of the history of communities and the legal basis for
ratification of territorial rights.

(g) In Pulmari, Finca Santiago and Amaicha, many subprojects had the effect of strengthening
effective control over territory, training communities and their authorities in control over
resources, and in indigenous rights. Improving infrastructure, installing water supply, irrigation
and other, permitted the recuperation of areas in decline and territorial reoccupation. In many
communities, the possibility of increasing agricultural production via irrigation infrastructure, and
credit permitted reoccupation (actual or potential) of areas previously in process of depopulation.

Participation and decision-making

(h) Focal groups and interviews revealed that participation fostered by the Project resulted in the
resolution of problems formerly resolved by the state in regard to the promotion of rights,
demands and local planning. .

(i) Participation promoted more democratic procedures within/outside organizations; stimulated
individuals within communities to seek stronger linkages with non-indigenous groups, politicians
and provincial governments; and, developed/fomented political structures and organizations with
a strong ethno-political profile, and strong capacity for decision-making, strategic objectives,
applying pressure, conducting negotiation and capacity to mobilize resources.

(j) In some areas, there was inequality in levels of participation and decision-making between
members of organizations and authorities and the rest of the community, affecting access to
information and subprojects, and control over resources. The competition generated, in part the
outcome of the high expectations generated by the project, created dissension among groups in
some indigenous organizations. However, it must be stressed that dissension is a traditional
characteristic of indigenous organizations and groups in Argentina and can be perpetuated over
many generations, flaring up under changing circumstances. The project was especially
successful, with many examples, in bringing formerly conflicted groups together in cooperative
efforts.




                                                53

Social Capital

(k) The Project experience has permitted beneficiaries and LMU personnel to acquire knowledge
and skills to manage resources and subprojects, interact with diverse state institutions, NGOs
and international organizations. They have passed on those skills - administrative, legal and
financial ­ to the communities. This is one of the top achievements of the Project. Some of
these personnel have been re-contracted by INAI post-project, as authorized by the Ministry of
Social Development.

Sustainable Use of Natural Resources

(l) The various subprojects and development under the Project have favored the improved use of
natural resources. Communities show better habits, forms of production, diversification, and
better utilization of resources.    The project has also reinforced awareness about resource
management to avoid environmental degradation.          This is manifested in three ways:       (a)
execution of natural resource subprojects which have economic benefits.       There are numerous
subprojects with promising impacts on income generation and which fulfill the needs of
beneficiaries (irrigation systems, crafts and forest management, and revolving funds); (b)
practices which promote greater sustainability of resource use (the project was especially
successful in this regard); and (c) preparation and execution of integrated development plans or
strategies for large-scale sustainable management of natural resources (Amaicha and Pulmari
developed management strategies and development plans; Finca Santiago did ecological studies
and financed numerous subprojects in the use of natural resources). The most advanced example
was the co-management agreement for Lanin National Park in Pulmari.

(m) The experience left one of the most positive balances in terms of formulating and trying
integrated development plans, even though some subprojects had less success than expected in
the incorporation of technologies and development of consensus between distinct sectors of
communities. The impact of the Project has been to create in the communities a concern for
preparing development plans and this practice needs vigilance to ensure its universal application.

Economic Impact

(n) The possibility opened up for many beneficiaries to increase their incomes and produce the
means to subsist in their own community ­ whether through irrigation, eco-tourism or crafts ­
which in turn slowed down the out-migration of young community members.                 Subprojects
considered successful have been wooden crafts, pasture management, and strengthening of co-
management of Lanin Park. Many other subprojects have good potential in the short-medium
term, e.g., campgrounds, eco-tourism, and water management. The evaluation noted the need for
improved planning, monitoring and implementation of subprojects to sustain community
confidence and motivation.       Delays in funding due to management problems, lack of
collaboration on the provision of labor in some communities and, in a few subprojects less than
transparent management have the capacity to erode community commitment.

Preparation and approval of subprojects

(o) Some communities had difficulties in directly influencing deliberations about and proposal
for ideas and preparation of subprojects. This is seen as one of the most important points for any
future intervention because the Project sought to generate actions and projects which emerged
from the beneficiaries themselves. The primary problems were: (a) complicated preparation; and
(b) Excessive bureaucracy in procedures for subproject evaluation, approval and flow of
financing. This situation improved sharply in 2005.


                                                54

Financial Management of Resources and Procurement

(p) Communities had difficulties managing subproject resources until many procedures were
simplified in 2005.         The vast majority of community members had never handled banking
procedures, administered so much money, or prepared an SOE, the latter quite difficult given that
the majority of communities engaged in the informal economy. Similarly, procurement requiring
three bids/providers was often unworkable. Even though they received training and the PMU
adapted its procedures to be more realistic, communities expressed criticism over the apparent
lack of appreciation of local realities by the PMU.

Monitoring and technical supervision

(q) The evaluation cites complaints about the lack of support and monitoring by technicians at
key stages of the subproject cycle and that technicians were not local residents and did not visit
frequently enough. This more general finding contrasts with the results of Cuyo's opinion survey
which shows relatively favorable beneficiary opinions about the frequency of visits by technical
specialists.    Further, LMU technicians and local promoters were frequently resident in the
immediate subproject area or locale, a key factor which made the LMUs so effective. A common
demand of the communities was for agricultural extension support, which has a strong and
frequent presence in the countryside and was satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation

(r) Monitoring and evaluation, to the extent implemented, could not do justice to the subprojects
and was an important deficiency. The evaluation suggests that data were inadequate to judge
changes induced by the subprojects/project, and limited data were available to permit inferences
about the causes of problems or numbers of beneficiaries.32 The reasons for poor M&E are
suggested by the evaluation as: (i) greater priority to the pace of physical execution rather than
assessing quality; and (ii) lack of support and/or persons adequately trained to implement
effective M&E, especially in the countryside.




32Beneficiary numbers are stated on all approved subproject proposals/documentation and are known and quantified.
Otherwise, the issues affecting M&E are described fully in the Main Text.

ANNEX 6: STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP REPORT AND RESULTS

A stakeholder workshop was not required, although numerous workshops occurred throughout
the life of the Project as an instrument to promote solidarity, exchange experiences, disseminate
information and to conduct training on crucial aspects of the subproject cycle (see Annex 2).

Origin and justification of the operation

1.       Following the 1994 constitutional reform, Argentina ratified indigenous land rights and
created the National Institute for Indigenous Affairs (INAI), an agency of the Secretariat of Social
Development, whose mandate is to develop legal and administrative mechanisms for individual
and collective land ownership, identify the development needs of indigenous peoples, and
coordinate public sector investments in the development of indigenous communities.

2.       Indigenous peoples are among the most vulnerable in Argentina. They represent a high
proportion, approximately 25%, of the country's rural population and constitute a very significant
portion of the rural poor. Recognition of their cultural and social diversity is increasing, and
efforts are being made to amend policies of the past that discriminated against indigenous peoples.

3.       By 1999 the strategy for addressing these issues was to improve and strengthen the social
capital of indigenous organizations through the support provided to community-based natural
resources management systems and the development of small-scale investment programs that
would be managed by indigenous organizations.

4.       These initiatives are the domain of INAI whose priority objective is to improve the well-
being of indigenous populations by providing them with land security and essential social
services, and creating protected indigenous areas that are managed jointly by local indigenous
communities and relevant government authorities. In this context, the pilot project was designed
in three indigenous areas to allow the formulation of a methodology based on lessons learned and
to extend the model to additional areas/communities based on the exploration of a successful
methodology.

5.       Loan 4580-AR, signed by the Argentine Republic and the World Bank, for the
Indigenous Community Development Project (DCI), was designed as a Learning and Innovation
Loan (LIL) project, with an original allocation of US$5,000,000 plus a local contribution of
US$892,936.

6.       The planned intervention model was totally new in the country, with an inter-sector and
multi-stakeholder modality. From the time of its design, it incorporated coordinated actions by
representative organizations of the beneficiary communities, the Argentine Government through
INAI, as well as provincial governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and other
local actors.

7.       The Project's development objective was to establish the groundwork for community-
driven development and the management of natural resources in indigenous lands. This includes:
(i) the strengthening of social and cultural organization and the formulation of development plans
and of natural resources management plans; (ii) the testing of innovative approaches to address
key socioeconomic and environmental issues, taking into account the dimension of gender; and
(iii) improvement in the services provided by the government to indigenous populations.

8.       Planned actions are under the framework of two intervention components and one
management component, according to the following specifications:

     Component A: Social and Cultural Strengthening of Indigenous Communities




                                                 58

9.      This includes the development of activities that strengthen the capacity for self-
development and the promotion of activities closely linked with traditional knowledge and culture,
such as:

(a) Development of handicrafts and ethnic and cultural tourism.
(b) Cultural exchange and creation of networks.
(c) Training in indigenous cultural rights and identity.
(d) Renewed appreciation of indigenous languages, knowledge, and practices.
(e) Management, registration, and regularization of property title deeds.
(f) Preparation of legal instruments related to the establishment of Pilot Indigenous Areas.
(g) Strengthening of communications within and outside the communities.
(h) Improvement of the management capacity of indigenous organizations, particularly that
    related to the design, execution, and monitoring of community projects, and the preparation
    of participatory diagnostics and associated management.
(i) Development of skills aimed at project management and administration.
(j) Technical assistance to Indigenous Organizations (OI) for the resolution and mediation of
    legal conflicts.

    Component B: Sustainable use of natural resources

11.     Formulation by indigenous organizations of natural resources management plans for
        indigenous areas, through the preparation of:

         - Socio-cultural analyses, resource evaluations, extension services, and soil, water and
             forest management planning;
         - Specific mechanisms to reduce environmental risks.


12.     Preparation and execution of community subprojects in indigenous areas, including
        investments in:

a) Improvement of soils and lands used to fatten livestock;
b) Sustainable management and use of native forests and conservation of biodiversity;
c) Management and improvement of livestock production and of fodder production;
d) Management and improvement of agricultural production for on-farm consumption and for
    market;
e) Watershed planning or intake, conveyance, and distribution of water for irrigation or
    livestock;
f) Basic productive infrastructure;
g) Community infrastructure for the marketing of agricultural, forest, and livestock production
    or of handicrafts;
h) Provision of piped water;
i) Expansion or improvement of water purification plants;
j) Repair, opening, or expansion of roads;
k) Expansion or improvement of community infrastructure;
l) Management of archeological areas;
m) Handicraft production;
n) Ecological tourism.

                                                 59

Component C: Project Management

12.     This component aimed at ensuring the efficient management of the project, both at
central and local levels. Therefore, actions will be carried out, such as:

(a) Generation of the regulatory instruments needed for project development.
(b) Development of technical capacity at central level.
(c) Transfer and development of management capacities at local level.
(d) Promotion of cooperation agreements with other public or civil society agencies, with the
    objective of technically strengthening the program's efforts.
(e) Planning and coordination of monitoring and evaluation efforts.
(f) Development of a management methodology that enables the transfer and development of
    capacities to communities.


This component encompasses the establishment and operation of the UEP, the UMLs, and the
GTs, including auditing and financial management systems.

Compliance with Objectives
13.     At the time of project design, the targets that would need to be achieved in order to
consider the project a success were established. These targets and the progress achieved are
described below.

(a)     Local indigenous social organizations recognized and operating legally. At the end of
2006, there were a total of 914 recognized indigenous communities, i.e., 504 more than in the
year 2000 when project execution began. Over 10,000 indigenous people participated in
workshops financed by the project to support the process of registering and training indigenous
organizations. The project specifically financed SpCs aimed at the social and cultural
strengthening of indigenous organizations in each API. It also financed the presentation of seven
regional forums and one national forum, with the participation of representatives of all of
Argentina's indigenous peoples, not only of the communities involved in the DCI, at which one
of the key issues was that of legal status. This resulted in the National Plan for Indigenous
Development. Recognition by RENACI (the National Registry of Indigenous Communities) was
obtained for the communities of Casas Viejas, El Mollar, and Tafí del Valle.

(b) Mechanisms established and being implemented to resolve land tenure conflicts. Workshops
were held on conflict resolution and rights to indigenous lands. In addition, for the first time
studies of property titles in the APIs were also financed through SpCs. These mechanisms are
contributing to the resolution of land tenure conflicts. For example, during the life of the project:

    o 1 indigenous community completed the land regularization process.
    o 8 indigenous communities completed studies on land rights and property titles.
    o 1 indigenous community is in the process of land tenure approval.
    o 4 critical regulations dealing with land regularization were approved during the life of the
        project, the most important of which was Emergency Law 26.160 on Indigenous
        Community Property.
In the abovementioned forums supported by the project, another key subject of discussion was
land. Mapuche communities and the National Parks Administration (APN) reached an agreement
on the co-management of Lanín National Park in Patagonia, with project support.

(c)     Sustainable natural resources management practices successfully included in community
development plans (PDCs). The PDCs for the three original APIs were prepared during project


                                                  60

design and in expansions to the APIs of Pulmarí and Finca Santiago which were incorporated in
2004. In all cases, the PDCs include practices for the sustainable management of natural
resources. These practices have been implemented successfully with project support. Although
the PDCs were not explicitly prepared in the three new areas incorporated in 2004, sustainable
natural resources management practices were incorporated in the SpCs financed by the project. In
the abovementioned forums, another key issue was biodiversity and, in this context, sustainable
natural resources management practices.

(d)     New types of economic alternatives identified and successfully tested in APIs. The SpCs
financed by the project in the communities have supported the implementation of various new
economic alternatives. For example, microcredit initiatives have been launched under the
"revolving fund for seeds" modality, which implied the recovery of an ancient mutual support
system. This initiative was first applied in support of agricultural activities, but due to the success
and 100% recovery of microcredits, it is being extended to other economic sectors such as
handicrafts and the provision of irrigation water. New economic alternatives for APIs have also
been put into practice through the implementation of SpCs for the development of productive
farms (15), provision of water for human consumption and irrigation (16), development of
handicrafts (2), forestry development (2), and tourism (40).

(e)      Process of adopting adapted technology that produces over the long term a greater level
of productivity and higher income for project beneficiaries. The communities have contributed to
the increase in productivity and income. For example, the communities living in Río Negro's
Nahuel Huapi National Park have incorporated the use of a mobile sawmill to manage deadwood
in order to prevent forest fires. In this regard, APN is hiring the community to handle deadwood
in various areas of this national park. In terms of handicrafts, the communities of Finca Santiago
and Diaguita Calchaquí have introduced the use of new technologies to treat the raw materials
used, such as wool, clay, and wood. This has improved the quality of the production process and
the quality and price of the final product. In agriculture, irrigation technology for farms has been
introduced in areas that previously depended on rain. Productivity increased in all cases where
new technologies were introduced, and the quality of products prepared and their value added
also improved.

(f)     The gender dimension was successfully taken into account. A significant number of
women participated in the project. Sixty-three were members of management commissions
(around 1.2 women per community), and 60% of outreach workers/administrative assistants in the
APIs were indigenous women. Women were direct beneficiaries of training sessions and
workshops.

(g)     Improvement in the provision of services by the government to indigenous populations. In
the areas where the project operated, ties between government agencies and indigenous
communities have been strengthened. In this regard, it is worthwhile to mention, for example, the
appointment by provincial governments of nurses and teachers for the new health centers and
schools constructed and rehabilitated with project support. A Bureau of Original Peoples has been
created under the framework of the National Secretariat of the Environment and Sustainable
Development. This bureau's first appointed director was Jorge Nahuel, representative of the
Mapuche community and DCI Project Coordinator until he took this new appointment. As a
result of discussions on the subject of Intercultural Issues at the Indigenous Rights Forums, the
Bureau of Bilingual Education has been created in the Ministry of Education, and important
federal, provincial, and municipal regulations were issued to protect, recognize, and promote
indigenous peoples and their culture.

(h)     With project support, articles were introduced in amendments to the provincial
constitutions of Tucumán and Neuquén. A number of institutional agreements have been reached

                                                  61

by indigenous organizations and various government agencies: 47 agreements were signed,
including ones with the APN, the Agricultural and Social Program of the National Secretariat of
Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, and Nutrition, the Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA),
NGOs, universities, public hospitals, the National Secretariat of Human Rights, and the national
and provincial Secretariats of Tourism.

Innovative Aspects of the Project

14.      Without a doubt, the most outstanding and innovative aspect of the DCI project is its
multi-stakeholder and decentralized management model. The project's success lies in its
demonstration of the possibilities for execution and self-management of public policies by rural
indigenous communities. The possibilities of developing consensus that the communities have
demonstrated in this case to prepare their own sustainable development strategies represent a
lesson to be replicated.

15.      For the first time in the country, indigenous communities have been given the chance to
formulate their own policies and managing resources. These communities had to undergo an
important learning process on participation in order to reach consensus and administer resources.

16.      It should also be noted that the communities' high level of participation in project
development is a success in itself, understanding that the acceptance of a program by the State
results in an overall cultural change that should be attributed to the DCI.

17.      One key to the program's success has been the formation and operation of the Indigenous
Consultative Council. This agency played the lead role in generating policy agreements for the
design of community development strategies and for the allocation of funds to participating
communities.

18.      It was the first time that loan funds were administered by the communities themselves.
No subsidy was provided in which beneficiaries did not participate in its definition and
management, and funds were deposited in the bank accounts of the communities which were
responsible for administering them successfully for the execution of the SpCs.

19.      Another very important aspect that should be highlighted is that most subprojects have
managed to go beyond the planned effects due to the synergies and strengthening of the social
capital that has been generated. One noteworthy example is the construction of the community
center in Río Negro: with the provision of computers and workshops, committed young people of
the community were able to submit retirement benefit applications for 24 elderly people. This had
a strong economic impact on the community because the families benefiting from retirement
payments began to receive a monthly income equivalent to the income they once received
annually.

Principal Difficulties Affecting Project Execution

20.      The main shortcomings of the DCI project, beyond the economic outcome of subprojects,
are the very limited information on and monitoring of these outcomes, which have greatly
hindered the utilization of experiences for learning purposes--precisely one of the basic
objectives of a pilot project. This was due to management failures in the project from the start and
to changes in leadership and to the long period of time between the start and end of the project.

21.      One of the reasons why the project lasted longer than planned was the need for learning
about the management and handling of funds by beneficiary communities and about reaching
consensus among participating groups for the design of development strategies and for the


                                                 62

allocation of resources. Remember that beneficiary communities not only designed the
development policies financed by the project, but also allocated the available funds. This
successful achievement must not be overshadowed by difficulties in the program's design that
should have envisaged more time for the program's implementation at the beginning.

22.      Besides the particular moment when the project was designed and implemented, its
shortcomings were due to the lack of foresight in the design of a management unit that was in line
with the magnitude of the project which covered a large area of land with important cultural
diversity.

23.      The principal difficulties for project start-up were the requirements established for
subproject preparation and their complicated wording, as well as the excessive bureaucracy in
evaluation and approval procedures. The gap that was generated among the start-up, approval,
and implementation of subprojects also seriously affected the expectations of beneficiaries.

24.      With respect to the objectives of fund management by indigenous communities, a more
than satisfactory project performance is noted. The DCI project was without doubt innovative in
the Argentine context by delegating the management of subproject funds in the indigenous
communities themselves, thus avoiding in principle their tutelary handling by various agencies,
and to a large extent delegating the responsibility for the success of subprojects and the
administration of funds to the beneficiaries themselves. This point was one of the aspects of the
DCI proposal that was most favorably received by the communities.

25.      There were also numerous difficulties at the time of administering this money. A large
portion of those responsible for the accounts had never performed banking operations,
administered such large amounts of money, or had to be accountable, etc., which exposed them to
involuntary errors and to suspicion by third parties due to delays in the DCI's execution. The
measures promoted by the UEP for compliance with the submission of financial records were
initially quite unrealistic for the informal economy of most areas, as was the requirement for
budgets on inputs or equipment that were difficult to purchase in the areas. Nevertheless, controls
of the administrative circuit and of fund management were necessary to monitor local
management. It was not possible to find effective mechanisms for adapting the situation to each
area, and this should be a good subject of analysis in order to replicate this project in the
development of rural zones. Based on the UEP and the MDS, the modality of a special receipt
(Community Receipt) was adopted for submitting accounts of funds together with the
implementation of the Monotributo Social.

26.      There were also difficulties and tensions between the project's deadlines and different
stakeholders. The communities were not accustomed to working with the logistics of project
formulation, financial statements, etc., or with deadlines imposed by the DCI. The time it takes
for communities to trust the project and to participate in and execute it is much slower. This
matter is not duly addressed, which not only hinders project execution but also affects the
communities' interest.

27.      Moreover, the mechanisms for the allocation and accounting of funds received by the
Bank hindered the financial flow of project funds, because this was a financially decentralized
project and the delays in fund execution and accounting by some communities negatively affected
all beneficiaries, since the large amount of funds to be disbursed by the Bank to the federal
government depended on the flow of accounting records, which were in the hands of the
communities. The time it took communities to learn and accept the process of requesting and
accounting for funds, was largely responsible for financial delays.




                                                63

28.      The monitoring and evaluation systems of ongoing SpCs were often not effective enough
to understand the subprojects' actual level of success. Indicators were used that sought to quantify
some results but did not allow access to the deeper content of the changes that occurred, because
only generic parameters were used.

Lessons Learned

29.      Inadequate design of the operation: By analyzing this experience, we note that a lesson
to be applied in future operations with rural collectives that lack experience in managing
resources and handling funds, is the need for think about a much longer time for the start-up of
the initial implementation of SpCs due to the long learning period that beneficiaries required.
These types of projects should last at least five or six years; at the start of the project,
communities spend much time on learning and reaching consensus, after which implementation
may be carried out as in any project. The design of similar future operations should therefore
consider an initial learning stage of at least two years, prior to normal execution periods.

30.      Inadequate design of the Central Executing Unit: A project with these characteristics
should have had, from the start, an independent management agency with professional,
multidisciplinary human resources exclusively in charge of project management. The large land
area that the project eventually encompassed and the difficulties of financial and administrative
decentralization and of subproject execution were not considered in the operation's original
design (it initially encompassed only three areas and then began expanding). Project management
acted most correctly in reaching consensus and in resolving conflicts, and played a key role in
policy issues that achieved the resulting broad participation, but it was not supported at first by a
good management agency. Finally, when such support was provided by the MDS, execution was
successful.

31.      Lack of adjustment of financial regulations to high levels of informality in markets:
Throughout the execution process, attempts were made to adjust financial regulations to the
reality of informal markets in rural indigenous communities, but without much success. This was
one of the principal causes of the delay in project execution. Although communities learned
important lessons on fund management and accounting, the characteristics of the high level of
informality in this type of rural economies implied serious difficulties in generating flows of
funds that were adequate to this reality. It is believed necessary to keep these difficulties in mind
at the time of designing a similar project, aiming to create financial mechanisms that are more in
line with the realities of this group of beneficiaries.

32.      Inadequate design of monitoring and evaluation systems: This was a shortcoming
throughout the entire management process. At the start of the project, project baselines were not
properly recorded in order to make comparisons at midterm and at the end of the process, nor
were efficient monitoring and evaluation systems designed at the start. For future operations of
this type, it is recommended that time be invested at the project's start-up to design efficient
monitoring and evaluation systems.

33.      Inadequate design of some projects: In some cases, the project designs did not take into
account long-term sustainability forecasts with regard to the maintenance of operational and
maintenance costs.

Project Sustainability

34.      In general, all communities participating in the project have been strengthened in terms of
their capacity for organization, deliberation, reaching consensus, and administrative management
through the different activities carried out in the various subprojects. Outreach workers from the


                                                   64

communities themselves, selected through a transparent process and trained in the UMLs, as well
as administrative assistants, constitute an important human resource that should not be
overlooked.

35.      The incorporation of such personnel in INAI's temporary or permanent staff would be a
good sustainability effort and a means of retaining the social capital strengthened through the
project. There are presently no resolutions on this matter, although there are political intentions
that staff members who were hired for 2007 to support the MDS in project conclusion activities,
would become part of the Institute's staff as of 2008.

36.      Although a positive factor throughout the DCI's implementation was that the UMLs
functioned as separate entities from INAI and were not influenced by the Institute's particular
problems, once the project is completed this element signifies a difficulty in the management of
trained human resources.

37.      The assets that were purchased through the DCI have now been transferred to the
ownership of INAI. Therefore, it is believed that the institute should take over their operational
expenses. Throughout this year, expenses for stationery, telephone service, and maintenance of
vehicles purchased by each UML have been financed with the local support of the DCI and
through INAI's budget. From here on, the institute should accept the mechanisms of financing the
maintenances of these assets.

38.      With regard to the maintenance of projects financed by the DCI in the communities, the
operational and maintenance expenses of assets have not been taken into account in all cases. In
some cases, the communities have made agreements with other government agencies (such as
INTA and universities) to receive technical assistance and to be able to cover operational
expenses. In cases where this type of agreement cannot be reached, INAI should be asked to
cover the operation and maintenance costs of investments made under the DCI.
