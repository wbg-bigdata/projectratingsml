1. COUNTRY AND URBAN TRANSPORT BACKGROUND
COUNTRY ECONOMIC CONTEXT
1.1   Turkmenistan, the southernmost republic of the former Soveit Union, is bordered
to the west by the Caspian Sea, to the south by Iran and Afghanistan, to the east by
Tajikistan and to the north and northeast by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The country
gained its independence on October 27, 1991. Turkmenistan lies in the midst of two of
the largest deserts in the world, the Karakum and Kyzyl Kum, and 90% of its land is
considered arid. With an area of 488,000 kin2, it is the fourth largest country of the
Former Soviet Union republics (FSU).
1.2   Turkmenistan is one of the least urbanized of the FSU countries with 45% of the
total population in urban areas. The country's small population of 4.5 million people is
concentrated in a thin strip of land along the foothills of the South and in areas where the
land is irrigated. The nation's capital, Ashghabat, is the largest urban center with an
estimated population of 500,000.  Compared to other countries of the FSU,
Turkmenistan7s health indicators are poor. Life expectancy is the lowest (63 for males
and 70 for females); the infant mortality rate (IMR) is the highest (46/1,000); maternal
mortality is the fifth highest; rates of cardiovascular dieseases are extremely high and
increasing; and respiratory, digestive, infectious and parasitic diesease are also among the
highest of any FSU countries.
1.3   Turkmenistan's economy is dominated by energy and agriculture. It has 1.3
trillion cubic meters of proven and probable natural gas reserves and is the world's fourth
largest natural gas producer. It also has 1.1 billion tons of oil reserves. Despite these
energy reserves, the economy is still predominantly agricultural.
THE URBAN SETTING
1.4   The urban population, estimated at 1.9 million in 1994, accounts for about 45% of
the total population compared to a range of 40% to 75% in FSU and 30% to 60% in the
Central Asia subregion of the FSU. However, the rate of growth in the urban population
has been particularly high since 1990, reflecting the increasing liberalization of economic
activity, the mobility of labor, and the relatively strong growth of the service sector in
urban areas.
1.5   Ashghabat, the nation's capital, is the largest urban center with an estimated
population of 500,000. Since 1991, the Government has devoted much of its development
budget to upgrading the city's commercial and administrative infrastructure. This
expenditure has underpinned both a substantial growth in construction and commercial



2                                                                    Chapter I
activity and contributed to the rapid growth of eight per cent per annum in the city's
population in the last five years.
1.6   The other major urban centers in the country are Chardjou (population of
180,000), Mary (population of 167,000), Dashkovuz (population of 140,000), Nebitag
(population of 109,000) and Turkmenbashi (population of 64,000). In aggregate, the
population of these towns has been stagnant since 1991.
1.7   With the exception of Ashghabat, the major urban centers are the administrative
centers for the country's five local governments (velayats). Ashghabat, as the capital city,
has velayat status. Funding for local services and infrastructure provided by the urban
centers is derived predominantly from the central government through a system of
revenue-sharing of centrally administered taxes (Value-Added Tax, income taxes and
natural resources tax) and subventions from the central government. The revenue-sharing
rates and the level of subventions are determined annually. Velayats can levy their own
taxes and user fees and can borrow to finance services and investments. All local
government budgets are subject to approval by the central government, giving it a
primary role in determining the level and composition of urban services.
URBAN TRANSPORT IN TURKMENISTAN
1.8   The total passenger vehicle population of Turkmenistan is estimated at 50,000
units. Detailed vehicle statistics are only available for Ashghabat, which is estimated to
account for over 40% of the national public transport vehicle population, of which 90%
are cars. In terms of ownership and use, about 70% of the car fleet is privately owned
with the balance owned by enterprises or operated as public taxis. In contrast, only about
ten percent of the bus and minivan fleet is owned privately, with the rest held by
enterprises for transport of their workforces or operated by the public transport enterprise.
Although private car ownership in Ashghabat has grown rapidly over the last five years,
the car population, at 25 units per 1000 population or 200 units per square km, is still
very small in comparison with other middle income countries.
1.9   The relatively small private car population has left a large role for public transport
in meeting mobility needs in urban centers. A detailed survey of passenger transport use
in Ashghabat indicates that about 55% of the city's population relies exclusively on
public transport for work and social trips compared to 20% that depend exclusively on the
use of private cars or enterprise transport.  Given significantly lower private car
ownership rates, the degree of dependence on public transport is probably substantially
greater in the rest of the country.
1.10        Public transport in the urban areas is provided predominantly by a fleet of
2,000 diesel and gasoline buses operated by municipally owned enterprises managed by
the Ministry of Autotransport (MoAT). The distribution, age profile and availability of
the bus fleet by urban area is summarized in Table 1.1 below.

1.11   The diesel and gasoline bus fleet in Ashghabat is supplemented by a fleet of 63
electric trolleybuses operated and managed by a municipally-owned enterprise. The
recent availability of this fleet is about 70%.
1.12  By international standards, the publicly-managed bus fleet is of adequate size in
relation to the population in all urban centers. However, the low availability of the
vehicles has eroded the capacity of the enterprises to provide an adequate and consistent
level and quality of service in most areas. The main causes of the present low availability
of the fleet are: (i) lack of resources for timely maintenance of vehicles; (ii) low vehicle
replacement rates in relation to the operating entities vehicle retirement criteria; and (iii)
the incentive these two factors provide to bus operators to both defer maintenance and
cannibalise the older vehicles in the fleet to maintain the progressively dwindling stock of
newer operable buses. The causes of low availability rates result from the inadequate
cash generation of public transport enterprises arising from the nature of their
organization and regulation and inadequate budgetary funding to compensate for their
losses.
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
1.13   The Ministry of Autotransport (MoAT) is vested with responsibility for urban
transport planning and regulation.  The Ministry also has the responsibility for
management of inter-city bus, urban bus and intercity and urban cargo transport
operations.   These  operations  are  conducted  through  chartered  (commercially
autonomous) enterprises. MoAT staff have executive responsibility for the enterprises'
performance, overall investment planning and financing, budgeting, route scheduling,
operational management, and licensing. Fares for passenger transport are set on a
national basis by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOF) based on submissions by
the MoAT. Fares on trolleybus system are also set by central Government at the same

level as diesel bus operations and the city government finances all operating subsidies.
Investments for system expansion are the responsibility of the central government.
1.14 At the municipal level, the city governments are responsible for setting bus routes
and service levels, constructing and maintaining stops, overseeing service quality and
financing losses incurred by the MoAT's municipal public passenger transport
operations. The financing needs of urban bus transport operations are established
annually in advance through an operational budgeting exercise. The operational budgets
provide for bus replacement financing needs through depreciation charges while the
financing of system expansion is the responsibility of the central government.
Investments for expansion of municipal bus systems are established under the state's
annual development budget.
1.15  The municipalities are also responsible, in principle, for overall planning of land
use and infrastructural facilities (roads, traffic, utilities, etc), the preparation of master
plans for the future investments in urban infrastructure and services, scheduling, and
coordination of all public transport services and road maintenance. In practice, only
Ashghabat has developed the institutions (Agency for Roads Management and
Department of Planning and Architecture) to perform  these services.   Other
municipalities have effectively redelegated these responsibilities to the central
government.
1.16  The licensing of private passenger transport operators in all municipalities is
currently the responsibility of the MoAT. The fares charged by private urban passenger
transport operators were decontrolled with effect from December, 1995.
1.17 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for the formulation and implementation of
traffic laws in all urban areas. The Ministry is also responsible for the operation of traffic
signals and road safety in all cities.
1.18  The prevailing institutional arrangements for the delivery of urban public
transport services have a number of serious shortcomings:
(a)   Fragmentation of Responsibilities. The division of responsibility for the
operational and financial performance of the bus systems increases the
complexity  of managing  such  systems.   More importantly, the
fragmentation of responsibilities for the systems has diffused
accountability for their performance. While municipalities have
responsibility for any residual financing requirements of the system, they
have neither the powers nor the capacity to exercise effective oversight of
the MoAT's operational management. Similarly, the MoAT is compelled
to continue to provide services irrespective of the payment of subsidy
obligations by the cities. In practice, the municipalities have abdicated
most responsibility for oversight of the bus system for two reasons: (i)
owing to staffing constraints, they have been unable to assess and thus
control the efficiency with which bus services are provided; and (b) they



Chapter I                                                                5
have not been able to finance the full recurrent subsidies required by the
bus systems, at current efficiency levels, to operate at agreed service
levels. In Ashghabat, there is no effective formal mechanism for co-
ordination of the operations and investment planning for the bus and
trolleybus systems. Most of the co-ordination of the services operations is
currently based on informal but strong ties between the management of the
systems;
(b)   Commingling of Regulatory and Functional Roles. The regulatory and
policy roles of the MoAT are commingled with its direct operating
responsibilities for the dominant segment of urban passenger transport.
This creates potential conflicts of interest in the development of
appropriate public policy and, given the limited staff of MoAT, serves to
dilute its effectiveness in both operational management and policy
making;
(c)   Inadequate Incentives for Monitoring of Performance Standards. Under
the present institutional arrangements, the regulating and supervisory
agencies (MoAT, the municipalities and the MOF) bear little of the
financial burden arising from their decisions. At the same time, public
transport operators are not held accountable for defined standards of
operating efficiency.   This absence of mutual accountability for
performance has fostered a climate of poor performance;
(d)   Difusion of Management Capability. The MoAT has a number of diverse
operating responsibilities. Its operation of urban taxi services is peripheral
to the main public objective of providing mass transport services and
results in diverting both managerial and public investment resources from
the provision of bus services, used by a majority of the population. Its
extensive involvement in inter-urban bus and cargo services as well as
intra-urban cargo services further stretches its capacity; and
(e)   Erosion of Financial Performance. The operating subsidy requirements of
public transport has grown substantially since 1991 as fares have been
subject to tight regulatory restraint, while operating costs, particularly
spare parts, have increased significantly. Cost increases have taken place
as traditional managed trade relations between the COMECON countries
and the FSU, and within the FSU, have been replaced by market-based
* relations and prices. Municipal budgetary support to public transport has
not grown correspondingly to cover the ensuing financing gap, forcing
MoAT to partly cross-subsidize bus operations by its other relatively cash-
generative transport operations and to partly curtail maintenance of the
fleet. Vehicle replacement rates have been similarly constrained by a lack
of funds. Recent bus replacement investments have reflected barter
opportunities  rather than  programmed  purchases.   Under these



6                                                                     Chapter I
procurement conditions, it is difficult to subject investments to economic
and technical assessment or to assess in advance the complementary
investments necessary for their optimal operation.
GOVERNMENT'S URBAN TRANSPORT STRATEGY IN SECTOR
1.19  The Government recognizes the need for substantial changes to the framework
within which public transport services are provided in the urban areas. Since the
commencement of an active dialogue with the Bank on the sector, the Government has
adopted a reform program for the sector designed to: (a) establish a framework for the
efficient and cost-effective performance of public sector transport operations; (b) provide
a stable and adequate level of funding to ensure the sustainability of efficient service
provision by the public sector; and (c) reduce the fiscal burden on the public sector by
promoting private sector involvement in the provision of public transport.
1.20 The reform program as presented in the Government's Policy Statement (June
1996) included the following key measures (Annex 1.1):
(a)   consolidation of managerial responsibility for all public sector passenger
transport operations in each municipality under one autonomous agency
accountable to the municipal government;
(b)   institution of explicit operating and financial performance objectives for
transport agencies by the municipal governments under annual contracts
for delivery of specified services;
(c)   determination of the annual subsidy requirements of the agencies in
advance based on budgets embodying the agreed performance objectives;
(d)   allocation of each municipality's agreed subsidy requirement in the central
government budget annually in advance coupled with adequate measures
to supplement budgetary allocations to take account of increases in
operating costs that are not compensated by increases in fares;
(e)   a progressive increase in fares for public transport services provided by the
municipalities to a level sufficient to cover the full cash costs of operating
the services; and
(f)   the expansion of private participation in the provision of public transport
services through the abolition of regulatory restrictions on the provision
of taxi and minivan services, the leasing of minivans currently owned and
operated by the public sector to private operators, the encouragement of
participation by private operators in the provision of services in selected
areas of municipalities under contractual agreements with the
municipalities, and the liberalization of fares for all private sector transport
operations except for contracted services with the municipalities.



Chapter 1                                                            7
1.21 In addition to these measures, the Government now requires the public sector
transport operators to prepare and implement Operations Improvement Plan (OIP),
presented in Annex 1.2 and discussed in para 4.18 to address weaknesses in their
operating performance before the Government would commit to provide new
investments.
1.22 The Government has already taken a number of key actions to implement the new
framework for public transport operations. The key elements of the reform program
implemented by the Government over the past year include:
(a)   A  Presidential Decree, requiring  the  municipalities to  assume
responsibility for all mass public sector transport operations in their
jurisdiction was introduced in March 1996;
(b)   The Government has established an Ashghabat Passenger Autotransport
Production Organization (APAPO) designed to introduce and implement
improved systems and practices to the management of all aspects of urban
transport operations in Ashghabat. The organization is headed by a
Director-General and other key positions in the management group are in
place. The office space for APAPO has been identified;
(c)   An OIP has been prepared and is under implementation in the city of
Ashghabat. The successful implementation of OIP would lay the
groundwork for effective utilization of the significant bus replacement
investment program planned for the city;
(d)   The Government is implementing its reform program to improve cost
recovery. The bus fares have gradually increased from 0.05 manats per
trip in January 1995 to 50 manats in December 1996. This increase in
fares is significantly above the rate of devaluation in the domestic
currency;
(e)   The private participation in the provision of public transport services has
expanded through: (a) abolition of regulatory restrictions on the provision
of taxi and minivan services; (b) the leasing of minivans currently owned
by the public sector to private operations; and (c) the liberalization of fares
for all private sector transport operations except for contracted services
with the municipalities. More recently, a Presidential Decree, requiring
privatization of a part of the public taxi fleet through open auctions,
organized by the State Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange of
Turkmenistan was introduced on July 1, 1996; and
(f)   APAPO has initiated the Social Assessment to create a foundation for the
involvement of citizens in providing inputs to transport policy and
contribute to policy dialogue.

URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT
1.23 Energy consumption and emissions from vehicles are high in former Soviet Union
countries compared to Western European and North American standards, particularly
carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC). Not only were domestic vehicles
produced without catalytic converters and basics like electronic ignition and exhaust-gas
recirculation, but also there was the widespread use of gasoline rather than diesel fueled
heavy vehicles and buses. About 45 percent of the urban bus fleet in Ashghabat is still
powered by gasoline rather than less polluting and more fuel-efficient diesel-powered
engines.
1.24 Reductions in CO, HC and Pb emissions can be made by changing the
composition of the vehicle fleet. The project will improve air quality in the project cities
because of the replacement of gasoline-powered buses by diesel-powered ones,
rehabilitation and improved maintenance of the bus fleet.
1.25  The proposed project will not generate activities that create significant new or
additional environmental impact. The objective of the project is to stabilize public
transport capacity and restore public transport passenger spaces lost due to past and
continuing attrition within the bus and trolleybus fleets. The project does not create new
capacity nor increase fleet sizes beyond previous limits. The impact of the project on
public transport vehicle emission levels will be moderately beneficial (paras 4.53-4. 54).
1.26 Draft legislation for environmental legislation and emission standards for
Turkmenistan has been reviewed during project preparation and the proposed project does
not conflict with the draft legislation.
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
1.27  The role of the Bank in the sector is essentially twofold. First, drawing upon its
international and regional experience, the Bank is in a strong position to support the
Government in formulating the strategies necessary to ensure that an adequate, efficient
and sustainable level of public transport services is available to the urban population.
Second, the Bank can assist the Government in implementing these strategies through
both the finaticing of technical advice, training and investments and direct analytical
support to the Govermment during implementation. The proposed project would also be
important for the implementation of key reforms, not only in the urban transport sector,
but also in other areas of the public sector, by demonstrating the effectiveness of such
reforms.
1.28  A first Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has been prepared, at the
request of the Government, for discussion by the Board, together with this Operation.
The proposed project is consistent with that CAS. Specifically, the strategies for
reorganization, financing, and regulation of urban transport services that the Government
has adopted, following close dialogue and collaboration with the Bank, would help

contribute to: (a) reduction of the potential call on the Govemment's fiscal resources for
operating subsidies and capital investments; (b) promotion of structural reforms in the
economy by advancing the efficient restructuring and partial privatization of an important
and visible sector; (c) strengthening of the Government's capacity for the overall
management of a sector that is critical to efficient economic performance; and (d)
improvement of access for the relatively poor segment of the urban population to a basic
transport service.






2. THE URBAN TRANSPORT SUBSECTOR IN ASHGHABAT
TRANSPORT SUPPLY CHARACTERISTICS
2.1   Mass public transport services are provided by diesel bus and trolleybus
enterprises. The composition of the bus and trolley fleet is summarized in Annex 2.1.
2.2   The total bus fleet in November 1996 was 195 buses (68 Ikarus, 76 Laz, 50 Sahab,
and 1 Karosa). Since April 1996, 21 Ikarus buses have been scrapped and removed from
the books and 12 Laz buses have been transferred to other towns. Eighteen buses are
long-term defective, awaiting engines and can be rehabilitated and returned to service. In
addition, 34 buses are in workshop for various short-term defects. On average, only 55%
of the total vehicle fleet is available for service at any time. The low availability of the
bus fleet reflects two factors. First, the LAZ buses, comprising 40% of the fleet have
unfavorable design features, are prone to a high rate of failure and require intensive
maintenance. Second, the bus enterprise has encountered great problems in obtaining the
financing to import and hold an inventory of spare parts necessary to ensure the adequate
maintenance of the total fleet of buses at an acceptable level of availability. One adverse
consequence of the attendant deferral of maintenance of the fleet has been a significant
acceleration in the deterioration of the mechanical condition of the fleet and the
shortening in the operating life of buses. The usual practice has been to cannibalize buses
out of service. At present, buses are operated for six to seven years as compared to an
assessed operating life of adequately maintained buses, in similar climatic and road
conditions, of 10 to 15 years.
2.3   The trolleybus fleet has also experienced similar maintenance and availability
problems. Out of a total of 63 trolleybuses in 1996, six trolleybuses (with an average age
greater than 10 years) are life expired and cannibalized to the extent that only shells
remain. Twelve trolleybuses are over five years old and due to shortage of funds, have
not undergone the capital repair program required at the mid-life point for trolleybuses.
At present, only 70% of the vehicle fleet is available for service. Over the past five years,
the vehicle fleet has been reduced by 18%.
2.4   The bus enterprise also operates a fleet of minibuses, minivans and taxis. The
minibus fleet of 134 vehicles consists of 101 buses purchased in 1994 and 33 Mercedes
purchased in 1995, under barter arrangements with Iran. While the vehicles represent a
further diversification of vehicle model and spare parts requirement in the fleet of the
enterprise, no provisions were made for after-sale service facilities or support. After an
initial period of high reliability in service, the minibus fleet has already started to
experience increasing mechanical problems and declining availability as a result of the
enterprise's inability to perform scheduled maintenance and services and the poor quality



12                                                                   Chapter II
of buses. A number of measures have been taken by the Government over the past
eighteen months to privatize operations of minivans and taxis (paras 2.28-2.30).
2.5   The bus enterprise controls a fleet of about 1,000 taxis consisting predominantly
of Volgas with an average age of 10 years. A significant addition was made to the fleet
in 1994 with the purchase of 100 cars from Turkey. Vehicles in the fleet are operated by
the enterprise for 450,000 km, after which they are leased to the drivers or set aside.
Lease terms provide for the maintenance of the vehicle by the enterprise. Currently,
about 60% of the taxi fleet is operational and about 50% of the operational fleet is
operated on a lease-basis.
2.6   The RAF minivan fleet consists of 59 vehicles purchased in 1993. Beginning
March 1996, all minivans are leased out to private operators for unrestricted use within
the city.
2.7   The provision of privately owned and operated public transport services, although
growing, is limited. The Government formally liberalized entry into public passenger
transport in December 1994, with the eligibility to operate subject to a simple licensing
and registration process. However, only a small proportion of vehicles has been licensed.
Nonetheless, there is a vigorous informal and unlicensed private provision of passenger
services. In particular, private cars and enterprises' own transport play a growing and
visible role in the. city's transport supply. Enterprise taxis and private cars have increased
significantly between 1993 and 1994, with private cars increasing from 30,997 in 1993 to
34,652 in 1994 (growth rate of 11 percent) and enterprise taxis increasing from 768 to
1,210 (over 50 percent growth rate) for the same time period.
2.8   Performance Measures of Public Transport Operations. There are 29 diesel-
bus, 7 trolleybus, and 20 minibus routes in the city. The public transport system, as
currently structured and operated, suffers from a number of deficiencies:
(a)   Network Coverage. While the network coverage of the city is generally
good, it leaves significant segments of the city partially or completely
unserved. The most prominent unserved area is the northeast which is also
the part of the city with the lowest household income.
(b)   Overlapping Services. The overlap in routes served by the three public
transport systems (diesel bus, trolleybus, and minibus) is excessive and
leads to significant competition rather than complementary in the
provision of services. The resulting congestion of services along some
routes penalizes service quality in other routes while tying up capacity
which could otherwise be allocated to underserved or high demand zones.
. (c)   Overlapping routes. The incidence of overlapping routes operated by the
same system is high. This has led to an inefficient allocation of capacity
on some routes, as well as excessive traffic on other routes, irregularity of
service, and undue congestion at bus stops.



Chapter 11                                                            13
(d)   Long Routes. Bus and minibus routes are extremely long for urban
services catering to passengers with an average trip length of about 2 km.
This leads to long trips for passengers as well as lower than attainable
frequency of bus arrivals.
(e)   Service Unreliability.  Owing to frequent vehicle failures and weak
operational planning and control of crews and vehicles, there are frequent
and abrupt interruptions of service and the punctuality of service is highly
variable. In particular, bus service quality varies with the time-of-the-day
and the day-of-the-week. The highest bus frequencies are available
during the weekday morning peak period and lower during the afternoon
peak-period. The frequency of bus arrivals tapers off as the day progresses
and is lowest during the weekends. In addition, bus drivers often take
detours to satisfy individual travelers willing to pay higher fares.  The
unreliability of public transport services often forces people to take the
more expensive private modes.
TRANSPORT DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT
2.9   Background. A social assessment (SA) was conducted in February 1995, as part
of the identification process for the proposed urban transport project in Turkmenistan.
The study was conducted in the capital city of Ashghabat, and focused on various aspects
of demand and supply of public and private transportation, various stakeholder groups
(households, transport users, bus drivers, drivers of private vehicles and bus and
trolleybus enterprises).  It also incorporated results of discussions with the public
transport agency and the municipality. (Annex 2.2)
2.10  Objectives.  The overall objective of the  SA was to provide a better
understanding of the transport use patterns and needs in Ashghabat. The specific
objectives were to:
(a)   examine the socio-economic profile of city residents;
(b)   evaluate the social impact of the proposed project on households and
investigate how certain social groups may be affected;
(c)   help identify the most critical interventions to be undertaken to improve
urban transport in Ashghabat;
(d)   evaluate prevailing expenditure on transport by different income groups
and examine users' willingness to pay for improved public transport
services; and



14                                                                        Chapter II
(e)    examine travel characteristics of the different segments of the city
population.
2.11   Methodology. The social assessment was conducted by two teams from the
Magtymguly State University, Ashghabat, and the Turkmen Academy of Sciences,
Ashghabat. A total of 81 local social scientists and computer specialists were mobilized
to conduct about 2,000 interviews and analyze data. The research effort was supported
by a team of social scientists from the World Bank. The social assessment consisted of:
(a) household survey; (b) transport user survey; (c) vehicle service characteristics survey;
(d) enterprise survey; and (e) informal meetings with different user and operator groups.
2.12   Findings. The SA identified five key attributes of
public transport demand in Ashghabat. First, as in all    TABLE 2.1: SHARE OF PERSON
FSU  countries, while the share of public transport in    TRIPS BY MODE, 1995
meeting the mobility needs of the city's population has
contracted significantly from 90% estimated in a survey in    Mode          Sha
1991 to 60% in 1995, public transport continues to play a    PublicTransort  60.3%
dominant role in urban transport services in the city. Of    Bus            36.00/o
the estimated 560,000 average daily person trips in 1995,    Minibus         7.3%
Trolleybus        8.0%
almost 60 percent use some form  of public transport,    Taxi                9.00/0
while the rest use private vehicles or enterprise transport
or walk. The contraction in the share of public transport is    Private Trnport    39.7%
Enterprise Bus    6.90/o
attributable mainly to three factors: (i) the decline in the    Walk        20.0%/o
service capacity and reliability of the public transport    Private Car     12.8%
fleet; (ii) the growth in private vehicle ownership and in
own-transport  by enterprises; and (iii) the expanding
settlement in the peripheral areas of the city that are
unserved or underserved by the public transport network. The SA also highlighted the
existence of inadequate support infrastructure, including street lighting and sheltered bus
stops. Second, about 50 percent of the trips using public transport vehicles are work trips,
10 percent are school trips and the balance are shop and social trips. Third, on average,
trip duration using public transport is 41 minutes (including time to walk to bus stop and
waiting for a bus). Average waiting time for a bus is about 20 minutes. However, there
is considerable variation around this mean trip time depending on the time-of-the-day.
People walking to their destination, on average, walk for 19 minutes and generally work
in the vicinity of their residences. Fourth, average household expenditure on transport
varies from 6 percent for high-income groups to 12 percent for low-income groups. The
poor people pay a lot more for meeting daily transport needs than the fare on public
transport would suggest, because of the necessity to use private transport modes at ten-
time the official fare. In addition, many of the poor people are forced to undertake most
of the journey on foot. Fifth, use of various modes of transport services in Ashghabat is
highly differentiated both by gender and ethnicity. For example, 28 percent of women
walk to work as compared to 14 percent of men; 7 percent of women commute by car as



Chapter II                                                              15
compared to 20 percent of men; and 10 percent of women use enterprise transport as
compared to 20 percent by men.
2.13  The SA also underscored that with a decline in public transport services, people
have had to use other arrangements to satisfy their daily mobility needs, including,
changing their work place to be closer to home, abandoning shift-working, or using
informal services.  The data revealed that a high  percentage of people (almost 80
percent) reported paying much more than the prevailing "official fares" on public
transport services.
2.14 A review of improvements suggested by residents showed a strong preference for
management and institutional reform. With regard to willingness to pay, almost all users
(94 percent) reported willingness to pay for improved services. When people were asked
to identify specific improvements expected, they reported the need for higher vehicle
frequency, reliability, additional routes, and better comfort. The SA clearly illustrated
that tariff increases, in conjunction with other reforms, would reduce the real "out-of-
pocket" costs for users, while improving services. Low fares in the past have not resulted
in cheap transport for the people, who have had to resort to more expensive forms of
transport services-to satisfy their mobility needs.
2.15  Participatory Process. A stakeholder workshop was held in October 1995 to
share results with the academic community, representatives of MoAT, the municipality,
operators, and the users. The SA results provided inputs to project preparation based on
what the majority of the city's population actually saw as priorities. The SA created a
foundation for the future involvement of citizens in making immediate inputs to transport
policy and development, contributed to policy dialogue, laid the basis for internal reforms
that could be instituted without major cost, and contributed to the overall process of
reform and democratization by linking decision makers to public opinion on a matter of
general concern. As a result of SA findings, the government has already, in the past
eighteen months, instituted reforms, raised bus fares, and improved provision of public
transport services in the city. The specific initiatives undertaken by the government
include:
(a)   salaries of bus and trolleybus drivers were raised substantially in an
attempt to reduce pilferage and improve discipline. Transport supervisors
were designated to ride on buses to enforce operations;
(b)   the bus fare was increased ten times (from 0.05 manat to 0.5 manat per
trip) in July 1995, another ten-times increase in December 1995 (from 0.5
to 5 manat), another four-fold increase (from 5 manat to 20 manat) was
implemented in July, 1996 and most recently, in December 1996, bus fares
have been increased to 50 ma!nats. As a result, the liquidity situation of
public transport enterprises was improved. In addition, the discretionary
charges imposed by bus drivers were reduced, resulting in an actual



16                                                                                Chapter II
reduction in the cost of travel to all, and especially to poor with greater
dependence on public transport.
(c)    vehicle maintenance was improved, which together with improved driver
performance allowed better scheduling. Buses displayed routes and fares;
and
(d)    internal management and personnel were strengthened.
2.16 These initiatives went a long way in restoring public confidence in government's
efforts to improve transport services and laid a basis for future reforms. The social
assessment has become a part of the on-going effort by the government to assess,
monitor, and evaluate different approaches to addressing specific concerns of the
residents of Ashghabat. (Box 2.1)
Box 2.1: Social Assessment Initiatives by the Government of Turkmenistan
Over the past six months, the Government has developed social assessment approach to assess, monitor,
and formulate different strategies to address specific concerns of the residents of Ashghabat. The newly
formed bus transport management organization in Ashghabat (APAPO) has a social assessment wing,
headed by a sociologist, with the mandate to solicit opinions from the city residents on specific transport
related concerns, redress their grievances, and identify critical interventions to improve the city transport.
A dedicated hot line has been established for the residents to express their concerns.
Between August, 1996 and December, 1996, the social assessment team has conducted a random survey of
400 residents in the city.  The survey is designed as a three-page questionnaire.  The typical
recommendations made by the residents include:
*  change in bus stop locations to address passenger demand;
*  extend bus routes to better serve the residents;
*  increase in number of buses along corridors of heavy demand;
*  redesign bus routes to improve accessibility of poorly served areas;
*  improve bus scheduling;
*  provide better information on busstop signs;
*  display bus tariffs to control overcharging;
*  improve cleanliness in buses;
*  provide safe environment for commuters;
*  improve drivers' training to improve service quality; and
*  improve fare collection procedures.
The SA team analyzes the data and prepares a report for implementation by the transport companies. Most
of the concerns and issues raised by the residents have already been addressed by the transport companies.
The bus routes have been changed to accommodate residents' demands, frequency on some corridors has
been increased, new routes have been introduced, more efficient fare collection reporting systems have
been introduced, better discipline is enforced, and disciplinary action has been taken against a number of
bus drivers and staff for violating rules.

and trolleybus fares is to ensure that public transport is accessible to all segments of the
population. Up until June 1995, the fares for buses and trolleybuses were set at 0.05
manats per trip, leading to a significant erosion in their real value when compared to
inflation of about 25% over the same period. More graphically, by June 1995, the value
of bus fare per trip had been eroded to the point where it was equal to the cost of printing
a ticket.
2.18  In principle, the rigid control of public transport fares was meant to ensure that
public transport was affordable to all segments of the population. No efforts were made
in the past to evaluate if the residents could afford to pay higher fare for a better and more
reliable service or even what they were actually paying to satisfy their daily transport
requirements. In .practice, low fares led to: (a) a severe squeeze in the operating margin
of operators which was not compensated by operating subsidies from the municipality or
the Government; (b) a sharp deterioration in service quality; and (c) increasing diversion
of the population to other emerging and more expensive modes, primarily informal taxis.
The adverse side-effects of the bus fares policy on the effective cost of public transport
was exacerbated by two other factors: (a) the high rates of inflation led to a progressive
withdrawal of the low denomination 0.05 manat coins from circulation, forcing many
passengers to use higher denomination (2 manat) currency for the 0.05 manat fare; and
(b) households demonstrated willingness to pay substantially in excess of regulated fares,
coupled with poor supervisory control over bus drivers, provided strong incentives for
drivers to charge in excess of officially set fares, for personal gains. Often, the drivers
charged arbitrary fares (especially during off-peak period) giving riders the choice to
either pay or get off. Finally, monthly passes, which at 5 manats per month offered
potentially substantial discounts on the official fares to frequent users, became
increasingly unattractive as the predictability of the bus and trolleybus services
deteriorated.
2.19  The findings of the Social Assessment demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the
fares policy as an instrument for ensuring the affordability of public transport. The
majority (70%) of users were paying about 2.0 manats per trip using public transport
while the average cost of trips for cash paying respondents was about 3.2 manats for
transport, including taxis and minivans (as against the official fare of 0.05 manat per trip
for public transport). In addition, as almost 65 percent of the respondents were required
to change mode at least once to complete a trip, the average actual fare paid for one trip
was increased to about 5 manat.
2.20  Cost Recovery. Between January 1995, when the preparation of this urban
transport project started, and December 1996, the bus fares have gradually increased one-
thousand fold (para 2.15). As a result of the increase in fare structure, cost recovery

(excluding depreciation) has increased from less than three percent in 1995 to more than
ten percent in 1996 (see Table 2.2). The financial data presented in Table 2.2 reflects an
average for the 1996 fiscal year. Focusing only on the month of December 1996 when
the most recent fare increase was announced, cost recovery improved to more than 25
percent (for an explanation of the significantly higher cost recovery for minibuses, see
para 2.22). However, this cost recovery ratio overstates the financial performance of the
operating enterprises because maintenance expenditures are underestimated. Most of the
maintenance and repairs performed on the vehicles are undertaken with parts cannibalized
from other vehicles, recycled, or fabricated in-house and the cost of these services is not
fully reflected in the enterprise's accounts. In addition, a number of buses are allowed to
fall to a condition of disrepair so that average vehicle availability has continued to
decline. The resulting high rate of bus attrition has adversely impacted service frequency
and reliability.
2.21   In addition to low fares, cost recovery is further reduced because more than 60
percent of bus riders are either exempted from paying fare or manage to evade making a
payment. The category of people exempted from paying fare in Ashghabat is contained
in Box 2.2. As a result, only about 40 percent of the riders pay for using bus services.
The existing system for fare payments allows considerable leakages in revenue collection.
Assurances were receivedfrom the Government during negotiations that: (a) number
ofpeople receivingfare exemptions would be reduced; and (b) efficientfare collection
system would be set in place to eliminate fare evasion.

Box 2.2: Exemptions From Payment For Use of Public Urban Transport
In reviewing the revenue profile of the Ashghabat bus service, the following categories of people were exempted
from paying fares.
Payment For Children
On suburban and city bus and taxi routes every adult may transport, for free, one child under the age of seven as
long as the child does not occupy a separate seat. If however, there are several children under the age of seven (in
one party), the full fare is payable for all but one child.
Cabinet Members of Turkmenistan, heroes of Turkmenistan for recipients of honors received from the former
USSR for all types of public transport.
Participants in the Great Patriotic War; the Afghanistan War and people awarded with medals and orders from the
former USSR for labor and military service; parents and wives of military servicemen killed defending the USSR
for all urban transportation (excluding taxis).
Handicapped children under the age of 16, invalids of groups I and II because of the defects of eyesight, hearing
and speech and people accompanying invalids of group I for all urban transportation, excluding taxis.
School children living in rural areas traveling to schools situated in villages or cities.
Medical workers (doctors, nurses) transporting sick people.
Drivers and conductors of bus and transport companies and control service employees of MoAT.
Veterans of labor, (pensioners) and GPW, and family members of perished soldiers for all types of urban transport
(except taxi).
Inspectors or the Prosecutors office, bailiffs and policemen.
Miscellaneous other groups.
Preferential Passes for Buses for Inter-City Transport Provided to the following:
Students of comprehensive, special, and boarding schools and professional colleges.
Children and adolescents from I st June to 31 st August pay 20% of the tariff.
From November I - March 31, students older than 12 years pay 50% of the tariff.
Reimbursements for transport companies for free and preferential tickets is meant to be financed from local
budgets in accordance with Presidential decree N369 of 19 August 1991.
2.22    Cost recovery on the minibus services has been significantly better (125 percent)
because of: (a) a Government decision to allow higher fares (almost ten times) on the
minibuses which, as compared to diesel buses and trolleybuses, were expected to offer a
better quality of service; (b) the low maintenance requirement in the early part of life of
the new minibuses and, correspondingly, the higher utilization rate of the fleet; and (c)



20                                                                 Chapter 11
higher revenues obtained from the rental of the older fleet of minivans to enterprises and
from the leasing of the vehicles to the drivers and third parties. The cost recovery ratio
on this fleet however is coming under increasing pressure. As the IVECO bus fleet ages,
its maintenance costs increases and its availability declines; and as the RAF minivans are
retired from service, their contribution to fixed costs are reduced. In addition, the
Govermnent's decision in January 1997 to reduce fares on minibuses to bring them on par
with other bus services operating in the city would further reduce cost recovery ratio of
these services in future.
2.23 Agreements were reached at negotiations that cost recovery for bus and
trolleybus would improve to 40 percent (excluding depreciation) as an average over a
two-month period, as a condition of Loan effectiveness.
URBAN TRANSPORT STRATEGY FOR ASHGHABAT
2.24  The Government recognizes that comprehensive policy reform is needed to
address the underlying causes of the deficiencies in the provision of transport services.
An Urban Transport Policy Statement was issued by the Government in June 1996. A
detailed Action Plan has been developed to support the Government's Transport Policy
Statement (Annex 1. 1). Confirmation of the measures contained in the Action Plan
has been obtainedfrom the Government during negotiations. The following sections
briefly discuss the measures contained in the Action Plan.
2.25  Pricing. The present system of fares undermines the capacity of the bus operators
in Ashghabat to generate financial resources necessary to maintain the adequacy and
efficiency of the present level of service, especially given the capacity of the
municipalities and the central government to finance countervailing subsidies on a timely
and predictable basis. To alleviate this problem, the Government has: (a) increased bus
fare 1000-fold (paragraph 2.15); (b) improved fare collection and monitoring systems;
and (c) re-examine number of exemption categories with a view to reducing number of
people receiving exemptions.
2.26 Subsidy Regime. The effort by the Government is to target transport subsidies to
the truly needy -and to reduce exemptions.  To protect the identifiable groups of
individuals for whom tariff increases will not be affordable, the Governnent will review
and introduce appropriate measures to target subsidies directly to such individuals. The
Government is currently examining the subsidy system from one in which subsidy
requirements are determined after losses are incurred to one where subsidy requirements
are determined annually in advance based on the operating budget of the enterprise. The
Government recognizes that without honoring the subsidy obligation, the capacity of the
system would inevitably decline. The operating budget would take due account of the
contracted service obligations (including the difference between fares paid by recipients
of such subsidies and the full fare), anticipated tariff levels and operating costs necessary
to support efficient operations.



Chapter 11                                                              21
2.27 Institutional Arrangements. An important element of the urban transport
reform program adopted by the Government is to consolidate managerial responsibility
for all public sector passenger transport operations in Ashghabat (bus, trolley bus, and
minibus) under one autonomous agency.  This would reduce fragmentation of
responsibility and strengthen operational management and policy planning in urban
transport in Ashghabat. Towards this objective, the Government has already issued a
decree (para. 1.22) creating Ashghabat Passenger Autotransport Production Organization
(APAPO), responsible for overall management and planning for all public transport
operations in the city.
2.28  Privatization of Transport Services. There is an important role for minivans and
taxi services in the provision of transport services in Ashghabat. The provision of these
services can be undertaken by the private sector without the attendant drain on public
resources, which could be better devoted to operating a mass transport system. Over the
past year, the Government of Turkmenistan has taken measures to privatize operations of
minivans and taxis by leasing them to drivers and allowing them to keep a share of daily
return, after a certain monthly payment has been made. The Government's policy is to
encourage increased participation of the private sector in service provision to encourage
competition and reduce costs through: (a) competitive tendering of taxi and minivan
vehicle requirements of the municipalities; (b) selective transfer of the minivan and taxi
fleet to private operators through leasing and sale of such vehicles or the transfer of
operating rights to such vehicles; and (c) further review and reform of the administration
of the licensing system for private passenger transport operators. The Government
introduced open access to taxi services by the private sector in December 1994 and is
currently studying the changes to licensing procedures and the regulation of operators that
are necessary to attract more operators into the market.
2.29  The ownership of taxi fleet is with public enterprise, and the drivers are required
to pay 60,000 manats per vehicle-operating-day (an increase from 500 manats in July
1995) for eight hours of operation and retain the balance of revenue receipts. Fares on
taxis are set at 300 manats per passenger-km (an increase from 5 manat per passenger-km
in July 1995). In practice, taxi drivers charge two to three times the officially set fare and
even more during late evening hours and holidays. In return for payment to the taxi
garage, drivers get about 300 liters of petrol per month and maintenance is the
responsibility of the MoAT's taxi garage. In practice, the petrol quota is sufficient for
only about ten days, after which the drivers have to purchase their own petrol. The
maintenance obligation is also rarely discharged by the garages due to shortage of parts.
Nominal cost recovery is high due to the omissions in the system of accounting for the
maintenance service. Revenues from taxi operations are used to cross-subsidize the
operating costs of bus services, with very little resources reinvested in maintaining the
taxi fleet. As presently operated, the full burden of replacing the fleet falls on the central
government. Simulations performed by MoAT indicates that, under plausible operating
assumptions and current prices, the total return on a second-hand market value of a
vehicle being operated as a taxi is attractive.

2.30  A Presidential Decree was issued on July 1, 1996, to privatize part of the taxi fleet
in Ashghabat. In accordance with the Decree of the President of Turkmenistan (No.
2702) "On the realization procedure of state enterprises and organization vehicles", for
the purpose of pursuing market-oriented reforms in service-oriented transport sector, the
following measures were introduced: (a) to allow the ministries, agencies, state-owned
enterprises and organizations to realize privatization of vehicles fully depreciated or
technically unfit for further exploitation in the economy of the country through the State
Commodity and Raw Material Exchange; (b) to approve the attached regulations "On the
realization procedure of state enterprises and organization vehicles" (Annex 2.3); (c) to
adopt, hereinafter, that revenues obtained from privatization of the vehicles of self-
supporting enterprises shall be credited to the enterprises' settlement accounts and
channeled for renovation of rolling stock fleet; (d) to channel to the income of an
appropriate budget the revenues obtained from privatization of the vehicles of budgetary
enterprises and organizations; and (e) to conduct privatization procedures of state
enterprises and organization vehicles under the authority of the Ministry of Economics
and Finance of Turkmenistan, as well as, the State Commodity and Raw Materials
Exchange of Turkmenistan. A total of 800 taxis or about half the total taxi fleet in
Ashghabat, presently owned by the taxi garage in the MoAT, have been identified to be
sold to private individuals.



3. LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE
3.1   Since 1972, the World Bank has funded over thirty urban transport projects and an
even larger number of urban development projects with a substantial urban transport
component. These projects have been quite diversified in terms of content, countries, and
circumstances under which they have been designed and implemented. The major
objective of World Bank lending for urban transport has been to improve and extend
available facilities and services through the use of low cost options. For this reason, the
greatest emphasis has been placed on: (a) rationalization of the use of urban transport
facilities, particularly urban roads; (b) provision of better access through upgrading and
extension of the road networks; and (c) improvement in the standards and viability of
public transport services. A more general objective has been to meet the special needs of
the urban poor. Upgrading and extending road networks in low income neighborhoods
has also been a priority, as well as improving the public transport services benefiting the
poor. Other objectives of World Bank urban transport operations have been to improve
planning and coordination and to better integrate urban transport with urban development.
More recently, Bank objectives have focused on the privatization of urban transport,
including contracting out maintenance and other services, but most of the projects
incorporating these objectives are ongoing projects.
3.2   With few exceptions, physical components of urban transport projects were
generally implemented as planned. While some changes did take place and some
components were poorly planned, the physical components proposed at appraisal proved
to be feasible and supported by decision makers. Overall estimated project costs were
also of the right order, although wide variations in individual components occurred.
3.3   Transport policy measures were included in some, but not all projects, with mixed
results. A number of projects (Bombay, Madras, Cote d'Ivoire and Calcutta) invested in
public bus or monopoly bus operations (often supplying buses). Except in Calcutta, all
the companies were relatively efficient with, for example, availability of the fleet of the
order of 90 percent and reasonable staffing ratios. All companies made operational
improvements during project implementation. Nevertheless, governments were reluctant
to allow bus fares to rise adequately to meet agreed revenue/cost ratios (covenanted under
the loans) and for financial targets to be met, demonstrating the political difficulties of
raising fares.
3.4   Project schedules were chronically over-optimistic at appraisal, due to:  (a)
difficulties of implementing traffic schemes; (b) failure to complete final designs in a
timely manner; (G) unfamiliarity with World Bank procedures (especially procurement);
and (d) lack of counterpart funds.



24                                                                 Chapter III
3.5   The Bank is currently financing two urban transport projects in the FSU - one in
Russia (Ln 8806-RU) and one in Kazakstan (Ln 8511-RU). Both projects are progressing
satisfactorily. and achieving their development objectives. In Kazakstan, there has been
considerable progress in the design and implementation of policy and institutional
reforms in the three participating cities. Cost recovery targets have been exceeded,
sufficient funds have been allocated to the transit companies for operations and
considerable progress has been made on privatization of bus services. In Russia, transit
services have been decentralized, cost recovery targets have been exceeded by many of
the 14 participating cities, and key institutional measures have been taken.
3.6   The lessons of World Bank experience have been taken into account in the design
of the project. The preparation of the project has been structured with a view to
minimizing implementation delays: (a) procurement is well advanced - standard bidding
documents for the purchase of new vehicles have been substantially agreed with the
Government; (b) an OIP has been agreed upon and should be implemented before the
loan becomes effective; (c) a new agency (the APAPO) is established to introduce
improved systems and practices to the management of all aspects of urban transport
operations in the city of Ashghabat. The Government has already increased fares by one-
thousand times since preparation of the project began and it has agreed to improve cost
recovery (excluding depreciation) to 40% by loan effectiveness. Agreements were
reached during negotiations to improve cost recovery of the participating transport
oomnpanies (excluding depreciation) to 100% by December 31, 1999, in accordance
with a mutually agreed time bound plan.



4. THE PROJECT
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
4.1   The objective is to improve, on a sustainable basis, the efficiency and effectiveness of
urban transport operations in the Municipalities of Ashghabat, Mary, and Chardjou. Specifically,
the proposed investments would: (a) reform management of the agencies in charge of urban
transport operations in the three participating cities; (b) establish a metropolitan transport
organization (APAPO) responsible for the overall management of bus operations; (c) improve
cost recovery of the operating enterprises; (d) implement an Operations Improvement Plan; (e)
augment and preserve supply of bus services; (f) enhance private sector participation in the
provision of urban transport services; and (g) establish a continuing process of public
consultation.
GENESIS OF THE PROJECT
4.2   The formulation and implementation of a viable and sustainable strategy for the provision
of urban transport services is recognized by the Government as an important element of its
development program. The Government has begun to place increased emphasis on encouraging
private sector investment and improved cost recovery in selected public sector activities as a
means of increasing efficiency and mobilizing resources for development.
4.3   Similar to other countries of the former Soviet Union, Turkmenistan is currently
experiencing a shortage of operable urban public transport vehicles and a corresponding decline
in transport services. The shortage of operable vehicles has been caused by a number of factors
including poor cost recovery as a result of low transit fares, combined with many exemptions and
extensive fare evasion, poor quality vehicles, underfunded and poor maintenance practices, and
generally weak institutional arrangements for the management and regulation of urban transport
services. The urban poor and middle classes are most affected by this decline in service as they
do not have ready access to alternative means of transport. Transport conditions in other major
cities are even worse than in Ashghabat.
4.4   Bank involvement in the project would help to ensure that the evolving Government
strategy to improve urban transport services builds on the considerable experience gained and the
lessons learnt from urban transport projects and reforms in the delivery of public services in
other countries. Beyond addressing urban transport issues and taking into account that this
project would be the first investment operation of the Bank in Turkmenistan, the project would
introduce competitive goods procurement to the country which should have a demonstration
impact well beyond the confines of the project.
4.5   A study of demand and supply of public transport services in Ashghabat was conducted
by the Government (with financial assistance of the Government of Italy through a Bank-
administered trust fund) in 1995. Based on the results of this study, a phased program of
investment requirements was developed by the Government. Key inputs into project design were

DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A.   Transport Vehicles
4.7   City of Ashghabat. The project includes purchase of 52 twelve-meter diesel buses (at an
estimated cost of US$120,000 per bus), 10 CNG/diesel buses (at an estimated cost of
US$135,000 per bus), and 40 twelve meter trolleybuses (at an estimated cost of US$160,000 per
trolleybus). The inclusion of 10 CNG/diesel buses is proposed as a pilot to test technology
viability of CNG buses in Ashghabat operating conditions. The Government has taken a policy
decision to promote CNG-powered buses to address environmental concerns and exploit low cost
abundant supply of CNG. This component also includes a mobile charging unit and equipment
for CNG buses, to be financed by the Government. Buses financed under the loan will have a
longer life, higher availability, require fewer spare parts, and be more fuel-efficient. Agreement
was reached at negotiations on a detailed draft of the technical specifications for buses and
trolleybuses.
4.8   Cities of Mary and Chardjou. The project will include purchase of about twenty-eight
twelve-meter diesel buses for the cities of Mary and Chardjou. The exact number of buses to be
financed by this project will be determined by completion of a detailed investment plan for the
two cities, specifying the age profile of the existing buses, number of buses on road, and an
assessment of the demand gap in the provision of services. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with the Government that as a condition of disbursement of this component, the
Government will submit a detailed investment program for the purchase of new buses for the
two cities, satisfactory to the Bank.
B.   Maintenance and Rehabilitation
City of Ashghabat
4.9   Rehabilitation of vehicles. The project will include rehabilitation of 81 buses, 34
trolleybuses and 33 minibuses. The Bank loan will finance spare parts for rehabilitation of 60
Ikarus buses (US$1.5 million, at an average cost of US$25,000 per bus) and 34 trolley buses
(US$1.02 million, at an average cost of US$30,000 per trolleybus). For minibuses, the Bank
loan will finance spare parts for (a) a program of modification for 101 Iveco minibuses (at an
average cost of US$2,700 per bus) to increase their operational life to nine years, and (b)
rehabilitation of 33 minibuses (US$0.33 million, at an average cost of US$10,000 per bus). The
Government will finance for the rehabilitation of 21 Laz buses (US$0.32 million, at an average
cost of US$15,000 per bus) and for labor and utilities costs of US$0.19 million.



28                                                                 Chapter IV
4.10  Replenishment of the spare parts inventory. Inventories of spare parts for buses,
trolleybuses and minibuses have been allowed to fall to critical levels, making it impossible to
maintain the vehicles to satisfactory standards. The Bank loan will finance replenishment of
spare parts inventories to maintain an average inventory level equal to six months over a two-
year period. For buses, the Bank Joan will finance US$0.8 million, for trolleybuses US$0.59
million, and for minibuses US$0.40 million. In addition, the Government will finance US$0.75
million for buses, US$0.01 million for trolleybuses, and US$0.01 for minibuses.
4.11  Workshop, computers and other tools and equipment. Urban transport companies'
workshops and other equipment are inadequate for the efficient operation of urban transport
services in Ashghabat. In particular, there could be substantial improvement of maintenance
operations if urban transport companies were provided, for example, with paint booths, welders,
steam cleaners, sandblasters, machine shop tools, hand tools and other items of equipment.
Operations would also improve if there were more computers for activities such as route
planning and scheduling, inventory control and accounting and cost control. The total cost of
workshop, computers and other equipment to be financed by the Bank is estimated at about
US$0.59 million for buses, US$1.19 million for trolleybuses and US$0.69 million for minibuses.
The estimated cost of works and materials to be financed by operating companies is US$0.3
million. This component will also include procurement of equipment to set up a tire retreading
facility. This facility would initially service the Ashghabat urban vehicle fleet. The aim is to
recycle the tire stock through a minimum of two retreading processes. The workshop tools and
equipment, to be financed under the loan, will be used to equip the Capital Repair Facility in
Ashghabat (excluding civil works). Agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Government will provide the following by loan effectiveness: (a) a business plan, showing
feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this facility; (b) a plan for attracting other business into
this workshop; (c) a set of options available to bus enterprises to perform the capital repairs
themselves, if they so decide; and (d) identification of the quality of service to be provided by
this facility, including specified service fee.
4.12  OIP-related Investments.  To improve monitoring of vehicles in public transport
enterprises and improve fare collection, the proposed project includes provision for US$2.0
million for investments in related equipment. The proposed investments, if justified, would
include: (a) Automatic Vehicle Location and Monitoring System (AVLM); and (b) ticketing
System.
4.13  The AVLM has three main objectives: (a) to provide real-time location of vehicles in
service and permit a transport control room to adjust service intervals or take other corrective
actions; (b) to provide a control and monitoring mechanism to detect unauthorized deviations
from route by drivers; and (c) to provide data inputs to service planning data systems. The
component will procure the necessary equipment to set up data and/or communication links
between available vehicles (about 350) and a central route control facility. Regarding the
automatic ticketing system, an analysis will be carried out on the most efficient collection system
for Ashghabat, including the ticketing system. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
the completion offeasibility studies and an implementation strategy, satisfactory to the Bank,
for the OIP-related investments would be a condition of disbursementfor this component.

4.14 Incremental Operating Costs. The utility and operating costs associated with the
additional vehicles made available under the project (including both new purchases and
rehabilitated fleet) will be financed by the respective operating companies. The costs would
include expenses for additional operating staff, fuel, tire and other operating costs related to
operating additional vehicles made available under the project. The net incremental operating
cost, for a period of two years, is estimated at about US$1.0 million, to be financed by the
operating companies.
4.15 Establishment of APAPO. A new office for APAPO has been provided by
Government, but it will require some additional work, furnishings and office equipment. The
estimated cost of these works and materials, to be financed by the Government, is US$300,000.
In addition, Government will finance the services of an independent auditor.
4.16 Cities of Mary and Chardjou. The Bank loan will finance US$1.54 million for
rehabilitation of buses, replenishment of spare parts inventory and workshop tools and
equipment. The two participating cities will contribute US$ 100,000 for labor and utility costs.
To qualify for inclusion in the project, APAPO must carry out a study of the urban transport
requirements in the two cities, satisfactory to the Bank. The cities must demonstrate
commitment to an urban transport reform program similar to that implemented in the city of
Ashghabat. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government would submit the
following for the two cities as a condition of disbursement: (a) policy statement, including
OIP and project implementation arrangements; (b) executed Administration Agreement,
satisfactory to the Bank, between the Borrower, each municipality and APAPO; (c) conclusion
of a performance contract between APAPO and each of the two transport companies
satisfactory to the Bank; and (d) conclusion of a service contract between each municipality
and APAPO, satisfactory to the Bank.
C.   Technical Assistance and Training
4.17 TA to APAPO. External assistance will be provided to APAPO in two phases. Phase I,
to be financed by the recently executed Project Preparation Facility (PPF), would be executed
over a 9 to 12 month period. A PPF advance of US$600,000 has been approved by the Bank and
agreed by the Government, of which US$4 10,000 will be for this component. Phase II, the exact
scale and scope to be determined during Phase I, would be financed under the main loan.
Preliminary estimates indicate that a minimum of 60 man-months of consultant assistance would
be needed during Phases I and II over about a 30 to 36 month period. Specifically, the external
staff would: (a) introduce improved systems and practices for the management of all aspects of
urban transport operations in the city of Ashghabat including the implementation of OIP and the
modernization of management, accounting, planning and budgeting systems; (b) develop a
program to assess and improve the operational efficiency Mary and Chardjou transport
enterprises; (c) develop and maintain project accounts and the accounts of APAPO and review
those of the operating companies, including supervision of annual audits by an independent
auditor; and (d) provide inspection services to monitor the production and delivery of buses and
trolleybuses financed under the loan. Draft terms of reference for the technical support specialists
are provided in Annex 4. 1. The execution of a contract, on terms and conditions satisfactory to



30                                                                 Chapter IV
the Bank, of the external consultants to APAPO to assist in the preparation and
implementation of the project and to provide technical support to Ashghabat, and the MoAT is
a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.18 Operations Improvement Plan. APAPO, supported by the specialists financed under
this loan, would introduce operational systems, procedures and supervisory practices required to
support efficient operations of the transport enterprises and effective utilization of the assets. To
identify the required changes in systems and practices, an Operations Improvement Plan (OIP)
was developed by APAPO and MoAT, based on a detailed audit of all transport activities and
related operations information management and supervisory practices. During project
preparation, the management of the bus and trolleybus enterprises felt the need for development
of an OIP to improve capacity and reliability of passenger transport services in Ashghabat by:
(a) implementing a maintenance program to increase the availability of the vehicle fleet;
(b) taking other measures which require little financial resources, to improve operations,
maintenance and general management; and (c) monitoring qualitative and quantitative targets for
service improvements. The OIP is presented in Annex 1.2. The performance monitoring
indicators to evaluate on a continuous basis, the implementation of the project and achievement
of its objectives were agreed with the Government during negotiations (Annex 4.6).
4.19 TA to Assist Ministry of Autotransport and Municipal Governments. The project
also provides technical support to the city of Ashghabat in assisting the Department of Planning
and Architecture in the Mayor of Ashghabat's office with contractual arrangements for APAPO
and overall monitoring of APAPO's performance and obligations for further privatization of
urban transport services, training needs and economic evaluation of urban transport investments.
Technical support will also be provided to the MoAT in furthering reforms in the urban transport
sector throughout the country, including establishing a system for service contracts between local
governments and transport enterprises and increasing private sector involvement in the supply of
transit services and in assessing training needs in the urban transport sector throughout the
country, including identifying local and foreign training institutes, study tours, etc., for the
training of urban transport personnel.
4.20  Training Under the project, the proposed approach is to: (i) tie training initiatives to
project start-up, the operating and maintenance requirements of the vehicle investments, the
immediate functional needs of the organizational arrangements in APAPO and the changing
institutional arrangements of the sector; (ii) introduce senior officials and managers of APAPO,
the cities, MoAT and the transport companies to international management practices in urban
transport to sensitize them to options for change and the role of management and staff training in
the process. Provision has been made under the project (US$0.3 million) for the training of
urban transport sector managerial and operational staff.
COST ESTIMATES
4.21  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is estimated at about
US$38.3 million, with an estimated foreign cost of about US$37.0 million or about 97% of total

on an overall implementation of five years.
4.24  The cost estimates are based on the following: (i) new urban transport vehicles:
quotations received from major vehicle manufacturers; (ii) vehicle rehabilitation: recent rates
for similar services in the FSU; (iii) spare parts: quotations received from major manufacturers;
(iv) workshop, computers and other tools and equipment: based on unit costs for tools and
equipment derived from recent Bank experience; (v) OIP-related investments: based on unit
costs for equipment, material and services derived from recent Bank experience; (vi) technical
assistance and consulting services: actual man-month rates for similar services in the region.
FINANCING PLAN
4.25  The proposed Bank loan of US$34.2 million would finance about 89 percent of total
project costs and 93 percent of foreign costs.  As discussed in project description, the
Government would finance: (a) a mobile charging unit and equipment for CNG/diesel buses; (b)
the rehabilitation of 21 Laz buses including labor and utilities costs; (c) an agreed-upon
replenishment of spare parts inventory; and (d) the additional works, furnishing and office
equipment for the establishment of APAPO. The operating companies would finance: (a) works
and materials for the workshop; and (b) the incremental operating costs associated with
additional vehicles. The cities of Mary and Chardjou are expected to contribute 100% of the
local costs.
4.26 It is proposed that the Bank loan be made to the Govermment which will pass on the loan
to the municipalities, the newly-formed APAPO and the operating companies. A schematic
diagram of the proposed legal structure governing the proposed loan is provided in Figure 4.1.
The execution of an Administration Agreement between the Borrower, the municipality of
Ashghabat and APAPO, containing all substantive provisions of the Action Plan and project
implementation arrangements is a condition of loan effectiveness.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.27 The municipal governments of Ashghabat Mary and Chardjou, the Ministry of
Autotransport, and APAPO will have overall responsibility for implementing the project. Figure
4.2 presents a diagram of the project's implementation arrangements, which are described in the
following paragraphs.
4.28 Role of COM. Within the COM, the Deputy Chairman for International Financial
Relations has the statutory responsibility for monitoring all international loans and obligations,
ensuring their effective use. The Deputy Chairman for International Financial Relations would
be responsible for final approval of purchases made under the proposed Urban Transport Project.
An administrative unit for international financial relations, the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), reports to the Deputy Chairman, International Financial Relations. The PIU has the
administrative responsibility for monitoring implementation of loan-financed (multilateral and
bilateral) projects, including institutional-building technical assistance (IBTA) loans.
4.29 Role of Municipal Government of Ashghabat. The ownership of all public transport
vehicles in the city is vested with the municipality of Ashghabat. The city has the overall
responsibility to: .(a) provide general policy guidance on local objectives; (b) approve APAPO
service plan; and (c) appoint transport operating enterprises management. In addition, the city
would define, in a timely manner, the financial parameters under which APAPO is to operate and
make payments to APAPO to cover the costs of operations as agreed in the city's budget and
plan. The municipality will be supported by an inter-agency committee, with the Mayor of City
as the Chairman, and with representatives from the Ministries of Autotransport and Economy and
Finance.
4.30 Role of APAPO. As part of the agreements reached during project preparation,
Ashghabat Passenger Autotransport Production Organization (APAPO) is established to develop
and manage an efficient and cost effective public transport system. APAPO has the following
major functions: (a) planning the public transport service network in the city; (b) procuring the
planned services in the most cost efficient manner; (c) monitoring and enforcing the quality of
service provided by each of the operating enterprises; and (d) developing the efficiency of service
providers APAPO would be headed by a General Director who will be supported by: (a) Project



34                                                                 Chapter IV
Management Group (PMG) headed by a director and two deputy directors (in the functional
areas of administration and operations/procurement); and (b) Operations Support Group (OSG)
constituted by: two deputy general-directors in the functional areas of maintenance and
finance/economic; other specialists in the areas of legal, personnel and sociology/computers.
Figure 4.3 presents a chart of the proposed APAPO organizational arrangements. The PMG is
the administrative wing of APAPO, with its principal focus on the procurement of goods and
services and the development and maintenance of project accounts, including the Special
Account. The OSG is the techincal group with the principal responsibility to develop, monitor,
and enforce effective management approaches to improve delivery of transport in Ashghabat in
an economically-financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner. APAPO is an
independent legal entity, with control vested with the Municipality of Ashghabat. Key staff of
APAPO and its subordinate units have been appointed. All appointments of key staff will
require prior review by the Bank.
4.31 Bid Evaluation Committee. The PMG will be supported by a bid evaluation committee,
a technical group established to evaluate bidding documents for procurement of new vehicles and
spare parts under the project. The principal objective of the Committee will be to evaluate
proposals and bids for the components financed under the loan. The Committee will consist of
APAPO General Director, PMG Director, technical representatives of MoAT, representatives of
the three operating enterprises, and an expatriate consultant. The recommendations of the
Committee will be sent for approval to the municipality. The service contract between each
municipality and APAPO will include a provision defining the bid evaluation clearance process,
as well as the responsibilities of all members of the Committee. The execution of the
procurement contracts will be concluded by the Deputy Chairman for International Financial
Relations, COM. During negotiations, the establishment of a Bid Evaluation Committee, with
description of participating members and their specific functions, was agreed upon with the
Government.
4.32  Transport Operating Enterprises.  The three transport operating enterprises (bus,
trolleybus, and minibus) and capital repair facility in Ashghabat, and transport enterprises in
Mary and Chardjou are autonomous units, legally and financially independent, under a
performance contract with APAPO, to achieve a set of pre-specified objectives. The principal
objective of the enterprises would be to: (a) provide the transport services as agreed at agreed
level of service; (b) maintain safe vehicles and operations; and (c) develop their professional
competence and management information systems. Each enterprise would have a manager,
responsible for daily operations of their respective fleet. Evidence was provided by the
Government, during negotiations, to the satisfaction of the Bank, that each transport
enterprise is an independent legal entity with it's own management andfinancial accounting
systems.
4.33  Agreements were reached during negotiations on the execution of the following contracts
as a condition of loan effectiveness (a) service contract between the municipality of Ashghabat
and APAPO; and (b) performance contract between APAPO and each of the transport enterprises
in the municipality of Ashghabat.

4.36 The rehabilitation component provides for the rehabilitation of 60 Ikarus diesel buses, 21
Laz buses, 34 trolleybuses and 33 minibuses plus modification program of 101 minibuses.
Procurement for spare parts for the rehabilitation of vehicles and replenishment of spare parts
inventories will be through ICB (for an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million) through slice and
packaging, international shopping (up to US$400,000 per contract with an aggregate value of
US$2.6 million ), national shopping (up to US$50,000 per contract with an aggregate amount of
US$0.3 million), and direct contracting (aggregate amount of US$0.7 million) because of their
availability from only one source.
4.37 Workshop, computer and other tools and equipment will be procured under ICB (for an
aggregate amount of US$1.8 million) through slice and packaging, international shopping
(US$0.9 million) and national shopping (US$0.1 million). In addition, the proposed OIP-related
investment components (automatic vehicle location and monitoring and fare collection system)
will be procured following ICB procedures (US$2.2 million).
4.38  Procurement for the component for the participation of other cities is estimated to include
US$4.5 million for ICB procurement of buses. Spare parts for vehicle rehabilitation and
replenishment of inventories will be procured by international shopping (US$0.9 million),
national shopping (US$0.1 million) and direct contracting (US$ 0.1 million).
4.39 Works. Rehabilitation works will be carried out in-house given the absence of local
private workshops for rehabilitation of vehicles and the difficulty and expense of moving
vehicles to rehabilitation plants in other countries. Some minor works for the workshop and
APAPO's offices will be also carried out locally.
4.40 Technical Assistance and Training. Specialists to be engaged to provide technical and
operational support to APAPO for the implementation of the project are proposed to be recruited
as a team from one firm. The firm would be selected from a short list of firms in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (1981). A short-list of firms has been
agreed upon with the Government and consists of consulting firms with demonstrated and
extensive prior experience in providing: (i) procurement services in the procurement of vehicles,
spare parts and other goods and services defined under the project; (ii) advising on technical,
managerial and national urban transport policy issues; (iii) management of vehicle rehabilitation
projects; and (iv) the conduct of technical and economic studies in the urban transport sector.
Contracts for training and other technical services will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (including possibility of sole sourcing).
4.41  Contract Review. The likely contracts under the project and their expected timing are
presented in Annex 4.4. All packages for procurement under ICB would be subject to the Bank's
prior review of procurement documentation. Apart from the first contract award, all contracts
procured under International Shopping procedure would be subjected to post review.
Furthermore, and-irrespective of the contract value, the following would be subject to prior Bank
review and approval: (a) all terms of reference for all consultants' contracts; (b) all procurement
documentation for contracts for assignments judged to be of a critical nature by the Bank; (c) all
amendments of contracts; and (d) all DC contracting.

DISBURSEMENT
4.42 The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed on the following basis: (a) goods: 100% of
foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory costs), 85% of local expenditures
for other items procured locally; and (b) consultants' services, technical assistance and
training: 100% of expenditures. All disbursement claims would be fully documented, except
for contracts for consultant and technical services, costing less than (a) US$100,000 with regard
to contracts with consulting firms; and (b) US$50,000 with regard to contracts with individuals,
which would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs), and except for contracts
for goods costing less than US$400,000, with the exception of: (a) goods under contracts
awarded on the basis of ICB; (b) the first contract for goods awarded on the basis of international
shopping procedures; and (c) all contracts for goods awarded under DC. The documentation for
these expenditures would be retained by the PMG of APAPO for at least one year after receipt by
the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This
documentation would be made available for review by the auditors and the Bank upon their
request. Figure 4.4 outlines the loan withdrawal cycle proposed under the project.
4.43  The project has been designed for implementation in five years which is the World
Bank's standard disbursement profile for the ECA Region for full disbursement of the loan. The
estimated disbursement schedule and chart are given in Annex 4.5. The table below presents the
categories and arnounts to be financed out of the IBRD loan and the percentage to be financed
under each category.

4.44 The Special Account (SA) would be established, in US dollars, by the Borrower in the
Turkmenistan State Bank for Economic Affairs (Mesheconom Bank) in Ashghabat on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocation of the Special Account would be
US$500,000, representing the estimated average expenditures to be paid from the SA over a
four-month period. The initial amount deposited would be US$200,000, but this amount would
be further increased to the maximum authorized allocation once the level of disbursement has
reached US$3.0 million. The Mesheconom Bank is capable of meeting the requirements of the
Bank with respect to operating and maintaining the SA. The Mesheconom Bank: (a) is
financially sound as demonstrated by its latest accounts, as audited by an internationally
recognized auditing firm; (b) has a significant foreign correspondence network covering all



38                                                                Chapter IV
major currencies; (c) has reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of credit, for
making direct foreign payments and other international transactions with appropriate
arrangements for the training and development of its staff; (d) is capable of performing a wide-
range of local banking services, including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks,
issuance of debit notes, application of conversion rates from foreign currencies, and maintenance
of adequate accounts for the SA; (e) is a member of Swift and uses or plans to use this facility to
expedite payment transfers; (f) is willing to issue a Comfort Letter to assure the amounts
deposited in the SA would not be set off or otherwise seized or attached to satisfy amounts due to
the Bank by the Borrower; (g) is willing to maintain adequate accounts as required by the Bank
and to provide to the Bank monthly bank statements and any other information considered
necessary by the Bank (copies of all transactions would be routinely submitted to the
implementing agencies); and (h) is willing to charge reasonable rates for its services and pay
reasonable interest on balances held from time to time.
REPORTING AND MONITORING
4.45  Accounts and Audits. The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all
other project-related accounts will be maintained in accordance with international accounting
standards (IAS). Audits will also be carried out for corresponding periods, in accordance with
Bank guidelines, for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made
out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference will be made in the audit reports accompanying
the financial statements. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
accounting disclosure and auditing requirements: (a) for the period up to June 30, 1998,
APAPO and transport companies will submit to the Bank, on a quarterly basis, no later than
four weeks after the end of the relevant quarter, its income statements and balance sheets
based on Turkmenistan accounting standards extant and APAPO's accounting policies; (b)
for subsequent periods, APAPO and transport companies will submit (i)) annual accounts,
based on MAS, and audited by an accounting firm, satisfactory to the Bank and under terms of
engagement satisfactory to the Bank, within six months of the end of the relevant fiscal year;
(ii) quarterly project accounts to be submitted within four weeks of the end of the relevant
quarter starting from October 1, 1997 and audited annual project accounts, including the
auditor's opinion on the use of the Special Account and statement of expenses as described
above, the adequacy of international controls in the management of loan funds and
compliance with project covenants; the audited project accounts to be submitted within six
months of the end of relevantfiscalyear, starting with fiscalyear 1997.
4.46  Semi-annual progress reports covering all project components will be prepared by the
project cities and APAPO and sent to the Bank within six weeks after the end of each six-month
period. These reports will include: (a) progress achieved against agreed implementation and
disbursement schedules, including number of contracts for goods and vehicle rehabilitation
works awarded, number of buses and quantity of spare parts delivered, number of urban transport
vehicles rehabilitated, and project monitorable targets and performance indicators; and (b) work
programs and cost estimates for the coming six months and for the total project. The main
purpose of the reports will be to provide timely and updated information on implementation of
project components, highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending actions and



Chapter IV                                                                 39
commenting on progress in resolving previous recommendations. The project will be monitored
according to project monitoring indicators (Annex 4.6). Agreement has been reached with the
Government on the Performance Monitoring Indicators. Upon completion of the project,
APAPO will also prepare an evaluation report on the project's execution.
4.47 There will be three supervision missions in FY98, two in FY99, two in FY2000, and two
in FY2001. Each mission will be for about two weeks. Most missions would be staffed by an
urban transport specialist and an economist/financial analyst, and other specialists such as an
institutional analyst, procurement expert, vehicle maintenance specialist, training expert or
transport industry specialist, as required. Missions would review the physical components of the
project and implementation of reform programs including all the institutional and policy-
development measures proposed under the project and agree on remedial measures. The mission
reviews would be done in the context of agreed targets. Details of the supervision plan are given
in Annex 4.7.
4.48  A mid-term project review involving the World Bank and relevant Borrower agencies
will take place in September 1998. The objective of the review will be to assess: (a) overall
progress of project implementation including buses and trolleybuses procurement and
distribution of spare parts, technical assistance and training; and (b) the extent to which APAPO
and other participating cities have met the conditions of the project components. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the scope and timing of the
mid-term review. The report will be reviewed with the Bank by December 31, 1998.
4.49 The project completion date is June 30, 2001 and the loan closing date would be
December 31, 2001 to allow sufficient time for any remaining disbursements to be made.
4.50 Project Launch Workshop. Detailed discussions on project implementation were held
with the APAPO General Director during negotiations. Follow-up discussions focusing mainly
on completion of the implementation of the reform program and the selection of other
participating cities will take place during the Project Launch Workshop, to be held within two
months of loan approval. Important constraints to effective implementation of the project and
reform programs will be reviewed and discussed, and responsibilities for implementation will be
confirmed.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
4.51  The Bank determined that the project requires a "Category B" rating, as defined in the
Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01), since it is not expected
to have any significant negative environmental impact.
4.52 Automotive Urban Air Pollution. The new diesel-powered buses to be financed under
the project will have engines that will be certified in conformance with the following emissions
standards for heavy-duty engines: UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), EURO-I,
and will be less polluting than the gasoline-powered buses in operation today. Moreover, the
Government of Turkmenistan is now drafting a law which will take into account some of the
UNECE Regulations concerning engines. The city of Ashghabat is also looking for donor



40                                                                 Chapter IV
assistance to develop a special program to protect the environment of the city. The President has
also issued a decree to convert part of the road transport fleet to CNG fuel, resulting in less
atmospheric pollution. In addition, implementation of OIP involving, among other things,
improved maintenance practices and annual inspection programs would reduce energy
consumption by about 15 to 20 percent.  This would reduce the gaseous emissions
proportionately.
4.53  Replacement of the bus fleet and changes in its composition would not have a major
effect on the overall average level of atmospheric pollution in Turkmenistan. Buses do not
account for very much of transport emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrous dioxide (NO2),
the bulk of these pollutants being generated by trucks. A more important effect of the project
would result from reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and
lower peak concentrations of these pollutants in traffic congested urban areas. Characteristics of
diesel fuel will be accounted for in technical specifications for diesel engines for the buses to be
procured under the project. Suppliers will be requested to furnish recommendations for proper
maintenance of the engines when operating on diesel fuels available in Turkmenistan so that
engine performance and durability are not reduced.
4.54  Fuel economy data from transport companies will be used as an easily monitorable
environmental performance indicator throughout the project implementation period, as a proxy
for assessing reductions in total emissions of specific substances (provided the vehicle model-
specific exhaust characteristics and fuel composition are known variables). Bank-financed buses
are expected to be considerably more fuel efficient than the present fleet of buses in
Turkmenistan.
4.55  Noise Reduction and Waste Disposal. Urban transport is known to be the major source
of audible noise in all cities, independent of their size. Motor vehicles account for much of the
zones of acoustic discomfort in cities. New transit vehicles would also be less noisy. In
addition, the rehabilitation and spare parts for repairs to be financed under the project will help
improve vehicle maintenance, which will lead to reduced levels of noise of operating vehicles
(including, in particular, trolleybuses). Another sizable by-product of urban transport operations
is the accumulation of recyclable (ferrous and non-ferrous metals) and non-recyclable wastes
(rubber, petroleum products, oil paint, etc.). To support and/or enhance remedial activities
towards this end, assistance would be provided to the project transit companies to suggest
methods of limiting harmful effects of the disposal of non-recyclable engine fluids and old tires
(as a routine garage maintenance component of the vehicle rehabilitation technical assistance
program).



5. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
HISTORICAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF BUS ENTERPRISES
5.1   Recent financial performance for bus and trolleybus operations has been discussed
in Chapter 2.
FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING STRATEGY AND PROJECTIONS
5.2   During appraisal, agreement was reached with the Government, the City of
Ashghabat, APAPO and the transport enterprises on a financial restructuring strategy to
stem and reverse the deterioration of the transport enterprises' financial performance.
The objective of the strategy is to improve urban transport financing by instituting
measures to:  (i) improve the system  for covering operating costs (excluding
depreciation), including an adequate provision for maintenance of operating and
infrastructure assets; (ii) change the funding of exemptions; and (iii) improve the
budgeting system for allocating subsidies for urban transport.
5.3   To implement the financial restructuring strategy, the Government has prepared
an Action Plan, as part of its Urban Transport Policy Statement (paras 1.21-22), which
will involve specific actions in the following key areas:
(a)   Subsidy Regime.   The proportion of operating costs (excluding
depreciation) covered by subsidies will be carefully reviewed. First, a
review of the system used to grant fare exemptions will be completed,
with a view to identifying opportunities to reduce the budgetary burden on
the Government by providing transport subsidies only to the most needy.
Second, a program will be developed for easy identification of the
exempted passengers, including the issuance of identification cards with
photographs to those exempted passengers. Third, a system will be
developed to eliminate the number of people travelling without paying
fare. Fourth, a system will be developed for Ashghabat under which the
respective line agencies would pay to the operating companies for persons
exempted from paying fares. Fifth, the Government will provide for
annual budget allocations, in advance, for the required city transport
subsidy from the central state budget to APAPO which will in turn pay the
subsidies to the operating companies on a quarterly basis.
(b)   Tariff Increases. With the implementation of the above measures, the
fare collection system for Ashghabat will be relatively efficient. To
generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs (excluding
depreciation), the Government has gradually increased public transport



42                                                                    Chapter V
fares (para 2.15).  To protect the transport enterprises' cash flow from
erosion by cost increases in inputs and payroll caused by inflation or such
events outside the enterprises' control, the Government has agreed to
review tariff increases periodically, based on reviews and recommen-
dations made by APAPO.
(c)   Unit Transport Cost Reduction. The cost incurred by the transport
enterprises per unit of service performed is considerably greater than could
be achieved with more efficient operations. Through an integrated and
balanced program of maintenance, rehabilitation and acquisition of buses,
the enterprises' efficiency would be improved. During preparation of the
Action Plan, the Government and the transport enterprises indicated their
commitment towards implementing measures to provide adequate
financing for the repair and maintenance of vehicles and capital
investments to replace and expand the requirements of the enterprises. The
effective implementation of these measures constitutes a major means of
improving the contribution margins earned per unit of service provided by
the transport enterprises, i.e., of improving the enterprises' profitability.
5.4   The financial goals will not be effective if: (i) they coexist with contradictory
policies on subsidies; (ii) a budget allocation system does not provide for the financing of
subsidies on a timely and predictable basis; (iii) tariff increases are not allowed to be
adjusted to cover cost increases; and (iv) the transport enterprises, under reasonably cash-
generative operations, does not invest profits in productive assets and operations. To
ensure that the financial objectives are realized, during negotiations, agreement was
reached on the subsidy regime, financing mechanisms of countervailing susidies and
operational efficiency and cost recovery targets. During Project Implementation, the
Borrower shall: (a) make adequate yearly budget allocations from the central state
budget for the required subsidy to APAPO; and (b) quarterly payments of said subsidy
to APAPO.
5.5   Agreement was reached with the Government on the development of a system,
by June 30, 1997, under which fares for exempted passengers are paid by the respective
line agencies/municipality directly to the operating enterprises.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.6   The transport enterprises' recent financial performance has been discussed in
Chapter 2.
5.7   Revenues. Each transport companies' revenues were based on existing supply
and demand figures as described previously (Chapter 2). The financial model assumes a
vehicle profile presented in Annex 5.1. The model also assumes that in future: (a) travel
demand would increase at eight percent per annum in the medium term (in keeping with



Chapter V                                                                43
population growth of Ashghabat) and, thereafter, it would stabilize; (b) average trip
length would remain the same as in the base year; and (c) vehicle availability would
improve with the implementation of OIP and better maintenance. The operating
enterprises would get compensated for the fare-exempted-travelling public by an explicit
payment of subsidies and elimination of people evading fare. This would be achieved
through: (a) introduction of strict measures to eliminate fare evaders through
implementation of OIP; and (b) review of the subsidy regime to target specific groups and
assigning responsibility for explicit payment of subsidies from the municipality and line
agencies to transport enterprises.  Other critical assumptions used in the financial
projections are detailed in Annex 5.2.
5.8   Expenses. Future costs for each of the three transport companies were based on
existing costs adjusted for projected average vehicle operating costs for newer, more
reliable, vehicles purchased under the project. Fuel costs per vehicle should decrease as
new and rehabilitated vehicles will be more fuel-efficient. Tire and maintenance costs are
assumed to increase from the present levels in order to maintain a reasonable tire
replacement and vehicle maintenance program for the vehicles.
5.9   Summary of Results. The impact of the financial restructuring actions on the
transport enterprises' prospective financial performance has been evaluated and is
summarized in Table 5.2 below and detailed in Annex 5.3. The financial projections for
the project are based on the vehicle-operations profile, operating costs and tariff
assumptions described above and in Annex 5.2. These assumptions were also used in the
economic evaluation.
5.10  Table 5.2 illustrates that with an increase in fare structure cost recovery for diesel
bus is expected to increase to 42 percent in 1997 and to 61 percent for trolleybuses. The
Government is committed to improving cost recovery targets of minibus operations.
5.11  Scenario analysis.  The objective of the proposed project is to achieve self-
sustaining and commercially-viable transport services. This objective depends on the
operating efficiency objectives of the project being met and the consequential savings in
operating costs being realized. The financial evaluation focused on two scenarios: (i)
assuming the fare per trip remains the same in real terms (base case); and (ii) increased
fare per trip in real terrns to recover operating expenses (excluding depreciation).
5.12  Under the first scenario, total income would not be sufficent to cover operating
expenses for bus, trolleybus and minibus operations (as of January 1997 minibus fares
were reduced from 200 to 50 manats). However, cost recovery would gradually improve
in future with an increase in vehicle availability and the number of fare-paying
passengers. For diesel buses, cost recovery would improve from 42% in 1997 to 45% in
2005 and for trolleybuses, from 61% to 82%, and for minibuses, from 24% to 28% in the
corresponding years, without any change in the fare structure.

5.13   Under the second scenario, starting in 1997, fare for diesel buses would have to
increase about 24 times (in real terms) from 50 to 118 manats per trip to recover 100% of
the operating expenses. For trolleybuses, fares would have to increase less than two-fold
to about 90 manats in order to recover operating expenses For minibuses, fares would
have to increase more than four times to a little over 200 manats. The justification for
increasing real fares in future would be far greater with the project since service levels



Chapter V                                                                45
will be improved with a greater availability of buses. The possibility of a mode shift
from public transport to other private modes, with an increase in fares, resulting in a
decline in revenues for buses, is considered unlikely as very few alternatives exist and the
dependence on public transport systems is expected to continue (available data are
insufficient to compute price elasticities of demand).
5.14 Under the circumstances, the Government is faced with a choice of either: (a)
increasing the fare in real terms sufficient to recover total expenses on vehicle operations;
or (b) provide budget allocations for the required subsidy to cover the difference between
a financially viable fare and the actual fare and to ensure a timely replacement of the
vehicle fleet. The efforts by the Government to raise vehicle fares over the past year have
been in response to the Social Assessment (SA) which indicated consumer acceptance of
linking fare increases to better cost recovery and improved services. The willingness to
pay on the part of the people for improved services was clearly demonstrated in the SA.
5.15  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government for revenues
from transit services to cover 100 percent of operating costs, excluding depreciation, by
the end of 1999.
5.16  Urban Passenger Transport Investments. To protect against the risk of inefficient
investments, agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations on: (a) the
carrying out by the Municipality of Ashghabat, under terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank, of studies on urban passenger transport investments, and the completion and
furnishing to the Bank of studies containing the findings and recommendations before
commencement of such investments; and (b) exchange views with the Bank on the
recommendations with a view to determining an appropriate order of priority for transport
investments.






6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.1   Project Objective and Description. The objective of the project is to improve
the bus transport (diesel bus, trolleybus, and minibus) service in Ashghabat in terms of:
(a)   quality of service, by reducing waiting time and crowding while increasing
service reliability;
(b)   quantity of service, by satisfying the increasing demand reflecting eight
percent annual population growth in Ashghabat in the medium term, plus
the pent-up demand in currently under- and unserved areas in Ashghabat;
and
(c)   efficiency, by reducing transport unit costs through an integrated and
balanced program of maintenance, rehabilitation and acquisition of buses
supported by a broad program to eliminate specific shortcomings and
weaknesses identified in different operational areas.
6.2  It is against this background that the proposed project includes the following three
components for which an economic analysis has been undertaken:
(a)   Component 1. Technical Assistance  to strengthen institutional and
financial capacity of public transport operators and to implement an
Operations Improvement Plan (OIP). The OIP includes preparation of
optimal routing plans, driving training and control, vehicle maintenance
practices, services standards, service monitoring, and bus and trolleybus
terminal management;
(b)   Component 2. Maintenance and Rehabilitation. This component includes
upgrading maintenance facilities and equipment, rehabilitation and
refurbishment of diesel bus, trolleybus, and minibus facilities, including
procurement of parts needed for major repairs and rehabilitation, spare
parts and tires to replenish inventories, and tools and equipment for
garages. The purpose of these investments would be to provide the
necessary spare parts to put back into operation the vehicle fleet currently
out of service and augment the capacity of garages to provide periodic
maintenance; and
(c)   Component 3. Purchase of New Buses. Purchase of new diesel and
trolleybuses to improve service delivery, extend transport services to
currently unserved outlying areas, and set in place new procurement
procedures as established by Bank guidelines to ensure efficient delivery
of vehicles in future.



48                                                                 Chapter VI
6.3   Methodology. The economic benefits resulting from investments in each of the
three modes (diesel bus, trolleybus, and minibus) are determined by comparing the "with"
case with the "without" case. The benefits have been calculated for: (a) investments in all
three components for each of the modes; and (b) investments in OIP and maintenance and
rehabilitation program (excluding the capital cost of new purchases). The "without"
project case reflects the strategy that in the future unserviceable buses will be promptly
replaced by Government on an annual basis, a strategy that the Government has been
following in the past few years. A major difference in the "without" case would be that
Government would continue to make sub-optimal purchases of new vehicles based on its
ability to barter vehicles for natural gas or petroleum products. As a result, servicability
of vehicles would continue to be low. In addition, in the "without" case, vehicle
availability would be low because of poor operational practices, fragmented institutional
responsibilities, weak fiscal base, and inadequate maintenance. In the "with" case,
because of institutional reforms, implementation of OIP, rehabilitation of vehicles, and
emphasis on cost recovery, it would be possible to improve the servicability ratio and
operating environment, resulting in availability of a larger vehicle fleet on any day, which
would result in improved speed, lower waiting time, and better access for all residents of
the city. The proposed project would rehabilitate a large number of existing buses,
improving their operating life from the existing five to six years to about twelve years.
The benefits would translate into time savings for the commuting public. The cost to
make this possible would include: technical assistance; investments in spare parts,
workshop, tools and equipment; incremental operating costs; and investments in the
purchase of additional vehicles.
6.4  In view of the highly uncertain and volatile nature of pricing in Turkmenistan, the
calculation of point economic rates of return is not very meaningful. Of greater validity,
therefore, is the calculation of switching values, or the value at which NPV becomes zero
(or the IRR equals the discount rate). Each of the variable inputs is varied over a range
to establish the threshold beyond which the variable becomes a critical variable.
PROJECT COSTS, BENEFITS AND RETURNS
6.5   Project Costs. The project costs include: (a) technical assistance. The technical
assistance component, at an estimated base cost of US$1.3 million (including US$0.3
million for the establishment of Project Management Group), will help implement OIP,
assist PMG with the implementation of the project and the procurement of goods and
services, assist APAPO with the introduction of improved systems and practices for
management of all aspects of urban transport operations in the participating cities, and
assist municipal government and Ministry of Road Transport to further reforms in the
urban transport sector.  The economic analysis for each of the three modes is based on
the assumption that about 70 percent of the TA is for diesel buses and 15 percent each for
trolleybuses and minibuses. (b) Maintenance and Rehabilitation. The base cost of this
component includes: US$1.9 million for equipment, tools and parts to rehabilitate 81
buses, US$1.1 million to rehabilitate 34 trolleybuses, and US$0.6 million to rehabilitate
33 minibuses; US$1.6 million for spare parts, workshop, computers and other tools and



Chapter VI                                                                   49
equipment for diesel buses, US$0.6 million for trolley buses, and US$0.4 million for
minibuses. In addition US$2.0 million is estimated for implementing OIP which would
include improving the vehicle monitoring and fare collection system. (c) incremental
operating cost. The cost of operating additional vehicle fleet with the project is estimated
at US$1.0 million. (d) purchase of new buses. The project includes the purchase of 52
twelve meter diesel buses and 10 CNG/diesel (US$7.6 million) and 40 twelve meter
trolleybuses (US$6.4 million).
6.6   Benefits and Returns. The benefits of the proposed investments are computed in
terms of savings in trip time resulting from higher speed, lower waiting times, improved
headways, and easier access to public transport because of the availability of a greater
number of vehicles operating at higher efficiency as compared to the without project
case . Table 6.1 below shows the economic rate of return and net present value for each
of the three modes (both with and without investments for the purchase of the new fleet).
The rate of return for the project (including purchase of the new vehicle fleet) is
considerable, although, as expected, the returns increase significantly when the capital
cost of new vehicles is excluded. However, eventually new equipment will have to be
purchased. The most significant benefit of new vehicles is the inducement it has given
the Government to undertake key reforms in urban transport, the benefit of which will
extend far longer than the life of the project.

Note: Figures in parentheses show the net present values (NPV), in US$ million.
6.7   Switching Value Analysis. The switching value for each of the significant
variables is the value at which the project's NPV becomes zero (or the IRR equals the
discount rate). Switching values are computed as the percentage change in the value of
the variable needed to turn the Project's NPV equal to zero and help identify the variables
which most affect project outcomes. The switching values of the relatively more
important variables are presented in order of declining sensitivity in Table 6.2 below.
Value of time is computed by considering yearly person income of US$700 and assuming that time
savings resulting from improved operations "with" the project are perceived at 35 percent of income.

Table 6.2: Presentation of Switching Values
Variable                           Switching Value
Non-availability of spare parts and
inadequate maintenance beyond project life    -15%
Delay in implementation of OIP                -25%
Cost of new vehicle fleet                     30%
Per capita income                             -35%
Growth in passenger demand                    -70%
The most critical variable in this project is that institutional and cost recovery reforms
will not be implemented as promised. If these reforms are not implemented, availability
rates of new buses would again start declining beyond two years because of the lack of
spare parts and fleet replacement, and spare parts would once again decline because of the
aging fleet--a decrease of more than 15 percent in the availability of resources for spare
parts and maintenance beyond the initial two years will make the NPV negative, if other
things remain as expected. The next critical variable is the timely implementation of
OIP. A delay in implementation of OIP sufficient to reduce vehicle availability by more
than 25 percent will make the NPV negative. The analysis also indicates that the
assumed annual eight percent growth in passenger demand is not critical to the success of
the project--even if annual demand grows by about two-and-a-half percent, the
investments will yield a positive return. The per capita income would have to decrease
by more than 35 percent for the savings in time to be exceeded by the proposed size of
investments.
6.8   Other Benefits. The project will result in a number of other benefits, difficult to
quantify. First, improvement in institutional arrangements will enhance efficiency of
public transport enterprises in providing transport services. Second, the project, through
improved cost recovery, will reduce subsidies to public transport enterprise, which at
present pose a severe burden on city finances. Third, the project puts in place rational
procurement policies and procedures for acquisition of new buses and spare parts.
Fourth, the project supports the creation of an enabling environment for active
participation by the private sector. Fifth, improved public transport services would
enhance access to job opportunities for all residents, but especially for low-income
residents in the outlying districts, and therefore would result in improving living
conditions for the population. Sixth, improved operational practices, better scheduling
and routing would encourage a more balanced modal shift.



Chapter VI                                                               51
PROJECT RISKS
6.9   A major risk of the project is that the proposed reforms, especially the
institutional cost recovery reforms, will not be implemented as promised. If these
reforms are not implemented, the new buses and spare parts financed under the loan
would only give temporary relief. Availability rates of vehicles would once again decline
because of the lack of spare parts and fleet replacement, and vehicle maintenance costs
would increase because of the aging fleet. To mitigate this risk, the project includes
conditions regarding key institutional reforms and financial performance.  These
conditions include:
(a)   establishment of APAPO  as a legally and financially independent
organization (para 4.17),
(b)   signing of a contract between the municipality of Ashghabat and APAPO
to perform transport services (para 4.27);
(c)   implementation of short term measures included in the OIP (para 4.19);
(d)   agreement to explicitly  provide budget allocations for the required
subsidy one year in advance (para 5.4); and
(e)   increasing cost recovery to 40% by effectiveness (para 2.23).
6.10  Once the companies receive the new buses and trolleybuses they should be able to
increase cost recovery even more with the substantially improved level of service.
6.11  A second risk is that once the project is completed the urban transport companies
will still not have sufficient funds for the purchase of spare parts and replacement of the
fleet, even with improved cost recovery achieved under the project. Project companies
will have to compete with other priority sectors to secure adequate subsidies from local
government which could come under increasing financial pressure over the next few
years. Given the uncertainty over future levels of funding, the project will:
(a)   set a target of 100 percent cost recovery (excluding depreciation) by
December 31, 1999;
(b)   require the introduction of contracts between the municipal government
and project companies guaranteeing payment of subsidies based on
performance standards; and
(c)   introduce privatization of urban transport services to reduce public funding
requirements.
6.12  A third risk is that there will be delays in project execution. To reduce this risk,
the bidding documents for purchase of new vehicles have substantially been agreed with
the Government.



52                                                                Chapter VI
6.13  A fourth risk is that the assumed 8 percent growth in total travel demand per
annum may not materialize. The switching values analysis has already demonstrated that
the growth in travel demand is not a critical variable. However, the travel demand of 8
percent (based on an equivalent city population growth rate) is considered to be on the
conservative side as it does not include the 'latent" and "diverted" demand. With an
improvement in public transport services, people in the outlying zones, who currently
walk to their destination, would potentially become public transport users; a number of
people who currently have no choice but to depend on private transport would
additionally use public transport, if services are improved. Improvements in affordable
public transport services would also improve access to job opportunities, expanding the
labor force, and the resulting demand for public transport.

ANNEX 1.1
URBAN TRANSPORT POLICY STATEMENT AND ACTION PLAN
1.    The following urban policy statement and Action Plan has been approved by the
Government and agreed with the Bank.
2.    Urban residents account for 44 percent of the country's total population, and their
numbers are growing rapidly. In specific terms, since Turkmenistan gained independence
in 1991, the population of Ashghabat has been growing at a rate of 8 percent per year, and
now accounts for 12 percent of the total population. It is expected that the current rates of
population growth will continue in the near future, and may even rise.
3.    The production and social activity of the population of the city of Ashghabat and
the country's other major urban centers depends to a significant extent on public
transport. In light of the rapid population growth, changes in the population's economic
activities, and widespread reliance on public transport, a well-organized and efficient
transportation system is a key element in ensuring that:
*  limitations curtailing the mobility of the population and work force do not hinder
the development of production and commercial activity;
*  the development of new markets and social activity among the population is not
retarded by inadequate transportation services;
* the growing population is properly integrated into a city's economic and social
activity.
4.    The public transit system in cities, however, has not been able to meet the
growing demand for transportation services. Since 1991 there has been a significant
decline in the ability of transportation organizations to serve the population in an
effective manner. The level of service provided by motor transport organizations is
uneven, some parts of cities are not served fully, and deficiencies in the transportation
system have started to have a negative effect on production and commercial activity in
urban areas. While unofficial and alternative forms of transportation services have
appeared to supplement services provided by public transportation enterprises, this has
still not been enough to prevent a sharp decline in the quality and volume of services.
5.    The Government is currently faced with the following tasks:
* stopping the deterioration in transportation services provided to the public;
* improving the situation with regard to covering the costs of bus and trolleybus
service;



58                                                                   Annex 1.1
providing additional incentives for the private sector to get involved in offering
services to the public.
6.    In order to meet these goals, the Government is planning to carry out an extensive
program of reforms aimed at eliminating the causes of inadequate service in the passenger
transport sector. The program, the details of which are spelled out in an attachment to
this document, includes fundamental reforms to improve the practical organization of
services and the extent to which the costs of public transport organizations are covered, as
well as reforms to encourage the private sector's participation in urban transit.
7.    Program of institutional reforms. At present, responsibility for regulating and
providing services in the urban transit sector is shared by several organizations, which
results in poor service and redundancy. Transportation organizations have only general
instructions to provide services, the goals of which are not clearly defined. Even if these
goals were specified, transportation organizations would not be able to achieve them
because of the low fares that are in effect and unreliable state financing for subsidies.
The experience of other countries shows that urban transit services can be more efficient
and better coordinated if all public services provided are under the control of a single
independent authority, which is accountable to the given municipality. To provide a
better framework for organizing the transportation services system, the Government has
already taken measures to consolidate these services under the municipality of Ashghabat
and it is setting up an independent Public Transportation Agency, which is to be
accountable to city authorities. Improvements will be made in the system used to provide
budget subsidies and finance capital investments for the Transportation Agency, with a
view to ensuring more reliable financial support for the Agency, better accountability,
and more efficient use of government funds for transportation agencies. This will mean
moving away from the subsidy system in which subsidies are determined after losses
have been incurred, and toward a system under which subsidies are determined each year
in advance. Subsidies will be based on a transportation company's achievement of goals
that have been agreed upon and on fares charged, as part of an annual contractual
agreement to provide a city with transportation services. The transportation company in
question will take all possible measures to reduce costs and improve the quality of service
by preparing and implementing a plan to improve operations on a short-term and long-
term basis.
8.    The Government will gradually reduce the role of the Ministry of Motor Transport
in the operation and management of urban transit in the country and will expand the
Ministry's role in determining strategy, organizing national investments in transportation,
identifying budget priorities, providing guidance to city authorities in the area of
transportation planning and budgets, and monitoring urban transit services.
9.    Covering costs. The Government has taken significant steps in liberalizing
public transport fares. The bus fares have progressively increased over the past two
years, from .05 manats per trip in January, 1995 to 50 manats in December, 1996 for

diesel and trolleybuses. As a result, cost recovery for diesel and trolleybuses has
improved from about two percent at the beginning of project preparation to more than 25
percent.
10.   The Government is going to take measures to improve the system for covering the
costs of urban transit services, and it is going to act to close any gaps in the fare
collection system, raise fares, and protect subsidies.
11.   Privatization of transportation services. The Government has already taken
measures to privatize minivans and taxis by leasing them to drivers and allowing them to
keep a share of the profits, after a certain monthly payment has been made, including the
cost of maintaining the vehicles. The Government has also opened up a wide range of
opportunities for the private sector to participate in providing transportation services and
it is currently studying issues related to making the necessary changes in the system to
draw more of the private sector into the market. A presidential decree (No. 2702) was
issues on July 1, 1996, to privatize part of the taxi fleet in Ashghabat.

ANNEX 2.1
ASHGHABAT: URBAN TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS
1.    Ashghabat, the nation's capital, is the largest urban center with a population of
500,000 (about 25 percent of the national urban population), followed by Charjev
(180,000), Mary (167,000), Dashkovuz (140,000), Nebitag (109,000), and Turkmenbashi
(64,000). The population of Ashghabat has grown at an average annual rate of eight
percent over the past few years but public investments to maintain and expand transport
infrastructure and services have lagged behind the rapidly growing demand placed on
them. This concentration of population and economic activities in the city places a severe
constraint on the transport infrastructure. Current forecasts indicate that the concentration
of people and activities in Ashghabat and other urban areas would continue in future,
placing further demands on the available infrastructure.
2.    Transport Demand  Characteristics .   Seven    Table 1: Share of Person Trips
characteristics dominate transport demand in Ashghabat.        by Mode, 1995
Eirst, like in all FSU countries, public transport has
traditionally played a dominant role in satisfying mobility    M
needs in Turkmenistan (Table 1). Of the 560,000 average    Public Transpo      60.3%
daily person trips in 1995, almost 60 percent use some    Diesel Bus           36.0%
form  of public transport, while the rest include taxi,    Minibus              7.3%
private vehicles, and enterprise transport.  The table    Trolley Bus           8.0%
excludes walk trips, which are about 20 percent of total    Taxi                9.0%
daily trips. Second, about 50 percent of the trips using    Private Transpo    39.7%
public transport vehicle are work trips, 10 percent are    Private Car         12.8%
school trips and the balance 40 percent are shop and social    Enterprise       6.9%
trips.  Ihkd, on average, trip duration using public    Walk                   20.0%
transport is 41 minutes (including time to walk to bus stop
and waiting for a bus). Average waiting for a bus is about    1. Social Assessment Report, 1996
10 minutes, though it varies considering by the time-of-    2. Soges Final Report, 1995
the-day. People walking to their destination, on average,
walk for 19 rminutes and generally work in vicinity of their  I
residences. Fourth, over the past few years, there is a
gradual decline in the dependence on public transport from about 90 percent in 1990 to
60 percent in 1995. Eii, the degree of auto ownership in Ashghabat is low at about I
for every 4 households, though it is increasing at a fast rate over the past few years.
Sixth, average household incomes are low, about 7500 manat per month (US$35), of
Most of the statistics in this section is based on: (a) the Social Assessment Study, conducted in February
1995, as part of a World Bank mission (see Annex 2.2 for details); and (b) background studies
prepared by Soges Organizzazione E Gestione in 1995 as part of the preparatory work for this project.



74                                                                   Annex 2.1
which almost 80 percent is spent on food. Average expenditure on transport varies
between 7 percent and 12 percent.  Seventh, accessibility to transport services in
Ashghabat is lower for women as compared to men: 28 percent of women walk to work
as compared to 14 percent men; 7 percent of women commute by car as compared to 20
percent men; and 10 percent of women use enterprise transport as compared to 20 percent
men.
3.    Transport Supply Characteristics.  Passenger transport demand in Ashghabat
is served by a multitude of services: buses of varying sizes, trolley buses and taxis--all
operated by city-based enterprises; and private cars. The inventory of public transport
vehicles in 1995 indicates low utilization rate for diesel buses and trolley buses--less than
60 percent of the available vehicle fleet is in operation. It is estimated that over the last
five years, almost 40 percent of the available fleet of diesel buses and trolley buses have
been depreciated and junked. The problem has become more acute in the last two years
because of the difficulties in obtaining spare parts from Russia. The poor condition of
the existing vehicle fleet is brought out by looking at the age profile (Table 2):
Table 2: Age Profile of Buses
(a)   unavailability of spare parts to service and     in Ashghabat
maintain  buses;  and  (b) the  relatively
shortened effective operating life of the    Vehicle Average
vehicle fleet due to accumulated effects of    Type  Age (Yrs)
inadequate maintenance. The number of mini    LAZ-695    2.6
buses in operation is high because most of   Ikams-260    7.2
them have been acquired in the past two years.   Ikarus-280    6.9
The acquisition of 59 RAF minivans in 1993    Iveco-A60U    1.0
and  101  Iveco  minibuses in  1994  has    RAF-Minivan  2.0
considerably strengthened the vehicle fleet and    Taxi  6.1
has brought down the average life of these    Trolley Bus   6.5
vehicles in operation. However, these vehicle
replacements have depended largely on the
ability of the central government to barter vehicles for natural gas or
petroleum products and are not based on any planned policy. This system
of vehicle financing has led to inefficient investments. Minibuses and
mini vans are operated on heavy demand corridors which are better suited
for regular size buses. Operation of smaller vehicles has resulted in
vehicle overcrowding and safety compromises, which is generally a cause
of discontentment in the traveling public. The Social Assessment Study
(1995) has clearly brought out the need to replace mini buses with regular
* size buses along major corridors as one of the issues echoed by most
respondents. In addition, the city is not adequately equipped to provide the
servicing needs of these mini buses and minivans. The result is that as the



Annex 2.1                                                                75
available spare parts get exhausted by the end of this year, maintenance of
the existing fleet is going to become a serious concern.
4.    The decline in the provision of public transport services in the city has been
accompanied by an increase in personalized transport modes. In this regards, Ashghabat
is no different from other cities, where people look for alternative means to satisfy their
mobility requirements in the face of deteriorating public transport services. The number
of enterprise taxis and private cars have increased significantly between 1993 and 1994,
with private cars increasing from 30,997 in 1993 to 34,652 in 1994 (growth rate of 11
percent) and enterprise taxis increasing from 768 to 1,210 (over 50 percent growth rate)
during the one year period.
5.    Public Transport Operations. The major bus operator, The Enterprise of Public
Transport in the City of Ashghabat No. 3004, under functional tutelage of the Ministry of
Transport (MOT), claims about 60 percent of the public transport market. Three types of
buses are operated: Laz-695, with a total carrying capacity of 67, Ikaraus-260, with a
carrying capacity of 110, and articulated Ikarus-280, with a carrying capacity of 180. The
diesel bus enterprise employs about 8 staff per operating vehicle. The trolley buses
(carrying capacity 126), operated by the Ashghabat City Government, account for about
13 percent of the public transport market, and employs about 12 staff per operating
vehicle. The overall planning and route specification, introduction of new routes, for
both diesel buses and trolley buses is done by the City Government. In addition to
regular buses and trolley buses, mini buses and mini vans are operated by the Ashghabat
State Passenger Auto Transit Enterprise. under the MOT. Mini buses have a carrying
capacity of 25, while mini vans are seat-only vehicles with a capacity of 12, and employ
about 4 people per operating vehicle. The reason for a low staff to minivan ratio is that
about 60 percent of the available minivan fleet is subcontracted to private individuals,
who have served for more than five years as drivers (the subcontracting operation was
started only recently in May, 1995). The basic conditions of subcontracting include:
(a) driver appear every two weeks in the office of transit enterprise to get the renewal
documents and make a payment of 9,000 manats (US$40.00) for using the bus; (b) the
bus be operated for no more than 12 hours each day, of which two hours must be during
the morning peak period and two hours in the afternoon peak period along specified
routes; (c) the bus fare during the peak periods is fixed at 5 manat per trip, while the
driver is free to charge any amount during off-peak operation. In return for this
operation, the driver is paid a fixed monthly salary, and is provided with fuel and repair
facilities. The spare parts, oil, batteries, tires have to be paid by the driver. The balance
40 percent of the minivan fleet is operated on a limited version as a "demand-responsive"
service, as it operates at fixed fare, along fixed routes but the passengers have the
flexibility of getting-off at the desired location. Informally, however, Social Assessment
Study (1995) has shown that the drivers often take detours on payment of higher fares to
satisfy individual commuters. Taxis are also operated by the MOT and account for less
than 10 percent of travel market. Other forms of paratransit are not present.

Route Operations
6.    Diesel Bus. The city bus network and service measures for diesel buses show
following characteristics: (a) the bus enterprise operates 29 routes in the city and the area
distribution of bus lines is aimed at offering a service which covers the entire urban area;
(b) the greater part of the lines are planimetrically outlined according to a circular route
(where the departure terminus coincides with the arrival terminus) and are of average
length of 20 km, varying between a minimum of 12 km and a maximum of 32 km; (c)
there is a bus stop every 500 to 600 meters along the route; (d) average frequency of bus
operations is between 3 and 4 buses per hour, or one bus every 15 to 20 minutes; (e)
average bus speed is 15 to 20 km/hour; (f) on average, buses operate daily for about 150
km and carry a total of 300,000 passengers daily; (g) on average, buses operate daily for
about 9 hours.
*  Mini Bus. The mini bus route network and service measures show the
following characteristics: (a) mini buses operate on 20 routes which are
common with regular bus operations; (b) average route length, number of bus
stops, travel time, and speed are same as for regular buses; (c) average trip
length for mini buses is also the same as for regular buses; (d) on average,
buses carry 60,000 persons per day.
*  Trolley Bus. The trolley bus route network and service measures show the
following characteristics: (a) trolley buses operate on 7 routes, somewhat
coincidental with the operation of diesel buses and mini buses; (b) average
travel time and speed for trolley buses are no different than for buses.
.
7.    Constraints in the Operations of Public Transport System. The analysis of route
network of diesel buses, mini buses, and trolley buses indicates that: (a) the three modes
serve the same areas, following the same route pattern, often in competition with each
other. Each of the three modes has distinct advantages, which are not fully realized as
they all follow the same routes, without complementing each other; (b) in addition to the
overlapping of the three modes, there also are many overlaps between lines belonging to
the same system. As a result, while some areas are served very well, other areas
experience significant service irregularity; (c) while the three public transport modes
overlap their routes, part of the city, especially north-east is poorly served by any of the
modes; (d) the low speed (15 to 20 kph) is often caused by poor mechanical condition of
buses and overcrowding, especially during the peak period; (e) the public transport
service is very irregular, both because of frequent breakdowns resulting from poor
maintenance and inefficient route planning; (f) the transfer time between vehicles is long;
(g) inadequate public information system, whereby, bus routes, bus schedules, and
location of stops are not displayed clearly. In addition, bus fares vary among different
services and by time-of-day, and the user is often not clear about trip cost. In addition,
stops do not satisfy the basic safety requirements for a safe and easy access into the
vehicles and are often overcrowded resulting in spill over of waiting people onto the main
roads, which is both a safety hazard for people and reduces vehicle speeds. The primary

weakness of the existing system is absence of an operational plan, which clearly identifies
routing practices. driver training and control. vehicle maintenance practices. service
standards, service monitoring, and bus and trolley bus terminal management.

TRAVEL DEMAND FORECASTING FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT
IN ASHGHABAT
8.    A transport demand model was developed and calibrated for estimating passenger
transport demand for 1995 which was used to predict travel demand for year 2000. The
model area included the urbanized area of Ashghabat (including suburban areas), which
was divided into 25 zones. The road network was represented by links, centroids, and
zones. The links connect the centroids and zones and used for movement of pedestrians
and vehicles. Three types of links have been identified: main road, secondary road, and
service or local roads. The centroids represent the meeting point of different links. The
zones are trip production and attraction areas, and are connected to the public transport
network by means of a "dummy" network to be used by pedestrian traffic. The model is
developed for three public transport systems (bus, trolley bus, and mini bus) and the
variables specified include: line number, direction, service type, headway, seating
capacity, and crush capacity. The model is simulated for peak period traffic (6:30 am to
9:30 am) and divided into four components: trip production and attraction, distribution,
modal split, and assignment.
9.    Trip Generation. The basic information is collected for population, jobs, and land
use patterns for each of the 25 traffic zones. It is assumed that 20 percent of the
population lives and works in the same traffic zone (based on socio-economic surveys)
and the trips are mainly by walking which are excluded from the model. Of the balance
80 percent, about 60 percent use public transport services for commuting. The work trips
produced by each of the region was assumed to be proportional to the population. Work
trip attractions at the zonal level were estimated by correlating with the available jobs and
land use pattems. Total trip productions and attractions (work and nonwork) were
estimated by assuming that nonwork trips during the morning peak period are 15 percent
of the work trips.
10.   Trip Distribution. The model for trip distribution was based on gravity law and
took the following form:
(a)   V(ij) = Prod(i) f(K(ij))/ SUM Attrac (j)*f(K(ij))
(b)   Where: V(ij)= trips between zones i and j
(i)   Prod (i) = trips produced in zone i
(ii)   Attr G) = trips attracted by zone j
(iii)  f(K(ij)) = impedence function
11.   The impedence function is estimated using "generalized" time of travel, including:
walk time, wait time, boarding/alighting time, and time-on-vehicle.



Annex 2.1                                                                81
12.   Mode Choice. The model is developed to estimate travel demand volume for
public transport only, which in the base year (1995) accounted for 60 percent of the total
traffic volume. The allocation among different public transport modes was estimated
using a logic choice model based on system performance.
13.   Trip Assignment. Trip assignment is divided into two phases: (a) creation of
routes, in which the mode searches for all possible routes and assigns probabilities of
each of them being used; and (b) traffic assignment based on minimizing generalized
travel time. The process of trip allocation to the routes used three components: (a) walk
choice model; (b) transit model; and (c) alternative alighting model.
14.   The model was calibrated for the base year (1995) using the data from the socio-
economic survey conducted as part of the proposed project. A comparison of data on
network assignment with the base year traffic flows indicate large imbalances in the flow
of different public transport vehicles among different areas. The model was used to
forecast travel demand for year 2000. The basic assumption was made that population
growth in Ashghabat continues at 8 percent per annum and mode split between public and
private transport.modes stays the same till 2000. An alternative scenario was also
developed using annual 5 percent population growth rate and a lower dependence on
public transport (40:60). The travel demand projections, additionally, made the following
assumptions:
*  diesel buses are expected to continue supporting the increase in passenger
travel demand in future
-  trolley bus services will be strengthened on existing lines and one new line is
proposed to be built by the Government before year 2000;
*  existing mini-buses will be re-routed to serve as feeder services;
*  no new mini-buses will be purchased over the next five years.

ANNEX 2.2
REPORT OF A SOCIAL ASSESSMENT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.    A social assessment (SA) was conducted in February 1995 as part of the identification
process for a proposed urban transport project for the city of Ashghabat, Turkmenistan. It
focused on aspects of demand for and supply of public and private transportation, concentrating
on various stakeholder groups: households, transport users, bus drivers, drivers of private
vehicles and enterprises. It also incorporated results of discussions with the public transport
agency and the municipality.
2.    Currently, Ashghabat's publicly managed transport system suffers from low vehicle
utilization, short operating life spans, weak institutional arrangement and management, poor cost
recovery, and an inadequate road network infrastructure. The purpose of the World Bank project
is to improve urban transportation in Ashghabat so that it operates efficiently, effectively and
sustainably.
3.    The SA aimed to provide a better understanding of the uses people make of urban
transport, their choices, behavior and needs. It also focused on the behavior of some transport
suppliers in an attempt to identify incentives to improve their performance. The specific
objectives of the social assessment are to:
evaluate the social impact of the proposed World Bank project components on
households and investigate how certain social groups may be affected;
*   help identify the most critical interventions to be undertaken immediately to
improve urban transport in Ashghabat; and
*   ensure that project objectives and incentives for change are appropriate and
acceptable to all beneficiaries, particularly low income groups.
4.    The SA is basically a mechanism to allow consideration of the needs and expectations of
the people potentially affected by a development intervention-urban transportation in the case of
this project. Its recommendations stand alone and should be reviewed on the basis of economic,
financial and technical considerations. Not all needs expressed by actual and potential users of
urban transportation can meet economic and technical considerations. Similarly,, what may
appear technically and economically feasible or desirable may not meet people's needs and
expectations. A SA is not a substitute for other types of assessments essential for good project
design and implementation, but it is a key input to such a process. It is also a good tool to
facilitate participation of stakeholders in development projects. The SA process should be
continued during implementation in order to provide guidance on whether the project is
achieving its objectives or what modifications should be considered.

5.    The assessment presented here aimed at a systematic, rapid and cost-effective output,
and thus combined several methodologies within the short phase of project preparation.
Performed jointly by a team of social scientists from the World Bank and local experts, it
comprised the following elements:
*   A household survey, administered to about 600 households randomly selected from
the city's 16 districts ("micro-rayons") and focusing on demographic, socio-
economic, employment, income and travel patterns. A special survey was also
administered to those households that owned a private vehicle in order to establish
patterns of private vehicle utilization.
*   A user survey, conducted with about 1,100 respondents at bus stops throughout the
city at various times of the day over four days (including one week-end day). This
survey focused on journey details, such as purpose of trip, waiting time, length of
trip, and costs.
*   A survey of vehicle counts and demand composition in over 300 sites, focusing
on passenger congestion, demand composition and vehicle availability.
*   An enterprise survey of 92 enterprises, to elucidate the status and importance of
enterprise transport, and felt needs of the larger enterprises for changes in urban
transport services.
6.    In addition, the research team conducted informal interviews with household members,
transport users, enterprise representatives, and transport suppliers. Several months after the
analyses of the household, user and enterprise surveys, focus group discussions were held with
bus drivers, and with users and non-users of monthly bus passes following the tariff raises in
order to understand why the monthly passes were little used.
7.    A stakeholder workshop was held to share preliminary survey results with the
academic community, the representatives of the Ministry of Transport and the municipality. By
then it was clear that the findings of the SA had been taken on board locally; a number of
significant reforms in public transport management had been implemented within a month of the
SA. Service had improved, cost recovery instituted, tariffs raised and the liquidity situation
improved; and yet at the same time, by control of abuse, the actual cost of transport to the poor
had been approximately halved. The SA has thus provided inputs to project preparation based on
what the majority of the city's population actually saw as priorities, created a foundation for the
future involvement of citizens in making inputs to transport policy and development, contributed
to the policy dialogue, laid the basis for internal reforms that could be instituted without major
cost or the need for approval at national government level, and contributed to the overall process
of reform and democratization by linking decision makers to public opinion on a matter of
general concern. Because of these changes, the specific findings of the SA on dissatisfaction and
prices, and on informal driver practices, represent findings as of February 1995, a situation that
has already begun to improve. Other findings showed more deep-rooted structural and economic
patterns that are more enduring.



Annex 2.2                                                                           85
Overview of Major Conclusions
8.     People in Ashghabat rely heavily on public transport. Every day, around 160,000
citizens, close to one third of the population, use public vehicles for various activities. Buses and
trolleys are in especially high demand, with 50 percent of the city's work force and 84 percent of
all transport users rely on these two modes. The cost of public transport bears particularly
heavily on the poor (Figure 1).
9.     Generally, bus and trolley users belong to lower income groups, especially the many
female riders, who are more likely to use buses and trolleys than minibuses, taxis or enterprise
transport.
10.   Dissatisfaction with the public transport system is in measure with reliance on it.
This dissatisfaction has its roots in four main problems: (a) insufficient vehicle
frequency; (b) high "unofficial fares", and the general unpredictability of fares, resulting
in uncertainty about trip and joumey costs; (c) insufficient service to peripheral districts,
and (d) inadequate support infrastructure, including street lighting and sheltered bus
stops, and road network infrastructure.
* Vehicle Frequency. Intervals between vehicles, especially buses and trolleys, are
shortest in the morning, and become longer towards the end of the day, without a
noticeable improvement during evening rush hours. On week-ends, transport
services slow down even more, while demand decreases only slightly. The quality
of service is poor.
* Costs to Passengers and Willingness To Pay for Improvements. Eighty percent
of cash-paying passengers paid at least two manats or more-four times the current
official fare-for a bus or trolley trip. This results partly from a shortage in coinage,
but mainly from price gouging and "special fare" policies arbitrarily applied by
drivers. Although the purchase of monthly passes is a theoretical alternative to cash
payments, many transport users were reluctant to undertake such an investment
(currently 30 manats), because the unreliability of bus and trolley schedules might
in any case force them to resort to minibuses or taxis, thus depriving them of an
acceptable return to their investment. Bus and trolley passengers also had to deal
with ever-changing fares that could vary according to the time of day or the
itinerary chosen by the driver for a given trip. Not surprisingly, two thirds of the
interviewed users were not willing to pay more for an improved system than they
were paying at the time. The vast majority of users, 94 percent, found an official
bus or trolley fare of I manat acceptable. This was 20 times the official tariff at
survey time, and twice the tariff after the April 1995 increase.
*   Service to the Urban Periphery. Although public transport users suffer from the
shortcomings of the existing system throughout the city, six outlying districts seem
to be much worse off than central areas, and seem to require priority attention.
*   Road Infrastructure. Unsatisfactory road conditions and road infrastructure are
strong deterrents to many private car owners against the use of their vehicles as



86                                                                         Annex 2.2
informal taxis, which could provide an important supplement to public
transportation. Over 70 percent of households are unhappy with their local road
infrastructure. Especially in northwestern and southern peripheral districts, bad
road conditions seem to be a major concern.
11.   Private Taxis. The official taxi service is complemented by a fleet of approximately
1,350 private taxis--private cars whose owners use their vehicle to offer "informal" taxi services
to the public. This transport resource has the potential to grow rapidly, once tools and parts for
vehicle maintenance become more widely available, and road conditions improve. Informal
taxis play an important role at times when public transport is infrequent, especially over the
week-end. They could also become serious competitors to official taxis, especially once the taxi
business becomes privatized and government subsidies are stopped, as suggest in the proposed
project. Currently no mechanism exists to control informal taxis with regard to road safety and
environmentally sound operation.
12.   The Labor Market and the Role of Enterprise Transport.  Many institutions,
organizations and enterprises provide transport services for their workers and employees. Yet,
because transport is so unsatisfactory, many Ashghabat workers and employees decide to look
for employment near their home, as evidenced by the great number of walkers (20 percent of all
workers). If they have to move home, they are likely to look for another job in their new
neighborhood. Many enterprise managers report that labor allocation is inefficient (transport
concerns outweigh comparative skill advantages), and firms experience high rates of moving-
related job turn-over. However, provision of such transport is seen as an unfortunate necessity.
Enterprises report that they suffer the burden of having to operate and maintain an expensive
transport vehicle fleet, to complement inadequate public transport services.
13.   Improvements in public transportation (whether publicly or privately managed) and
particularly improvements in bus and trolley services, would directly help lower income groups,
especially women.
Description and Analysis of SA Results
14.   People in Ashghabat use public transportation (bus, trolley, minibus, and publicly
managed taxis) mainly to go to work, to visit friends, to go shopping, and for other activities,
such as school and leisure. Over 60 percent of the work force and 54 percent of shoppers depend
on public transportation. The remainder mostly walk or use private transport. During the past
five or six years, public transport has become so unreliable, and commuting to work such a
major problem, that many people have found ways to reduce their dependence on it. They
change jobs, so that their workplace is closer to home. They abandon shift-working, because
they cannot get to. and from work at the required times. They make informal arrangements,
including the use of unofficial taxis. Most working persons have to use a combination of
different vehicles to reach their work place. The most widely used are buses (which 44 percent
of working persons use for all or part of their commute), minibuses (29 percent, exclusively or in
combination with other modes), and trolleybuses (which 24 percent include in their commute).
At bus stops, 84 percent were waiting for buses or trolleys, and around 10 percent for minibuses.
The data confirmed the wide use and importance of urban transportation services currently
provided by the public sector, especially large buses.



Annex 2.2                                                                       87
15.   Lower income groups spend about the same absolute amount on transport as wealthier
residents. Therefore lower income groups spend about twice the proportion of their income on
public transport, in comparison with the wealthier (12 percent as compared to 6 percent) (Figure
1). At the same time, lower income travelers ride the relatively cheaper buses and trolleys, and
use monthly passes more often than higher income groups. The unreliability of bus and trolley
services, on the one hand, and difficulties experienced in having relatively inexpensive monthly
passes forces the lower income groups to use more expensive modes of transport, such as
minibuses.  Enhanced reliability of services and cost effective improvements in urban
transportation will thus have a positive impact on low income populations.  Bus stop
infrastructure improvements were also considered important.
16.   Comparison of the commuting behavior of male and female working persons showed
that women are more likely to walk to work: 28 percent of women but only 13 percent of men
commute on foot. Women do not use private cars or enterprise bus to go to work as often as men
do. Many factors contribute to this: a greater tendency for women to accept jobs nearer their
homes, lower wages for female workers, and traditions that favor men's access to private
vehicles.

17. A similar comparison by ethnicity reveals that Turkman employees are more likely to walk or take
a bus, while Russians more often use enterprise transport. This difference is caused by the geographical
distribution of ethnic groups, their distribution by sector and type of employment, and the recent
immigration of Turkman groups to the city to work in the informal sector or new enterprises. However
income, and locational factors such as the distance between home and work, are better predictors of
transport use than are gender or ethnicity.
18. A passenger's journey from home to destination, including walking to the bus stop and waiting
there, lasts 37 minutes on average. Unreliable services, however, cause large deviations from this
relatively acceptable figure, making many actual and potential transport users dissatisfied.  Bus
frequency, and consequently waiting times and vehicle congestion, varies by day and by time of the day.
Vehicle counts at many bus stops show that public vehicle fiequency is acceptable at the beginning of the
day, that it slackens as the day goes on, and can hardly satisfy demand during the evening peak hours. It
almost stops entirely over the week-end and in the evenings. Private carriers, whose weekday role is



Annex 2.2                                                                           89
unimportant, help to bridge the transportation gap at week-ends. Private vehicles, and informally
operated vehicles, also play a key role in transportation of goods.
19.  Travel costs were found to be unpredictable and far in excess of official tariffs. Eighty percent of
cash paying passengers paid a trip cost of 2 manats, 40 times the official bus fare at the time of the
survey. The main reason for this situation was the shortage of coinage, and the arbitrary "price gouging"
applied by drivers at certain times of the day, and when making "unofficial" itineraries. Even after the
official bus tariff was raised by a factor of ten, people were still paying two to four times that amount.
20.  A district comparison with regard to transport needs and satisfaction shows that the peripheral
districts especially suffer from inadequate and unreliable public transportation. There are six districts in
particular that show a combination of features-high commuting levels, high levels of dissatisfaction,
and high dependency on public transport-in sufficient severity to make them priorities. Of these, three
are lower income in relation to the city average, one is average and two somewhat above. Together, they
account for over 50 percent of the city's population. There are indications that infornal private sector
arrangements are developing to offer some level of remedy to the problems of these neighborhoods.
Therefore whether or not a public sector response is appropriate ought to be investigated on the basis of
technical and cost considerations.                  Figure 2: Dissatisfaction with Public
21.  Close to 90 percent of the respondents in the  Transport in Ashgabat, by District
household  and   user  surveys  expressed  their
dissatisfaction with the current system. Ninety percent
of interviewed users and 85 percent of surveyed
households claimed that they were unhappy with public
transportation services-a level of dissatisfaction that
was spread almost uniformly across the city's 16 sub-
districts (micro-rayons) (Figure 2).                      90
22.  A  review  of improvements  suggested  by   CO
residents showed a strong preference for management    f   70

improvements and institutional reform.  Because the  az
private sector concept is relatively new to the system at   c 
large, suggested  improvements focus on  people's         50
expectations with respect to the services supplied by the   X   40       1-
public sector.  However, the shift towards infornal              i
arrangements (including those supplied by the publicly    ,
owned vehicle stock), taken together with the use    g   20      ..
people actually make of these services, suggests that      10    1
there should also be a focus that will encourage the    a
informal system and allow competition to develop.          o   9                     6     1

itinerary, and charge fixed official fares. Additional routes are important especially to the
residents of outlying districts and commuters to them, particularly those areas that are
characterized by low incomes.
23.    With regard to willingness to pay for improved transport arrangements, 94 percent of
transport users said they would pay at least twice the current official bus fare (0.5 manats), 66
percent would pay four times this amount, and about one third were willing to pay six times the
official fare.
24.    These figures are sensitive to the amounts people were actually spending on fares: for
the majority, who paid an actual fare of 2 manats, 34 percent were willing to pay even more, 32
percent were paying as much as they were willing to, and 34 percent felt they were paying too
much. This does not mean that official fares are too high. It merely shows that even after the
official tariff had increased by a factor of ten in April 1995, "unofficial" fares as actually paid to
the drivers were still double that amount, and that the unofficial fares had reached or exceeded
many residents' thresholds of willingness (and probably ability) to pay for urban transport.
When people were asked to name the improvements they expected, and the price they would be
willing to pay for improved transport services, results indicated a relatively broad room for
enhanced cost recovery, particularly in areas of vehicle frequency, reliability, congestion and
seating, and additional routes (Figure 3).
25.    Enterprise transport.  Over 88 percent of enterprises surveyed claimed to own
transport vehicles owing to the specific nature of their work, rather than to fill gaps in
insufficient public transportation services. Almost a quarter of the work-force employed by the
surveyed enterprises uses enterprise buses to go to work. However, because of high operating
and maintenance costs for their vehicle fleet, 40 percent of enterprises that currently own
transport vehicles would prefer not to offer this service, but are reluctant to stop, because they
believe the public transport system could not carry the additional burden. Many small and newly
established enterprises use private arrangements or enter into lease arrangements with the public
transport authority. Poor urban transportation also adversely affects productivity, as reported by
over 48 percent of the firms and institutions surveyed. Therefore, most enterprises have great
interest in improved urban transportation and in the formalization of the informal system.
26.    An increasing fleet of private cars serve as informal taxis throughout the city. The
number of private cars is uncertain. Official figures show an eight percent increase from 1993 to
1994 to approximately 6,500, possibly an underestimate of several hundred. However, 27
percent of households surveyed claimed to "own" a car, probably because they included
enterprise cars allocated for private use, which would suggest about 30,000 privately-used
vehicles. Almost 5 percent of households claim to use their car regularly as a taxi. A further 13
percent of households are seriously considering joining the informal transport market, which
would bring the worker: informal taxi ratio to 30: 1. Although potential earnings from informal
taxis are high, many households are reluctant to use their car in this way, mainly owing to the
perceived high price of fuel, lack of available spare parts, and poor road condition. Whether or
not they own a car, many households are concerned about poor roads: seventy-two percent of
respondents considered road infrastructure in their neighborhood to be unsatisfactory, a result
that was most marked in the city center, and in northwestern and southern peripheries.

Policy Dialogue and Management Reform
27.   The SA findings led Ashghabat's public transport management to begin a process of
Internal reform. They identified changes that could be made to policies and procedures under
their control, in contrast to policies and procedures requiring national government action or
external financing. Internal reforms were begun within a month of the SA, before the formal
report was submitted. By September 1995 an impressive array of changes had been made, and
the clear impression was received that public levels of dissatisfaction had greatly reduced.
28.   The SA specifically identified two measures that could be taken. Official bus and trolley
cash fares could be raised even further to I manat, while the existing minibus fare of 2 manats
could remain unchanged. As a safety net for the 6.5 percent of users who could not afford these
tariffs, monthly passes could continue to sell at the current price (30 manats). So as to stabilize
the fare tariff and prevent revenue leakage, incentives could be created for drivers to stop
overcharging riders and pocketing the proceeds. Their salaries could be raised, performance
incentives introduced, while closer supervision and disciplinary measures, including dismissal,
could be instituted to control poor performance.
29.   Urban public transport management had become more aware that additional financial
resources were important, both from external financing and from improved cash generation by
operations. At the same time, urban transport services could also be improved significantly
through structural and operational changes. Reforms instituted by management in the wake of
the SA included the following which were relatively easy and inexpensive to introduce:
*   Salaries of bus drivers were substantially raised, thus removing the incentive for
supplementing them by exploiting the public, and increasing job status and
satisfaction. Transport supervisors were designated to ride on buses so as to control
the behavior of drivers, and enforce discipline.
*   The nominal fare of 5 tengge per trip was increased by a factor of ten, to 50 tengge.
Since the SA revealed that in practice people had been paying twice the new
amount, the burden on the poor was halved, yet the management began to recover
costs. Since coins were scarce, books of 20 tickets were sold to the public so that
passengers paid was the nominal fare irrespective of available coinage. The
liquidity situation of public transport substantially improved.
*   Improved liquidity meant more vehicles maintained and in service which, together
with improved driver performance, allowed improved scheduling. Buses displayed
routes and fares.
*   Internal management and personnel were strengthened.
All of this went a long way to restoring public confidence that officials were making a
definite effort to improve transport services, and paved the way for future reforms and further
cost recovery.
30.   Legalization and Regulation of Private Taxis. Given the important role these vehicles
play in filling a gap, it appears necessary to regularize the informal taxi business to a reasonable



Annex 2.2                                                                        93
degree (e.g. through annually renewable licenses and flat license fees), but not to the point of a
severe crowding out of the existing stock. Once the efficiency and capacity of urban transport is
restored, more elaborate regulation, can be implemented.
31.   Transport and the Labor Market. The quality and efficiency of urban transport has
direct economic implications on the city's labor market and enterprise productivity. Since
people are restricted in choosing the location of their residence due to inflexible public housing
policies and legal barriers, their job choices are heavily influenced by the quality and efficiency
of public transport. Overall, improved urban transportation would allow a better, more efficient
functioning of the labor market (which is especially important during the ongoing period of
economic transformation and privatization) and help enhance enterprise productivity.
32.   In the review of the SA (September 1995), the following policy and procedural steps
were discussed:
*   Publicizing the results of the SA. This step would acknowledge the widespread
dissatisfaction which had existed among users of urban public transport at the time
and demonstrate transport official's willingness to deal with problem areas.
*   Proposing publicly possible solutions, and discussing the appropriateness of
their application with stakeholders. These stakeholders include both those
interested in the solutions--the users--and those involved in implementing them,
namely management and workers, including drivers and mechanics.
*   Pointing out that tariff increases, in conjunction with other reforms, would
reduce the real cost of urban transport. Low fares had not meant cheap
transport, especially for the poor, and poor cost recovery, in turn, had led to
inefficiencies and had exacerbated the vicious cycle of problems and denied the
poor the very transport they needed. In contrast, it had been possible
simultaneously to increase the tariff substantially while markedly reducing the
burden on the poor.
* Improving the quality of service. Consumers needed to be convinced that better
service would result from tariff increases. Early tariff increases, essential to fund
transport operations, could come from service improvements that did not require
major investment, such as further operational, maintenance, and institutional
reforms. Later tariff increases might have to await more costly capital investment
such as the rehabilitation and replacement of vehicles.
* Ensuring a social safety net. Those in special categories who truly cannot afford
the full tariff--such as students, the very poor, or pensioners-need assured and
continued access to public transport. Transport companies need a transparent and
timely way to recover compensation for this subsidy.
33.   By contributing a stakeholder analysis to the project preparation phase, and by
researching and presenting the situation, behavior and views of the public and of other
stakeholders, the SA laid a precedent for continued stakeholder involvement, ensuring that urban
transport serves the needs of the public. The SA findings are thus very much part of an active



94                                                                      Annex 2.2
and ongoing policy dialogue with the Government of Turkmenistan. By researching the needs
and opinions of the public and the users, and by involving decision makers in a process of
responding to a felt need, the SA has also contributed to the process of including the public in the
more general process of social and economic reforms.

ANNEX 4.1
TERMS OF REFERENCE - TECHNICAL ADVISORY SERVICES TO APAPO
1.    APAPO will need external assistance in the implementation of the proposed
Bank-financed project. To this end, a consulting firm would provide technical advisory
services to supervise project implementation and ensure that the project achieves its
stated objectives. It is proposed that the consultants' assignment be implemented in two
phases. Phase I would be completed over a 9- to 12-month period. A possible second
phase, at a scale and scope to be agreed upon during negotiations, would be executed over
an 18 to 24 month period. Phase II would be financed under a proposed Urban Transport
loan which the Government of Turkmenistan. The consultants are requested to submit a
proposal for both phases, with staffing and work plan for each phase.
2.    Phase I will concentrate principally on measures aimed at:
(a)   advancing procurement of bus and trolleybus vehicles and spare parts,
(b)   the final preparation of those project components not yet fully developed,
(c)   implementing key parts of the operations improvement plan Phase II will
concentrate on:
(i)   advancing project implementation,
(ii)  improving the management, operations, maintenance, and finance
of the passenger transport companies,
(iii)  national policy formulation in public transport, and
(iv)  staff training.
3.    The consultant will conduct most of the assignment in Ashghabat, Turkmenistan
working with APAPO/PMG staff. However, some work will be required outside
Ashghabat, especially in the pilot cities of Mary and Chardzhou.  Additional office
work, to be specified in the consultants proposal, might be conducted at the home office
or facility of the consultant if the client concurs that this work can be accomplished more
economically in this manner.



102                                                               Annex 4.1
4.    The consultant is to report to the Director of the PMG within APAPO for
administrative purposes and for general direction. While reporting to the PMG Director
mainly for administrative purposes, the consultant will work in close cooperation with the
Director of APAPO. In particular, the consultant will work as part of the Operations
Management Group (OMG) within APAPO and provide ongoing support to each of the
passenger transport enterprises in Ashghabat.
5.    Phase I work will proceed under tight deadlines, requiring work on a wide variety
of tasks, and with a limited amount of funds. For this reason, the consultant will need to
field staff with broad experience, yet be able to provide specialists for short periods of
time to assist in specific situations. Since work priorities are likely to shift over the
period of the assignment, the consultant must be prepared to alter work plans under the
direction of the PMG director.
6.    The consultant, while assisting APAPO/PMG, will be expected to promote the
positive transfer of knowledge and experience to the APAPO/PMG team in their
everyday work environment. Experience gained during the practical implementation of
the OIP should be utilized to formulate training recommendations relevant to the future
development of APAPO and the passenger transport companies participating in the
project.
Phase 1: Scope of Work
7.    To meet the above objectives, the consultant will work with the APAPO/PMG
staff team to accomplish the Phase I scope of work that is described below.
8.    The Project Management Group (PMG) will use international competitive bidding
(ICB) procedures for procuring 62 buses and 40 trolleybuses in Ashghabat at an
estimated aggregate value of approximately $20 million. In addition, the consultant will
assist in the preparation for and procurement of spare parts, workshop equipment, and
other goods to be procured under the project.  Specific procurement tasks of the
consultant include the following:
A.   Procurement Assistance
Procurement Planning:
*  Preparation of a procurement plan, including bidding packages with schedules
for each procurement package.  (Determine for each package whether
International Competitive Bidding, International Shopping, National
Shopping, or Direct Contracting is to be utilized)
* Finalizing the list of spare parts for the vehicle rehabilitation program



Annex 4.1                                                                103
* Finalization, as needed, of the draft bidding documents for buses, trolley buses
and spare parts
Bidding Process:
* Forwarding draft bidding documents and letters of invitation for consulting
services to the Bank for the Bank's "no objection"
* Assisting with publication of invitation to bid, issuance of bidding documents,
clarifying suppliers queries, and pre-bid conferences
* Arranging the public bid opening including training of the bid opening
committee and preparing the bid opening minutes
Bid Evaluation:
* Assisting with the evaluation of bids and proposals
* Assisting with the preparation of bid and consultant evaluation reports
Contract Award and Post Award Contract Management:
Assisting with the negotiation of contracts and arranging for contract signing
* Assisting with engaging an inspection services firm to inspect the new
vehicles to be procured under the project
* Assisting with opening of letters or credit and applications to the Bank for
special commitment;
* Handling post award queries and issues, and subsequent administrative steps
* Administering the contracts including monitoring any deliveries that take
place for goods and services contracts
* Setting up documentation and procedures to minimize customs delays and act
as troubleshooter if delays occur
Disbursements:
* Preparing withdrawal applications and applications for special commitments
Training:



104                                                                 Annex 4.1
* Implementing a procurement training program for selected staff working on
the project
B.   Mary and Chardzhou Components
US $5 million has been allocated under the proposed project for financing
components in the pilot cities of Mary and Chardzhou. This will include the
procurement of buses, spare parts, and workshop equipment. The exact scale
and dimension of the components in each of these cities are not fully known at
this time, nor are the priorities for operational improvements or institutional
reforms. Therefore, the consultant will assist APAPO/PMG in the following:
(a)   (a)   Determining and justifying the composition of the project
investment program in each of these cities based on a needs analysis,
(b)   (b)   Preparing an operations improvement plan,
(c)   (c)   Determining appropriate institutional and contracting arrangements
for each of these cities, and
(d)   (d)   Preparing a report for each city summarizing the above findings.
C.    Vehicle Location and Monitoring System
The City of Ashghabat wishes to introduce a vehicle location and monitoring
system to: (a) adjust service intervals in response to a need to take corrective
action, (b) provide control and monitoring to detect unauthorized deviations from
routes by drivers, and (c) provide data inputs to service planning systems. The
consultant, in close coordination with APAPO and the City of Ashghabat, will
carry out a feasibility study to determine the economic justification for such a
system, and the optimal size and level of technology. If justified, the consultant
will prepare specifications for procurement of the required equipment under
consideration. (See Attachment # 4 for a preliminary description of this proposed
system.)
D.   Fare Collection System
Collection of fares has been a problem in Ashghabat due to an extensive range of
legal fare exemptions, and further due to a lax collection regime. The consultant
will propose an improved fare collection system that would be appropriate for
application in Ashghabat. One proposal has been to introduce an automated
ticketing system for the entire urban passenger public transport (including the
existing fleet of buses, trolleybuses, and minibuses). The consultant, however,
should investigate a range of options, including manual-only systems, as part of a



Annex 4.1                                                               105
feasibility study to determine the most economic ticketing system for Ashghabat.
The consultant will also determine fare levels that would be required for the
passenger transport companies to achieve the goal of 100% recovery of operating
costs with a suitable fare collection system in place. (See Attachment #5 for
additional guidance on fare collection study tasks that might be undertaken during
Phase I to underpin the design of an appropriate fare collection system.)
E.    Contracting Between Ashghabat, APAPO, and the Passenger Transport
Companies
An important element of the project will be the development and implementation
of a contractual agreement between the City of Ashghabat and APAPO for the
provision of passenger transport services in the City. This agreement will include,
inter-alia: (a) specified levels of service on specific routes by day and by time, (b)
prescribed fare levels by type of service, (c) schedules of persons receiving
exemptions, and (d) a prescribed level of subsidy for the period under contract.
This contractual relationship will establish the basis for an annual budget
provision for APAPO services, and for these funds to be advanced to APAPO and
the passenger transport companies for a specific periods in advance to permit
them to be able to plan and operate efficiently without a shortage of funds. This
approach will mean moving away from the subsidy system in which subsidies are
determined after losses have been incurred, and towards a system in which
subsidies are determined each year in advance.
The consultant will assist APAPO in preparing a contract along the above lines
with the .City of Ashghabat, and similarly will assist in the preparation of
contracts between APAPO and each of the passenger transport companies (bus,
trolleybus, and minibus) in Ashghabat. An important element in the development
of these contracts will be the concomitant development of performance measures
and monitoring instruments.
F.   Budgets and Accounting Systems
The consultant, within the limited cost parameters of the first phase program, will:
(a)   Identify and propose short term improvements that could be made to the
existing budgets and accounting systems of the passenger transport
companies in Ashghabat. These proposals would be further developed and
implemented during the proposed Phase II program.
(b)   Establish a simple system for maintaining project accounts.

Staffing for the Assignment
16.   Phase I Emphasis. Within the available budget for the Phase I assignment,
consultant time will need to be carefully allocated. While only indicative, the relative
emphasis the client wishes to place on the assignment during Phase I are approximately
as follows:
*  Procurement Assistance                                     40%
*  Preparation of Mary and Chardzhou Components               10%
*  Preparation of Vehicle Location and Monitoring System      5%
*  Preparation of Fare Collection and Automated Ticketing System  5%
*  Contracting between Ashghabat, APAPO, and the Passenger Transport
Companies                                                  10%
*  Improving Existing Financial Systems                       10%
*  Provision of Operations Advice                             10%



Annex 4.1                                                             109
*  Provision of Maintenance and Rehabilitation Advice      10%
16.   Phase II Emphasis. While only tentative, the following approximate allocation of
consultant time might be placed on the proposed Phase II work program:
* Procurement Assistance                                   2%
*  Implementation of Mary and Chardzhou Components         5%
*  Vehicle Location & Monitoring System, and Fare Collection System 5%
*  Contracting between Cities and the Passenger Transport Companies 5%
*  Budgets and Accounting Systems                          20%
*  Provision of Operations Advice                          15%
* Provision of Maintenance and Rehabilitation Advice       15%

17.   Suggested Staffing. While the decision on staffing is up to the consultant as part
of his proposal, it is suggested that the consultant team leader might be a bus operations
expert with strong procurement experience in international competitive bidding. The
team will also need to field a person (or persons) with a strong finance and administrative
background, and with experience in contracting between passenger transport companies
and municipal authorities. The client, while recognizing that use of short term specialists
on some of the work would be appropriate, would prefer the deployment of at least the
team leader on a full time basis during the assignment.
18.   The following minimum staffing is recommended, in particular, to cover major
activities under the assignment:
(a)   Procurement consultants with knowledge of World Bank procurement
procedures and with particular experience in the procurement of vehicles
will be essential. The consultant firm ought to have technical expertise in
buses and trolleybuses. It might be possible to deploy one consultant with
this expertise, but if this is not possible, a procurement advisor with short-
term procurement assistance from technical specialists would be a suitable
arrangement. The procurement advisors will need to be permanently in
Ashghabat for nine to twelve months.
(b)   An experienced financial expert familiar with urban passenger transport
budgeting and accounting.
(c)   A bus and trolleybus operations and maintenance specialist.
(d)   Other short term specialists as appropriate.

ANNEX 5.2
FINANCIAL EVALUATION ASSUMPTION
1.    The following assumptions are the basis for the projections utilized in the
financial evaluation in Chapter 5. The assumptions are consistent with those used for the
economic analysis (Chapter 6).
2.    Monetary Unit: US dollars.
3.    Exchange Rate: All investments are expressed in US dollar terms. Historic
operating costs and other balance sheet items, denominated in US dollars, have been
converted at the average US$:Manat exchange rates for the relevant period.  All
projections are on the basis of a nominal exchange rage of US$1 = 5,000 manats.
4.    Inflation Indices: Cost estimates are based on 1996 prices. Prices of imported
and importable goods and services, purchased under the project, are escalated at the
Bank's muv index. The cost of international non-tradeable goods and services are
escalated at an average annual rate of 25% over the project implementation period. The
projections are in constant (1996) US dollars.
5.    Vehicle Operating Inputs. For the base year, the following assumptions were
used: (a) 55 percent of the total diesel-bus fleet, 70 percent of trolleybus and 60 percent
of minibuses are available for use; (b) five percent of daily mileage is non-revenue
earning (dead mileage); (c) on average, vehicles operate for eight hours daily; (d)
passenger carrying-kilometer is, on average, 80 percent for diesel bus, 95 percent for
trolleybus and 95 percent for minibus; and (e) average trip lengths are 5.2, 3.3 and 10
kilometers for bus, trolleybus and minibus, respectively.
6.    Tariffs. Bus, trolleybus and minibus tariffs are based on the current fare of 50
manats per ride for each vehicle. No price escalation is applied.
7.    Operating Costs. The incremental operating costs under the project are fuel, tire
and maintenance costs. On average, fuel efficiency is 3 kilometers per liter. The life of a
bus tire is 55,000 kilometers and 50,000 kilometers for trolleybuses and minibuses.
Annual maintenance costs are assumed to be US$2,000 per bus and per trolleybus and
US$1,000 per minibus. The project includes US$1.0 million for incremental operating
expenses, to be funded by the transport enterprises. Labor requirements for the
rehabilitation and maintenance of the vehicles are not considered incremental as they will
be performed "in-house".

8.    Other Costs. In March 1997, salaries and wages in Turkmenistan have doubled
for all public enterprises except for selected transport sector companies, including the
bus, trolleybus and minibus companies. Wages are expected to increase in the near term,
however, the magnitude and timing of the correction is uncertain. The financial mode
assumes that wages will increase in average of 50% for each transport companies in the
base year and remain constant over the project implementation period. Overhead
expenses are assumed to be about 15% of operating and employee expenses.
9.    Depreciation. The depreciation schedule was determined based on current
practice for the class of fixed asset. Depreciation expense was not included in
discussions of cost recovery targets.

ANNEX 6.1
ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT
A.   Basic Methodology Used in the Evaluation
1.    Underfunding of the investment and operating needs of public transport vehicles
over the past few years has resulted in reduced operating lives of dieselbuses and
trolleybuses and accumulation of a substantial backlog of maintenance and vehicle
replacement requirements. The reduction in public transport capacity is especially
alarming when viewed in the light of an average annual population growth of eight
percent in Ashghabat. If efforts are not undertaken to rehabilitate bus fleet, the bus
garage may effectively have to close down in the next three to four years. Over the past
few years, the government has augmented the capacity of public vehicle fleet through
procurement of a large number of new buses without any efforts to rehabilitate existing
vehicle fleet. The investments by the Government have been sub-optimal as reflected in
the purchase of sub-standard buses and the new acquisition has not made up for the
attrition in the capacity of the core bus and trolleybus fleet. The proposed project
attempts to assess the shortfall in supply relative to demand in the base year and estimates
additional vehicle requirements in future years to satisfy projected demand.
2.    The objective of the project is to improve the bus transport  (dieselbus,
trolleybus, and minibus) service in Ashghabat in terms of:
(a)   quality of service, by reducing waiting time and crowding while increasing
service reliability;
(b)   quantity of service, by satisfying the increasing demand reflecting an
expected eight percent annual population growth in Ashghabat in the
medium term plus the pent-up demand in currently under- and unserved
areas in Ashghabat; and
(c)   efficiency, by reducing transport unit costs through an integrated and
balanced program of maintenance, rehabilitation and acquisition of buses
supported by a broad program to eliminate specific shortcomings and
weaknesses identified in different operational areas.
3.   It is against this background that the proposed project includes the following three
components for which an economic analysis has been undertaken:



136                                                                 Annex 6.1
(a)   Component 1. Operations Improvement Plan (OIP). Technical Assistance
to* strengthen institutional and financial capacity of public transport
operators and to implement an operations improvement, plan (OIP). The
OIP includes preparation of optimal routing plans, driving training and
control, vehicle maintenance practices, services standards, service
monitoring, and bus and trolleybus terminal management;
(b)   Component 2. Maintenance and Rehabilitation. Upgrading maintenance
facilities and equipment, rehabilitation and refurbishment of dieselbus,
trolleybus, and mini bus facilities. This includes procurement of parts
needed for major repairs and rehabilitation, spare parts and tires, and tools
and equipment for garages. The purpose of these investments would be to
provide the spare parts necessary to put back into operation the vehicle
fleet currently out of service and augment the capacity of garages to
provide periodic maintenance; and
(c)   Component 3. Purchase of New Buses. Purchase of new diesel and
trolleybuses to improve service delivery, extend transport services to
currently unserved outlying areas, and set in place new procurement
procedures as established by Bank guidelines to ensure efficient delivery
of vehicles in future.
4.    Methodology. The economic benefits resulting from investments in each of the
three modes (dieselbus, trolleybus, and minibus) are determined by comparing the "with"
case with the "without" case. The benefits have been calculated for: (a) investments in all
three components for each of the modes; and (b) investments in OIP and maintenance and
rehabilitation program (excluding capital cost of new purchases). The "without" project
case reflects the strategy that in the future unserviceable buses will be promptly replaced
by Government on an annual basis, a strategy that Government has been following in the
past few years. A major difference in the "without" case would be that Government
would continue to make sub-optimal purchases of new vehicle fleet based on its ability to
barter vehicles for natural gas or petroleum products.  As a result, serviceability of
vehicles would continue to be low. In addition, in the "without" case, vehicle
availability would be low becasues of poor operational practices, fragmented institutional
responsibilities, weak fiscal base, and inadequate maintenance. In the "with" case,
because of institutional reforms, implementation of OIP, rehabilitation of vehicles, and
emphasis on cost recovery, it would be possible to improve serviceability ratio and
operating environment, resulting in availability of a larger vehicle fleet on any day
operating efficiently, which would result in improved speed, lower waiting time, and
better access for all residents of the city. The proposed project would rehabilitate a large
number of existing bus fleet, improving their operating life from existing five to six years
to about twelve years. The benefits would translate into time savings for the commuting
public and evolve a mode choice in favor of public transport. The cost to make this
possible would include: technical assistance; investments in spare parts, workshop, tools

and equipment; incremental operating cost; and investments in purchase of additional
vehicles.

1.    Data and Assumptions.  Estimates of passenger demand in Ashghabat by
different transport modes are obtained from household survey and on-board user surveys,
conducted as part of the Social Assessment. Estimates of service characteristics, vehicle
inventory and replacement and maintenance schedule have been obtained from the
respective operating agencies.    The key assumptions made in the computation of
economic benefits are:
*  Operating ratio.  The current operating ratio for dieselbuses is 55%; for
trolleybuses is 70%; and for mini buses is 70%. The investments under the
project would improve operating ratio for dieselbuses to 85%; for
trolleybuses to 90%; and for mini buses to 85%.
*   Vehicle Rehabilitation. The project will include rehabilitation of 81 buses, 34
trolleybuses, and 33 minibuses. The Bank loan will finance the spare parts
for the rehabilitation of 60 Ikarus buses (US$1.5 million, at an average cost of
US$25,000 per bus) and 34 trolley buses (US$1.02 million, at an average
cost of US$30,000 per trolleybus). For minibuses, the Bank loan will finance
spare parts for (a) a program of modification for 101 Iveco minibuses
(US$.27 million, at an average cost of US$2,700 per bus) to increase their



138                                                                 Annex 6.1
operational life to nine years, and (b) rehabilitation of 33 minibuses (US$.33
million, at an average cost of US$10,000 per bus). The Government will
finance for the rehabilitation of 21 Laz buses (US$0.32 million, at an average
cost of US$15,000 per bus) and for labor and utilities costs of US$0.19
million
*  Service Life. Average service life for a dieselbus and trolleybus is expected
to increase to 12 years from the present six years, and for minibus to nine
years;
*  Vehicle Price. The project includes purchase of 52 twelve meter diesel buses
(at an estimated cost of US$120,000 per bus), 10 dual fuel buses (at an
estimated cost of US$135,000 per bus), and 40 twelve meter trolleybuses (at
an estimated cost of US$160,000 per trolleybus);
*  Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC).   VOC per vehicle-km is computed by
assuming fuel efficiency of 3km/lt without, increasing to 4km/It with the
project (at a cost of US$.10 per It); tire life of 50,000 km; veh-km/day at 190
km without and 205 km with the project.
*  Travel Demand Passenger travel demand for dieselbus in 1996 is 80 million
trips; for trolleybus 25 million trips; and for mini bus 16 million trips.
*   Value of Time. Value of time has been calculated at 35 percent of average
salary of US$700.
* Travel Demand Growth. Travel demand is expected to grow at 8 percent per
annum in the medium term.
e  Service Characteristics. The implementation of OIP is expected to increase
travel speed from existing 16kph to 20kph, increase frequency from 3.0 to 4.0
during peak periods. Average trip length is 5.2 km and assumed to remain
the same in future.
N NPV Calculations. The NPV is computed at 12% rate of return.
Project Costs. The project costs include: (a) technical assistance. The technical
assistance component, at an estimated cost of US$1.8 million (including US$0.3 million
for the establishment of Project Management Group), will help implement OIP, assist
PMG with the implementation of the project and the procurement of goods and services,
assist APAPO with the introduction of improved systems and practices for management
of all aspects of urban transport operations in the participating cities, and assist municipal
government and Ministry of Road Transport to further reforms in the urban transport
sector . The economic analysis for each of the three modes is based on the assumption
that about 70 percent of the TA is for dieselbuses and 15 percent each for trolleybuses
and minibuses. (b) Maintenance and Rehabilitation. The base cost of this component
includes: US$1.6 million for equipment, tools and parts to rehabilitate 81 buses, US$1.1
million to rehabilitate 34 trolleybuses, and US$0.6 million to rehabilitate 33 minibuses;
US$2.1 million for spare parts, workshop, computers and other tools and equipment for
diesel buses, US$1.8 million for trolley buses, and US$1.1 million for minibuses. In
addition US$2.0 million is estimated for implementing OIP which would include
improving vehicle monitoring and fare collection system. (c) incremental operating cost.



Annex 6.1                                                                 139
The cost of oprerating additional vehicle fleet with the project is estimated at US$1.0
million. The calculation of incremental operating cost includes power costs, tire costs,
and maintainence cost. (d) purchase of new buses. The project includes the purchase of
52 twelve meter diesel buses and 10 dual fuel buses (US$7.6 million) and 40 twelve
meter trolleybuses (US$6.4 million).
5.    Benefits and Returns. The benefits of the proposed investments are computed in
terms of savings in trip time resulting from higher speed, lower waiting times, improved
headways, and easier access to public transport because of the availability of a greater
number of vehicles operating at higher efficiency as compared to without project case.
Table below shows the economic rate of return for each of the three modes (both with and
without investments in purchase of new fleet). Tables 1 to 3 provide details on
computation of economic return. On average, without the project, there would be 135
dieselbuses, 59 trolleybuses, and 80 minibuses available for service on any particular day;
in contrast, because of policy reforms and improved operating and service environment,
the vehicles available with the project would increase to: 208 dieselbuses, 76
trolleybuses, and 114 minibuses. As a result of availability of a greater number of
vehicles, it would be possible to improve performance on existing routes as well as
extend service to currently unserved areas, which are predominantly occupied by lower
income groups. The rate of return is computed for two cases for each of the three modes:
(a) the total investments in the public transport system, including purchase of new
vehicles; and (b) investments for each enterprise, excluding capital cost of new purchases.
The costs here include the investments required to prepare and implement OIP (including
technical assistance), build up an inventory of spare parts, and for rehabilitation of
vehicles.
6.    The rate of return for the project (including purchase of new vehicle fleet) is
considerable, although, as expected, the returns increase significantly when the capital
cost of new vehicles is excluded. The returns from implementation of OIP, technical
assistance, and rehabilitation of vehicles (extending vehicle life from existing six years to
twelve year) exceed 50 percent. However, eventually new equipment will have to be
purchased. The most significant benefit of new vehicles is the inducement it has given
the Government to undertake key reforms in urban transport, the benefit of which will
extend far longer than the life of the project.

7.    Switching Value Analysis. The swithching value for each of the significant
variables is the value at which the project's NPV becomes zero (or the IRR equals the
discount rate). Switching values are computed as the percentage change in the value of
the variable needed to turn the Project's NPV equal to zero and help identify the variables
which most affect project outcomes. The switching values of the relatively more
important variables are presented in order of declining sensitivity in table below.
Table: Presentation of Switching Values
Variable                                    Switching Value
Non-availability of spare parts and
inadequate maintenance beyond project life        -15%
Delay in implementation of OIP                    -25%
Cost of new vehicle fleet                          30%
Per capita income                                 -35%
Growth in passenger demand                        -70%
8.    The most critical variable in this project is that institutional and cost recovery
reforms will not be implemented as promised. If these reforms are not implemented,
availability rates of new buses would again start declining beyond two years because of
the lack of spare parts and fleet replacement, and spare parts would once again decline
because of the aging fleet--a decrease by more than 15 percent in the availability of
resources for spare parts and maintenance beyond the initial two years will make the NPV
negative, if other things remain as expected.  The next critical variable is the timely
implementation of OIP. A delay in implementation of OIP sufficient to reduce vehicle
availability by more than 25 percent will make the NPV negative. The analysis also
indicates that the assumed annual eight percent growth in passenger demand is not critical
to the success of the project--even if annual demand grows by two-and-a-half percent, the
investments will yield positive return. The per capita income would have to decrease by
more than 35 percent for the savings in time to be exceeded by the proposed size of
investments.
9.    Other Benefits. The project will result in a number of other benefits, difficult to
quantify. First, improvement in institutional arrangements will enhance efficiency of
public transport enterprises in providing transport services. Second, the project, through
improved cost recovery, will reduce subsidies to public transport enterprise, which at

present pose a severe burden on city finances. Third, the project puts in place rational
procurement policies and procedures for acquisition of new buses and spare parts.
Fourth, the project supports the creation of an enabling environment for active
participation by the private sector. Fifth, improved public transport services would
enhance access to job opportunities for all residents, but especially for low-income
residents in the outlying districts, and therefore would result in improving living
conditions for the population. Sixth, improved operational practices, better scheduling
and routing would encourage a more balanced modal shift.
