POlWJER TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
SUVIARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Governnent of India (GOI) has requested financial assistance
frt,m IDA for the purchase of equipment and materials for some of the trans-
mission and distribution schemes in the IVth Five-Year Plan (FY 1970-74).
An amount of US$75 million has been proposed. The Project consists of
a number of transmission line and substation sub-projects, each forming
a part of the developmetut programs being undertsaken by nine of the
fifteen State Electricity Boards (SEB3s). The Borrower would be the
Goverrnment of India<, The beneficiaries would be the nine SEBs.
ii.       The Bank has made eight loans to India for power projects,
amounting to US$155 million, net of cancellation, and IDA has made four
credits totalling US$77 million, net of cancellation0  Only one of these
loans (416-IN) was for transmission and distribution,
iii.      The power sector of the Indian economy is large and is grow-
ing fast. The development plans prepared by SEBs, as embodied in the
Four th Plan transmission and distribution programs, are considered sound
and necessary to enable optimum use to be made of existing generating
facilities and those under construction. By improving the transmission
and distribution systems and interconnecting the grid systems of the
various SEBs it is expected that generating plant can be utilized more
effectively than it now is, and that the rate of installatinn of new
generating plant can be held below the rate of increase of demand in
the next few years. The project pilays an important part in this processo
iv.       The total investment program for power in the Fourth F an is
US$3,200 million of which 70% has been allocated to the nine SEBts.
The SEB's will invest roughly 5010 o-n generation, 30% on transmission
and distribution and the balance on rural electrificatiGn.  The proposed
Credit is about 10 percent of investment by the nine SEBts on transmis-
sion and distribution over the five year plan period3
V.        In the previous transmission project, Loan 416-IN, most items
of equipment which could be manufactured in India were reserved for
Indian suppliers. This practice resulted not only in higher capital
costs but also in substantial delays because the GOI spent much time
deciding which equipment should be procured in India rather than imported-
IDA has proposed, and the GOI has agreed) that the procurement of towers,
line conductors and groundwire, insulators and all major substation eqluip-
ment required for the Project, would be by international competitive
bidding. In evaluating bids, Indian manufacturers would be granted a
margin of preference of 15%. The proposed credit would finance the c.i0.'.
cost of goods procured abroad or 100% of the ex-factory cost of goods
procured locally.






- ii -
vi.       Loan 416-IN included a rate of return covenant which gave
effect to an earlier governmental committee recommendation that rates
of return should be the basis of assessing performance. At the time
of Loan 416-IN, the financial position of many of the SEB's was unsatis-
factory. Performance since then has varied between SEB s but in general
there has been a definite improvement even though the original targets
set for rates of retvrn have not been achieved.
vii.      Notwithstanding the improvement noted, the financial position
of the SEBs are generally unsatisfactory because of inadequacies in the
institutional arrangements including lack of a clear tariff policy and
the large investment made in low-yielding rural electrification. A
start win1 be made in this Credit on a solution to such institutional
problems, as noted in viii. and ixs below.
viii.     GOI has confirmed that, in accordance with an informal under-
standing reached during appraisal, it will provide financial data for
each SEB in which rural electrification will be separated from other
activities. It will then be possible to study the impact of rural
electrification on the finances of SEBs, and to identify the problems
relating to tariffs, subsidies, capital financing arid capital structure.
ix.       The gradual financial improvements introduced by the conditions
of Loan b16-IN should continue. However, the SEBs have not, in the past,
been able to pay interest on the loans made to them by their State
Governments, and in some cases have incurred additional loans to pay the
interest due. Assurances have been received during negotiations that GOT
will discuss with the SEBs and the State Governments the disposition of
these liabilities, and will put forward proposals regarding their
treatment.
x.        The proposed credit is considered as the first in a series
of credits for power proposed in the Associationts five-year
lending program which would have the objective of expanding and improv-
ing the power system and of achieving, over the long term, institutional
improvements, particularly of the financial systems under which the
SEBs operate. The proposed credit is necessary for the efficient
expansion of the transmission system and would provide very important
first steps in the process of sectoral reform. The project is a
suitable basis for a Credit of US$75 million.






INDIA
POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has requested assistance from
the International Development Association (IDA) in purchasing equipment
and materials for the development of power transmission and distribution
within the I7th Five-Year Plan (FY 1970-74). J n cin&uunt of US$75 million
has been proposed.  The Project consists of a number of transmission line
and substation sub-projects, which together form only a part of the
transmission and distribution programs being undertaken by the State
Electricity Boards (SEBs) during the period of the IVth Plan.  These
sub-projects are in the areas of nine of the fifteen SEBs in India, and
the nine SEBs named in paragraph 3.01 would thus be the beneficiaries of
the Credit.
1.02      The Bank has made eight loans to India for power projects,
amounting to US$155 million, net of cancellations, and IDA has made
four development Credits totalling US$77 tillion, net of cancellations.
With the exception of Loan 416-IN, (Power Transmission Project I) and
Credit 89-IN (constructional equipment and services required to develop
hydroelectric power from the Beas River) all the other loans and credits
were for the construction of generating plants.
1.03      Loan 416-IN (Power Transmission Project I) made in 1965
involved all 15 SEBs. It had two important objectives. The first was
to finance high-voltage transmission facilities which would complete the
interconnection of the networks within each of the States, and provide
the first steps towards interconnection between the State systems.
The second was to improve the earnings of SEBs, bring about uniformity
of acco-unting, and introduce commercial consciousness. All fifteen
SEBs and their respective State Governments gave undertakings to GOI
which stated that each SEB would achieve a rate-of-return performance
target of 11% by a certain year in the period between FY 1969 and
FY 1976.
1.04      These rate of return targets were set before detailed financial
forecasts had been made and were unrealistic in a number of respects,
particularly in overestimating the growth of sales. Moreover, actual
performance suffered from the effects of severe droughts, industrial
recessions, delays in completing new plant, the war with Pakistan, and
increases in costs because of devaluation, higher wzages and fuel prices.
The SEBs have, therefore, been unable to meet them. Because the financial
targets were unrealistic, the Bank agreed, after reviewing the SEBs'






- 2 -
finances in 1969, that the undertakings should be modified (a) to reduce
the rate base by excluding works in progress, and replacing end-of-year
plant values by the average values, and (b) to extend the time allowed
for the SEBs to achieve their 11% target to a given year for each SEB
in the period FY 1973 to FY 1977. Annex 1 sets out the revised rate-
of-return targets, including interim targets, and the forecast returns
of those nine SEBs which are beneficiaries under the Credit now proposed.
While these rates of return would be more meaningful if they were based
on current rather than historical values of the assets the question is
left in abeyance to concentrate on more important problems. As the
target returns have not been fully achieved, the GOI has agreed that
the undertakings given in connection with Loan 416-IN by the nine
SEBs, which are beneficiaries under this Credit, will be maintained.
1.05      Apart from these difficulties, considerable time was lost in
specifying the items to be financed out of the proceeds of Loan 416-IN
and in submitting them for Bank approval, and in deciding which equip-
ment should be procured in India rather than imported.  Similar delay
is not expected with the Project appraised in this report, because the
sub-projects have been more clearly defined and the procedure proposed
for procurement will enable contracts to be awarded promptly.
1.06      An earlier project was appraised late in 1969 but the processing
of the credit was deferred while the Association was reviewing policy on
domestic preference and while GOI was considering international bidding
as well as IDA coneern about the more effective management of the SEB's.
The credit now proposed is visualized as the first of a series of similar
credits which seek to obtain institutional improvements gradually.
Its purpose is to induce the first steps along this path, by collating
financial data as a basis for consideration of the problems discussed
in Chapter 14, and to lead to complementary improvements by exposing
Indian manufacturers to the pressure of international competition
(Chapter 5).
1.07      This report is based on information obtained by Messrs. J. Beach
and S.S. Scales following discussions with officials of the Central Govern-
ment and the SEBs concerned during missions to India in November/December
1969 and December 1970.

2. THE PCiWER SECTOR
The Indian Electricity Supply Industry
2.01      Under the Constitution of India both Central (GOI) and State
Governments may legislate on the subject of electricity. The power
sector of the Indian economy is institutionally complex since several
agencies at the national level, Regional Boards, State Governments and
SEBs all play a part. IDA's influence on the sector is limited because
it can be exerted only through the GOI. Borrowings such as the proposed
Credit form part of the overall finance available to the GOI for its
annual budget, which includes loans to the State Governments. The
budgets of the State Governments include loans to the respective SEBs
for their development schemes. This pattern of lending is a substitute
for the relending of the credit by GOI to the State Governments and to the
SEBs. Thus the role of an IDA credit is marginal at the level of the SEBs.
2.02      The Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 with its various amendments
controls the structure of the sector, and the operation of the following
bodies:
(i)  Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is a statutory authority
responsible directly to the GOI for national power policy,
as arbitrator between State Governments or SEBs and licensees,
and generally to coordinate and investigate the best use of
power resources;
(ii)  Central Water and Power Commission (WCP) is a technical arm of
the I4inistry of Irrigation and Power of the GOI, to which
CEA has delegated its technical functions.
CWPC is charged with the responsibility for planning, coordinat-
ion,design and construction, in consultation with the State
Governments concerned, of schemes for power generation and for
the utilization of water resources throughout the country;
(iii)  State Electricity Boards (SBs) are responsible within States
for electricity supply i.e. generation, transmission, distribu-
tion, sales and new installations.
The Act also lays down rules for licensees, setting ra;es for power sales,
interstate agreements for the exchange of power, and for the financial
operation of the various authorities.






- 4 -
2.03      The SEBs, together with plant owned by the State Governments
and certain corporations owned by the GOI (Damodar Valley Corporation,
Neyvelli Lignite Corporation and the Atomic Energy Commission) are
responsible for about 85% of the energy generated in India. Private
licensees and captive industrial plant account for the remainder.
Private licensees will decline in importance as time passes because of
restrictions in the Act, their services being replaced by the SEBs.
Development of Integrated Regional Systems
2.04      Fully-integrated operation within each SEB systen will soon
be achieved following the progress made with power transmission schemes
during the Third Plan (1962-1966) and later. However, integrated opera-
tion on a regional basis with the ultimate objective of operating as a
national system, is only just beginning.  The advantages of national
integration would be substantial. Interconnected systems require less
generating capacity due to diversity amongst daily peak demands, larger
and more efficient generating units and higher-voltage transmission lines
can be installed, and thermal and hydro-electric generating plants can
be operated more economically in combination.
2.05      In 1962 and early 1963, a committee consisting of represent-
atives of the SEMs and policy-making organizations in the power sector
recommended the integration of the State systems into regional systems.
Five Regional Boards (see HIap) were accordingly set up by the GOI at
various times between Aay 1964 and February 1966. These Regional Boards
have not been effective instruments of regional integration because they
are purely advisory in character: they possess neither legal nor finan-
cial status and their decisions have to be imp1emented through the actions
of the individual SEBs, which continue to have responsibility for genera-
tion, transmission and distribution within the States. Certain SEBs
have been reluctant to operate their plant in a manner which, while
advantageous to the region as a whole, might be detrimental to their
own financial results.
2.06      If t1iere is to be effective regional integration, legislation
will be required to give the Regional Boards power to own and operate
generating stations and major transmission lines. Only then would a
Regional Board be able to determine how the power stations within its
region would share the load, and to ensure that the larger nuclear and
conventional thermal stations were operated at the high plant factors
for which they were designed. SEBs would be left with responsibility
only for the distribution and sale of electricity, which they would
purchase from the Regional Boards. Reorganization on the basis outlined
above would take time, but the steps being taken by the GOI and the
SEBs in constructing inter-State and inter-Regional ties, building
and equipping State and Regional system control and load despatch
stations and setting up load despatch training establishments, are all
moves in the right direction.

Growth of the Sector
2.07      Since the introduction of the Act in 19h8 and the beginning of
properly planned development, rapid expansion has been a continuing
characteristic of the power sector. The table gives an indication of
the rapid growth and large scale of the sector.

It is currently planned to expand the present installed capacity of 15.5
million kW to 22 million kW by the end of 1973/74.
2.08      The figures in the table above give an idea of the magnitude
of the program of rural electrification which the GOI has been carrying
out in recent years. This program has had a significant effect on the
economy of the power sector; this subject is discussed in Chapter 4.
2,09      About 70% of total energy production is utilized in the
industrial sector, 11% in the domestic sector, 7% in the agricultural
sector and the remainder in other sectors. Tnis pattern of utilization
is expected to continue generally, although the percentage for agriculture
is likely to increase slightly.

3. THE BENEFICIARIES
3.01      The Beneficiaries of the proposed credit would be the nine State
Electricity Boards of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra,
Pumjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and lWest Bengal.
3.02      SEBs are corporate bodies, charged, according to the 1948 Act,
"with the general duties of promoting the coordinated development of the
generation, supply and distribution of electricity within the State". SEBs
are able to carry on their day-to-day operations with relative independence,
but possess little financial autonomy because tariffs, annual operating and
capital budgets, planning of capital development and the raising of loans,
are controlled by the State Governments.
3.03      Under the provisions of the 1948 Act, an SEB consists of three to
seven members appointed by the State Government. One member must have experi-
ence in commercial matters and administration, a second in electrical engineer-
ing, and a third in accounting and financial matters, preferably in a public
utility undertaking. One of these three members is appointed chairman. The
remaining members usually serve part-time and are either government officers
or represent for example, trade unions, commerce or industry.  Tenure of office
varies between different states; chairmen have been appointed for one to five
years but with no certainty of continuing in office for the whole term.
In some cases senior staff have been seconded by Government to the SEBs; this
practice is unsatisfactory because seconded staff have loyalties outside the
SEBs on which they serve and the career prospects of the SEBst own staff
are affected adversely. Despite these shortcomings, the SEBs have competent
technical staff who are fully capable of designing and constructing the
transmission lines included in the project (paragraphs 5.1O and 5.1l).
Nevertheless, as a Condition of Effectiveness the Borrower has agreed to
obtain from each SEB and the Bhakra Management Boarcin undertaking, satis-
factory to the Association, regarding the manner in which their respective
parts of the Project will be executed.
3.o4      The gradual improvement in SEBst earnings will continue if the
target returns required by Loan 416-IN continue to be achieved. The proposed
Credit will permit progress towards institutional reform. By requiring that
the financial data discussed in Chapter 4 be developed, an important and
necessary step would be taken in what is seen as a long evolutionary process.
3.05      A comparison of the scale of activities of the nine SEBs compared
with the power sector as a whole is given by the following statistics:

4. FITANCIAL SITUATION
4.01      The Electricity Supply Act 1948 requires that SEBs should not be
run at a loss, but this requirement is interpreted in a cash sense only before
providing for depreciation. Depreciation is not considered as an annual ex-
pense of doing business which must be provided for in the tariffs, but as
a contribution, subject to revenue being available, to a reserve for the
replacement and renewal of plant or for repayment of certain loans. The
Act gives the SEBs powers to borrow, but places little responsibility on them
for servicing their loans; nor is any obligation placed on State Governments
to ensure that SEBs have tariffs which are adequate to meet these obligations.
Thus the Act fails to give clear guidance on policy for fixing tariffs.
This fact is a major cause of the poor financial position of the SEBs. The
rate-of-return basis of performance established in loan agreement 416-IN
provides a policy which would permit tariffs to be set and maintained to
enable SEBs to earn revenue sufficient to meet all their outgoings properly
chargeable to revenue, if the SEBs were permitted to function under its
provisions and certain anomalies were eliminated. GOI is aware that such
a policy should be incorporated into the Act, but does not wish to focus
undue attention on legislation at the present time which could be counter
productive.
4.02      Since the SEBs were first formed between 1955 and 1960, their
poor financial performance has not permitted most of them to pay the interest
accruing on government loans. The GOI appointed a committee in 1963, chaired
by Shri Venkataraman, then Madras State Minister of Industries, to report on
the tWorking of State Electricity Boards'. Its report, published in 1964,
recommended that SEBs tariffs should be increased gradually over several
years with the object of meeting their operating expenses, and eventually
providing a surplus equivalent to a return of 11%. (See note 3 Annex 1
page 2) This decision was reflected in Bank Loan b16-IN and a gradual
improvement in earnings has resulted. Annex 1 shows the performance achieved
since FY 1967/68 by the nine beneficiary SEBs under the proposed Credit, and
compares their forecast returns with the revised target returns set under the
Loan 416-IN. Gujarat, Haryana, Mlaharashtra and WVest Bengal SEBs should meet
their first interim targets in FY 1970/71, while Andhra Pradesh, Punjab,
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are running about one year late and Bihar two
years late. The SEBs also have had to contend with capital structures
which have been distorted by heavy debt financing, attributable in part
to investment in unremunerative projects such as rural electrification, as
noted below.
Rural Electrification
4.03      Since 1964 the GOIts policy of rural electrification (RE) has had
considerable impact on the SEBst finances, because it has involved the electri-
fication of a large number of irrigation pumps and tubewells. Overall
investment in rural electrification expanded fourfold to the equivalent of
about US$600 million by 1969 and actually accounts for about 20% of the
SEBst gross assets. A further sum of US$410 million equivalent is to be
provided during the Fourth Plan period, 1970-1974. GOI and State Governments

require SEBs to implement the national program of rural electrification
and the State Governments have made large capital loans to SEBs for this
purpose. The SEBs are expected to construct the rural networks over
widely-scattered villages, accept responsibility for ownership, bear
the heavy cost of operation and maintenance, and pay interest on the
loans without suitable tariffs or subsidies in lieu of them. Because
of concessional tariffs, the low density of the system and the large
seasonal fluctuations in energy sold, financial losses are inevitable.
4.04      The financial information presently available to SEBs is not
in a form which can readily identify the size of these losses, nor
reveal the precise effects on the SEBs' finances of the rural electri-
fication investments which they have been obli ; ted to undertake. An
informal understanding was reached during appraisal, that GOI would produce
financial data in respect of each SEB for rural electrification, separated
from the other functions of that SEB. Pro forma income statements,
statements of sources and application of funds, rate bases, and details
of indebtedness, would be prepared both for 'rural electrification'
and for the SEB excluding that aspect. These data would be for FY 1970
and 1971, continuing on a more factual basis from April 1, 1971, the
begimning of FY 1972. Examination of this information should lead to
clear identification of problems relating to: the adequacy of the tariffs;
the rates of return for each function; the need for, and quantification of,
subsidy; the determination of a more realistic provision for debt service;
reconsideration of the capital structure; revenue contributions to capital
outlay; and capital financing of each SEB. During negotiations the GOI
confirmed that it will produce these financial data in respect of each
SEB, and submit them to IDA in accordance with an agreed timetable.
Financial Analysis For The Nine SEBs
4.05      Statements of income, sources and application of funds, and
condensed balance sheets in respect of the nine beneficiary SEBs through
FY 1974 are shown in Annexes 4-12. All nine SEBs show steady growth,
and a gradual improvement in earnings towards the required minimum target
returns (Annex 1). Inadequate tariffs in the past and the revenue
deficiencies resulting therefrom are reflected in some of the balance
sheets in the following items:
(a)  arrears of unpaid interest by some SEBs, varying in amount up
to the equivalent of two years' revenue;
(b) the size of the long-term debt of some SEBs which exceeds the
total fixed assets. This situation has arisen because:






- 9 -
(i) repayments of government loans have not normally
been made; and,
(ii) certain SEBs which were not permitted by their State
Governments to accumulate unpaid interest on govern-
ment loans, have had to fund unpaid interest through
subsequent government loans.
4.06      Since Loan 416-IN was made in L965 the financial performance
of SEBs has been under constant review by the Central WMater and Power
Commission which has maintained pressure on State Governments to
approve higher tariffs. The higher revenues, despite higher operat-
ing costs, currently allow the nine beneficiary SEBs to meet operating
expenses, and interest.  The higher tariffs however, have not been
formulated on a cost-related basis; for example there are concessional
rates to agriculture and, in several States, very low rates to power-
intensive industries which, in some cases, are less than cost. The
financial data referred to in para. 4.04 should clarify the extent to
which revenue from rural electrification consumers is presently being
subsidized by other SEB consumers. The rates applicable to power
intensive industries will require separate consideration.
4.07      The :1ssociation had previcusly raised informally the possibilities
that State Governments should cancel:
(a) their claims to arrears of unpaid interest;
(b) loans raised to meet the unpaid interest on previous loans.
These liabilities have arisen because State Government approved rates
have not, in the past, provided for SEBs annual interest liability on
State Government loans. It is therefore considered unrealistic for
State Governments to rely upon these unpaid interest liabilities as
sources of revenue to them. Cancellation of the unpaid interest would
permit SEBs to apply any revenue surpluses after meeting operating
expenses and current debt services, towards financing construction.
Assuming the accumulation of unpaid interest is not cancelled, any
revenue surplus would be diverted to paying the interest arrears,
instead of financing construction with no incentive to SEBs to reduc-
ing their borrowings and consequential debt service liability thereon.
However, there may be problems with regard to the GOI income tax
requirements which require to be studied. The GOI has agreed to con-
sult with the State Governments and SEBs concerned the disposition of
these liabilities, and to keep the Association informed of the result
of such consultations and, in any event, to submit a progress report
not later than December 31, 1971 and thereafter at six month intervals.

5. THE  PROJECT
5.01      The Project consists of about 4500 circuit km of transmission
lines operating at voltages between 66 kV and 220 kV, and about 110
substations with an aggregate capacity of about 3500 MVA. The indi-
vidual transmission lines and substations (Annex 3), which together
form the Project, and which the proposed Credit would help to finance
are being constructed by the nine SEBs as part of their IVth Plan
development programs. They were selected in collaboration with the
technical experts of the CWPC and the SEBs concerned. Selection
was determined from an examination of construction programs and a
review of commissioning targets. Diagrams 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the
Map indicate the extent of the present grid systems and the extensions
proposed, including those which this Credit would help to finance.
Estimated Costs of Equipment and Materials
5.02      The estimated costs of equipment and materials required for
the Project are shown briefly in the following table, and are set out
more fully in Annexes 2 and 3. Annex 3 also gives details of projects
agreed with each SEB.

5.03      These estimates, which have been prepared by the various SEBs
in consultation with the CWPC, have generally been based on ex-factory
prices for similar transmission line materials and substation equip-
ment manufactured in India. Since it is probable, however, that the
exposure of Indian manufacturers of this type of equipment to inter-
national competitive bidding will result in some reduction in prices,
the estimates include some allowance for this factor.
5.04      Investment by the SEBs in the sub-projects for which the above
equipment and materials are required represents only a part of the total
investment in transmission and distribution which each SEB is proposing
to make during the IVth Plan.  The table below shows,  for each SEB,
the estimated cost of equipment for the sub-projects which the proposed
Credit will help to finance and the estimated total costs of these sub-
projects, including the cost of local civil engineering works and
engineering design.

1/  The Bhakra Management Board is responsible for the design, procurement,
installation, erection and commissioning of the transmission lines
(220 kV and above) being constructed to convey Beas power to the
States of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. The allocation to Bhakra/
Beas for equipment and materials will eventually be apportioned
between these three State Electricity Boards.

5eO5      The proposed Credit of US$75 million would be available to cover:
(a) the c.i.f. cost of substation equipment and transmission
line materials procured abroad;
(b) the ex-factory cost, free of taxes, of substation equip-
ment and transmission line materials procured in India
after international competitive bidding and the applica-
tion of a domestic preference of 15% (see paragraph 5.07).
So far as the SEBs are concerned, the Credit would not add to their
resources. The costs of their individual transmission programs are
already provided partly by loans from the State Governments. The main
advantage to them would be a reduction in cost from international
competition.
Procurement
5.06      Procurement of towers, line conductors, insulators and major
substation equipment required for the Project would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Indian manufacturers would be
expected to participate freely in such bidding, and would be granted
a margin of preference of 15%. For this purpose the landed price, before
customs duty, of the foreign bids plus the domestic preference of 15%
plus the cost of inland freight to site would be compared with the
delivered-to-site price of the domestic bids. There is little past
experience on which to base an estimate of the proportion of the bids
which would be won by Indian manufacturers. A possible range would be
50%-75¢. Since the foreign exchange component of locally manufactured
equipment would be, on the average, about 30% (see paragraph s.o8 and
Annex 2), the total foreign exchange financing from the Credit for the
range assumed would be $5O-$36 million.
5.07      With the exception of 400 kV substation equipment and line
accessories (none of which is included in the Project) the greater part
of the equipment and materials for the IVth Plan can be met from local
sources, although, generally delivery would take longer.  It is estimated
that, based on ex-factory costs, the foreign exchange required for various
types of equipment to be procured in India is as follows:
(i)  Aluminum conductors          55% (assuming that aluminum
would have to be imported)
(ii)  Steel towers                 10% (the cost of zinc required
for galvanizing)
(iii)  Power transformers           45% (copper and electrical-
grade magnetic steel)






- 13 -
(iv) Switchgear including
voltage and current
transformers                20%) (principally parts
(v)  Shunt capacitors             20%) not yet manufactured
(vi)  Power line carrier              ) in India)
cormunication equipment     20%)
5.08      There were many procurement delays on Power Transmission Project
(Loan 416-IN) because GOI spent much time deciding which equipment should
be procured within India rather than imported. For the proposed Credit,
assurances have been obtained from the GOI that when, after international
competitive bidding and the application of preferences in the manner describ-
ed above, the lowest bidder is a foreign manufacturer, permission to import
will be forthcoming immediately and no reviews by the Directorate General
of Technical Development, or any other agency of the Central Government
will be made.
5.09      Although the proceeds of the Credit should be committed fairly
quickly, commissioning of the lines and substations and final disbursement
are likely to take three years or more. In order to eliminate initial
delays, no withdrawal shall be made from the Credit Account with respect
to contracts for goods and services which are awarded more than eighteen
months after the signing of the Credit Agreement.
Engineering and Construction
5.10      Detailed planning, design and the preparation of tender docu-
ments are undertaken by the technical staff of the SEBs which have gained
satisfactory technical competence. Consulting engineers are not normally
employed for transmission design at 220 kV and below.
5.11      Because of their fairly heavy programs of construction, many
of the SEBs have built up competent constructional departments which
would construct some of the sub-projects. There are, however, in Indias
a number of experienced contracting firms which would also be employed.
Disbursements would not be made from the Credit to cover local erection
costs.
Disbursements
5.12      Disbursements from the Credit would be made as described in
paragraph 5.06 against expenditures incurred, both foreign and local,
for contracts awarded in the manner described in paragraph 5.07.
Expenditure prior to signing the Credit Agreement would not be reimburs-
ed. Any undisbursed amount of the Credit would be cancelled unless there
were good grounds for applying it to additional transmission line and
substation works. It is estimated that the credit will be drawn down
in the manner shown in Annex 13.

6. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
6.0o      Rapid growth has been the characteristic feature of the power
sector of the Indian economy for many years, and all the indications
confirm that it will continue. On the basis of all-India statistics,
installed capacity and units generated have increased at an average rate
of about 11% and 12% per annum respectively over the last nineteen years.
Current forecasts envisage that both demand and orfl  generation will
grow at a rate of about 13% per annum during the course of the next
four years.
6.02      Reference to paragraph 2.07 however, shows that it is planned
to increase installed capacity from 15.5 million kW (M4arch 1970) to
22 million kW -f by the end of FY 1974., an increase of only about 9%
per annum. It is expected, however, that as individual SEB transmission
systems grow and interconnection between systems becomes more widespread,
more effective utilization of installed generating plant will be achieved,
principally by pooling reserve capacity presently held by the individual
SEB systems. The Project would make a significant contribution to the
growth of the networks of state and national transmission, and would
assist therefore, in holding the rate of installation of new plant down
to the 9% quoted above. The Project is thus an essential element in
the growth of a complex national power system. Existing generating
plant together with that which is under construction, is expected to
meet the demands forecast provided that the transmission projects
included in the IVth Plan have been constructed and commissioned, thus
permitting the interstate power flows which will be necessary.
6.03      Growth rates for individual SEBs will, of course, vary from the
all-India averages. For the nine beneficiary SEBs, actual and forecast
system demands and rates of growth are indicated in the table below.
The high rate of growth in the recent past for Rajasthan is due mainly
to the incidence of industrial demand and tubewell irrigation. The low
rate of growth in Haryana/Punjab between 1963/64 and 1969/70 is attribu-
table in part to the effect of Indo-Pakistan War while the low growth
in Maharashtra stems from the industrial recession which affected this
State more than most of the others. Finally, the comparatively low rate
projected for Bengal is a reflection of the industrial slow down arising
from the problems facing the jute industry and from the effects of politi-
cal unrest.
1/ The corresponding estimate of maximum demand is 18 million kW.

Estimates of Growth
6.o4      Estimates of load growth, normally covering a period of five
years, are prepared by the technical staff of the SEBs and are closely
scrutinized by planning experts of the CWPC. Estimates are updated
annually. Historic loads and sales are the basis for extrapolating
"normal growth"; loads from new industries are added if they are likely
to have a significant impact on the projections. Estimates of these
loads are based on actual applications for supply or estimates which are
submitted by industrial consumers, and checked with the Department which
is responsible for issuing licenses for new industries. The method is
satisfactory. Demand has been below the estimates in recent years
because of the general recession in the years 1966 and 1967, but follow-
ing a considerable improvement in the Indian economy, the forecast demands
and energy requirements are likely to materialize.
Control of Planning
6.05      Most power schemes included  in the lVth Plan were initiated
by the SEBs in consultation with the State Governments. These schemes
have been reviewed by the Regional Boards, and further scrutinized by
the CWPC (in its capacity as technical advisor to the CEA), to ensuLre
that plans for power development throughout the country are properly
coordinated. Programs approved by the CWPC have been further reviewed
in detail by Working Groups of the GOI's Planning Commission in relation
to the financial resources and priorities of the national economy.
1/ Figures given for demand are totals for the States including
SEBs, municipalities and other licensees.






- 16 -
6.06      In addition to the general technical appraisal of proposals
for system expansion, system-analyzing studies have been conducted,
under the direction of the CWPC, to ensure that proposed transmission
lines will be of suitable capacity and that electrical stability of
the interconnected system will be maintained. These studies are
updated at frequent intervals.
6.07      The development plans prepared by SEBs as embodied in the
IVth Plan Transmission Program are accordingly considered to be technically
and economically sound. The Project is necessary to enable optimum
use to be made of existing generating resources and those now being
built.

7. AGREEIENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the Borrower agreed:
(a)  that the undertakings given in connection with Loan
416-IN by the nine SEBs which are beneficiaries
under this Credit will be maintained (paragraph 1.04).
(b)  that for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1970 and for
each fiscal year thereafter, it will produce financial
data in respect of each SEB separating the information
relating to rural electrification from that relating to
the SEB Is other supply functions and submit such data
to the Association in accordance with an agreed timetable
(paragraph 4.04);
(c)  to consult with State Governments and SEBs the disposition
of:
(i) the unpaid interest on loans from State Governments
to certain SEBs, and
(ii) those portions of such loans which were raised by
other SEBs to meet the unpaid interest on previous
loans from State Governments (paragraph 4.07);
(d) to keep the Association informed of the results of such
consultations and, in any event, to submit a progress
report not later than December 31, 1971 and thereafter
at six month intervals;
(e)  that all procurement will be on the basis of international
competitive bidding and that when, after the application
of a domestic preference of 15% the lowest evaluated
bidder is a foreign manufacturer, permission to import
will be issued promptly and no further reviews by agencies
of the Central Government will be made (paragraph 5.08);
(f)  that no withdrawal shall be made from the Credit Account
with respect to contracts for goods and services which
are awarded more than eighteen months after the signing
of the Credit Agreement (paragraph 5.09).
7.02      In addition to the customary conditions the Borrower has agreed
that the Credit Agreement shall not come into force and effect in respect
of the part of the Credit to be made available to any one of the SEBs and
the Bhakra Mlanagement Board until the Borrower shall have obtained from
such SEB and the Bhakra Mkanagement Board an undertaking, satisfactory to
the Association, regarding the manner in which their respective parts of
the Project will be executed (paragraph 3.03).

INDIA - POWER TRANSMISSION II
Explanation of Annex 1
1. Section A shows the target returns which the several SEBs and their corresponding State Governments have
undertaken to achieve.  The returns are based (where appropriate) on a consolidation of the results of the
SEBs and those of other plant owned by the State Government. Only three SEBs (marked 1/) have targets
which are consolidated.
2. Section B compares the actual and forecast rates of return with the revised target returns in Section A.
Section C shows the actual and forecast rates of return in respect of the working of the three SEBs excluding
the effect of consolidation with other government plant.
3. The target return of 11% (shown in Section A) was made up as follows - interest expense (6%), general reserve
contribution ( ), contribution towards capital construction expenditure (3%), and recovery of electri-
city duty (1 g) for the credit of State Government general revenue.  The return targets of less than 11% and
the forecast returns in Section B exclude reference to the electricity duty.
The rates of return are calculated by expressing operating income for the financial year as a percentage of
the average rate base at the beginning and end of such financial years.
Rate base is equal to a sum of
(i) the gross book value of fixed assets on operation
(ii) the cost of intangible assets; and
(iii) an amount on account of working capital equal to one-sixth (1/6) of the administration and
operating expenses (excluding provision for depreciation) for the fiscal year ending on the
date under consideration.
reduced by
(a)  the amount of accumulated depreciation charged on account of fixed assets in operation;
(b)  the amount contributed by customers for fixed assets in operation; and                                     O 
(c)  the amount of security deposits of consumers.
