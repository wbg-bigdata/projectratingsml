                                                 v
Program Development   The PASS has four objectives:
Objective(s) and      (i) to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health,
Contribution to            nutrition, education) for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of
Country Partnership        the Government‘s CCT program, Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical
Strategy                   actions in health and education;
                      (ii) to improve budget management to support the performance of these social
                           sectors within the CCT program;
                      (iii) to support the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in social
                           sectors; and
                      (iv) to enhance transparency and accountability to users by strengthening the
                           enabling environment for a better informed demand for improved public sector
                           performance in the social domain.

                      The PASS is consistent with the central pillar of the CPS which calls for ―reducing
                      vulnerability while producing results for all.‖ Specifically, it helps preserve and
                      enhance the human assets of the poor (health and education) by supporting a
                      meaningful shift in social policy from social assistance to the protection and
                      promotion of human capital. It also enhances accountability both within Government
                      agencies, and between Government agencies and the public.
Risks and Risk        Macroeconomic risks: The global outlook remains highly uncertain, in light of the
Mitigation            economic woes in Europe and the United States. This could dampen growth
                      prospects for the Dominican Republic through a fall in tourist arrivals, lower
                      commodity prices for mining products, and a collapse in demand for exports. A
                      higher than expected deficit in the electricity sector could potentially affect
                      Government solvency and contribute to a financing gap.
                      Mitigation: Mitigating factors include strong macroeconomic management,
                      including growth in the size and sophistication of the domestic debt market and
                      improved financial and bank supervision. The financial problems in the public
                      electricity sector remain the principal fiscal risk. A fall in international oil prices
                      would help improve the sector’s deficit. In addition, the Government is taking
                      measures to address the financial viability of the public electricity sector, including
                      an increase in tariffs and changes in the management of the distribution companies.
                      The transition from universal electricity and gas subsidies to targeted subsidies
                      (which use the SIUBEN beneficiary database and the CCT program) is also part of
                      the solution to energy-related fiscal constraints.

                      Political/transition risks: The national elections, set for May 2012, could result in
                      shifts in priorities and/or in clientelism in the administration of social programs.
                      Mitigation: Reforms benefit from strong Government and civil society ownership.
                      Many of the reforms themselves are also part of the mitigating strategy, as they aim
                      at institutionalizing key information and management systems, decision-making
                      processes, and roles and rules. The Government is also updating its registry of
                      beneficiaries, which uses a transparent proxy-means test to determine households’
                      eligibility. The Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) will
                      continue to support measures to strengthen the targeting mechanism and ensure that
                      transfers are progressively made against verification of co-responsibilities.

                      Implementation risks: The Government faces capacity constraints and coordination
                      could slow down some reforms. There are also risks of slow execution and

                                                   vi
               procurement for some reforms.
               Mitigation: The capacity constraints are largely mitigated by the Bank’s NLTA as
               well as resources from other Bank and IADB operations. Risks of lack of
               coordination have been mitigated by: (i) the institutionalization of the CCT
               Intersectoral and Interagency Committees at the central level, and of local level
               pluri-sectoral commissions which address issues at the local level; (ii) reforms to
               budget management processes, with budget requests to meet results targets for the
               CCT program being jointly formulated by the social protection, health and
               education sectors; (iii) the anchoring of the intersectoral coordination of the CCT
               around the tools and management of each sector (e.g. education and health
               Management Information Systems), rather than creating parallel tools and capacity
               within the CCT program management team, and (iv) continued active donor
               coordination efforts by the Bank and the IADB in particular. The Government’s
               commitment to protect programs aimed at bridging supply-gaps is likely to remain
               firm, in part thanks to the institutionalized pluri-annual planning exercise. The
               publication of budget data and the strengthening of civil society’s capacity to
               monitor it are expected to promote budgetary discipline.

               Stakeholder opposition risks: Unions representing teachers or doctors and
               associations of neighborhood shop owners may oppose some interventions.
               Mitigation: Intensive training on the use and usefulness of the information systems
               are expected to mitigate resistance by health and education staff. Also, the
               Government is in the process of scaling up the community scorecards (with a section
               on such mechanisms) and has agreed to let a consumers’ advocacy institution
               supervise such services.

               Natural disasters risks: The Dominican Republic remains vulnerable to multiple
               types of natural disasters, which can affect the poor and have large fiscal impacts.
               Mitigation: The CCT program supported by this operation is a key instrument to
               help the poorest mitigate impacts of shocks on their consumption and human capital.
               At the firm and Government levels, damage to the major private sector enterprises is
               partly covered by their own insurance and the Bank’s assistance covers natural

               PROPOSED THIRD DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
         ON PERFORMANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF SOCIAL SECTORS
                      TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

                                         I.    INTRODUCTION

1.      This document describes the proposed program for a Third Development Policy Loan on
the Performance and Accountability of Social Sectors (PASS) in the Dominican Republic. This
operation is being proposed as the third of a series of three sequential programmatic operations.
Its overall objective is to improve results in social sectors in order to preserve the human capital
of the poorest citizens in the short term and enhance it the medium term. Consistent with this
vision, the PASS has four objectives: (i) enhance the performance of social sectors to promote
human capital for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government‘s
Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program, Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions
in health and education; (ii) improve budget management to support the performance of social
sectors, protect critical social spending and support the required improvements in the supply of
health, nutrition and education services; (iii) support the gradual introduction of performance
agreements in key social sector agencies; and (iv) enhance transparency and oversight in social
sectors.

                                   II.        COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.     The Dominican Republic experienced a significant economic slowdown during the global
economic crisis, but growth quickly recovered. Following a period of high growth averaging 9.5
percent (2005-07), economic activity slowed to 5.3 percent in 2008, decelerating further to 3.5
percent in 2009. However, these rates were still well above the average for Latin America and
the Caribbean. Growth began accelerating again in the third quarter of 2009, and in 2010 the
country experienced one of the highest growth rates in the region, reaching 7.8 percent. Per
capita GNI increased from US$4,330 in 2008 to US$4,880 in 2010.1 The Dominican Republic
remains one of the best economic performers in the region.

3.      The recent growth spurt was fueled by a recovery in consumption. Private sector
consumption, which accounted for 90 percent of GDP in 2010, grew 7.7 percent, while
investment increased by 17.5 percent, driven by higher public capital spending. Exports, which
had fallen 11 percent between 2007 and 2009, began to recover again in 2010. This was in part a
result of the earthquake in Haiti, which increased demand for building materials and food
products from the Dominican Republic.2 Imports fell slightly in 2009 as domestic demand
slowed down and oil prices fell from their 2008 peak, but boomed in 2010 on the back of the
recovery in consumption and higher commodity prices. On the supply side, all main sectors of
the economy experienced an expansion in 2010. Growth was particularly high in commerce

  Even prior to the earthquake, exports to Haiti had been growing, making it the Dominican Republic‘s second
trading partner.

(13.6 percent), financial services (12.5 percent) and construction (11 percent). Local
manufacturing, especially of food products, also registered healthy growth (7.7 percent), driven
by the strong demand for Dominican products following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti.

4.     External factors were also instrumental for the strong economic performance. The fall in
remittances due to the global economic crisis was relatively mild, as expatriate Dominican
workers tend to be employed in the service sector rather than in construction, which was among
the worst hit sectors in the United States. In 2010, remittances remained below their pre-crisis
high, but increases at the end of the year suggest a turnaround. Tourist arrivals began to pick up
again in the third quarter of 2009, and an increasing share of tourists now come from new
markets, including Eastern Europe and South America.

                                                                          2
5.      However, the current account deteriorated sharply in 2010 mainly due to the worsening in
the trade balance. Whereas non-Free Trade Zone exports grew by 49.1 percent in 2010, the
recovery in Free Trade Zones exports was relatively mild (7.5 percent). Total exports thus grew
by 20.3 percent in 2010. The sharp increase in imports pushed the trade balance into a deficit of
16.6 percent of GDP. This was counterbalanced by the recovery in tourism receipts. As a result,
the current account deficit reached 8.5 percent, compared to 5 percent in 2009. Foreign direct
investment (FDI) fell to US$1.6 billion from US$2.2 billion in 2009, with the bulk of it going to
manufacturing, telecommunications, mining and real estate. With the slump in foreign direct
investment, external borrowing increased to finance the current account deficit. Foreign
exchange reserves – while at historically high levels by Dominican standards – remained low by
international standards, reaching 1.9 months of imports.
6.      Inflation began to accelerate in 2010. Following an average increase in the consumer
price index (CPI) of 1.5 percent in 2009, inflation edged up sharply in 2010, to 6.3 percent. This
reflected to a large extent the impact of rising food and oil prices, with core inflation (which
excludes food and fuel prices) remaining at 3.5 percent. Despite the increase, CPI inflation
remained well below the crisis levels of 2008 and within the Central Bank target of 6-7 percent.

7.      The fiscal balance improved in 2010 thanks to the gradual withdrawal of the fiscal
stimulus. The authorities began a fiscal tightening in the second half of 2010 in line with the IMF
Stand-By Agreement. As a result, the overall deficit improved from 3.2 percent in 2009 to 2.7
percent in 2010. This outturn was, however, above the target of 2.5 percent due to two main
factors: (i) weak tax performance, which fell from 14.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to 12.7 percent
in 2010; and (ii) larger than expected transfers to the electricity sector due to high oil prices.

8.      The fiscal expansion did, however, result in a modest increase in the public debt-to-GDP
      3
ratio. According to the Ministry of Finance (MoF), consolidated public sector debt increased
from 33.1 percent in 2007 to 37.4 percent in 2010. However, this share is below previous
projections, which foresaw an increase to 39.8 percent. Domestic debt increased from US$1
billion in 2007 to US$5 billion in 2009 with the issuance of Treasury and Central Bank bonds.4
Whereas private external debt has remained relatively stable, official external debt expanded at
an average of 18 percent in 2008-2010, mainly due to the PetroCaribe agreement with Venezuela
and the injection of funds by multilateral institutions in the context of the global crisis.

9.      There are no signs of stress in the banking system. Non-performing loans have remained
low. Many banks are reporting a rebound in their profitability and the system remains well
capitalized. Moreover, there is still plenty of liquidity in the system due to the banks‘ previous
prudence in credit extension. The cut in reserve requirements translated into a reduction in actual
reserves, but banks continue to maintain large liquidity buffers at the central bank.

  Unless otherwise indicated, public debt refers to gross public debt, i.e. including financial assets held by the
Government. On the other hand, intra-Government debt is subtracted, following the approach used by the
authorities.
4
  The main reason for the increase in domestic debt has been the issuance of bonds in the context of the Central
Bank recapitalization plan. This plan is embedded in law 167-07, adopted following recommendations from the
Technical Commission of the Central Bank, the IMF and other Government bodies. Central Bank bonds (inexistent
prior to the mentioned law) represented US$2.2 billion in 2008-2011.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS

10.     The overall economic outlook for the Dominican Republic remains positive. First quarter
growth in 2011 reached 4.3 percent, indicating a gradual deceleration with the end of the fiscal
and monetary stimulus. Growth projections for end-2011 have been revised downwards by half a
point to the 5.0-5.5 percent range (IMF and Central Bank); in the medium term, a convergence
towards 6 percent growth per year is projected. Underpinning these growth rates are the
increasing diversification in FDI, exports and tourism receipts, which have contributed to the
Dominican Republic‘s economic resilience.

11.    Inflation is picking up in 2011 due to higher food and commodity prices. CPI inflation
increased to 9.3 percent year-on-year (yoy) in June, while core inflation accelerated to 6.1
percent (yoy) as the output gap is closing. Cumulative CPI inflation in the first half of the year
reached 5.9 percent. In order to counter inflationary pressures, the Central Bank has raised the
overnight policy rate five times between September 2010 and May 2011, from 4 percent to 6.75
percent. Inflationary pressures are also expected to be lessened by a slowdown in domestic
demand. Consequently, inflation is projected to fall to 6.8 percent by the end of 2011.

Fiscal accounts

12.     Tax revenues are expected to recover gradually thanks to increased economic activity and
the recently approved tax reforms. The tax reforms approved in June 2011 (see Annex 7) are
expected to increase tax collections by 0.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and 0.3 percent in 2012. On
the tax administration side, efficiency gains are expected to be derived from measures taken by
the Government in recent months, such as: (i) the collection of VAT on imports for all
companies under the Proindustria regime; (ii) withholding of the income tax on casino and
lottery prize gains; and (iii) VAT and customs duties collection from public administration
agencies that were previously exempted. However, a number of weaknesses remain in the
country‘s tax system, including a large number of tax exemptions, which are estimated to amount
to almost 6 percent of GDP. As a consequence, tax revenues are expected to increase only
gradually, from 12.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 14.4 percent in 2014.

13.     The Government‘s recent actions are expected to ease expenditure pressures. The
Government announced an 8 percent increase in electricity tariffs in June 2011, which will help
stabilize the deficit of the public electricity sector. In the short run, however, the sector‘s deficit
continues to limit the Government‘s fiscal space: in mid-July, Congress adopted a supplemental
budget that includes across-the-board cuts in spending (protecting social expenditure in
education but not fully in health) to finance larger than expected transfers to the electricity
sector. Despite this, the fiscal balance is expected to improve, from -2.7 percent of GDP in 2010
to -1.5 percent in 2011. In the medium term, improvements in the management of the electricity
distribution companies through increased billing and collection, as well as the adoption of the
technical tariff, are expected to help gradually reduce budgetary transfers to the sector and thus
reduce fiscal risk (see Annex 7). These measures will free up resources for priority spending in
the social sectors. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to stabilize around 1 percent of GDP in
the medium term.

14.     There are a number of important downside risks to the macroeconomic and fiscal
outlook. Overall economic prospects remain dependent on the continued global economic
recovery and stabilization (or fall) in oil prices. In particular, a deepening of the economic woes
in Europe or the United States could depress growth in the Dominican Republic, make fiscal
tightening more difficult and stall the reform momentum, especially if the IMF program is not
renewed beyond the first quarter of 2012. In addition, presidential elections in 2012 may lead to
increases in expenditures during the campaign and to the postponement or reversal of unpopular
measures, such as electricity tariff increases.

Public debt and financing needs

15.     The Government‘s financing needs for 2011 are expected to be met through a
combination of investment and budget support loans, as well as the issuance of domestic and
international bonds. Total gross financing requirements are estimated to reach US$2.5 billion
(equivalent to 4.4 percent of GDP) in 2011. This gap is expected to be filled by the issuance of
domestic (US$384 million), and international (US$500 million) bonds, and by borrowing from
bilateral and multilateral creditors (US$1.7 billion). As the fiscal balance improves and
amortization payments decrease gradually, financing requirements are expected to fall to US$2.1
billion in 2012 (equivalent to 3.5 percent of GDP).

16.    An updated Debt Sustainability Analysis shows that the Dominican Republic‘s public
debt appears to be on a sustainable path.5 The counter-cyclical fiscal stance in response to the
global economic crisis led to a slight increase in the public debt to GDP ratio from 33.1 percent
in 2007 to 37.4 percent in 2010. Beginning in 2011, as global external conditions improve, the
Government would begin reducing this ratio by generating primary surpluses. Under this
scenario, consolidated public debt would fall to 29.7 percent in 2015. Sensitivity analyses shows
that debt sustainability remains particularly vulnerable to sharp exchange rate movements (see
Annex 6).

17.     The Government is committed to sound macroeconomic management in the context of
the IMF Stand-By Agreement (SBA). Following a delay in the completion of the fifth review,6
the Fund‘s Executive Board completed the fifth and sixth reviews under the SBA in mid-July
2011. The review noted that macroeconomic performance was better than expected and that the
authorities had begun focusing on implementing the tightening phase of the program. However,
there were deviations from the fiscal performance criteria for December 2010 and March 2011,
including the central Government and public electricity sector deficits, reflecting the delay in tax
reforms and increase in international oil prices. The end-2011 target for the deficit of the
electricity sector was revised from US$350 million to US$690 million, and structural
benchmarks on the reform of the electricity sector by September 2011 were added, including the
adoption by law of the technical tariff and the implementation of a flexible pricing mechanism.
The authorities remain committed to meeting the program targets for 2011, as demonstrated by
the measures taken in recent months, including the increase in electricity tariffs, adoption of tax
reforms and reduction in expenditures.

 The DSA is based on the definition of gross debt.

  The fifth review could not be concluded as scheduled because the authorities needed more time to articulate
policies to redress small program deviations for end-2010 and to react to the oil price shock of early 2011.

                                                     6
18.   In light of this commitment and the continued implementation of the IMF SBA, the
macroeconomic policy framework is deemed adequate.

POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

19.     The Dominican Republic has learned from previous crises about the importance of
protecting human capital gains in adverse economic conditions. The 2003 domestic banking
crisis pushed 1.3 million people into poverty, resulting in an increase in poverty of 15 percentage
points, and resulted in an increase in unemployment by four percentage points. Poverty, and in
particular extreme poverty, has slightly declined since 2007, though these positive trends are still
fragile. In April 2010, the poverty rate was 33.2 percent and extreme poverty rate was 9.6
percent, below 2007 levels. However, official Government figures indicate a slight increase in
both moderate and extreme poverty in October 2010 (See Figure 3). Unemployment decreased
by 6 percent in 2010 to reach 14 percent, though this number masks large disparities across
population groups.

20.     Previous crisis resulted in sharp declines in terms of social spending: health spending
declined by 36 percent in 2003, while education spending fell 34 percent (Figure 4). Public
spending on education and health is still low compared to regional standards but has been
protected and prioritized in the aftermath of the 2003 crisis. Education spending has increased
from 2.24 percent of GDP in 2008 to around 2.3 percent in 2009 and 2010 and is projected to
remain at this level in 2011. Education spending is planned to increase to 3 percent in the 2012
budget. Similarly, health spending increased from 1.40 percent in 2009 to 1.70 percent of GDP
in 2010 and is projected to remain at similar levels in 2011.7

  The figure for budgeted health expenditure as a share of GDP remains constant in 2011 despite a 5 percent
reduction in allocations to the Ministry of Health in July 2011. This is explained by an initial nominal allocation to

                                                                                 7

21.     The impact of the 2003 crisis on social spending and poverty resulted in renewed
emphasis on the importance of safety nets to mitigate risks and address the causes of poverty.
The Government responded to the crisis by establishing the Solidaridad program in 2005, a
conditional cash transfer program aimed at ensuring investments in the human capital of poor
households, and in particular the health, nutrition and education of their children while
increasing their consumption. The Solidaridad program selects its beneficiaries using the Single
Beneficiary Selection System (SIUBEN) established in 2004-05. The coalescence of Solidaridad
and SIUBEN represented an important shift from universal, unconditional subsidies to targeted
transfers based on investments in human capital.

22.     Since 2008/2009, higher food and oil prices and the global financial crisis are likely to
have affected poverty rates. The Government took significant mitigation measures to address the
crisis, including the expansion in coverage of social protection programs (60,000 new
beneficiaries of the Solidaridad program for a total of about 590,000 beneficiaries), the
expansion of the subsidized health insurance regime (SENASA, which now covers 59.2 percent
of the poor), and the implementation of food-related policies, financing grain depots to improve
the regulation of bulk purchases and to control grain prices, increasing the number of agricultural
markets providing subsidized, fortified food baskets, and reestablishing the school breakfast
program (see Annex 8). Also, increases in social spending in 2009 were the result of the
Government‘s counter-cyclical measures and the coordinated actions of the MoF, MEPD and
social ministries to reduce gaps in the supply of health and education services. As a result, this
crisis has not translated into a major contraction of social spending, as had occurred in 2003.

23.    In the Dominican Republic, the quality of health care and access to some basic health
services need to be further strengthened, especially at the first level of care. The 2007
Demographic and Health Survey shows that more than 95 percent of women received at least 4
prenatal check-ups and 97 percent of births were attended by physicians. Yet the maternal

health expenditure for 2011 that was higher than that of 2010, as well as by a decrease in GDP estimates for 2011.
Increases in the education budget in August 2011 (in the context of significant budget cuts) have not been reflected
in the data. Data for 2010 and 2011 are based on the "economic classification of expenditures by function."

                                                         8
mortality rate remained high at 159 per 100,000 births, a level observed in countries in the region
with similar incomes but much lower rates of institutional births (DHS 2007). 8 Although, in
general, access to health services is not an issue, vaccination coverage was notably low in 2007:
only 39 percent of children between 18-59 months of age were fully immunized in their first 18
months of life. Quality is an issue at the first level of care. A 2010 survey of 1,271 primary
health care facilities indicated gaps in equipment, supplies, and staffing with respect to the
guidelines established by the Directorate of Accreditation (Dirección de Habilitación). All
surveyed public primary care units managed by the Ministry of Health did not meet the
minimum required equipment standards, while the majority of them did not have all the required
personnel.

24.     The quality of education is the main challenge for the education system. The Dominican
Republic has one of the lowest levels of public spending on education in the region, as a share of
GDP and the lowest performance on the SERCE test, the regional standardized exam measuring
education quality. Poor performance affects all socioeconomic groups: on average, individuals
from the wealthiest quintile perform similarly on the test to individuals in the poorest quintile in
Nicaragua. But the issues are greater among poorer households. Though initial intake in primary
education is high, with minimal differences across socio-economic groups, enrolment starts
decreasing by age 14 for students from the poorest quintile (by age 16 for wealthier students),
and the poor experience higher repetition and drop-out rates. Overall, students from the poorest
quintile spend 12 years at school to accumulate 9.6 years of education, while the wealthiest
quintile accumulate 11.8 years of education with 13 years of schooling (see Annex 9).

25.     The current political context in the Dominican Republic is marked by stability, but the
forthcoming presidential election in May 2012 provides an important pre-electoral context for
this operation. The political system in the Dominican Republic has historically been defined by
the strong concentration of power in the executive branch. President Fernandez served between
1996 and 2000 and since August 2004, and was re-elected in May 2008 by a significant margin.
The ruling party also expanded its Congressional majority in May 2010 (holding 31 of 32 seats),
setting the basis for continued policy reforms and initiatives, including a notable focus on
strengthening social cohesion and transparency. Since the beginning of the PASS series, the
Administration has maintained its commitment to social cohesion and poverty reduction, a
commitment further reinforced by the global crisis. While the core social programs are not likely
to be challenged by a new administration, the current Government is focusing in its last months
on institutionalizing recent reforms, through the consolidation of systems and processes.

    III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

26.     The Government‘s broad program of policy reforms to enhance the human capital of the
poorest households focuses on enhancing the performance and accountability of key public
sector agencies and improving investments in health, nutrition and education by poor families,

  while ensuring that public resources are more effectively, efficiently, and transparently managed
  to provide for these investments. The strategy includes actions in four broad policy areas:
     Improving the performance of social sector agencies, including reforms to the Solidaridad
       program to transform it into a CCT program focused on the promotion of human capital;
     Improving the quality, accountability and efficiency of public social spending, specifically
       through enhanced budget management and planning;
     Introducing performance-based social sector budgeting and management; and
     Enhancing the transparency and oversight of public spending.

  27.      These efforts have been integrated into the first-ever National Development Strategy
  2030 (NDS) that is pending Congressional approval. The NDS covers the period 2010-2030 and
  aims to create dynamic, sustained economic growth and distribute its benefits to all Dominicans,
  emphasizing poverty reduction, equity, sustainable development, and efficient, transparent
  institutions. Table 2 summarizes the strategic axes of the NDS and selected specific objectives
  that relate to the Government‘s approach to the PASS series.

                                                                   10
28.     Since the beginning of the PASS series, the Administration has maintained strong
political will for social cohesion and poverty reduction. In some ways, the global economic crisis
has reinforced its commitment to its reform agenda vis-à-vis the improved performance of social
sectors. Furthermore, strengthened budget planning itself, including the introduction of the
Multi-Annual National Plan for the Public Sector which is prioritized centrally and coordinated
across both central and line ministries, have helped prioritize critical social sector and preserve
social spending levels. This commitment is reflected in the efforts of the Government to increase
social spending and maintain it in times of crisis, as discussed in the previous section.

29.      The National Development Strategy benefited from extensive nationwide consultations
led by the Government in 2010 and reflecting the main concerns expressed by civil society
organizations during these consultations. The consultations involved around 7,700 individuals
and 1,425 political, economic, social, private or civil society organizations in more than 50
meetings. During these consultations, over 80 percent of the participants highlighted the
importance of increasing access to education and health services of quality by promoting access
to all, increasing the efficiency and transparency of public spending.

30.      The Government has also continued to seek civil society inputs under the Participatory
Government-Private Sector-Civil Society Anti-Corruption Initiative (IPAC). IPAC has been
facilitated by twelve international development agencies and jointly led by the MEPD, the
Ministry of the Presidency, and the National Commission on Ethics and the Fight against
Corruption. In March 2011, the first public audit on the degree of achievements of sectoral
transparency and accountability action plans (including in health, education, access to
information, and water) was performed by the 16 anti-corruption Government Focal Points.
Areas supported by the PASS, such as improved Civil Society oversight of the budget and
specific recommendations in the education and health sectors have been reported to be on track. 9
The Portal del Ciudadano (“Consulta Amigable?) supported by this operation is a milestone for
the monitoring framework of the IPAC Working Group on Public Finance Management.

31.    Finally, coalitions have recently been formed aimed at strengthening civil society voice
and influence in public affairs. In particular, the Civil Society Consultative Council –
representing a wide range of CSOs – is currently monitoring social policies, which account for
44 percent of the country‘s expenditures, and regularly interacts with the Social Cabinet. These
organizations are also part of the ―Citizen Forum‖ (Foro Ciudadano) which comprises more than
200 CSOs spread out through the country. Some CSOs have also started to focus on monitoring
the public budget, particularly the national budget and the allocations to social expenditures.




9
  The IPAC Education Working Group identified a series of recommendations, including: (i) the design of a
monitoring and evaluation system for schools performance, (ii) the support to the decentralization of education
management and the introduction of results agreements, and (iii) the civil society monitoring of school performance
through the strengthening of Parent-Teacher Associations. The IPAC Health Working Group‘s recommendations
focused on the creation of a unified procurement system for the purchase of drugs and medical supplies.

              IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINK TO THE CPS

32.     The PASS program, including this third proposed operation, is fully consistent with the
CPS, which calls for ―reducing vulnerability while producing results for all.‖ The PASS helps to
preserve and enhance the human capital of the poor through a major shift in social assistance to
include the protection and promotion of human capital. Accountability is also central to the
PASS and the CPS, both within Government agencies and between the Government and the
public. Specifically, the reforms targeted by the PASS align with the following CPS pillars:
 Pillar on Social Cohesion and Services: benefits from the reform of the social protection
    system, which results in better results across social protection, education, and health;
 Pillar on the Quality of Public Expenditures and Institutional Development: benefits from (i)
    measures to improve budget management to support the performance of social sectors in
    delivering the CCT performance targets and (ii) the program‘s performance orientation;
 Pillar on capacity-building of non-traditional actors (including civil society): benefits from a
    better informed demand for improved public budget performance as well as from a
    strengthened demand for better quality and more effective social service delivery.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

33.      In November 2009, the IMF approved a 28-month Stand-By Agreement (SBA) in the
amount of SDR1,094.5 million (about US$1,700 million). The SBA included two phases: the
first, through mid-2010, supported a fiscal impulse to limit the pro-cyclical policy bias; the
second, from mid-2010 to early 2012, foresees a fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. The
program includes quantitative performance criteria on the overall fiscal balance, the deficit of the
public electricity sector, net international reserves and net domestic assets, and accumulation of
public debt arrears. Structural benchmarks target public and financial sector reforms, policies to
enhance the economic recovery and growth, and the expansion of the coverage of social safety
net programs, including the CCT Solidaridad.10 The Bank and Fund teams have collaborated
closely, meeting regularly to discuss macroeconomic developments and prospects; assess risks;
and coordinate on key sectors, including electricity and social safety net sectors. As mentioned
earlier, the Fund‘s Executive Board completed the fifth and sixth reviews under the SBA in mid-
July 2011, in light of which, the macroeconomic policy framework is deemed adequate.

34.     Throughout the implementation of the PASS series, the Bank has maintained close donor
collaboration to strengthen the resolve and coordination of reforms. Coordination and dialogue
with the IADB have been continuous on the redesign of the CCT program, on reforms to the
health sector (an IADB investment loan focuses on health aspects of the reform of the CCT
program reform and is complementary to the Bank‘s Second APL on Health Sector Reform,
PARSS2), on reforms in the education sector (the IADB provides technical assistance to the
Ministry of Education), and more generally on elements of the Government‘s agenda of
modernization of financial management (the IADB provides funding to the Portal del Ciudadano
tool, and the two institutions have shared analysis and joined in providing technical assistance).

10
   Following the fifth and sixth review, structural benchmarks on new legislation for the adoption of the technical
tariff and a flexible pricing mechanism for the electricity sector were added.

                                                        12
35.    The Bank has continued communication with the European Union and the International
Development Agency of Spain, particularly in areas of education and transparency. The Bank
team has also received important support from the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the
Caribbean (SFLAC) to advance analytical work to complement areas related to the PASS
program. UNICEF has also been an important partner in its efforts to complement the
performance and accountability approach by strengthening the legislative function of the
congressional budget oversight office.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

36.     This third operation of the PASS program continues to exploit important synergies with a
number of existing operations in the Dominican Republic. It is particularly important to note that
the reforms supported by this operation were promoted through a broad range of instruments,
highlighting the potential synergies between instruments and across sectors. These instruments
combined a multitude of sectors – Social protection, health, education, public sector, economic
management, and social development – and a multitude of types of instruments – SILs (Sector
Investment Loans), DPL (Development Policy Loans), NLTA (Non-Lending Technical
Assistance), Trust Fund, and partnerships with other donors. This breadth of support was critical
in ensuring the successful implementation of an ambitious set of reforms and in ensuring the
Bank was able to effectively monitor progress and provide technical assistance as required.

37.      First, it complements the Social Protection Investment Project (SPIP) and its Additional
Financing, which provide critical support for targeting, documentation, and social accountability
mechanisms. The SPIP assists poor, undocumented Dominicans in obtaining national identity
documents as an essential first step to enroll in social protection programs. It also supports the
institutional strengthening of the targeting mechanism for social programs, which will improve
the coverage and effectiveness of the CCT program. Finally, the SPIP strengthens the capacity of
the CCT program itself to implement the redesign of the program and develop a comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation system. The SPIP does not finance transfers to beneficiaries.

38.     Second, the PASS also complements efforts in health and education. In health, the second
phase of the Adaptable Program Loan to support the Health Sector Reform (PARSS2) focuses on
improving the delivery of basic health services by introducing results-based financing
mechanisms and improvements in the quality of spending. The health-related co-responsibilities
of the CCT program rely on the supply of health services at the first level of care. The PASS also
complements the Early Childhood Education Project which supported important increases in
access to early childhood education services, and the Youth Development Project which provides
poor and vulnerable youth with a second chance to complete their secondary education.

39.      Third, the PASS complements a series of Non-Lending Technical Assistance (NLTA)
activities undertaken in the social sectors, in the broader area of public expenditure management,
and with civil society. As described in the following section, the PASS has been accompanied by
a Programmatic Social Sector NLTA that has helped prepare the reforms, simulate their potential
impacts ex-ante, and analyze various options, as well as built the capacity of the Government in
policy design and analysis. In addition, the Programmatic NLTA on the Quality of Public
Expenditure has provided important inputs for the design of this operation, through its broader


                                               13
range of activities in terms of transparency, governance, and budget management. Finally, the
PASS is complemented by Bank activities which aim at strengthening civil society. Through a
series of Trust Funds and NLTA, the Bank has helped strengthen the capacity of Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs), in particular their ability to monitor and analyze budget information. The
three NLTA teams and the DPL team were fully integrated, ensuring timely inputs and synergies.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

40.     The PASS program builds on a series of analytical and advisory services from within and
outside the Bank, in particular the programmatic Social Sectors NLTA. The NLTA provides
specific knowledge required for the design and implementation of key reforms supported by this
series of DPLs. It also aims at providing broader knowledge on options to strengthen the
performance and quality of social services and build resiliency to crises, with a focus on options
to consolidate the social protection system by integrating social insurance, social assistance and
active labor market policies. In education, the NLTA resulted in two major reports analyzing the
determinants of enrollment and education quality and the sector‘s resource and information
flows. These reports provided important analytical underpinnings for the education prior actions
of this third operation. The NLTA also facilitated important knowledge exchange with
international experts on the Portal del Ciudadano tool, the SIUBEN targeting instrument, and
the Community Scorecards. The NLTA and additional PSIA Trust Fund also supported the
assessment and monitoring of the social impacts of the PASS-supported reforms (see Annex 10).
In January 2011, at the request of the Vice-President of the Dominican Republic, the Bank and
the Social Cabinet jointly organized a high-level Technical Seminar to disseminate the NLTA
results and engage in a discussion of the achievements and pending challenges in social sectors
in the Dominican Republic.11 The summary report, which includes specific recommendations,
has been posted on the Social Cabinet website and has provided inputs which informed the
National Development Strategy.

41.      Important complementary analytical support is also provided by a SFLAC grant to
support innovations in accountability in the Dominican Republic. In health, this advisory work
will support the review of the preliminary experiences of the results-based financing in two pilot
regions, as well as the implementation of the initial performance agreements between the
Ministry of Health and the Ministries of Economy, Finance and Public administration. The
Second Phase of the Health Reform Project (PARSS2) will also support the Ministry of Health in
its internal reorganization to improve its stewardship and essential public health functions. This
work in health has built on the analytical underpinnings of the First and Second PARSS projects,
including the 2008 report, ―Analysis of the Regional Health Services, in the Framework of the
Social Security Reform in Health in the Dominican Republic.‖

42.     The program also benefited from analytical work undertaken under the NLTA on the
quality of public expenditure.12 This NLTA supports Government efforts to address, among other
problems, the weak strategic orientation of resource allocation processes, the lack of integration

and harmonization between budgeting and planning exercises, and the absence of capacities and
tools to measure and report on both financial and physical results. The Government has advanced
several new (and strengthened) planning instruments, information systems, and other initiatives,
including the National Development Strategy, the Multi-Annual National Plan for the Public
Sector, the Education Decennial Plan, the Health Decennial Plan, the Project Portfolio
Monitoring System, Performance Agreements, and the Integrated Financial Management System
(SIGEF). This PREM-led NLTA has combined its advisory services with the human
development team to best support cross-sectoral working group discussions and bilateral
meetings in the development of performance agreements, aligning efforts, and defining mutual
understanding on a common agenda. The Participatory Government-Private Sector-Civil Society
Anti-Corruption Initiative (Iniciativa Participativa Anti-Corrupción, IPAC), also benefited from
a cross-sectoral approach to identify critical areas of improvement for the implementation of
performance agreements and improvements in resource allocation and accountability, also to be
supported by the a WB-European Union Trust Fund Technical Assistance program.13

LESSONS LEARNED

43.    Arguably the most important factor that has contributed to the success of the program is
the high level of Government ownership of the policy reforms supported by the program. The
Fernandez administration strongly endorsed a political agenda of greater transparency and social
cohesion, which was only reinforced by the global economic crisis. This high-level political
mandate and sustained support in the crisis context helped counteract interest group resistance to
reforms (such as Solidaridad and health sector staff resistance to institutional restructuring and
personnel changes). Support has been sustained across a broad range of institutions, including
the Finance, Planning and sectoral Ministries.

44.    The PASS DPL series has been at once responsive, sustained, and flexible, and has
proven that Bank lending can effectively combine supporting short-term crisis alleviation with
medium-term policy actions. The PASS DPL series provided a rapid response instrument to
address the immediate needs of the Government with the then-impending impact of the global
food, fuel, and financial crisis, while also building-in an important degree of flexibility to
incorporate new Government priorities.

45.     The series has shown how multi-sectoral interventions can work effectively with other
Bank and donors‘ interventions. The design of the PASS program bridges traditional institutional
structures and sectoral divisions to address many of the cross-cutting issues hindering the joint
performance and accountability of social sectors. While this required additional efforts both
within the Bank and within the Government, the resulting reforms were more effective in
reaching its results than isolated sector-specific interventions would have been.

46.     The team had initially underestimated the time and efforts required to design and
implement certain reforms. In particular, the decision to strengthen sectoral Management
Information Systems (MISs) to verify co-responsibilities (rather than creating parallel systems
managed by the CCT program) was initially thought to only require cross-referencing
identification numbers. When issues of incompatibility of the identification variables across

                                               15
databases were discovered, the Government launched a special emergency operation to produce
the necessary adjustments. In parallel, the sectors used this opportunity to overhaul their systems
and adopt electronic MISs that can help improve sectoral supervision, accountability, and
management. Nevertheless, the development of new MISs took longer than expected, because of
administrative issues as well as the cultural changes required to adopt the new tool. To address
this delay, the team has worked closely with the Government to develop a short-term solution (to
avoid delays in the CCT program‘s full implementation) while continuing with the
implementation of the steps required to build the medium-term solution. Also, as the sectoral
ministries started using the MISs for broader management decisions, these efforts gained
additional momentum.

47.     Just-in time knowledge and advisory services through the corresponding programmatic
AAAs in social sectors and public expenditures management have been critical in strengthening
the technical approaches of these multi-faceted reforms.

                           V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

48.     This proposed DPL of an amount of US$70 million is the last operation of a
programmatic series of three DPLs developed to improve results in social sectors, preserving in
the short-term and enhancing in the medium-term the human capital of the poorest citizens (the
first two operations were approved in November 2009 and November 2010 respectively).

49.     The overall PASS program‘s four objectives are:
 to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition,
    education) for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government‘s
    CCT) program, Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions in health and education;
 to improve budget management to support the joint performance of social sector agencies, as
    part of the interim measures to protect critical aspects of social spending and support the
    required improvements in the supply of health, nutrition and education services;
 to support the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in the key social sector
    agencies; and
 to enhance transparency and oversight in social sectors.

50.      The first operation (PASS1) established the conceptual, institutional, and operative
revamp of the safety net framework, particularly the Solidaridad program, to focus on promoting
human capital investments by poor households. PASS1 also explored synergies between the
safety net revamp and the creation of new budget planning mechanisms to improve the targeting
of the fiscal resources dedicated to social transfers and the progressive coverage of supply-gaps
in education, health and nutrition. Critical steps were also taken to initiate results-oriented
regional management agreements in health. The second operation (PASS2) further strengthened
the institutionalization of reforms. It supported the governance arrangements and institutional
strengthening necessary to effectively administer the redesigned CCT Solidaridad across social
sector ministries and agencies and to gradually introduce performance agreements to orient an
institutional focus on results. PASS2 also supported the creation of the first Medium-Term

                                                16
Public Expenditure Framework to increase predictability, transparency, and rationalization of the
budget, and initiated the implementation of community scorecards for social accountability. This
third operation further deepens reforms, providing for the effective verification of CCT co-
responsibilities, while deconcentrating the operations and strengthening the monitoring and
evaluation framework. It also supports the introduction of the first performance agreements for
social programs and improvements in the Solidaridad payment network, as well as broader
efficiency and quality improvements in education and health services and advances in
transparency and oversight. Finally, PASS3 supports the introduction of landmark transparency
and oversight policy measures, including the Portal del Ciudadano (“Consulta Amigable?) tool
to provide a free, public web-based portal to access easy-to-use, national budget information.

51.      The reforms supported by the PASS program are expected to generate improvements at
four main levels: (i) institutional and policy improvements related to the reform of the
governance and operative system of Solidaridad, including the verification of co-responsibilities
and a better articulation with health and education actions (Policy Area 1) and to the gradual
introduction of performance-informed budgeting and a stronger emphasis on results (Policy
Area 3); (ii) improved budget management and execution to meet CCT results targets, including
the progressive reduction of supply-gaps in health, nutrition, and education services (Policy Area
2); (iii) improvements in transparency and accountability to users, with respect to the national
budget and the redesigned CCT Program (Policy Area 4), and (iv) improvements in human
development outcomes for the CCT beneficiaries who comply with their co-responsibilities and
thereby invest in education, nutrition and health (Overall PASS Program‘s result).

52.     There have been only minor changes in the formulation of the prior actions for this
proposed PASS3 operation. Annex 1 provides a detailed comparison of the proposed prior
actions with the initial formulation and the rationale for changes. Annex 2 provides an updated
version of the operation‘s policy matrix for the three PASS operations. The minor changes are:
 Following good practice, the number of prior actions has been reduced. However, while prior
    actions were limited to the most critical measures needed for reaching the full potential of the
    reforms, the team has continued to provide technical assistance and monitor progress across
    the broad program of reforms supported by this operation.
 The 18 original triggers show significant advances, though in selecting prior actions, some
    triggers have been replaced by policy actions that are more central to the program objectives.
    For example, the original trigger in education (initially to adjust student learning outcome
    tests for the second cycle of basic education based on the newly validated student evaluation
    standards) was removed because the Government has embarked on a broader reform of its
    curriculum. It was replaced by a series of key policy actions to improve the efficiency of
    education spending, which had been identified as key constraints for improved results.
 Finally, certain actions were reformulated to reflect achievements beyond expectations. For
    example, the action related to the establishment of Regional Inter-Sectoral Committees in at
    least half of the regions was transformed to reflect the fact that the Government has
    established these committees in all regions, as well as Regional Joint Working Committees to
    improve coordination with sectors in all 136 health zones and 103 school districts.

53.     The following sections discuss the situation in each of the policy areas supported by the
series of DPLs. They also present the prior actions for this operation, and discuss future policy
actions which would be critical for deepening the reforms supported by this series of DPLs.

POLICY AREA I. ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF SOCIAL SECTOR AGENCIES

54.     The first area of policy reform involves the consolidation of the shift in the social
assistance model of the Solidaridad program into a full-fledged CCT program focused on
promotion of the poor‘s human capital. This involves the institutional and operational redesign of
the Solidaridad program and its articulation with critical health and education actions. The
overall service quality and targeting issues related to the Solidaridad program are also addressed
to improve the accuracy of beneficiary selection, while enhancing the competition and
transparency of the use of the payment mechanism. Finally, reforms aimed at ensuring that the
Solidaridad program, which initially operated as a de facto unconditional program, would start
verifying and enforcing co-responsibilities.

Policy Area I.1: Conceptual, institutional and operative reform of the CCT program

55.    Since the second PASS in November 2010, the Government has continued to develop
and/or consolidate institutional features and systems consistent with best practice from mature
CCT programs, such as those of Mexico or Jamaica, as described below.

56.     First, from an institutional standpoint, the Government has now established the CCT
Solidaridad program as the primary axis of the national Social Protection System (SPS). The
fundamental redesign of Solidaridad began with a Presidential Decree establishing the legal and
regulatory framework for the restructuring and strengthening of the SPS, including its mandated
reorganization into non-conditional cash transfers, targeted subsidies, and cash transfers
conditioned to the investment in human capital by poor families. The Government also adjusted
the organizational structure and staff profiles of the Solidaridad program to align them with the
new goals and operating rules. Efforts have also been made to strengthen the program‘s capacity
by training all actors in the use of the revised operations manual; the functions of each body; and
the processes and procedures for customer service and the verification of co-responsibilities.

57.     Second, the Government created a new institutional framework, fostering collaborative
interinstitutional and intersectoral decision-making, in contrast with the previous fragmentation
of social policy in the country. The operating rules of the redesigned CCT program approved in
2010 include the creation of two important committees: the CCT Intersectoral Committee –
which brings together the Solidaridad program with the Ministries of Health, Education,
Planning and Finance – and the CCT Interinstitutional Committee, which brings together the
agencies in charge of targeting (SIUBEN), operations (Solidaridad Program), and payment of
transfers (ADESS), as summarized in Box 1.

58.     Third, institutional strengthening has allowed the Government to meet its strategic
objective of deconcentrating program operations. Over the past year, Solidaridad has formed 9
Regional Technical Intersectoral Subcommittees (RTISSC) corresponding to the regions of the
country where the program is present, which are integrated by the Regional Managers of the


                                                18
Ministries of Health and Education, the public health insurance system (SENASA) and the
Solidaridad program. Each RTISSC defines its own rules and focuses on improving the
efficiency of services delivery and on resolving in a timely manner issues related to service
provision and the verification of co-responsibilities. Additional sectoral Commissions were
developed at the local level, to ensure close coordination of Solidaridad with each sector,
establishing 136 Mixed Commissions in Health and 103 Mixed Commissions in Education.
These commissions are responsible for following-up with families registered at a specific health
center or school to ensure access and effective verification of co-responsibilities.

 Box 1: From Fragmented Decision-making toward Intersectoral and Interinstitutional Collaboration: The
                   New CCT Institutional Framework in the Dominican Republic.

 The CCT Intersectoral Committee provides a platform to improve service provision in health and education for
 Solidaridad beneficiaries, to improve the process of verification of co-responsibilities, to foster the
 deconcentration of operations at the regional level. The Committee is the primary body of the Solidaridad
 program, where all collective decisions are made and responsibilities attributed. This committee is in charge of,
 among others: (i) the implementation of education and health information systems for the verification of co-
 responsibilities; (ii) the updating of processes and procedures for the verification of co-responsibilities; (iii) the
 programming, budgeting, bidding, and monitoring of execution of the actions necessary to close the supply gaps
 in education, health, and nutrition; and (iv) the strengthening of the decentralization of the program at regional
 and local levels.

 The CCT Interinstitutional Committee guarantees a closer coordination of central activities of the Solidaridad
 program. It comprises the Solidaridad program, the targeting agency SIUBEN, and the payment agency ADESS.
 The committee has strengthened the capacity of each body to address beneficiaries‘ requests and has developed
 the capacity to generate and analyze information required for the program management. A 2010 operational
 evaluation found significant progress in the coordination of the updating of the beneficiary registry, the
 verification of co-responsibilities and the generation of payments.

59. Fourth, one of the results of the strengthening of the operational capacity of the
Solidaridad program at central, regional, and local levels was the first-ever verification of CCT
co-responsibilities in October 2010 (co-responsibilities measured only in terms of registration of
families at their primary health centers and of school-age children in school at this stage). This
first verification in education was able to reach 80 percent of Solidaridad beneficiary students to
validate enrollment. The verification found, as validated through an external IADB evaluation,
the successful registration of 92 percent of these children. In health, the verification of co-
responsibilities for health covered 70 percent of beneficiaries (as of April 2011). The verification
found that 90 percent of these were registered at a primary health clinic. Overall, Solidaridad
households accounted for approximately 50 percent of the consultations registered in the Clinic
Management System (CMS). The re-designed Solidaridad program has begun making transfers
based on the verification of co-responsibilities in education, health and nutrition.

60.     In addition, with a view to complete and improve the system of verification, the
Government has taken significant steps to strengthen sectoral Management Information Systems
(MIS) in health and education. Initially, the plan for verification was to mainstream the use of a
manual system in all schools and health clinics and to provide each beneficiary with a personal
identification number for the CCT program (one that could be cross-referenced across sectors).
However, in early 2011, enough momentum was gained in the sectors to establish sector-wide
MISs and the Government decided to use these newly defined MISs for the verification of CCT


                                                          19
co-responsibilities. These new MISs serve a series of purposes beyond the verification for the
CCT program, and are expected to play a central role in most management decisions aimed at
improving the quality and efficiency of sectoral spending and the sectors‘ performance. Shifting
to these new MISs requires lengthy procurement, dissemination, and training processes, in
addition to the initial uploading of basic information on each individual, as well as an important
shift in culture. So, while sectoral ministries, with support from the Bank and the IADB, are
supporting the process of development of these MISs, including with a review of incentive
mechanisms to ensure their use, they are also continuing with their efforts to ensure complete
verification in the short term. To this end, the Government has put in place measures to
strengthen the capacity of all actors (beneficiaries, health and education providers, and CCT
staff) with regard to the verification mechanisms, developed a series of booklets (cartillas de
asistencia a salud y de asistencia a la escuela)¸ and developed guidance for supervision based on
the information systems and visits on the ground.

61.     Fifth, the Government has progressed in the development of a comprehensive Monitoring
and Evaluation (M&E) System for the Social Protection System. The initial step consisted in the
adoption of a results framework defined by the CCT Intersectoral Committee and shared by core
actors – the Solidaridad program, the Ministries of Education and Health, ADESS, and SIUBEN.
The Government has also designed and adopted a common M&E system, which is to be
articulated with the national monitoring and evaluation system under the leadership of MEPD.

62.    In this area, the prior actions for this operation focus on consolidating progress in three
key dimensions of reform – verification of co-responsibilities, deconcentration of part of the
operations, and systematic monitoring – through the formalization of the mechanisms to verify
co-responsibilities, the formal establishment of Regional Intersectoral Committees, and the
adoption of an integrated monitoring and evaluation system for the sector which coordinates and
complements existing monitoring and evaluation activities. The specific prior actions are:

   The Government, through the CCT Intersectoral Committee, has: (i) adopted procedures and
    mechanisms to allow for the verification of compliance with health and education co-
    responsibilities under the CCT Solidaridad Program; and (ii) established regional
    intersectoral committees in all regions covered by the CCT Solidaridad Program, as
    evidenced by Disposición issued by the CCT Intersectoral Committee, dated August 26,
    2011.
   The Government has designed and mandated the establishment of an integral monitoring and
    evaluation system for purposes of sharing technical information amongst: (i) the CCT
    Solidaridad Program; (ii) the Borrower‘s Ministries of Education and Health; (iii) ADESS;
    and (iv) SIUBEN, as evidenced by Disposición issued jointly by the CCT Intersectoral
    Committee and the CCT Interagency Committee, dated August 25, 2011.

63.     Expected results from the PASS DPL series in this reform area include improvements in
governance and operative rules of the CCT program that allow for increased use of education
and health services by CCT beneficiaries, as well as the more systematic verification of
compliance of CCT beneficiaries with their co-responsibilities. Annex 3 presents the indicators
used to monitor progress (indicators 1.1.1 to 1.4.6). Overall, the targets in terms of verification of
co-responsibilities (indicators 1.1.1 and 1.1.2) were met. For indicators of access to health,


                                                 20
education and nutrition services (indicators 1.2.1 to 1.4.6), the baseline was recently released
(Social Protection Evaluation Study data for July 2010, see section on monitoring and
evaluation) and the targets subsequently adjusted.

64.     In the coming months, the Government will continue to consolidate the MISs in the
Ministries of Health and Education to allow for the systematic and automatic verification of CCT
co-responsibilities, and ensure the operationalization of the integrated M&E system to inform
CCT programming and greater results-orientation in social sectors. The decentralization of
Solidaridad operations will also begin integrating new supervision and training processes.
Beyond the consolidation of CCT processes, the Government also focuses on the integration of
the Social Protection System, in particular with the articulation between the CCT program and
the national health insurance, active labor market programs and other social insurance programs.

Policy Area I.2: Strengthening health services for CCT beneficiaries

65.     In the health sector, the Government has put in place a series of reforms to strengthen
service delivery. In particular, the Government has increased the demand for health care services
by introducing co-responsibilities that promote the use of preventive health services (these co-
responsibilities correspond to the Basic Health Plan and include prenatal and puerperal
consultations, infant and child check-ups and immunizations, quarterly health education trainings
for adolescents, and preventative health check-ups for the elderly). Also, the Ministry of Public
Health (MoPH) undertook an assessment of 1,298 primary health care families, their equipment
and staffing, and is progressively addressing equipment and staffing limitations based on WHO
(World Health Organization) guidelines.14 Another reform consisted of the introduction of
results-based agreements between the MoPH and all Regional Health Services to foster
incentives for health care providers to improve the timeliness and quality of primary care,15 as
well as the piloting of results-adjusted financing for the first level of care in two regions, with
support from the current Bank Health APL (PARSS2). Finally, the MoPH has developed new
manuals and training materials for the first level of care.

66.      The Government is also making progress in the reorganization of the MoPH in order to
separate the functions of service provision and stewardship.16 This institutional restructuring,
initially envisioned in the General Health Law and Social Security Law in 2001, had lagged for
lack of political will and leadership. The increased demand for timeliness and quality of health
services from the reform of the CCT program has resurfaced the need for restructuring. The
Government has decided to establish an autonomous management agency that would be
responsible for the delivery of health services through the network of public health care
providers, while the MoPH maintains its stewardship role. In order to move forward with this
proposed institutional reform, the Government has: (a) drafted a law establishing this
management agency after in-country consultations, that is currently being reviewed by the

14
   As of May 2011, equipment has been purchased for 1,298 primary health centers (delivery is expected to be
completed by November 2011). Construction of new primary health facilities is programmed for the following year.
15
   Reform supported by the first and second PASS under the Pillar III on performance agreements.
16
   Stewardship is used here to reflect the WHO (2003) definition: "involves setting, implementing and monitoring
the rules of the game for the health system; assuring a level playing field among all actors in the system (particularly
purchasers, providers, and patients); and identifying strategic directions for the health system as a whole."

                                                          21
Judicial Counsel of the Executive Office before presentation to the National Congress; and (b)
prepared an action plan to operationalize this agency, and is in the process of defining an action
plan to strengthen the MoPH‘s stewardship role.

67.     The Government has made a concerted effort to develop the Clinic Management System
(CMS) as the new MIS and an integral component of the Health Information System (HIS). The
CMS provides a platform for the electronic registration of medical visits that aims to improve the
quality, accountability, and management of primary health services. The delivery of laptops to
each health center and training on the use of computers and CMS has been recently completed.
The verification of CCT co-responsibilities has begun utilizing this CMS by: updating the
registration of Solidaridad beneficiary households at the primary health centers; registering the
consults provided to at least one member of each household; and following up on those families
that have not complied. The CMS represents a fundamental change in the data collected and
reported by physicians, providing electronic medical records and instantaneous reporting to
central and regional administrators. The new system also requires physicians to follow protocols
of care during consultations with new procedures for inputting information to the HIS. The
cultural change, of getting doctors and/or staffs to register primary health care consults on a daily
basis, is not without difficulties. Early issues include software problems; frequent power
interruptions; and the need for more training on the use of computers and the CMS for health
staff, as well as zonal and area level supervisors. The Government has demonstrated notable
progress in addressing these issues through: a Ministerial Resolution establishing the mandatory
use of the CMS; a new ministerial incentive scheme to improve uptake; and the provision of
additional training and small generators.

68.      In this area, the prior action for this operation focuses on the formalization and
institutionalization of the core mechanism that has been put in place verify and certify
households‘ co-responsibilities in health are met, namely the Ministry‘s Clinic Management
System. In particular, the focus is on making the use of the system compulsory while providing
incentives for such use and ensuring all personnel are adequately trained and equipped. In
particular, the specific prior action is:

   The Government, through its Ministry of Health, has: (i) mandated the daily registration of
    primary health care services through the Clinic Management System, as evidenced by
    Disposicion No. 0000016, dated July 26, 2011, issued by the Borrower‘s Ministry of Health;
    and (ii) issued an action plan (Plan de Acción para Apoyar e Incentivar la Aplicación de
    Protocolos y Uso del Sistema de Registro de Atenciones en los Centros de Primer Nivel), for
    the institutional strengthening of entities within the Borrower‘s health sector, training, and
    the establishment of performance incentives for physicians, nurses and administrative staff of
    primary health care centers related to the use of the Clinic Management System.

69.     Expected results for this area include an increase in the share of CCT beneficiary
households whose compliance with health co-responsibilities can be verified (see indicators 1.1.1
and 1.1.2 in Annex 3). More broadly, advances in this area over the entire span of the DPL series
are reflected in indicators of access to health and nutrition services by the CCT beneficiaries and
indicators of quality of such services (including indicators related to the application of the



                                                 22
protocol of attention, 1.2.1-1.3.3). As mentioned earlier, targets have been met for verification,
and data is not yet available to fully assess progress on access.

70.     In the coming months, the Government will ensure the universal use of the CMS, as well
as implement regular reviews of its use in order to address key bottlenecks that affect the
registration of information. The Government is also planning to implement the various steps
required for the operationalization of the sectoral reorganization, particularly the definition of
clear institutional arrangements. In the medium term, to improve the quality of care, the
Government is planning to develop and implement a system to regularly monitor and evaluate
the competencies and practices of health personnel who work in the first level of care and to
provide supportive supervision. The idea is to have a system of periodic tests of personnel
knowledge and application of protocols to complement the information provided by the Clinical
Management System and, based on these results, to provide personnel with refresher and/or
additional training.
Policy Area I.3: Strengthening education services for CCT beneficiaries

71.    The quality of learning and efficiency of service delivery remain important inter-related
challenges for the sector to enhance its performance, as described in Annex 9. To address these,
the Government has continued to improve its capacity to monitor student learning outcomes.
Over the past years, MINERD validated student learning standards for basic education and is
now implementing annual examinations at the end of fourth grade, primary and secondary
education. Initially, the equivalent test at eighth grade was to be adjusted this past year, but the
Government deferred this action as it embarked on a broader process of curriculum reform.
Additional measures to enhance the quality of education have included efforts to improve
leadership and management capacity at the school level, in particular through the establishment
of a School Principal Academy, as well as the introduction of a school monitoring and
supervision system (Sistema de Acompañamiento y Supervision, SAS), which provides
standardized instruments for school supervisors to verify and guide the realization of school-
level pedagogical and administrative objectives. As of May 2011, data collected is available to
more than 700 users, allowing them to identify schools facing challenges and requiring targeted
support. The formal adoption of the system is expected by the end of 2011.

72.    To enhance efficiency and effectiveness, the Government is also rolling out its School
Management System (Sistema de Gestión de Centros Escolares, SGCE), a web-based MIS to
manage school administration at all levels and allow for the verification of CCT co-
responsibilities. Laptops and internet connections have recently completed delivery and the
platform is fully operational, with information uploaded regularly by school principals. The
SGCE provides timely collection and exchange of information on key variables, including
enrolment and attendance, to allow for the timely verification of CCT co-responsibilities. The
Mixed Commissions in Education, between local education and Solidaridad administrators,
conducted a validation exercise to guarantee that each Solidaridad beneficiary student is enrolled
in school and is assigned their proper identification code in the SGCE to allow for its cross-
referencing with Solidaridad.

73.     MINERD has taken additional steps to strengthen its articulation with the CCT, by
investing in bridging supply-gaps, effectively executing 75 percent of the available resources.

                                                23
Solidaridad and MINERD also initiated a pilot to assess alternative transfer structures to best
compensate for different opportunity costs of schooling for different age groups. Results are
expected in early 2012.

74.     The Government has also improved the Annual Operations Plan for 2011 (Plan
Operativo Annual 2011), in line with the analysis of resource and information flows undertaken
by the World Bank (see Annex 9) in order to eliminate overlaps in roles across the central,
regional and district levels. The Organic Rules and Operational Manual will be modified
following the same model in the coming months. Finally, the Government is taking steps to
increase the deconcentration of financial resources from the center to the district level, as
established in the Education Law (Ley de Educación 66-97).17

75.     In this area, the focus of the DPL series has been on setting up mechanisms to verify
compliance of CCT beneficiaries with their co-responsibilities and on improving the quality of
education services through two sets of actions. The first set of actions defines standards, design
tests to measure learning outcomes and institutionalize their application. The second set of
actions aim at increasing the efficiency of education expenditure through improved planning and
management processes, including through the partial deconcentration of non-salary expenditure.
This operation focuses on the final step in the institutionalization of the deconcentration measure
(which was recently piloted and endorsed in light of the resulting improvements) and the final
step in the process of revision of curriculum and evaluation standards and processes. In
particular, the prior action is:

      The Government, through its Ministry of Education, has: (i) approved a mechanism for the
       transfer of financial resources to District Offices for the purchase of didactic materials,
       financing of non-personnel services and non-financial assets; and (ii) validated student
       evaluation standards for secondary education, as evidenced by Resolution No. 668-2011,
       dated September 7, 2011 and Resolution No. 605-2011, dated September 2, 2011.

76.     Expected results in this area of the series of DPLs include an increase in the share of CCT
beneficiary households whose compliance with CCT co-responsibilities are verified (indicators
1.1.1 and 1.1.2), as well as an increase in the share of children from CCT beneficiary families
who are enrolled in and attending early childhood programs, as well as basic and secondary
education (indicators 1.4.1-1.4.6). As discussed earlier, the program is on track in terms of
verification, but data to judge progress on access and use of services is not currently available.

77.     In the coming months, the Government plans to implement key measures to increase the
quality of its education. In particular, this will mean finalizing the revisions to the national
curriculum and updating evaluation standards and tests accordingly, effectively establishing a
specialized school for school principals (focused on managing for results), and implementing the
Accompaniment and Supervision System (Sistema de Acompañamiento y Supervisión, SAS),
which provides standardized instruments for supervisors to verify the realization of
administrative and pedagogical goals at the level of each school.



17
     In 2010, circa 20 percent of non-salary education resources were deconcentrated.

                                                           24
Policy Area I.4: Enhanced payment mechanisms for CCT beneficiaries

78.     The Government has improved the payment mechanism through which transfers are paid
to beneficiaries (through a debit card, which can be used at participating corner grocery stores, or
colmados). Unlike other CCTs, the Solidaridad card is not linked to a savings account or other
financial services, nor can transfers be withdrawn as cash. Beneficiaries also have limited access
to basic information about their accounts. Some issues have arisen regarding access to, and the
performance of, colmados. In some cases, CCT beneficiaries have had difficulties in accessing
colmados, while others have complained about issues regarding prices, quality and
transparency.18

79.     In this area, the DPL series has supported a series of reforms aimed at improving the
quality of the payment mechanisms. In particular, the payment agency, ADESS, has
implemented a series of reforms to improve the payment mechanisms. These include an
expansion in the number of colmados in the Red de Abastecimiento Social (RAS) by over 50
percent since July 2009 (to reach over 3,000 locations), which is expected to increase
competition and reduce prices. It also includes a mapping of existing affiliated colmados to
target the expansion to areas where access is limited. The Government is working to improve
beneficiary access to account information through a new Integrated System for the
Administration of Social Subsidies. These advances will allow beneficiaries to access same-day
account information at any ADESS office or online.19 Finally, the Government has decided to
work with a pro-consumer organization, Pro-Consumidor, which would be responsible for
monitoring the quality of services from a user‘s perspective and to empower users by providing
them greater information on the services and their rights as consumers. In this area, the prior
action for this operation focuses on the final element of formalization of the expanded RAS
(through its bylaws) and of the supervision mechanism. Specifically, the prior action is:

    The Government, through its Social Cabinet, has: (i) expanded the number of institutions
     affiliated to the Red de Abastecimiento Social (RAS) to a total of 3,067 institutions as of
     September 30, 2011 (from a baseline of 1,988 institutions as of June 30, 2009); (ii) approved
     the bylaws of the RAS; and (iii) entered into an agreement with Pro-Consumidor, dated
     August 10, 2011 to: (A) supervise the institutions of the RAS; and (B) inform beneficiaries
     of CCT Solidaridad Program of their rights and the functioning of the RAS, as evidenced by
     Resolution No. 001-2011, dated August 25, 2011, issued by the President of the Board of
     ADESS.

80.     For this area, expected results include an increase in the number affiliated institutions,
from 1,988 in 2009 to 3,067 in 2011, as the establishment of monitoring mechanism to identify
and address issues related to payment mechanisms. These results have been added to Annex 3
(Indicators 1.5.1 and 1.5.2).

81.      In the coming months, the Government will enter in new contracts with financial
institutions for the payments of the CCT transfers and ensure they promote a diversification of

   They will also streamline the replacement of lost cards within 15 days (versus current timeframe of two months).

services, improvements in its quality, and improvements in access to account information. The
Government is also planning a number of pilots to examine the possibility of different payment
modalities – including modalities which promote financial literacy and access to financial
services more generally – and evaluate their impacts.

Policy Area I.5: Improved targeting performance.

82.     Finally, a critical component of the modernization of the CCT and the broader social
protection framework includes the updating of the SIUBEN targeting instrument through the
Second Socioeconomic Household Census. This census has been launched in August 2011.
Initial procurement and financing delays allowed for an improved sampling strategy and an
expansion of coverage to 1.81 million households, an increase by more than 300,000 households
from the initial design.20 Also, the new census will take advantage of innovative technology,
using PDAs, GPS, and data transfer services for areas where these are cost-effective. They are
expected to allow for greater quality control and a shorter data collection period. In this area, the
prior action for this operation is:

    The Government, through its Social Cabinet, has launched a new census to update the
     SIUBEN and improve the targeting of its social programs, including an update of the
     information on households and individuals, an increase of census coverage in geographic
     areas already covered by the last census carried out in 2004-2005, and an expansion of the
     census coverage to geographic areas with high poverty levels not previously included, as
     evidenced by Resolution No. GS-02-11, dated September 13, 2011 issued by the coordinator
     of the Social Cabinet.

83.    In this area, the expected short term result is the completion of the SIUBEN, as well as
the updating of the database which will be used for the targeting of the CCT program (added to
Annex 3, as indicator 1.6.1). In the medium-term, beyond the completion of the DPL series, the
SIUBEN socioeconomic census is expected to improve the accuracy of inclusion and exclusion
by updating the information of families currently in the SIUBEN and expanding the database to
new geographic zones of high poverty not covered in 2004-05. This will result in an
improvement in the targeting accuracy of the CCT program, as well as other social programs
which use the SIUBEN to identify their beneficiaries.

84.    In the coming year, the Government will complete the census and validate its
information. Each program which uses the SIUBEN will then identify their beneficiaries and
update their beneficiary registries.




20
    The survey requires more than a dozen procurement processes that faced difficulties. Many international
competitive biddings had low levels of response and required multiple bidding cycles. Also, political hurdles during
congressional elections in May 2010 delayed the approval of the Additional Financing to the Social Protection
Investment Loan which delayed some bidding processes. Finally, in September 2010, the Ministry of Finance issued
a mandate to all Government agencies to suspend disbursements until the end of the calendar year.

                                                        26
POLICY AREA II. IMPROVING BUDGET MANAGEMENT TO SUPPORT THE CCT PROGRAM
85.     As part of the national strategy to move towards Results-Based Management (RBM), the
Government has made progress in critical areas.21 This includes improvement in planning and
budget management of the CCT and the associated health, nutrition and education services. In
particular, to respond to the dramatic reductions in social sector spending in past crises and to
ensure CCT beneficiaries can comply with their co-responsibility in health and education, the
Government put efforts in place to close gaps in the supply of basic services. The program was
developed on the basis of sectoral assessments led by the CCT Intersectoral Committee, which
quantified the investments required to cover supply-gaps in three years. The Ministry of Finance
ensured that sufficient funds were available to cover the identified gaps for the first two years.

86.     More broadly, the Government started to institutionalize these planning and budget
improvements. In particular, in September 2010, the Council of Ministers approved the first-ever
Multi-Annual National Plan for the Public Sector 2010-2013, which contains medium-term
guidelines, including provisions for social protection policy with projections in terms of
coverage and budget, and appropriation for the programs aimed at closing gaps in the supply of
social services. The plan represents a significant advance to increase predictability of the budget
and is a first step to developing a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. With regard to the
programs which aim at closing supply gaps, during the first year, the assignation of resources by
the Ministry of Finance was fully met. The plan is to be revised every year on a rolling basis.
The first revision (the revised plan covers the period 2011-2014) continues to protect the budget
required to close gaps in supply in education, health and nutrition over the rolling three-year
period.

87.     The Government has also worked to increase transparency, in particular through the CCT
Intersectoral Committee‘s efforts to monitor the execution of resources on a quarterly basis and
publish the findings. Reports on the execution of the 2010 program provide a detailed breakdown
of capital investments across sectors, along with detailed overviews of the timelines for planned
investments. To complement these rather technical reports (focused on procurement and
execution rather than on results), the CCT Intersectoral Committee is planning evaluation reports
that would also present the contribution of the new investments to improvements in results
indicators (e.g. reduction in overcrowding, increased micronutrient intake). This focus on results
will also help sectoral ministries justify the timely allocation of the resources with the Ministries
of Finance and Economy. The reports will be published on the Government‘s websites to inform
the public of progress. They will also be an important input in the design of Performance
Agreements in health and education, as discussed below.

88.    In this area, the PASS series has supported reforms in this policy area by supporting the
diagnostic by the CCT Intersectoral Committee of the gaps in supply of basic services to meet

the needs of the CCT beneficiaries and promoting the strengthening of the CCT Intersectoral
Committee in its joint budget planning and monitoring capacities and coordination to ensure
resources are available to meet the results targets of the CCT program. This operation supports
the final element of consolidation of these reforms – namely the integration of the elements
necessary to meet the results of the CCT program in the budget and their effective monitoring.
Specifically, the prior action is:

    The Government has established budget planning and coordination mechanisms that will
     ensure the availability of sufficient resources to meet the results targets of the CCT
     Solidaridad Program, as evidenced by the approval of: (i) the Multi-Annual National Plan for
     the Public Sector 2011-2014, by the Government‘s Council of Ministers on September 15,
     2011; (ii) the Budget Law of 2011; and (iii) Disposicion dated September 1, 2011, issued by
     the CCT Intersectoral Committee.

89.    As a result, it is expected that the difference between the allocated and actual budget for
the programs aimed at closing gaps in supply of social services for CCT beneficiaries will be
smaller than the difference observed in other sectors of the budget (reflecting the priority given
to these activities in the budget), as reflected in indicator 2.1.1. in Annex 3. Also, the policy
reform is expected to result in a reduction in the difference between quarterly scheduled quotas
and actual allocated quotas (see indicator 2.1.2 in Annex 3). Both targets have been exceeded.

90.     In the coming months, the Government has committed to continue to consolidate the
gains in budget planning and resource allocation in the social sectors through continued
commitment to the sectors‘ priority programs, updating of the assessment of supply gaps to
propose a three-year investment plan for 2013-2016 and ensuring its funding under the Pluri-
Annual National Plan for the Public Sector. This will establish important linkages with advances
in results-oriented budgeting, particularly given the signing of performance agreements between
MoF, MEPD, MPA, and the social sector ministries.

POLICY AREA III. INTRODUCING PERFORMANCE AGREEMENTS IN THE SOCIAL SECTORS

91.    To strengthen institutional budget management and accountability, the Government
introduced performance-based budgeting in social sectors through a series of Performance
Agreements for priority health and education programs.22 These Performance Agreements
(Contratos por Resultado y Desempeño) are intended to provide a flexible managerial link
between the provision of budget resources and the desired improvements in the social sector‘s
performance, as reflected in baselines, indicators and targets for outputs and outcomes. Table 3
summarizes the phases and main achievements in the introduction of Performance Agreements.23




22
   Organized by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public
Administration and Ministries of Health and Education following the guidelines established in the 2006 Budget Act.
This reform is supported by the PASS series, the 2009 Public Finance and Social Sector DPL and the NLTA on
improving the quality of public expenditure, as well as by the IADB PRODEV program.

 of findings         improving future Performance Agreements.

92.     Performance Agreements cover both institutional and program performance. They
include commitments regarding: (i) institutional objectives and goals verifiable by performance
indicators, involving managerial and institutional processes and systems, including planning,
procurement, monitoring, personnel, statistics and organizational structure, among others; and
(ii) objectives and goals of priority programs, involving elements related to the volume and
quality of goods and services delivered by the program. In the case of the education sector, for
instance, the Performance Agreement includes a series of institutional objectives and targets –
such as for instance the publication of manuals that define all functions in the Ministry and guide
the classification of each existing position and the development of a platform for the monitoring
of the sector, the training of 109 technicians in the use of the platform, and the actual monitoring
of 19 central, 104 local and 18 regional institutions – as well as a series of goals in terms of
results – such as the training of around 3,500 teachers identified in the context of a diagnostic of
capacity. This is a significant departure from traditional budgeting practices that focus on inputs
(and not on results). Additionally, the process of implementation includes self-evaluation,
validation of the results and the dissemination to internal users such as the Cabinet, and to
external users, including Congress and citizens at large.

93.     The PASS series supported a series of actions. First, a series of diagnostics of basic
conditions for the implementation of Performance Agreements were used to prepare institutional
strengthening plans to help the Ministries of Health and Education improve planning and
management systems, a prerequisite for the implementation of Performance Agreements. These
plans also helped identify the programs that were better suited for implementing the first

24
   Since 2005, the Ministry of Public Administration has led the implementation of the Common Assessment
Framework to assess institutional quality through self-evaluation. More than 90 agencies have used this approach.

                                                          29
Performance Agreements. In 2011, the Government has set up a dedicated coordination unit in
MEPD. The Government also approved a Decree regulating Article 14 of the Budget Law that
mandates the design and implementation of performance agreements. The central Ministries also
signed Performance Agreements with the Ministries of Health and Education for their priority
investment programs. In the health sector, for example, the main focus of the current
Performance Agreement is on improving the coverage and efficiency of vaccination, as well as
strengthening the logistical capacity of health centers to provide these vaccinations. The
contracts contemplate an initial phase of implementation until December 2012, covering the
remainder of the 2011 budget cycle and the subsequent cycle in 2012. Also, the design of the
contracts includes a self-assessment period by the sectors and a validation by the Ministries of
the Economy, Finance and Public Administration, which findings will be presented to the
Cabinet. This operation focuses on the last stage of the reform, namely the signing of the
Performance Agreements for priority programs in health and education. In this area, the prior
action is:

    The Government, through its Ministries of Finance, Economy and Public Administration,
     has: (i) signed a separate performance agreement with each of the following Government‘s
     Ministries: Health and Education, to strengthen the institutional budget management and
     accountability of the Government‘s priority programs in health and education, through
     performance-based budgeting, as evidenced by the performance agreements dated August 31,
     2011; and (ii) approved the Presidential Decree No. 522-11, dated August 31, 2011, which
     regulates Article 14 of the Government‘s Law No. 423-06 (Ley Orgánica de Presupuesto
     para el Sector Público), that establishes a results-oriented management model through the
     use of performance agreements.

94.     The expected result in this area is an increase in the number of programs which have
developed their log-frame in order to transition towards results-based management (see indicator
3.1.1. in Annex 3). The targets set for this indicator have been met, with five priority programs
covered by the performance agreements (target for November 2011 was 4 programs). In the
medium-term, the policy reforms are expected to generate gains in efficiency within the sectors,
which will be partly reflected in the increase take up of social services by CCT beneficiaries
(measured through indicators 1.2.1 to 1.4.6).

95.      In the coming months, the Government will ensure consolidation of the Performance
Agreements through the close monitoring of their commitments, their validation, and the
presentation of the finding to the Cabinet. Once the lessons from this first set of programs have
been learned, the Government will also develop a plan for the expansion of Performance
Agreements to other programs and agencies. Finally, the Government is working to ensure the
institutionalization of the link between the Budget Division in the Ministry of Finance and the
Planning Division of MEPD.25




25
  The Bank will provide technical assistance on these and areas identified in the PEFA 2010 report, in collaboration
with the European Union and the IADB. Efforts are also promoted under the IPAC initiative (see www.ipacrd.com)

                                                        30
POLICY AREA IV. IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

96.      This area of reform has focused on establishing mechanisms for improved transparency
and oversight by addressing three critical challenges: first, granting the public with access to
timely and comprehensive budget information from the Financial Management Information
System (SIGEF) through the development of the Portal del Ciudadano (Citizens‘ Portal,
“Consulta Amigable?); second, ensuring that the Solidaridad program counts with an effective
social auditing scheme through the implementation of Reportes Comunitarios (Community
Scorecards); and third, ensuring that complaints are directed to their respective sectoral
institutions through a centralized system of complaints.

97.     Portal del Ciudadano (“Consulta Amigable?). With knowledge exchange and technical
assistance from the World Bank, the Government has developed Portal del Ciudadano, a web-
based, user-friendly tool that provides the public with information on budget revenues, allocation
and execution from the Financial Management Information System.26 The objective is to
promote greater transparency and accountability, and the effort is accompanied by efforts to
strengthen the capacity of civil society organizations to effectively access and analyze the budget
information, convey it to local communities, and help channel communities‘ concerns and
suggestions (see earlier section on relationship to other Bank operations). The MoF and MEPD
have also signed an administrative agreement to collaborate on the inclusion of a module within
the Portal that will enable users to link budget expenditures to performance indicators. The
Government has also prepared easy-to-access budget execution reports which are posted on the
MoF‘s website, as well as a short note on ‗Presupuesto Ciudadano’ (Citizens‘ Budget) that
provides an easy-to-understand overview of the composition of the budget incomes and
expenses. The success and credibility of the Portal del Ciudadano as a mechanism for budget
analysis and monitoring will depend on the Government‘s commitment to ensuring that: (i)
coverage applies to all centralized agencies using SIGEF; (ii) coverage is gradually expanded to
other decentralized agencies; and (iii) open discussions take place with civil society
organizations.

98.     Reportes Comunitarios. The CCT program has piloted one of the first social auditing
schemes in the country, where Solidaridad beneficiaries have formal mechanisms to voice their
opinion. The community scorecards focus on the quality of CCT services (timely payments,
training delivered, etc.) and the provision of the basic social services (teachers present,
micronutrients available, etc.). A feedback mechanism is being developed, involving direct
service providers and district, regional and national administrators. The scorecards have been
piloted. The pilot showed that beneficiaries are highly satisfied with many aspects of the
programs, but highlight a few areas for improvements, including issues of availability of
vaccination, medication and didactic material, and issues with the quality of services in
Colmados. An important lesson from the pilots was that many of the issues were immediately
addressed by the local committees in charge of the CCT program (who put in place immediate
action plans), suggesting an immediate feedback mechanism can ensure most grievances are
effectively and swiftly addressed. In the coming months, the Government will undertake a

26
  This automated interface will be linked to performance indicators through the administrative agreement signed
between MoF and MEPyD to develop a pilot to define performance indicators in health, education, and social
protection that will be linked to budget line execution, as supported by PASS2.

                                                      31
process evaluation of the pilots, to inform the expansion plan (currently planned in 4 regions
which exhibit large socio-economic differences, with a view to test the tool in contrasting
contexts). The Bank will also support the evaluation of the impact of the Reportes Comunitarios
during the scaling up phase (the baseline data will be collected during the first trimester of 2012).

99.      Complaint mechanisms. With a view to strengthen transparency in its operation, the CCT
program has taken significant steps to disclose key information – including a list of beneficiaries
– to reduce risks of political clientelism. It has also enhanced the mechanisms for service
providers to address beneficiaries‘ complaints or questions. Initially, the complaint mechanism
did not allow for the CCT program to share or hand over complaints related to health or
education services. To address this concern, the Government has developed a central complaint
mechanism, called the integrated system for customer service (Sistema Integrado de Atención
Ciudadano, SIAC) that utilizes the national System of Access to Government Information
(AGIS) and the associated Access to Public Information Offices established in each Government
institution. This system ensures that complaints are effectively directed to the agency responsible
for the related services, irrespective of the institutions which initially received the complaint.

100. In this area, the PASS series has supported policy actions in the three spheres presented
above – the publication of budget information, the monitoring of the CCT by beneficiaries, and
the establishment of a complaint mechanism. This operation supports two prior actions, which
mark the completion of the reform process – the launch of the online budget publication and the
institutionalization of the community reporting mechanisms (which goes beyond the initial target
of publication of results from these mechanisms). For this operation, the prior actions are:

   The Government, through its Ministry of Finance, has launched an online budget
    transparency tool (Portal del Ciudadano Dominicano), which allows free public
    consultations on public revenues and expenditures of the Government‘s central agencies,
    including data on execution of the Government‘s national budget.
   The Government has defined and mandated the implementation of the expansion plan of the
    ―community scorecards‖ (a social auditing scheme for the beneficiaries of the CCT
    Solidaridad Program to voice their opinion on the quality of the services provided under said
    program), as evidenced by a Disposición dated August 12, 2011, issued by the CCT
    Intersectoral Committee.

101. In this area, expected results include an increase in transparency and public oversight.
Specifically, an increase in the public‘s access to comprehensive budget information is expected
to be reflected in the launch of the tool, a gradual increase in number of users of the Portal del
Ciudadano tool, and a gradual increase in the number of times this portal is accessed (indicators
4.1.1 and 4.1.2). The tool has been launched on September 30, 2011, and is accessible to the
public at large (NGOs have participated in its development, by providing feedback on its content
in the context of open consultations). The numbers of registered users and hits will be updated
once the portal is launched. The expected result for the development of the community
monitoring mechanism is an increase in the share of community scorecards that are effectively
completed by beneficiary committees (see indicator 4.2.1. in Annex 3), which reflects the actual
take up of the tool by beneficiaries. The target set for November 2011 has been exceeded, as 65
percent of the scorecards were effectively filled by communities.


                                                 32
102. In the coming months, the Government is planning to continue promoting an open
dialogue with organization of the civil society to keep improving the Portal del Ciudadano tool
and discuss budget information. In particular, the Government will integrate comments and
recommendations from users into the portal. Also, in the coming year, the Government is
planning to broaden the scope of the tool to include information on spending by decentralized
and mixed agencies and to link budget execution information to performance indicators. In terms
of the community scorecards for the CCT and its associated social services, the Government is
planning to implement the expansion plan and institutionalize the processes. The Government is
also setting up mechanisms, which ensure the issues raised are swiftly addressed by the relevant
agencies. The rapid response to issues will also be an important element of the continued
implementation of the national complaint mechanism.


                         VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

103. The policy actions supported by this operation and the PASS series in general are
expected to generate significant positive poverty and social effects through improved
management processes for the delivery of social services, which is expected to result in
improvements in the performance of social sector agencies in serving the poor. The policy
actions are not expected to generate significant negative poverty and social impacts.

104. In the context of the preparation of this series of DPLs, a PSIA was undertaken to
examine and monitor the expected impacts of the policy actions supported by the series. The
process was developed through a PSIA Committee formed by the Social Cabinet, MEPD, and
MoF. Annex 10 provides more details on the approach, methodologies and results of the PSIA.

105. The PSIA undertook an ex-ante micro-simulation to assess the expected outcomes of the
CCT redesign of demand-side incentives for social service use for education and health co-
responsibilities. The results of an ex-ante micro-simulation estimate that the revamped CCT
Solidaridad would increase school enrollment by 6 percentage points and decrease child labor by
9.2 percent due to the introduction of education co-responsibilities. In health, the same
simulation found that attendance of children under-5 by a healthcare professional should double.

106. The PSIA also produced a benefit-incidence analysis to assess the progressivity of the
programs aimed at closing gaps in supply of health and education services compared to larger
public spending in each sector. Results suggest education spending is semi-progressive overall,
whereas the targeting used for the program aimed at closing gaps may be a little less progressive
in practice. The resources dedicated to the closing of supply gaps in health are shown to be very
progressive, especially when spent on refurbishing existing health centers.

107. In the coming months, the Government has planned an analysis of the CCT program‘s
actual targeting and incidence. An evaluation of the CCT‘s impacts on the poor‘s investments in
human capital and poverty is also ongoing.



                                               33
108. Beyond the scope of this series of operations, the Government has adopted a socially
responsible approach to closing the gaps in the supply of basic social services, by anchoring the
decisions on where to strengthen the supply of services in a combination of detailed maps (which
identified geographic areas with limited access) and community-based discussions. In the past,
following this approach has resulted in delays for school constructions in some areas, because it
required lengthy processes of identification of needs for additional establishments, identification
of appropriate locations for these establishments and purchase of the relevant land where
applicable. However, the process was important to ensure the closing of supply gaps was realized
in a socially-responsible manner. This process is now completed.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

109. The policy actions supported by this operation and the PASS series in general focus on
improvements in processes and are not likely to generate significant positive or negative effects
on the environment, forests, and other natural resources.

110. In the social sectors, beyond the scope of this series of operations, the Bank has worked
with the health sector for several years on the question of biomedical waste management, most
recently through a series of Adaptable Programmatic Loans in support of the Health Sector
Reform (PARSS). The first loan supported a needs assessment, the strengthening of
infrastructure, and training to improve waste management. In 2009, the Government adopted
new regulations and related operational guidelines (Decree 126-09). Under the Second Phase of
PARSS, the Bank will continue to provide support to the Government for the strengthening of its
capacity to implement these procedures. With regard to rehabilitation or construction of social
service facilities, any activity would fall under, and be mitigated through, the guidelines for
construction already in place in the Ministries, with support from sectoral WB projects. In
particular, the Ministry of Education‘s policies require any construction to conduct an
environmental assessment following the Ministry-wide protocols, and obtain licenses from the
Ministry of the Environment.

PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

111. In addition to the Government‘s own process of consultation described earlier (under the
section ―The Government‘s Program‖), the Bank undertook specific consultations with civil
society representatives on selected policy areas. During the identification mission in April 2011
and the preparation of the IPAC social audit workplan, the Bank held consultations with the Civil
Society Consultative Council (Consejo Consultivo de la Sociedad Civil) and the Citizen‘s IPAC
Observatory (Observatorio Ciudadano a la IPAC) a coalition of 12 CSOs specialized in budget
transparency and quality of services advocacy. To strengthen the capacity of CSOs in monitoring
public policies, a series of training workshops is also planned within the framework of the Bank-
supported Dominican Republic Civil Society Strengthening Program.

112. The PASS team also held informal discussions with experts from CSOs, academia,
citizens, and beneficiaries. These discussions reiterated the need to protect and increase critical
social spending, increase transparency and fight corruption. A consultation was also held on May
15th, 2011 to discuss ways to improve governance. In coordination with the PASS-supported

budget transparency reform, a Civil Society NLTA targets improvements in four major areas: (i)
civil society‘s budget analysis and monitoring capacities, funded by the Governance Partnership
Facility; (ii) Congress‘ budget oversight functions, funded by the IDF for the Budget Planning
Office; (iii) the capacity of local Governments to increase accountability, funding by the Korean
TF managed by WBI; and (iv) civil society‘s capacity to audit public policies, through the IPAC
Citizen Observatory funded by the SFLAC TF and the Civil Society Fund.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

113. The Government and the Bank team continue to endorse the monitoring indicators, and
feel they constitute a robust framework for this series of DPLs. However, the collection of data
to report on progress along these indicators has met important obstacles over the series‘ period.
Indeed, The PASS series was initially prepared on an accelerated calendar, because of the need
for accelerated support to help the Dominican Republic face the global crisis. As a result, some
of the monitoring indicators, baselines and targets were set in the absence of strong data. In
particular, many baseline data were contingent upon the results of an impact evaluation – the
Social Protection Evaluation Study (Encuesta de Evaluación de la Protección Social, EEPS) –
planned for the summer of 2010. In practice, the EEPS experienced significant delays, related to
methodological issues in locating treatment groups, and the baseline indicators only became
available in September 2011. This delay was already discussed in the program document for the
second DPL (PASS2), which recognizes that the Government will need to adjust the baselines
and associated targets for some of the indicators which depend on the EEPS.

114. Over the past year, the Government has continued to demonstrate its commitment to
update the results framework of the PASS series, as part of larger efforts to develop an integral
M&E system for Social Protection in the country, and the Government and Bank have found the
indicators to be adequate in continuing to constitute a robust results framework for the PASS
series. Overall, the PASS is expected to increase the share of CCT beneficiary households who
invest in their human capital, as measured by: (i) an increase in the share of CCT beneficiary
households who comply with health and nutrition co-responsibilities; and (ii) an increase in the
share of students from CCT beneficiary families who are enrolled in, attending and completing
basic education, and who are enrolled in and attending secondary school. 27 It is also expected to
lead to improved budget management for enhanced performance of the social sectors, in
particular through the reduction in the deviation between proposed and actual budgets and
disbursement schedules. Finally, the reforms include the introduction of Performance
Agreements in social sectors, resulting in enhanced transparency and civil society oversight.

115. Annex 3 presents an update of the results framework, which presents all the data
available at the time of preparation of this program document and presents the data collection
plan for the coming year which will allow for the evaluation of the success of these reforms in
meeting their goals. The implementation and monitoring of PASS DPL3 will continue to rely on
the close coordination of the Bank team with the Social Cabinet, the Ministry of Finance, the

   Specific long-term results expected in education include increased educational attainment of extremely poor
children, particularly in Early Childhood Development (ECD) (children 4-6 years old) enrollment, basic education
completion, and secondary school enrollment. In health, key long-term results include better Government
performance in the delivery of critical nutrition, child and prenatal health care services for the poorest citizens.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

116. While the fiduciary risk related to the Public Financial Management (PFM) environment
in the Dominican Republic is considered moderately high, the Dominican Republic has
continued to engage in reviewing, strengthening and reforming the way its public finances are
planned and managed in the last few years, as detailed in Annex 11. The country has made good
progress in passing important reforms that targeted the FM legal framework and redefined the
role of the institutions involved on public financial management. Developing the reforms has
involved not only the Ministries of Finance, Public administration, and Economy, Planning and
Development, but also legislative and other oversight entities concerned with quality and
efficiency of budget execution and control. Implementation has shown modest improvements as
explicitly indicated in the 2007 Performance Expenditures and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
Report, and the 2010 PEFA Update. Key PFM entities show notable progress in defining their
strategic plans, aligned with the National Development Plan. Many joined activities -
Government/civil society/private enterprises/donors to strengthen key FM and oversight entities
are taking place. See Annex 11 for a more detailed discussion of fiduciary aspects. The team
confirms that the Government publishes its annual budget in a timely fashion.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
117. The administration of this loan will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. The
proposed loan will follow the Bank‘s disbursement procedures for development policy
loans/credits. The untied balance of payments/budget support will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the development policy program, including the maintenance of a
satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework, and not tied to any specific purchases.
Furthermore, no procurement requirements will be needed. Once the loan is approved by the
Board and becomes effective, the Borrower may submit a withdrawal application requesting the
Bank deposit the proceeds of the loan into a dedicated account designated by the Borrower and
acceptable to the World Bank at the Central Bank of Dominican Republic at the request of the
Borrower. The Borrower shall ensure that upon deposit of the Loan into the account, an
equivalent amount shall be credited in the Borrower‘s budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the
foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds of the
loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Policy Loan Agreement,
IBRD will require the Borrower to promptly, upon notice from IBRD, refund an amount equal to
the amount of the payment to IBRD. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be
cancelled. The Bank will retain the option to request an audit of the dedicated account.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
118. Table 4 below summarizes major risks identified since the first DPL of this series,
discusses the extent to which they have materialized and identifies new risks and risk mitigation
measures when applicable.

                                          Bank has an active engagement in the sector through a technical assistance
                                          project, which supports the structural reform agenda where important
                                          advances have been made (see Annex 7 for more information). In the short
                                          run, however, the implementation of the technical tariff in particular may be
                                          affected by the political environment, especially in light of the upcoming
                                          elections.
                                         The Government has strengthened the institutionalization of new planning
                                          and allocation mechanisms aimed at protecting pro-poor social sector
                                          investments. The January 2011 Presidential Decree mandating ministerial

                                          able to fully protect all social sectors.
                                         Finally, the Government has initiated a transition from universal subsidies
                                          to electricity and gas consumption, which were fiscally unsustainable, to
                                          targeting subsidies which benefit only those families that have been
                                          identified as poor by the national registry (SIUBEN) and the CCT program.
                                          The use of the targeted social protection program is hence part of the
                                          solution to the fiscal constraints stemming from the energy sector.

                              Performance and Accountability of Social Sectors
                              Programmatic Loan

Dear Mr. Zoellick:

On behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic, I am pleased to write to you to reiterate our
interest in and commitment to forging ahead with public sector reform processes, strengthening
macroeconomic stability, enhancing public policy performance in the social sectors, which develop
human capital among the poorest, and continuing the process launched in 2006 to improve public
financial administration. Clearly, the third disbursement of the above-mentioned programmatic loan,
based on development policies related to performance and accountability in the social sectors, will
support the implementation of key areas of these processes and priorities.

In 2009, the international situation directly impacted the Dominican economy, as evidenced by the
decline in tax revenue collected relative to the amount budgeted, and a marked slowdown in the main
sectors or areas that generate foreign exchange earnings, namely, tourism, exports, and remittances.
With a view to ensuring growth in output, the Government adopted the policy objective of reviving
domestic demand in order to offset weaker external demand. In October 2009, the Dominican
Government concluded a Stand-By Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund in order to
compensate for the sharp drop in tax revenue and quickly jumpstart the productive base. This Stand-
By Arrangement is expected to guarantee the implementation of short- and medium-term
countercyclical measures.

The Arrangement strengthened implementation of an expansive fiscal and monetary policy that
resulted in a solid growth rate of 7.8 percent in 2010. In aggregate terms, the sectors that most
contributed to growth were services (3.9 percent) and industry (2 percent). In the area of prices,
inflation stood at 6.2 percent at end-2010, a rate consistent with the target inflation rate proposed in
the Central Bank‘s Monetary Program and the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. To achieve this
target, the monetary authorities guaranteed reversal of the inflationary expectations of the first five
months of 2010, a period during which prices increased by 5.4 percent on average, 0.55 percentage
points below the lower limit of the target inflation range.

Since 2009, the Dominican Republic, with the assistance of multilateral organizations, has stepped up
work aimed at coping with external difficulties, improving the efficiency and quality of public
services, reducing the vulnerability of persons at the bottom of the social pyramid, and prioritizing
                                                  65
and accelerating public sector reforms. To achieve these goals, the Government obtained and secured
the fiscal space needed to establish priority social programs and investment aimed at the continued
development of the economy. The World Bank Group‘s Strategic Alliance with the Dominican
Republic fits perfectly into this renewed collaborative work effort. The importance of sustaining this
effort is heightened by the recent worsening of crisis conditions and the climate of uncertainty.
Against this backdrop, and as set forth in the Strategic Alliance, priority should be given to
maintaining the focus on protecting the most vulnerable sectors, while at the same time sustaining
efforts to increase competitiveness and strengthen public institutions in the country in the areas of
accountability and more effective management outcomes.

1. The Government’s Vision

The Dominican Government is continuing to implement the most sweeping institutional reform
agenda in 50 years, which culminated with the promulgation of the new Constitution of the
Dominican Republic in February 2010. The new Constitution provides for meaningful change in
political and administrative government management, to be carried out in a manner consistent with a
long-term vision for the country.

The Government is continuing to develop the National Planning and Public Investment System.
After duly completing the drafting and consultative process involving the broadest social, political,
academic, business, labor, church-based, and other civil society entities, the Executive submitted the
draft National Development Strategy 2030 (NDS) to Congress in March 2011 for its passage into
law. This draft has been sent forward for review and discussion by a bicameral legislative
commission. The document is currently open for public review, prior to its submission for passage
into law. It is expected to be adopted by the current legislature.

The NDS articulates a vision, strategic thrusts, general and specific objectives, and lines of action that
facilitate progress toward achievement of the development objectives. These strategic elements must
lead to the investment programs, policies, and projects outlined in the Multi-Year Public Sector Plan
for the production of public goods and services intended for the population, in order to achieve the
development objectives. A system of indicators for monitoring their performance from an
implementation standpoint and, possibly for assessing impact, is an integral part of the Multi-Year
Plan.

The aim is to move toward a country and public sector with greater and more effective planning, with
the goal of achieving more effective results-based management. This objective is thus the focus of
the draft NDS and the National Multi-Year Public Sector Plan, which ranks second in the National
Planning System hierarchy, based on a medium-term perspective. Consistent with the guidelines of
the Strategy, the National Multi-Year Plan contains programs and projects to be accorded priority in
order to tackle the main obstacles to achievement of national development goals and objectives, the
most pressing of which are the quality lag in public management, the poor quality of education, and
deficiencies in the provision of health services. The Dominican Government is cognizant of these
problems and is striving to correct them. It has devised a roadmap with established goals and
indicators and identified the gaps in the process. Closing these gaps is an integral part of the
objectives to be developed through the operations set forth in the framework of this Development
Policy Loan (DPL) and is a key component of the public policy content of the most recent version of
the aforementioned National Multi-Year Public Sector Plan (2011-2014).

II. Macroeconomic Developments

In the years preceding the global financial crisis (2005-2008), the macroeconomic performance of the
Dominican Republic served as a benchmark for Latin America and the Caribbean. Real GDP growth
climbed to an annual rate of 8.4 percent on average, equivalent to a cumulative increase of 40
percent, marking one of the greatest periods of expansion in 25 years, while inflation remained below
the double-digit range, averaging 6.5 percent on a year-on-year basis during that period. Revenue
collected rose to historic highs, leading to a process of fiscal consolidation. The central government‘s
primary surplus averaged 0.2 percent of GDP during that period, and the consolidated public sector
global deficit fell from 7.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to 4.4 percent in 2008. The debt-to-GDP ratio fell
by 4.6 percentage points, from 29.1 percent in 2004 to 24.5 percent in 2008.

This period of macroeconomic stability was interrupted in 2009 when the global economy
experienced the greatest contraction on record since the 1930s. The international economic crisis led
to a slowdown in local activity, while the real GDP growth rate fell to its lowest level in four years in
2009.      In terms of policy responses, the Government adopted various monetary and fiscal
expansionary measures. In the monetary policy sphere, measures ranged from lowering the policy
rate to direct cash infusions into vulnerable sectors of the economy. Expansionary fiscal policy took
the form of fiscal stimulus programs.

The Dominican Republic joined the consensus reached by most countries to implement expansionary
fiscal policies through short-term implementation, during the second half of 2009 and the first half of
2010, of a countercyclical response in the form of a fiscal stimulus of roughly 1 percent of GDP, with
priority being accorded to social spending in the vulnerable sectors and public investment being
promoted with the aim of creating a multiplier effect in the rest of the economy. In the medium term,
a fiscal consolidation process was implemented during the second half of 2010 by lowering
expenditure in the non-social spheres, with indiscriminate subsidies being targeted, and strengthening
the tax administration, thus ensuring fiscal sustainability.

The swift and coordinated monetary and fiscal policy response averted a recession in the Dominican
Republic. In 2009, the real year-on-year GDP growth rate stood at 3.5 percent and the recovery
continued with growth peaking at 7.8 percent in 2010, making the Dominican economy among the
best performing in the region. At end-2010, the inflation rate stood at approximately 6.2 percent,
close to the lower limit of the 6 to 7 percent range set by the Central Bank‘s Monetary Program and
the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. During the first quarter of 2011, the growth rate of the
economy stood at 4.3 percent, a rate lower than the one posted for the same period in the previous
year, owing to the implementation of more restrictive fiscal and monetary policies from end-2010,
while the year-on-year inflation rate stood at 7.6 percent in March 2011.

In 2010, effective average oil prices stood at US$79 per barrel. At the end of that year, oil prices
started to trend upward, surpassing US$100 per barrel in early 2011 owing, among other things, to
geopolitical factors that rocked the international markets against a backdrop of tensions in oil
production, supply, and distribution. The cyclical increase in international commodity prices,
particularly oil, impacted the country‘s macroeconomic and fiscal situation. However, the authorities
once again mounted a swift and coordinated response to blunt the impact of this situation. The
Central Bank, which was committed to the Monetary Program that sets a target inflation range of 5 to
6 percent for 2011, adopted a restrictive stance, while the Ministry of Finance, committed to fiscal
consolidation, reallocated non-social expenditure, thus offsetting the higher oil expenditure and
maintaining the projected consolidated primary surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP at end-2011.
                                                  67
In terms of the foreign sector, the current account deficit climbed to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2010,
owing to the decline in public savings following the implementation of a countercyclical fiscal
policy. This deficit has been financed by foreign investment and portfolio investment capital inflows,
which in turn increased international reserves, with this figure climbing to US$2.5 billion in the first
quarter of 2011. The current account deficit is expected to fall slightly toward end-2011 owing to the
fact that the increase in oil prices will be offset to some degree by the weaker domestic demand and
the increase in mining exports.

III. Macroeconomic Program

The fiscal stimulus implemented at end-2009 to boost economic activity was maintained in 2010.
During this period, the role of fiscal policy as the stabilizer of cyclical effects was reestablished. In
2010, total revenue, including grants, amounted to RD$259.2 billion, equivalent to 13.6 percent of
GDP, representing a nominal variation of 12.8 percent relative to 2009. Primary expenditure
amounted to RD$271.4 billion, corresponding to 14.3 percent of GDP, a 5.9 percent increase relative
to the previous year.

As of end-2010, transfers to the electricity sector were double the originally programmed amount.
The Government had to increase transfers by 0.6 percent of GDP which, by year-end, stood at 1.2
percent of GDP. The adjustment to offset greater subsidies to the sector was made by redistributing
primary, non-social expenditure, in particular by decreasing government spending and keeping
capital expenditure below the projected amount. In September 2010, Congress approved the first
budget amendment aimed at restructuring total expenditure. As a result of this measure, capital
expenditure stood at 3.8 percent of GDP, below the programmed amount in the Stand-By
Arrangement with the IMF and close to the level posted in 2009. In addition, toward end-2010, a
decision was made to increase electricity rates by 11 percent, thus mitigating the risk of further
slippage in relation to the fiscal goals set forth in the Arrangement.

As a result, the overall central government deficit was 2.5 percent of GDP in 2010, slightly above the
target set in the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. This slippage indicates that the redistribution
of primary expenditure, excluding transfers to the electricity sector, was inadequate to offset the
effect of the subsidies to the sector, which were higher than the programmed amount, and the slow
rebound in tax revenue. Tax revenue was below the amount stipulated in the Arrangement by
roughly 1 percentage point of GDP.

The second phase of the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, beginning in the second half of 2010,
included a consolidation phase that began with the gradual phasing out of the monetary incentive and
a slower increase in public expenditure. The consolidated public sector fiscal balance posted a deficit
of 4.1 percent of GDP, 0.2 percentage points above the target set with the IMF, reflecting the slippage
in the non-financial public sector.

The 2011 budget made provisions for continuation of the fiscal consolidation process started in the
first half of 2010, with a stipulation being made for an increase in the primary balance via a reduction
in primary expenditure, consistent with medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability. However,
beginning in early 2011, revenue collected fell below projected levels. Concomitantly, during the
first quarter, international oil and commodity prices rose unexpectedly, in particular in the oil market
where the projected price was US$83, a situation that exerted pressure on the primary balance as a
result of higher transfers to the electricity sector.

                                                   68
This situation led to the proposal to amend the original budget through a reformulation that factors in
the change in the macroeconomic and fiscal environment. The proposal provides for an increase in
primary expenditure in the amount of RD$8.1 billion as a result, in part, of greater transfers to the
electricity sector relative to the initially programmed amounts. To this end, the President announced
an austerity program that includes a 12 percent cut in non-social primary expenditure. An additional
offsetting measure was adopted in June in the form of another electricity rate increase of 9 percent,
reflecting higher energy costs.

To shore up the financial position of the electricity sector and thus reduce current transfers to the
sector in 2012, the Government will implement a series of measures revolving around a ―technical
rate,‖ which would cover a portion of the distribution losses and would contain an automatic
adjustment mechanism that would reflect the changes in production, transmission, and distribution
costs. In this regard, despite the inherent risks in oil price volatility, measures aimed at strengthening
the electricity system will be continued given the significant proportion of thermal sources of energy,
reflecting the Government‘s continuing commitment to the recovery of the sector, in line with the
Stand-By Arrangement and loan conditionalities agreed upon with the World Bank and Inter-
American Development Bank.

Action has been taken with the aim of achieving this objective, which began with replacement of the
directors of the three electricity companies [empresas de distribución eléctrica EDEs] with
professionals possessing the relevant management experience. This has facilitated the ramping up of
the administrative streamlining initiative being conducted in the sector, such as the conversion by the
electricity companies of more than 70 percent of residents in former Blackout Reduction Program
[Programa para la Reducción de Apagones PRA] areas into regular customers, the installation of
meters, and effective measures to combat theft, among other things, with the aim of improving the
medium-term outlook for the sector.

In the area of tax revenue, in June 2011 Congress approved a tax reform measure by means of Law
139-11, aimed at boosting revenue. This reform attests to the commitment of the authorities to
maintaining fiscal sustainability. The reform creates new taxes primarily targeting casinos and
gambling institutions and well as the banking sector and corporations.

In July 2011, the fifth and sixth reviews of the Stand-By Arrangement were completed, which
determined that most of the quarterly fiscal and macroeconomic targets of the program had been
satisfactorily met. Despite compliance with the target for the consolidated public sector, the central
government deficit was slightly higher than the programmed amount as a result of the increase in the
electricity subsidy and the collection of a moderate amount of revenues.

Beginning in 2012, the consolidation of the fiscal accounts should reflect a primary surplus balance
of 2 percent of GDP on a sustained basis in the years ahead, which should permit consolidated public
debt to return to pre-crisis levels in the medium term, with this amount standing at 30 percent of
GDP.

IV.    Government Program for the Social Sectors: Reforms for the Programmatic Loan

The Dominican Republic is currently better equipped to protect its poorest citizens from the effects of
the crisis. The Government has been developing and institutionalizing a targeted social protection
system that protects low-income population groups, strengthens policy guidelines pertaining to
education, health, and nutrition, and focuses on energy subsidy policies. This model involves three
                                                 69
entities that operate under the Office of Social Policy Coordination [Gabinete de Coordinación
Política Social GCPS]. The Vice President of the Dominican Republic serves as the Coordinator of
the GCPS, which is charged with the following specific and interrelated tasks:

i)     The Sistema Único de Beneficiarios (Single Beneficiary Selection System, SIUBEN).
       Implemented in 2004, SIUBEN is a mechanism that promotes transparent and objective
       targeting of social programs through the identification and socioeconomic assessment of
       potential beneficiaries. SIUBEN‘s database currently contains information on 1.7 million
       homes (almost 60 percent of the homes in the Dominican Republic), approximately 720,000
       of which are classified as moderately and extremely poor households that meet the eligibility
       requirement to receive social protection program benefits under the Conditional Cash Transfer
       Program. Furthermore, in its register of eligible persons, SIUBEN has identified households
       eligible for targeted cooking gas (Bonogas) and electricity (BonoLUZ) subsidies, bringing the
       total number of households living in extreme and moderate poverty and lower middle class
       families to 830,000. With financial support from the World Bank, all logistical and
       operational planning tools were developed during the first half of 2011 so that the new census
       survey containing 2011 information could be conducted starting in August.

ii)    The Solidaridad Program. Established in late 2005, this program marks a shift in the focus
       of social assistance by explicitly orienting transfers toward investment in human capital
       investment by the beneficiaries. It seeks to help break the intergenerational transmission of
       the causes that generate and allow poverty to take root by boosting the investment that poor
       households can make in education, health, and nutrition, thereby increasing the human capital
       accumulation of their children. The program essentially has two components. First, the Health
       Component, with four basic lines of action: (a) Prevention: the provision, free of charge, of
       services outlined in the Basic Health Care Plan for (i) pregnant women between the ages of 15
       and 49 years; (ii) boys and girls between the ages of 0 and 5 years; and (iii) adolescents
       between the ages of 10 and 15 years; (b) Support for Older Adults through the provision of a
       monthly cash transfer of RD$400.00 (US$11.14) and preventive medicine programs; (c)
       Food Support, through the Comer es Primero transfer for the provision of staple foods
       equivalent to RD$700.00 (US$19.50) per month and the distribution of powdered
       micronutrient supplements; and (d) Health Promotion and the Education Component. Looking
       ahead to the 2009-2010 school year, the Program redesigned the education intervention
       scheme to ensure that in addition to the current coverage for six to sixteen-year-olds, five-
       year-olds receive one year of preschool education, to expand access to the first cycle of
       secondary education and contribute to the reduction of the number of overage students, with a
       monthly per beneficiary transfer of RD$150.00 (US$4.20).42
iii)   The Administradora de Subsidios Sociales (Administrator of Social Subsidies ADESS).
       With a view to separating the payment function from the beneficiary identification and
       selection function, this entity was established to manage the mechanism for the payment of
       transfers, namely, the Solidaridad card. This debit card, which is valid in the national
       financial system platform, is used by establishments belonging to the Red de Abasto Social
       (RAS)—the network of establishments affiliated with the Solidaridad program—comprised
       primarily of retail grocery stores known as colmados.


42
   The program proposed gradually transitioning to a new transfer scheme where transfers are
increased with each grade successfully completed.

                                                 70
However, owing to the turbulent international economic situation, in which the poorest tend to
abandon investment in their human capital and, in so doing, reduce their chances of overcoming
poverty using their own resources, the Government anticipated an increase in demand for
interventions to protect the wellbeing of the population. Consequently, the prevailing economic
context heightens the need to allocate expenditure on social protection in a more effective and
efficient manner.

In this regard, the Government‘s policy priority with respect to social protection is to protect the
poor, while improving the performance of institutions and transparency in the allocation and use of
resources earmarked for the social sectors. The key areas of progress with regard to the
implementation of government programs, which are specifically linked to the objectives of the
Programmatic Loan, are as follows: (i) improved results in the social sectors to enhance the human
capital of the poorest; (ii) improved budget management to support the joint performance of the
social sectors under the redesigned Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program; (iii) the gradual
introduction of performance agreements in the social sectors; and (iv) greater transparency in national
budget execution, with special emphasis on social programs such as Solidaridad, and enhanced civil
society oversight in the social sectors.

(i)    Improved results in the social sectors to enhance the human capital of the poorest
An important component of this first pillar is the use of public resources to provide a more equitable
distribution of opportunities. The Dominican Republic has improved and continues to improve its
social networks, with a view to insulating the poor against the effects of the recent exogenous shocks,
including the food and oil crises of mid-2008 and the ongoing financial and economic global turmoil.

With objectives similar to those found in other programs in the region, Solidaridad promotes
investment in health, nutrition, and education (in human capital) for the poorest through a monthly
cash incentive. Achievements in this respect have been substantial: (i) the Government moved away
from its traditional clientelist model of social policy-making, developing and institutionalizing the
SIUBEN as a mechanism for targeting eligible citizens; (ii) the authorities allocated social subsidies
and transfers in a more efficient manner; (iii) this new social assistance plan enhanced transparency
in the allocation and use of public resources, with clear identification of the beneficiaries and the
amounts earmarked for each transfer or subsidy for each eligible household; (iv) the Government
strengthened its capacity to respond in a timely manner to natural disasters or economic crises such as
the oil and food price hikes; and (v) this mechanism led to substantial fiscal savings, through
targeting of the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy, for example; savings are also expected with
the dismantling of the geography-based subsidy system (PRA) and implementation of the BonoLUZ
subsidy through the Solidaridad card and program.
The foregoing notwithstanding, the Government, by means of Decree No. 118-09, redesigned and
strengthened the Social Protection System and its participating entities in order to enhance its
efficiency, transparency, and coordination. To carry out this mandate, the Office of Social Policy
Coordination established the Interinstitutional Technical Committee as a coordination forum for the
three entities—Solidaridad, SIUBEN, and ADESS—which facilitated the development of the manual
on crosscutting processes for the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Program. These processes have
clearly helped to conceptually redefine and strengthen Solidaridad’s role as a conditional cash
transfer program, thus avoiding the risk of losing focus of the Program‘s original objective by
including in its operational mandate unconditional subsidies such as BonoGas and BonoLUZ, which
occurred with the redesign of the Solidaridad Program that was implemented in 2010.

                                                  71
Cognizant of the fact that the co-responsibilities system could not be implemented owing to
shortcomings in available social services and intersectoral coordination efforts, the Government
initiated a process in February 2009 to strengthen the Solidaridad Conditional Cash Transfer
Program, with a view to building its capacity to promote human capital and enhance its efficiency.
Accordingly, the Office of Social Policy Coordination established the Solidaridad Intersectoral
Technical Committee to improve its operational coordination with the social sectors (education and
health) and with those responsible for allocating resources (Ministry of Finance), and avoid
duplication of efforts and systems, so as to strengthen the comprehensive and systematic verification
process designed to ensure compliance by the target beneficiary population with the co-
responsibilities required by this program. Improvements are currently being made in the areas of
institutional coordination and organizational development of the Solidaridad Program, with a view to
efficient functioning of the redesigned CCT program. This improvement effort involves the approval
of regulations that will govern the functioning of the CCT Interinstitutional Committee (ADESS,
SIUBEN, and Solidaridad) and the CCT Intersectoral Committee (education, health, Solidaridad).

The foregoing facilitated adjustments to the transfer, co-responsibilities, and training plan for
beneficiaries to ensure closer alignment with sectoral priorities, programs, and standards, as well as
the promotion of behavioral changes associated with the causes of sectoral challenges, all of which is
set forth in the manual for the Solidaridad CCT Program. Thus, with respect to health, the Program is
aligned with the promotion and prevention component of the Basic Health Plan for the poor, the
majority of whom are enrolled in the subsidized health program. In the case of education, the
redesigned Solidaridad program covers preschool education and the first cycle of secondary
education, both of which are objectives in the education sector‘s plans.

With a view to ensuring transparency in the Solidaridad CCT Program, the Government implemented
a plan to expand the network of RAS-affiliated establishments, at which beneficiaries use the social
transfers to make purchases. This plan seeks to (i) promote competition among participating
businesses; (ii) broaden the range of products available at the establishments; and (iii) reduce the
transaction time and costs for beneficiaries. Assessments of the RAS were conducted during the first
quarter of 2011 and information was gathered from a sample group of colmados and beneficiaries,
with IDB support. The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations emanating
from this assessment.

Other objectives of the restructuring of the Solidaridad CCT Program include (i) the deconcentration
and automation of its operational cycle and the strengthening of the community organizational
structure, aimed at lowering costs and improving services provided to beneficiaries; and (ii) the
introduction of a monitoring and evaluation system to strengthen planning, management and
accountability. This process was launched with the Social Protection Evaluation Survey (EEPS)
conducted in late August 2010; the second EEPS (EEPS-2011) was conducted in June 2011 to
provide follow-up on households. In both cases, the Government has received financial support from
the World Bank, through scaling-up of the Social Protection Investment Program (SPIP), and the
Inter-American Development Bank, through the Social Protection Support Program (First Phase)
(DR-L1039).

Alignment and synergies with education and health policies

Education: Among the goals of the Ten-Year Education Plan for 2008-2018, which are in line with
human capital promotion of the poor, are (i) the mobilization of public and private will in order to
ensure that five-year-olds receive one year of preschool education followed by eight years of
                                                72
inclusive and quality basic education; (ii) the strengthening, expansion, and diversification of
secondary education and quality education for adults, with a view to instilling civic responsibility and
paving the way to the job market and/or higher education; (iii) the establishment of clear quality
standards and an evaluation system that makes it possible to monitor the performance of the
education system, promotes the mobilization of schools, families, and communities for an improved
education system, and ensures that certificates and degrees awarded are reflective of the training
provided; and (iv) the promotion of educational equity, with support for students from the most
vulnerable social groups. In order to ensure that, beginning at age five, the population receives a
minimum of nine years of preschool and basic education, and to assess the quality of the knowledge
acquired, the Ministry of Education established student assessment criteria for preschool and the first
cycle of primary school.

The intervention, which is in line with the redesigned Solidaridad CCT Program‘s objectives of
strengthening capacity and intersectoral collaboration between the Ministry of Education and the
Solidaridad program in order to verify and monitor compliance by beneficiaries with the Program‘s
co-responsibilities, as well as results in the education sector, is reflected in the establishment of a
Sistema de Gestión de Centro Escolar (School Administration System SGCE) by the Ministry of
Education. The SGCE has been operational since 2009 and currently covers all regions, districts, and
centers.

Health: The key objective is to strengthen the first level of health care in order to increase access by
the poor to better quality basic health services. The Ministry of Public Health has been working on a
plan aimed at strengthening infrastructure, equipment, human resources, medicines, and other inputs
at the primary and secondary health care levels. One aspect of this effort is the introduction of a new
system of compliance monitoring tools and protocols.


ii) Improved budget management to support the joint performance of the social sectors under the
redesigned Conditional Cash Transfer Program

The reforms of the policies in this pillar build on previous measures, which were implemented in
2006 and designed to strengthen public sector institutions in the areas of budget and finance
management. One innovation introduced by these reforms is multi-year budgeting in the public
sector, which must be executed based on the processes and outcomes of multi-year planning. As
previously indicated, as stipulated by law, the Ministry of Finance defines the multi-year income and
expenditure framework, that is, the comprehensive framework for financial conditions. Multi-year
planning, including public investment planning, is conducted on the basis of this obligation, and
based on this planning, multi-year and annual budgeting, which sets physical goals for priority
production in the public sector, is executed.

The current coordination effort between the Solidaridad program and sectoral institutions ties in with
this innovative approach to the planning and budgeting processes. Process and output gaps were
identified in conjunction with the institutions. In order to bridge the supply gaps created by
implementation of the Solidaridad program, the Government pinpointed these gaps, with a view to
meeting the additional demand generated by the new transfer system. As a result, investment needs
over the next three years required for alignment of the supply of services with demand have been
assessed jointly with the sectoral institutions.

In order to ensure transparency in the use and allocation of public funds, the Intersectoral Technical
                                                  73
Committee, of which the Ministry of Finance is a member through the Directorate General of Budget,
established a mechanism by consensus. Under this mechanism, resources allocated in the 2010-2012
budget to cover supply gaps cannot be used for any purposes other than those established in the three-
year assessment and implementation schedule presented by the Coordinator of the Social Policy
Office to the Ministry of Finance for the gradual closing of the gaps. Likewise, at the operational
level, it was proposed that the Financial Management Information System (SIGEF) could generate
alert reports to facilitate follow-up and monitoring by the Intersectoral Committee.


iii) Gradual introduction of performance agreements between policy-making bodies and the social
sectors

Results-based and performance contracts are an innovation currently being implemented. These
instruments operationalize the results-based management approach in public administration,
specifically with respect to budget management and accountability. They were designed to establish a
flexible managerial link between the budget sources provided and the desired improvements in the
performance of the social sector, specifically in the areas of health and education. These contracts
include commitments regarding (i) verifiable compliance with goals and objectives, which can be
monitored by performance indicators set forth in the results-based and performance contracts; (ii)
greater managerial flexibility—for the implementing entity—in the enforcement of regulations
governing execution, human resources, and inputs; and (iii) possibly, budget incentives for the
implementing entity and/or incentives for managerial staff and employees during the term of the
results-based contract.

In this connection, both agreements were signed in 2008 by representatives from the policy-making
bodies and the health and education ministries. These agreements reflected the political will of these
ministries to proceed with the establishment of basic conditions, which would involve institutional
strengthening efforts and processes to facilitate conclusion of the results-based contract with policy-
making bodies (Ministries of Health; Public Administration and Economy; and Planning and
Development). Both agreements are currently being concluded by the Ministries of Education and
Health and the policy-making bodies.

Internal Health Management Agreements. In addition, in the case of health, two management
agreements have been concluded between the Ministry of Health and the regional health offices in
Cibao Central and El Valle, in which the Ministry promotes, as part of its management role, the
deconcentration and decentralization of public health services. The commitments, objectives, and
goals are set forth in these agreements and serve as a guide for actions regarding the provision of
health care to persons in population groups identified as priorities, based on the stipulations in the
legal framework governing the separation of functions and the establishment of health services
networks.

iv) Greater transparency in national budget execution and civil society oversight in the social
sectors

The Government remains committed to enforcing the existing Access to Information Law in the
Dominican Republic. The aim, with respect to this three-year Programmatic Loan in particular, is to
strengthen access to information on national budget execution. To that end, the IT platform was
created, and the Ministry of Finance is on the verge of operationalizing the Consulta Amigable
system, which will provide up-to-date information on execution by institutions.
                                                  74
In order to make the actions of the Social Policy Office transparent, the entities belonging to the
Social Protection System published the list of eligible beneficiaries, as well as the amounts
transferred through the Solidaridad CCT Program, which may be verified on the websites of any of
these entities. More recently, in a bid to enhance transparency in public expenditure, the value of the
supply gaps for the health, nutrition, and education services was published, which, for the three-year
period (2010-2012), totaled US$323.7 million. In addition, the Government has committed to
ensuring that civil society will not only have access to information, but will also be able to participate
in the assessment of the performance of the social sectors. In this context, the Government is already
working to strengthen the community participation and social oversight system of the Conditional
Cash Transfer Program.

In this regard, the Ministry of Finance will officially launch the Consulta Amigable (CA) tool as a
public access interface with the Financial Management Information System (SIGEF). This portal
attests to the Government‘s commitment to ensuring transparency in financial transactions conducted
by the public sector.

With a view to establishing the community participation and social oversight plan to monitor the
availability of health and education inputs and management of CCT services, which relate to
compliance by beneficiary families with co-responsibilities, a community reporting pilot project was
carried out between April and June 2011 in the context of the Núcleos de Familias Solidarias.43 This
pilot was conducted with a sample of 750 beneficiary households, health service providers, education
service providers, food suppliers (RAS), community organizations, and Program liaisons.

The community reporting process is used to ascertain the views of the beneficiaries on the services
they receive from the Program, as well as from the health, education, and food services providers
(RAS). It also helps determine the providers‘ own opinion of the services they provide and the
collaborative search for solutions to problems. Approval of the proposal for nationwide rollout of the
pilot will be contingent on the results of this pilot, which will be presented in September to the CCT
Intersectoral Committee.

In view of these actions in the Government‘s program, this three-year programmatic loan in the
amount of seventy million United States dollars (US$70 million) for Performance and Accountability
of Social Sectors is of special importance, and falls under the country‘s new joint strategy with this
financial institution.

We wish to express our gratitude to the World Bank for its ongoing support to the Dominican
Republic.

Very truly yours,


Juan Temístocles Montás                                                            Daniel Toribio

  The Núcleos de Familias Solidarias are groups of beneficiaries of the Solidaridad program, which were created
primarily to promote the active participation of these beneficiary families in meetings to discuss a variety of topics, chief
among which is compliance with co-responsibilities.

              DOMINICAN REPUBLIC—ASSESSMENT LETTER FOR THE WORLD BANK

                                              October 4, 2011

This letter updates the IMF staff assessment included in the latest report discussed by the IMF
Executive Board at the time of the Fifth and Sixth Reviews in July 2011 under the Stand-By
                                                                1
Arrangement (SBA) (see the Press Release No. 11/286). Since then, an IMF mission visited Santo
Domingo in early September 2011 to carry out discussions on the seventh review under the program
                                         2
(see the Press Release No. 11/335). Further discussions were conducted during the Annual Meetings
in Washington DC in late September 2011. Discussions were productive but an agreement has not
been reached yet.

1. Overall macroeconomic conditions remain broadly favorable despite a worsening in the
global economy. After growing vigorously at 7¾ percent in 2010 (closing the output gap), real GDP
growth decelerated in the first half of 2011 to about 4 percent (yoy). Residual pass-through from
higher commodity prices still weighed heavily on inflation, with headline CPI reaching 10¼ percent
(yoy), well over the 5–6 percent target. However, the monetary tightening cycle that started in late
2010 helped to limit second-round inflationary effects, with core inflation in August 2011 reaching
6¼ percent (yoy), up from 4¼ percent in December 2010. Also in the first half of the year, credit
rating agencies upgraded the Dominican Republic‘s country risk from B to B+ and the government
issued US$500 million in bonds in the international market in July 2011.
2. Risks have shifted to lower growth and higher inflation. Against the background of a
deteriorating global economy, growth projections for 2011 have been revised downward to 4–5
percent (from 5–5½), and inflation projections have been revised upward to 7–8 percent. The
expected current account deficit for 2011 was revised upward by ⅓ of a percentage point of GDP to
about 8 percent, reflecting delays in gold exports. A further weakening in global economy, would
adversely affect tourism and remittances flows, put pressure on credit markets and international
reserves, and soften economic activity further.
3. There were some deviations on fiscal targets for end-June 2011. Mostly reflecting a large
overrun in the electricity sector deficit due to lack of price flexibility as energy cost rose (0.6 percent
of GDP deviation in the target), there was a deviation to the consolidated fiscal deficit for end-June
2011 (0.2 percent of GDP). The rest of performance criteria have been observed and there was
progress in observing most structural benchmarks. However, the authorities still have to design and
implement a strategy to adopt the cost-recovery ―technical tariff‘ and the flexible pricing mechanism,
which are important benchmarks for end-September 2011.

4. The authorities continue implementing the consolidation phase of the program. Fiscal
tightening is broadly on track. A number of corrective measures were adopted in mid2011 to
safeguard the target of a consolidated fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 2011 (from 4.1 percent of
GDP in 2010) and to offset growing electricity subsidies. Measures included: (i) an increase of 8
percent in electricity tariffs in May; (ii) a tax package yielding 0.4 percent of GDP approved in June;
and (iii) a 12 percent cut in non-social expenditure spelled out in the supplementary budget approved
in July. The authorities report that the 2012 budget will be broadly in line with the envisaged 2
percent of GDP consolidated deficit included in program projections, although there might be
additional expenditure pressures in the run-up to the election. Monetary policy remains on hold but
attentive since May 2011, which is appropriate given the supply-driven and one-off nature of recent
shocks.

5. Discussions are expected to continue in the next several weeks and a mission is tentatively
scheduled for November 2011. Given delays in completing the seventh SBA review, staff and the
authorities are devising a work program to conduct the seventh and eighth SBA reviews jointly later
in the year. Completion of the 2 reviews would facilitate access to external financing in the amount of
about US$800 million (1½ percent of GDP).

presented in the main text.44 Both a deterministic model and a stochastic approach introducing
Monte-Carlo simulations have been applied using Analytica© software.

A6.1: Recent developments

2.      Public debt levels in the Dominican Republic rose sharply in 2003-2004 in the context of the
domestic financial and economic crisis, as growth slowed down and fiscal accounts deteriorated.
Central Bank debt (mainly domestic) increased as a result of the bailout of the banking sector.
However, beginning in 2005 consolidated debt was brought back to 34.3 percent and has been
relatively stable since then. Some of the trends observed in the last six years are a progressive
reduction in Central Bank debt levels (from 18.3 percent of GDP in 2004 to 13.4 percent in 2010); an
increase in Central Government debt from 17.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 23.7 percent in 2010; and
an increase between 2009-2010 in the share of public external debt (due to larger multilateral
financing in the context of global crisis, as well as to the favorable terms of the PetroCaribe
agreement with Venezuela).

  This debt sustainability analysis relies on information provided by the General Directorate of Public Credit, Ministry of
Finance, in what regards real interest rates, maturity profile of the debt and expected debt amortizations in future years for
the non-financial public sector debt. Public debt is defined as the debt obligations of the consolidated public sector,
including the central Government, central bank and other public sector entities. Public debt is measured as gross debt, i.e.
the bonds owned by agencies within the Government are not netted out from the total value of debt.

A6.2: Debt Sustainability

3.     The Dominican Republic‘s public debt is projected to decline steadily in the medium term
under the baseline scenario which is characterized by: (i) sustained growth averaging 5.5 percent of
GDP in the period 2011-2016; (ii) an average primary surplus of 1.1 percentage points of GDP; (iii)
an average annual nominal depreciation of 3.0 percent; and (iv) an average inflation rate of 5.1
percent. The alternative historical scenario45 assumes (i) 5.16 percent GDP growth, (ii) 0.3 percent
primary surplus, (iii) 11.1 percent depreciation and (iv) 12.4 percent inflation over the next five years.
The no policy change scenario assumes a constant primary balance over the forecast period.

4.       Under the baseline scenario, the debt to GDP ratio would decline from 37.4 percent in 2010 to
35.3 percent in 2012 and 28.3 percent in 2016. Assuming historical averages would prevail (scenario
A.1), public debt would decline to 35.5 percent by 2016. Assuming a constant and persistent primary
deficit (scenario A.2), public debt levels would rise to 39.1 percent in 2016 (Table A6.1).

                                                 Source: Staff calculations.

5.      Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the potential impact of isolated and
simultaneous shocks on several variables. As illustrated in Figure A6.2, a primary balance shock and
sudden currency depreciation are the main risks to debt sustainability in the Dominican Republic.
Finally, a simultaneous shock encompassing reduced growth, higher interest rates and accelerated
peso depreciation would increase debt to 48.6 percent of GDP in 2012.

6.     Stochastic simulations assign low probabilities to extreme scenarios. Stochastic simulations
produce confidence intervals for the public debt ratios corresponding to varying degrees of
uncertainty for four key macroeconomic variables: (a) domestic interest rates, (b) the growth rate, (c)
the exchange rate, and (d) the foreign interest rate. Assuming an average primary surplus of 1.1
percentage points of GDP in the period 2011-2016, there is a 90 percent probability that the public
debt to GDP ratio will remain between 25 and 32.1 percent (Figure A6.3). Under an alternative
scenario where the primary deficit stays at the last decade‘s average level of 0.3 percent of GDP, the
90 percent confidence interval for the public debt to GDP ratio would become 28.3-37.8 percent.

7.      In sum, under reasonable assumptions consolidated public debt in the Dominican Republic
will remain sustainable, with a reasonable prospect of presenting a declining path. Special attention
has be paid to potential exchange rate shocks, especially in the context of global economic turmoil, as
a sudden depreciation could cause an increase in the debt levels and severe debt refinancing
problems. Raising reserve levels to around 2.5 months of imports may be seen as a desirable
objective. Additionally, ensuring fiscal discipline, reducing tax exemptions and implementing
reforms in the electricity sector would also help to ensure debt sustainability.

                  Annex 7: Macroeconomic outlook: Recent fiscal developments

1.      The following sections provide an overview of key developments in the Government‘s fiscal
policy framework, including tax reforms, spending cuts and progress on electricity sector reforms.

A7.1: Tax reforms

2.      In June 2011, the Government submitted a draft bill for tax reform to Congress that initially
included the following measures:
 A 1 percent tax on the financial assets of the banking sector
 A 10 percent unified tax on gambling and lottery, for income tax purposes
 An upper limit for the exemption on real estate property tax raised to RD$6 million (US$
    162,000), but now applying to the sum of real estate assets by owner (instead of property
    individually exceeding RD$5 million)
 A reduction in the tax on dividends from 25 percent to 10 percent
 An increase on tax withholdings applied to payments for goods and services by Government
    entities from 0.5 percent to 5 percent

3.     According to Ministry of Finance estimates, these measures would have yielded an additional
RD$9.9 billion in tax collections in 2011 and RD$7.4 billion in 2012, equivalent to 0.46 percent and
0.30 percent of GDP, respectively.

4.      Several of the proposed reforms were widely debated among stakeholders. In light of the
fiscal urgency, the measures were passed by the National Congress in less than a month, but with
substantial modifications. The following are the main policies included in the final decree:

   A temporary increase in the corporate income tax from 25 percent to 29 percent, valid for 2 years
   A temporary 1 percent tax on the financial assets of the banking sector, limited to 24 months
   A new 2.5 percent income tax on free zones sales in the local market
   The originally proposed 10 percent unified tax on gambling and lottery (for income tax purposes)
    was substituted by specific operation fees (e.g. a fixed fee depending on the size of the casino)

5.      The increase in tax revenue resulting from these measures is estimated to reach 0.26 percent
of GDP in 2011, as the increase in corporate income tax will start to affect collections only in 2012.
Additionally, tax administration measures such as the indexation of the excise tax on fuels, improved
control on tax exemptions and the indexation of excise tax on motor vehicles are expected to yield a
0.18 percent increase in revenues in 2011, for a total estimated increase of 0.44 percent of GDP.

A7.2: Spending cuts

6.      In order to safeguard its fiscal position and comply with the 2011 fiscal targets in an adverse
context of increasing food and energy prices, the President announced a series of austerity measures
in March 2011, including a 12 percent cut in public spending (except for social sectors and the
transfers to the electricity sector) for the rest of 2011. The Government also announced that no new
infrastructure projects would be initiated in 2011. In addition to the cuts, the Government announced
new public contracting procedures in the energy area, so that only energy-saving equipment is
acquired. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance would be allowed to ―discount‖ the electricity bill
from the budget assigned to different public administrations at every level, in order to ensure

                                                  84
payment. Finally, the Government is also supporting the conversion of transport units to natural gas,
in order to save around US$25 million in fuel imports. Overall, initial Government estimates
suggested that the austerity plan would reduce expenditures in 2011 by 1.1 percent of GDP.

7.      The spending cuts were later modified as it became clear that the transfers to the public
electricity sector (CDEEE) were set to almost double, from the budgeted US$350 million to US$690
million. In the modified budget, approved by Congress in July 2011, capital expenditure was cut by
7.5 percent and some current expenditure items were also cut back (including a 5 percent cut in the
provision of health services, though education spending was protected) to finance the increased
transfers to CDEEE. In addition, the Government resorted to additional financing from PetroCaribe to
make up for reduced disbursements from externally-financed investment projects.

A7.3: Progress on Electricity Sector Reforms

8.      The Dominican Republic has long been plagued by the underperformance of its electricity
sector, including unreliable supply and financial troubles. This is a key constraint to growth because
of its impact on the business climate. But it has also created an important fiscal problem, as the
deficit of the public electricity sector has been covered by transfers from the treasury, representing on
average 10 percent of total primary expenditures between 2006 and 2010. Solving the challenges in
the sector is therefore key to ensure that public resources are freed up for programs in priority sectors.

9.      The authorities have made considerable progress towards reforming the sector, but challenges
remain. In December 2009, the authorities presented a detailed plan for the reform of the sector,
consistent with the medium-term budget balances agreed in the IMF program. The main objectives of
the electricity sector reforms are to: (i) provide reliable service to all clients; (ii) eliminate untargeted
subsidies; (iii) differentiate generation inputs away from the current high dependence on fossil fuels;
and (iv) achieve a long term viable energy sector. Specifically, the main reform commitments
included: (i) further reform of the tariff mechanism to eliminate the gap between the current (applied)
and ―indexed‖ (generation costs included) tariffs through increased flexibility; (ii) continued
increases in the cost recovery index (CRI) which includes improvements in invoicing, collection and
reduction of operational costs (for distribution and holding companies); (iii) completed transition
from a inefficient subsidy scheme to a targeted subsidy scheme, Bonoluz; and (iv) increased
investment efforts to expand and differentiate energy generation and to improve the distribution and
transmission systems. Progress towards these commitments has been as follows:

 The tariff gap between the applied and the ―indexed‖ tariffs could not be closed because of high
  oil prices (in particular the heavy fuel oil price). However, in November 2010 and June 2011 retail
  tariffs were increased by 11 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The main action on this matter is
  the completion of the Technical Tariff Study (financed by the Bank) that determines the efficient
  tariff level and proposes a smoothing-out mechanism to return to flexible tariffs that reflect the
  actual costs of generation. Based on this technical study, legislation on the application of the new
  mechanisms for calculating changes in the tariff is expected to be approved in September 2011.
 There have been advances in the reduction of operational costs, invoicing and collecting, and
  losses in the last year: (i) costs were cut by 45 percent in CDEEE; (ii) collection increased by 13
  percent (in US$); (iii) energy costs were reduced by US$100 million through negotiations with
  generators; (iv) clients registered by EDEs increased by 0.5 million; (v) new management teams in
  3 EDEs are working on an aggressive plan to reduce losses through tele-metering and investments
  in protecting circuits from fraud and theft. The CRI does not reflect these improvements because
  past CRI figures were incorrect and have only recently been revised downwards.
                                                    85
 The transition from an inefficient subsidy scheme (the PRA) to a targeted cash transfer (Bonoluz)
  was successfully completed during 2010/early 2011. Currently there are 140,000 poor households
  who benefit from Bonoluz (subsidy equivalent to 100kwh per month of consumption). The
  challenge is to register the other 660,000 poor household that live outside the former PRA areas.
 Quality of service is improving. During 2010, power generated was 9 percent higher than in 2009
  (and 44 percent higher than in 2004). More neighborhoods receive electricity on a 24 hour basis
  and CDEEE has made important efforts to improve transparency and customer service. Thanks to
  the actions of the 3 EDEs and on-going investments (including one financed by a Bank Loan –
  Distribution Rehabilitation Loan of US$42 million), electricity losses are expected to shrink by 5-7
  percent during 2011 and an additional 4-6 percent in 2012.

10.     However, the increase in fuel prices (by 28 percent in the case of fuel oil) in the first four
months of 2011) has counterbalanced the savings generated by the measures. Another challenge is the
lack of budgetary resources for the expansion of the Bonoluz subsidy: in the 2011 budget, no
resources were allocated to the program, which made it necessary to reallocate resources from other
social programs on an incremental basis. This not only endangers the achievement of the Bonoluz
target of 250 thousand beneficiaries by end-2011, but also the expansion of other social transfer
programs.

11.     Continued structural reforms should help close the electricity sector deficit in the near future.
All three main distribution companies (EDEs) are now headed by new managerial teams. The main
objective of these managerial changes is the reconstructing of the commercial and control capabilities
of the utilities in order to reduce non-technical losses and increase cash recovery. It is expected that
the new teams will be able to increase billing and collection significantly, in particular from large
customers that will be subject to tele-metering. Initial projections of the financial gap of the
electricity sector for 2011 were in the order of US$350 million; however, due to the increase in oil
prices, the target has been increased to US$690 million.

12.     The World Bank has continued an active dialogue in the energy sector which has helped
advance important structural reforms. Past performance in this sector has been disappointing and
some of the sector critical vulnerabilities – such as strong dependency on fuels in its energy matrix –
have not yet been removed. However, with the implementation of three key reform elements: (i) a
new reforming head in CDEEE; (ii) a new professional management in EDEs, and (iii) efficient cost-
recovery tariffs to be implemented from 2011 onwards, sharp reductions in non-technical losses
(electricity theft) seem achievable. These will translate into an improved financial performance of the
sector in the medium term.

              Annex 8: The Government’s response to food and fuel price volatility

1.      In the Dominican Republic, the confluence of unstable international food prices and increased
fuel prices constitutes a significant constraint on household finances, with a disproportionate impact
on the buying power of poor households. The food and fuel price increases are transmitted to
household food baskets through cost increases in three major areas: (i) importing goods for final
consumption; (ii) producing goods with a high share of imported foods; and (iii) shipping foods. The
burden of these cost increases is estimated to be felt nearly four-fold for the poorest households
compared to the richest quintile. These repercussions affect food security in the decreased
consumption of poor households as well as their substitution of more expensive quality foods, for
cheaper foods with less nutritional value.

2.      Lessons from the 2008/2009 Crisis: The consumer price index for food more than doubled,
resulting in a severe impact on purchasing power. Increased fuel prices resulted in the exhaustion of
the annual budget appropriation for the universal liquid petroleum gas subsidy and electricity subsidy
in the first quarter. The production of various foods was partially or fully subsidized as a means to
mitigate sharply increasing food prices. By September 2008, the inflation rate reached 10.8 percent,
its highest level since December 2004, when the domestic banking crisis bankrupted four banks. At
the same time, the Social Protection System was strengthened to transition the universal gas subsidy
to a targeted transfer, Bonogas, to the poor and lower-middle class. Fiscal savings were also
reassigned to increase the coverage and amount of Solidaridad transfers to poor households to
mitigate price increases. The more complex, universal electricity subsidy was also gradually
dismantled to create a targeted electricity transfer, Bonoluz. The Dominican Republic has served as a
model for using the momentum of a crisis to rethink the delivery of subsidies, including the
introduction of well-targeted, progressive mechanisms in times of constrained resources. Other
countries, particularly much of the Caribbean, are less prepared to respond to crises given the
predominance of untargeted subsidies and the lack of well-engineered mechanisms to rapidly adjust
transfers to offset such covariate shocks.

3.      The Dominican Republic is well positioned to respond to these price increases through,
among others:
     i. A Unique Beneficiary Registry used to target social programs through a proxy means test that
        covers 60 percent of households, poor or non-poor.
    ii. Nationwide electronic payment system that uses a debit card for payments of a range of
        subsidies and transfers.
   iii. CCT program which covers 21.2 percent of households and 61.5 percent of the poor.

4.      Challenges ahead: Since mid 2010, the rise in food prices continues to outpace increases in
the general price index. The Government has responded to the 2008/2009 crisis by expanding the
coverage of Solidaridad to 60,000 additional households, along with an increase in coverage of the
targeted electricity subsidy.

                               Annex 9: Challenges and policies in the education sector

1.      The performance of the education sector remains a serious concern. Enrolment rates are above
the Latin American average, reflecting sustained progress since the 1990s, although enrolment in pre-
school and secondary school is comparatively low. The confluence of the small education budget and
high demand for enrolment has resulted in overcrowding, with multiple shifts. Analysis of the
determinants of enrollment and quality confirmed persisting challenges related to differences in
enrollment, quality and attainment across socioeconomic quintiles46. Though initial intake in primary
education is high, with minimal differences across gender or rural-urban groups, enrolment starts
decreasing by age 14 for students from the poorest socioeconomic quintile and by age 16 for students
from the wealthiest quintiles. Differences in education attainment across socioeconomic levels likely
reflect higher repetition and drop-out rates of individuals from the poorest quintile: students from the
poorest quintile spend 12 years at school to accumulate 9.6 years of education, while the wealthiest
quintile accumulate 11.8 years of education with 13 years of schooling.

2.     Quality of education is the main challenge for the education system and affects most students
regardless of socioeconomic status. The Dominican Republic has one of the lowest levels of public
spending on education in the region, as a share of GDP.47 The Dominican Republic has the lowest
performance on the SERCE test, the regional standardized exam measuring education quality.
Further, its relative position has strongly decreased since the mid 1990s. The comparisons between
measures of quality and GDP indicate overall inefficiency in the provision of education; the
Dominican Republic has the largest gap between its predicted and actual score on the SERCE test in
the region. Poor performance affects all socioeconomic groups: on average, individuals from the
wealthiest quintile perform similarly to individuals in the poorest quintile in Nicaragua (see Figures
A9.3 and A9.4).

3.      An analysis of the flow of information and resources in the education sector undertaken by the
Bank at the MINERD‘s request identified bottlenecks that hamper those flows and create
inefficiencies. The study compared the ―de jure‖ structure of the flows, as described in the bylaws
and operational manuals of the education sector, with the ―de facto‖ structure, which was constructed
with evidence from field visits and interviews with stake holders at different levels of the education
system. The overall diagnostic presented diverse profiles and duplication of functions in the system,
weak communication protocols and a top-down relationship between the central administration and
the schools. Based on the diagnostic, the study recommended an update of the operational manuals of
the sector (including job descriptions), improvement of communications processes (taking advantage
of the School Management System), improvements in the planning process (better use of the schools‘
Annual Operation Plans), and greater participation of school communities in the design of education
policies. Four main processes in the education system were analyzed in detail:

              Provision of Quality Teachers: The pedagogical Supervision process tends to be weak, with
               limited impact on teacher practices and student results, and inadequate capacity to identify
               real needs for teacher training. The study recommends an inclusive approach to pedagogical
               support that prioritizes self-evaluation, classroom observations and professional development
               plans for teachers.

              Provision of School Inputs: Interviews with school principals point to their lack of confidence
               in the current process of requesting and receiving school materials and resources, in particular
               regarding the on-time arrival and quantity to be delivered to the school. The study
               recommended that MINERD decentralize the procurement process, particularly bulk
               purchases, and use the schools‘ Annual Operation Plans to more accurately determine needs.

              Appropriation and clarity of public policies: There seems to be little appropriation at the
               school level of the education policies generated at the central level. The study recommended
               stronger technical monitoring at different levels in the education system to coordinate,
               articulate and follow-up on policies emanated from the center, and improved training of
               principals and authorities to provide the needed leadership and management capacities that
               the implementation of new policies requires.



                                                                                                     89
      Flow of Information: Overall, information flows in many directions, does not always use
       official channels, and does not provide accurate, on-time data useful for planning and policy
       making. The study reinforced the importance of the recently adopted School Management
       System to improve planning, information-based policy, and the more systematic identification
       of and response to training and resource needs (See Section III.2 below).

4.     The study was validated with different groups, including school principals, district and
regional officers, and central authorities. The main results were presented to both the previous and the
current administration at MINERD, contributing to the dialogue around concrete policy actions to
address the identified challenges. This dialogue resulted in the policy action for this proposed third
PASS operation on the deconcentration of resources and the improved use of the schools‘ Annual
Operation Plans to more accurately determine needs.

Background and issues

1.      As presented in the PD of the PASS DPL1 and DPL2, the Bank set out to provide an
analytical and policy base to examine and monitor the expected impacts of priority policy actions
supported by the PASS series. The Government embarked on a program of cross-cutting reforms that
include the reorientation of social protection efforts to human development promotion and the
simultaneous coverage of supply gaps in social sectors. The Social Cabinet and MEPD called on the
Bank to help strengthen the analytical capacity of the Government to accompany these reforms with a
strong evidence base.

The approach

2.      The PSIA process followed a sequential analytical base that informed policy, operational and
financing decision-making in line with the PASS DPLs. The PSIA approach featured a highly
participatory process with the establishment of a committee to coordinate inputs of the Social
Cabinet, MEPD, Ministry of Finance and line ministries. This committee defined the scope of the
analysis and identified major positive and negative risks of the program of reforms: (i) efforts to
bridge supply gaps in education, health and nutrition linked to the CCT program (co-responsibility
for the Government); and (ii) efforts to condition transfers to households' investments in education,
health and nutrition (co-responsibilities of the poor).

3.      The efforts resulted in an analysis of the efficiency of resource allocation in the supply-gap
program (together with a methodological toolkit and monitoring instrument to undertake such types
of analysis) and a report on the ex-ante simulation of expected impacts of the co-responsibilities in
health and education (this will be complemented with an ex-post impact evaluation). In addition, the
efforts helped build the capacity of key technical administrators and planners in the Social Cabinet
and MEPD to improve the capacity of these actors to apply the methodology to other programs in the
future. Knowledge sharing was a key part of the process, with a capacity-building workshop, the
dissemination of reports, and a high-level seminar led by the Vice-President to present results.

4.     The analytical toolkit and methodology used provides important applications for emerging
policy themes in the Dominican Republic, beyond the PASS series, such as potential targeting
mechanisms for new demands for increased educational spending. As part of the PSIA process, and
with funds from the World Bank PSIA MDTF, a political economy and stakeholders‘ analysis has
been initiated for completion by the end of 2011 to look at mechanisms to enhance the cross-
accountability agenda and results-based focus in social sectors, while taking stock of potential risks
(and mitigation measures) in the introduction of performance-based agreements on the programs to
close supply gaps. This will support the preparation of a series of policy note for the transition in
Government scheduled for 2012. Final activities are planned to fully transfer the analytical toolbox,
with the possibility of additional training for civil society organizations in the results and
methodology of this PSIA in 2012.

Methodology and data sources for the PSIA

5.      For the analysis of the impact of co-responsibilities on education enrolment and use of health
care services, the PSIA team developed ex-ante simulations – a methodology that helps simulate what
                                                  91
the impact of changes in rules is likely to be, in light of what is known about household behavior. To
do that, the team built a model that explains the behavior of households, for instance in terms of the
decision to send children to school (using household survey data). Then, the team tested how
households would react to changes (e.g. the introduction of alternative transfer schemes). In the case
of health, the team analyzed the key factors that determine households‘ use of health services such as
immunization or pre-natal services (factors such as education levels, location, number of children,
etc.). The team used the approached developed by Bourguignon, Ferreira and Leite in 2003 for Brazil
and used throughout the region. The simulation was based on data from the National survey of
household incomes and consumption (Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de los Hogares,
ENIGH) of 2007, as well as the SIUBEN.

6.      For the analysis of the incidence of programs aimed at closing supply-gaps, the PSIA
simulated different investment plans to see who would benefit from new investments, depending on
where these investments would take place. The PSIA used information with a very high resolution
(for small geographic areas) in order to have more precise estimates. It used four potential criteria
that could be used to allocate the program‘s resources, with investments focused in regions with (1)
high prevalence of households that benefit from the CCT program, (2) low net enrolment in schools,
(2) high incidence (percentage) of poverty, or (4) large numbers of poor. The analysis used
information on poverty incidence (using poverty maps), school enrolment, health care utilization and
the prevalence of existing services.

Results Area 1: Analysis of the introduction of co-responsibilities in the CCT

7.      The ex-ante micro-simulation assessed the expected impact from the introduction of co-
responsibilities in health and education. The analysis built on early findings from key stakeholders'
interviews and quantitative analysis, which pointed to the potential for positive impacts from the CCT
program to incentivize human capital accumulation among the poor, while producing positive
externalities beyond the program in targeting systems, results-based financing, transparency, and
complementary health and education efforts.

8.      The results of an ex-ante micro-simulation suggest that the introduction of education co-
responsibilities would increase school enrollment by 6 percentage points and decrease child labor by
9.2 percent. In health, the same simulation found that attendance of children under-5 by a healthcare
professional should double. Such results are in line with the results achieved by other CCTs in the
region. This analysis is also being used to estimate the potential results from other adjustments in the
design of the program, such as the differentiation of education transfers by grade level.

9.      The findings also highlighted the barriers to compliance with health and education co-
responsibilities by poor families, including lack of access to national identity documentation. To
address this risk, additional measures have been taken: (i) as of March 2011, the Central Electoral
Council, through the National Civil Registry, had issued national identity documents to 81,762 poor,
previously undocumented Dominicans that have been incorporated into the SIUBEN database,
therefore qualifying for inclusion in social programs; and (ii) the Government, in coordination with
the Central Electoral Council and the Social Cabinet, has taken additional steps to provide legal
assistance to facilitate the documentation process of still undocumented beneficiaries. Since
launching this legal assistance phase in April 2011, 16,000 individuals have been provided with
identity documents and are being incorporated into the SIUBEN database. The findings also
highlighted the potential negative externalities from the planned penalization of households for non-

                                                  92
compliance, when such non-compliance is due to gaps in the supply of basic services, and not to
household decisions.

Results Area 2: Rethinking the incidence of social spending in the Dominican Republic

10.     The PSIA also produced a Benefit-Incidence Analysis (BIA) to assess the progressivity of the
programs aimed at closing gaps in supply in health and education compared to larger public spending
in each sector. The resulting report was prepared as part of the analytical underpinnings of PASS2, to
analyze the targeting mechanism that was used in defining the selection of localities for investment in
the program aimed at closing supply gaps. Results suggest education spending is semi-progressive
overall, whereas the targeting used for program aimed at closing supply gaps may be less progressive
in practice, depending on the criteria used to target resources. The resources dedicated to the closing
of supply gaps in health are shown to be very progressive, especially when spent on refurbishing
existing UNAPS inter alia. The analysis also points to a fair calibration of the supply gap estimates
but also suggests that these should be recalculated on a yearly basis and use a mix of indicators to
increase their efficiency, including poverty maps and available services. The targeting mechanisms
that would ensure pro-poor marginal spending are currently being considered by the Government.

11.     The Benefit-Incidence Analysis (BIA) of Government spending pointed to the limited risk of
penalization of households for non-compliance due to remaining supply gaps in health and education
due to the additional measures taken by the Government under programs focused on supply gaps.
Evidence shows that education spending is somewhat progressive, whereas the targeting used for the
program focusing on supply gaps is a little less progressive in practice. The resources dedicated to the
closing of supply gaps in health appear to be very progressive. The analysis also points to a fair
calibration of the supply gap estimates but also suggests that these should be recalculated on a yearly
basis and use a mix of indicators to increase their efficiency, including poverty maps and available
services. Progress can be seen in closing supply gaps in education, health, and nutrition through
concerted efforts (new planning processes and budget protections). The Government is therefore
consolidating the gains made in institutionalizing the CCT Intersectoral Committee to increase its
oversight, including taking corrective actions to ensure an adequate pro-poor incidence and improved
level of execution of investments in closing the supply-gaps.

1.      As discussed in the document, the fiduciary risk related to the Public Financial Management
(PFM) environment in the Dominican Republic remains moderately high, though the Government has
continued to engage in reviewing, strengthening and reforming the way its public finances are
planned and managed in the last few years. The country has made good progress in passing important
reforms that targeted the FM legal framework and redefined the role of the institutions involved on
public financial management. Developing the reforms has involved not only MoF, MEPD and MPA,
but also legislative and other oversight entities concerned with quality and efficiency of budget
execution and control. Implementation has shown modest improvements as explicitly indicated in
the 2007 Performance Expenditures and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Report, and the 2010
PEFA Update. Key PFM entities show notable progress in defining their strategic plans, aligned with
the National Development Plan. Many joined activities – Government/civil society/private
enterprises/donors to strengthen key FM and oversight entities are taking place.

2.       The Government has continued to deploy and is steadily implementing a National Integrated
Financial Management Information System: the SIGEF. Its sub- system for municipalities SIFMUN
now covers almost half of the municipalities and its subsystem of implementing units with external
resources, UEPEX, is already being utilized in most projects financed by major development
partners. The integration of this system with the flurry of new (and renewed) planning instruments,
and other initiatives recently introduced including the Development Strategy, the Multi-Annual
National Plan for the Public Sector 2010-2013, the Regional Plans, the Medium-Term Sector and
Institutional Strategic Plans, and performance contracts, among others, remain a challenge. Once
existing management challenges are addressed and the integrated information system is fully
deployed to all public entities, including decentralized entities, improvements are expected in
enhanced transparency, strengthened internal controls, improved recording of accounting transactions
and greater access to quality, timely, and digestible public financial data.

3.       The main PFM oversight entities, the Contraloría General de la República (Comptroller
General, CGR) and the Cámara de Cuentas (Chamber of Accounts, CdC), are both members of the
LAC Organization for Supreme Audit Institutes (OLACEFs -Organización Latinoamericana de
Entidades Fiscalizadoras Superiores). Both are responsible for the internal and external audit
functions of the public sector, although CdC has a broader scope, since the CGR is only limited to
entities of the Central Government. Both entities are implementing concrete measures to improve
Governmental performance accountability by enhancing their capacity and staff skills in accordance
with their new legal framework. With very limited resources, both entities have been implementing
activities to improve compliance with their legal auditing mandate, largely financed by external
resources. In 2010 the CGR was granted constitutional power and the entity kept its internal control
role. To be able to comply with its auditing role, the CGR would require a substantial increase in its
workforce, along with training and capacity building, which would normally translate into greater
resource allocation; although not possible in times of scarce resources. The CdC, following
recommendations of a self assessment of its institutional arrangements performed in 2008, is
compelled to continue enhancing its effectiveness and strengthen its capability as Supreme Audit
Institution (SAI) while addressing the low public trust in the organization. Along these lines, the
Chamber has signed agreements with the European Commission, the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), and the Bank, among other donors. Both oversight entities,
CGR and CdC have also signed inter-institutional agreements with other Governmental oversight
bodies, such as the Dirección de Prevención de la Corrupción Administrativa (DPCA); however,
beyond formulation, the actual implementation of those agreements remain uncertain.

With multi-year and multi-sectoral non-lending technical assistance, institutional development trust
funds, and within the framework of the Participatory Government-Private Sector-Civil Society Anti-
Corruption Initiative (IPAC) Roundtables 3 for FM and 10 for Oversight Entities, and taking into
consideration the areas that need strengthening according to the PEFA reports, plus all strategic
plans, the WB and other donors are supporting PFM –including oversight entities. For this purpose,
civil society organizations and private enterprises are engaged on the demand side to balance
Governmental efforts for increased accountability and transparency in the management of public
funds.

A10.1: Procurement

4.     The Dominican Republic has made important advances in the Procurement Reform over the
past five years, nevertheless, substantial challenges remain. The latest Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) for the Dominican Republic was published in April 2005. Since then the
country passed Law 340-06 for Public Procurement of Goods, Works, Services and Concessions,
approved in August 2006 and later modified by Law 449-06. This law is the first to comprehensively
include all aspects of procurement of goods, works, services, the selection of consultants and
concessions in the country, while also attempting to increase competition and transparency by
allowing direct contracting only for limited circumstances specifically detailed in the law. As the
country entered into the Dominican Republic-CAFTA negotiations, the Public Procurement Law has
been validated as fully consistent with the procurement provisions of said agreement. Another
important milestone in the procurement reform was the passing of Decree No. 490-07 that provided
the enabling regulations for the new procurement law and the launching the portal
―comprasdominicana?. Nevertheless, in practice, Law 340-06 is not fully implemented and there is a
need for more transparency and efficiency in the system.

5.      The Bank has provided support to the national procurement body, Dirección General de
Contrataciones Públicas (DGCP), in the development of their National Procurement Strategic Plan as
part of the NLTA for Improving the Quality and Efficiency of Public Expenditures in the Dominican
Republic. This Plan has been incorporated into the Ministry of Finance wider Strategic Plan. The
National Procurement Strategic Plan includes activities that are to be implemented in the short-,
medium- and long-term to ensure significant improvements in the procurement system. Sustained
Government support for this Plan is crucial for procurement reform. With the support from the Bank
and other donors such as USAID, IADB and the European Union, DGCP has started some activities
indentified in their Strategic Plan. However, coordination issues between the DGCP and the Ministry
of Finance, as the implementing agency for the Integrated Financial Management System (SIGEF), is
causing additional delays to the process.

6.     The Government has expressed their interest in the application of the OECD Procurement
Indicators and has started preparations to undertake this exercise. Additionally, the conceptual
module for the Public Procurement Portal has already been developed. DGCP has also prepared the
modifications needed to strengthen the enabling regulations for Law No. 340-06, which have to be
approved by a Presidential Decree. These activities are key for the improvement of the Public
Procurement System and should be monitored to ensure the success of the reform.

A10.2: Flow of Funds
7.     The flow of funds within the Dominican Republic portfolio from Designated Accounts
denominated in US Dollars to the Operating Account in RD pesos, has continued to improve, and
most of the issues that persist on slow disbursement are procurement related. Project Implementation
                                                  95
Units (PIUs) report the cycle continues to be from three to seven days, according to discussions
during the Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) in 2009-2010. Efforts include a more
efficient release of allocated funds via the Treasury, following the cycle indicated in the new legal
framework, which included eliminating the need to involve entities which added no value to the
process, the use of modern administrative tools, such as e-banking for electronic wire transfers, and
e-disbursement through Client Connection. The combined measures show a less cumbersome and
effective flow chart. The quick count of bank accounts continues to be high. They went up from
more than 3,000 in 2007 according to the 2007 PEFA Report, to 6,000 according to the 2010 PEFA
Update. A formal inventory is already underway, as the groundwork to implement a Single Treasury
Account, as mandated by the 2005 Treasury Law. The implementation of the Single Treasury
Account will allow continuing decrease of the extra-budgetary expenses.

A10.3: Central Bank of the Dominican Republic

8.       The Financial Sector in the Dominican Republic does not apply International Financial
Reporting Standards, according to the 2004 Report on Observance of Standards of Codes on
Accounting and Auditing (ROSC A&A) Report and the 2009 ROSC A&A Update. Entities in the
financial sector adhere to specific rules issued by the respective regulatory agencies, namely, the
Superintendency of Banks (SB), the Superintendency of Insurance (SIS), the Superintendency of
Pensions (SIPEN), and the Superintendency of Values (SV). These rules, at the time of the World
Bank assessment, differ from the international standards (IFRS). The World Bank, therefore,
recommended harmonizing regulatory accounting principles for banks, insurance companies and
pension funds with IFRSs in the medium term which meant the next 1 to 2 years. No convergence
initiatives had been announced as of May 2011.

9.      An independent audit firm performed the external audit of the Central Bank of the Dominican
Republic (BCRD) for the Fiscal Year 2010. The auditors issued unqualified (clean) opinion of the
financial statements (FSs) for the audited period, in accordance with the accounting practices
followed by the BCRD. In notes 2 and 3 to the 2010 FS, the auditors mentioned that the Central
Bank does not follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It follows the policies
established by the Monetary and Finance Law (No. 183-02) and its enabling regulations, the Internal
Regulation for Accounting of the Central Bank, applicable Resolutions of the Monetary Board, and
accounting practices utilized by central banks. Although this is a clear departure from the IFRs, their
auditors attest that they represent an integral foundation for accounting. The accounting method to
prepare the FS are based on the historical cost, with the exception of the financial instruments
considered as negotiable which are measured to its reasonable value. According to Note 3.16, there
is not a unified accounting basis for recording income and expenses. Some income (investment
interest, sales of fixed assets, and staff loans) are registered on an accrued basis of accounting, while
investment discounts are horizontally amortized and commission income is recognized on the cash
basis of accounting. Likewise, expenses for interest financing for issued instruments are registered
when incurred, discounts are horizontally amortized, while other expenses are recorded using the
accrual basis of accounting.
