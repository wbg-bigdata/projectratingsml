        provided, that upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of
        the Loan, the interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on
        such amount shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of
        Article IV of the General Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
        amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-
        payment continues for a period of thirty days, then the interest payable by the
        Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 (e) of the

               behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and pay to
               itself the amounts required to pay any premium payable in accordance
               with Section 4.05 (c) of the General Conditions up to the amount
               allocated from time to time for the purpose in the table in Section II of
               Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

             withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
             following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
             Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
             Date following the date of withdrawal.

     (b)     Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
             at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which
             invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the
             provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any
             withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
     Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
     Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
     repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
     Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its
     currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
     exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency
     payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
     Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
     Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5.   If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
     the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
     in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for
     each such amount.
