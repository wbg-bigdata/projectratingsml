INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECO>MMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO TIIE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO MALAWI
FOR THE THIRD PHASE OF THE LILONCWE LAND DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed credit
to the Republic of Malawi, for the equivalent of $8.5 million, on standard IDA
terms to help finance the third phase of the Lilongwe Land Development Program.
The United Nations Capital Development Fund will help finance the project with
a grant of $1.6 million.
PART I --THE ECONOMY
2.        An updating economic mission visited Malawi in May 1974.    Its report
was discussed with the Government at the end of Novem17ber and was distributed to
the Executive Directors on January 14, 1975 (560a-MAI); country data are pro-
vided in Annex I.
3.        Since Independence, in 1964, Malawi's gross domestic product has
grown by an annual average of 8 percent in real terms.    However, with a per
capita income of only $105, Maalawi remaains one of the poorest countries in
the world and is included in the Uniced Nations list of the 25 least developed
countries. Natural resources are limited to moderately fertile soils, sub-
stantial water resources and a climate favorable to crop production. Although
bauxite and coal deposits have been discovered, their exploitation has not
yet been found commercially viable. Forests, which cover about 23 per cent
of 'falawi, constitute the main essentially unused resource whiich could be
exploited on a significant scale in the near future.
4.        The economy is however still heavily dependent on agriculture and
is subject to annual fluctuations in output. For example, real GDP dropped
by 6 percent in 1968, but rose by 18 percent in 1971. Agriculture lhas also
stimulated much of the high growth in otlher sectors. The increasing output
of export crops has directly caused a comparable increase in processing,
distributive and commercial activities, while indirectly, higher farm incomes
have stimulated the local production of consumer goods. Government policy
is oriented towards rapid growth of agricultural production and, indeed,
real per capita farm incomes have risen faster during the last two years
than incomes in the non-agricultural sectors.
5.        A substantial savings and investment effort and generally effi-
cient management of the economy have contributed to economic growth.    At
Independence, domestic savings were negligible and gross domestic invest-
ment was only 8.7 percent of GDP.   By 1973, domestic savings had increased
to 10 percent of GDP and gross domestic investment to 20 percent, leavina
a resource gap of US$48 million. A significant improvement in the financial



-2-
position of the Government lhas contributed to this impressive rise in savings.
At Independence, the Governiment was able to finance only about half of re-
current expenditure from local resources, the deficit being met by grants
and loans from the U.K. Between 1964 and 1973, however, improvements in
tax administration and some changes in the tax system caused domestic reve-
nue to rise annually by 15 percent, in comparison with an average increase
in recurrent expenditure of only 8 percent. Consequently, the Government
was able to balance its recurrent budget in 1972/73 for the first time.
6.        The Government has increased development expenditures at an
annual average rate of 20 percent over the last five years, and has laid
heavy emphasis on infrastructure and agriculture. Infrastructure investments
have included the construction and improvement of roads, particularly those
opening up the central and northern regions, and the construction of a rail
link to Nacala in Mozambique, which has provided a second rail outlet to
the sea. Since 1969, the construction of a new capital at Lilongwe has
taken up about 10 percent of the agricultural Government's annual development
budget. Since 1963, several large-scale agricultural schemes including the
supply of inputs, marketing facilities and some basic infrastructure, have
also been started (with IDA credits). Approximately one-fourth of total
Government investment has been in agriculture. Greater emphasis is now being
placed on this sector, and one-third of the US$175 million public investment
program over the next three years will be devoted to agricultural development.
7.        Total investment was US$100 million in 1973 and it is expected to
grow by 8 percent (in real terms) throughout the 1970's. A substantial role
is expected to be played by the private sector in Malawi's future development,
and private investments are expected to equal those of the public sector.
Government has liberal policies to encourage both domestic and foreign private
investment. Domestic private capital is concentrated mainly in agriculture
and small trading enterprises. Larger scale business is dominated by foreign-
owned companies.
8.        Whereas Malawi has benefited from a very rapid expansion of agri-
culture, since independence, the room for future expansion is smaller. An
annual economic orowth rate of over 6 percent seems likely in the 1970s.
Much of this will occur in the agricultural sector, as a result of increased
production of export crops such as tobacco, tea and cotton. Small but growing
surpluses of maize, pulses, groundnuts, cassava and sugar are also expected.
Malawi's agricultural exports, which increased, in constant prices, at an
average rate of nearlv 10 percent from 1964 through 1973, are projected
to rise by an average of over 6 percent annually until 1980. With the in-
creasing investment program and growing consumer demand that can only be partly
met by domestic manufactures, it is likely that the country's import require-
ments will grow more rapidly than in the past, increasing by 6 percent annual-
ly in volume until 1980. In 1973, the deficit on goods and non-factor
services was US$52 million. Capital inflow has generally been adequate to
finance deficits and build up moderate reserves. In 1973, net capital inflow
was US$70 million.



- 3 -
9.        The sustaitned improvement in the mobilization of domestic resources
for economic development is likely to continue during the rest of the decade.
Public savings, which have been negative in the past, should in the future
make a positive contribut,on to investment. In 1973, Malawi financed 52
percent of its investmert from domestic resources; this proportion should
grow to about 60 perceu.it by the end of the decade. The external capital
requirements will, h-vever, continue to be in excess of the foreign ex-
change component of projects and external aid should, therefore, also cover
some local costs.
10.       At the end of 1973, Malawi's external public debt totalled $263
million of which $189 million had been disbursed. Debt service in that
year amounted to $11.2 million, or about 10 percent of export earnings.
As Malawi's need for external capital is expected to increase in the next
few years, the Government may encounter increasing difficulty in borrowing
on terms as soft as those it has received in the past. Debt service is
likely to increase and the debt service ratio could reach 15 percent by the
end of the decade. In view of its low per capita income and the fluctua-
tions of its export earnings, Malawi should still continue to receive subs-
tantial amounts of external assistance on concessionary terms but could
also receive a limited amount of assistance on harder terms.
11.       The direct impact of the oil price increases on Malawi's balance
of payments has been relatively modest. In 1973 payments for fuel rose by
only 9 percent, and although in 1974 the increase was probably much greater,
this would not have been sufficient to cause a major loss of foreign exchange.
The indirect impact of fuel price increases in raising transport costs to
and from Malawi has been more significant. The prices of imports have risen
more rapidly than general international prices during the last year to reflect
the higher cost of fuel, and a 25 percent increase in import paymPnts was
expected in 1974, most of this resulting from higher prices. Malawi does
not rely substantially on imported food and has therefore also suffered
relatively little as a result of recent food price increases.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       To date, eleven   1/ IDA credits amounting to US$76.6 million have
been made to Malawi. Five of these credits, representing US$34 million
(44 percent of the total IDA investment in Malawi) were for projects in
the agricultural sector. The others consist of two credits totalling US$21.5
million credit for highways in 1968 and 1974, a US$6.3 million credit for
education in 1967, two credits totalling US$12.75 million for power projects
in 1970 and 1973, a US$2 million credit for the planning and engineering of
the infrastructural and technical assistance requirements of a proposed pulp
development scheme in Northern Malawi and a US$10.0 million credit for a
I/   Excluding Credit No. S-2-MAI of US$0.49 million of 1967 for highway
engineering, which was made in 1967, and which has since been refinanced.



- 4 -
second highway project both approved in 1974. There have been no bank loans
or IFC investments. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as
of January 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of on-going projects. Project
execution is generally satisfactory.
13.       At the end of 1973, IDA's share in Malawi's total external debt
was 22.6 percent buL servicing of IDA credits accounted for only 2.7 per-
cent of total debt service.
14.       Bank Group operations in MIalawi will continue to emphasize rural
development. In accordance with the recommendations of the Agricultural
Sector Review Report on Malawi (No. 235a-MAI distributed on January 14, 1974),
several projects are currently being prepared. Among these, a second phase of
the Kanonga rural development program is scheduled for appraisal in the second
half of 1975 and preparation work has been initiated on a project which
would support the national rural development program described in paragraph 20
below, which is scheduled for presentation in FY77. A second education project
is scheduled to be appraised in March 1975 and should be presented to the
Executive Directors in FY76.
15.       Finally the Bank Group is assisting the Government (through Credit
S-17 MAI) in the preparation of a major pulp development project whose total
cost is currently estimated at over $300 million. If it is established that
the project is economically viable and satisfactory arrangements can be made
for its implementation and for marketing its pulp output, and if financing
can be arranged with external guarantees so as not to burden Malawi's debt
servicing capacity, we expect to recommend that the Bank contribute to its
financing.
PARJT III - TIlE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN MALAWI
General
16.       Agriculture is the principal sector in the economy of Mlalawi.
It accounts for about half of total output and provides employment for
practically all the population of thle country. In addition, agricultural
commodities account for over 90% of the country's export earnings and pro-
vide raw materials for domestic industries. During 1964-1973, agricultural
production grew at a rate of 6 percent annually in constant prices.
17.       Whereas maize, cotton, pulses and groundnuts are grown throughout
the country, cotton and tea are produced mainly in the south, tobacco, ground-
nuts and pulses in the central region, and rice in the north. Mtaize is the
principal subsistence crop. Surplus nuantities are marketed, some directly
to shopkeepers and the rest to the Agricultural Development and Marketing
Corporation (ADMARC), a parastatal body which purchases farm inputs in bulk
for smallholders througlhout the country and distributes them to farmers



-5-
through its depots. Prices paid by ADMARC have been increased recently and
are now considered adequate in providing incentives to farmers. The Govern-
ment has agreed that ADMAkRC will review these prices from time to time to
ensure their attractiveness to farmers (see Section 4.02 of the Development
Credit Agreement).
18.       Prior to 1967, the growth of agricultural production was achieved
largely through expansion of acreage. Increasing scarcity of suitable land
and the large investments required to open up new land led to a shift of
emphasis towards achieving rapid increases in productivity on areas already
under cultivation, and the rehabilitation of land that had been neglected
in previous vears. Increased production was accompanied by a gradual mone-
tization of the agricultural sector. The implementation of integrated rural
development schemes is expected to accelerate this transition towards a cash
economy.
Rural Development
19.       Rural development is a primary social and economic objective of
the Government and is one of the targets in the country's indicative guide-
lines of a ten-year statement of policy objectives announced in 1971. Beyond
the aim of raising agricultural productivity, rural development in Malawi is
also conceived of as an effective vehicle for the Government's objective of
redistributing incomes in favor of the rural poor. At the moment, most
farmers are smallholders on the fringe of the market economy. Their staple
crop is almost exclusively maize and their principal cash crops are tobacco
and groundnuts. As an instrument of increasing smallholder productivity,
the Government is undertaking several integrated agricultural development
schemes in Lilongwe, Karonga, Shire Valley and the Salima Lake Shore area.
20.       With the exception of the Salima Lakeshore Development which is
being financed with assistance from Germany, all these schemes are being
financed with IDA assistance (Credit Numbers 113- and 244-MAI assisted in
financing the first two phases of the Lilongwe Agricultural Development
Program, Credit Numbers 114- and 363-MAI helped finance two agricultural
development projects in the Shire Valley and Credit 282-MAI is helping
finance a similar project in Karonga). In addition to extension and farmer
services, these schemes have included infrastructure components.
21.       All of these four projects are characterized by the provision of
infrastructure, extension and farmer services within relatively concentrated
areas and, at their completion, it is expected that some 1 million people
would have benefitted from them. While the intensive Projects have made
significant contributions both to institution-building and improved production
and standard of living for large numbers of people, nearly three-quarters of
Mlalawi's population still remain unaffected by these developments.    It is
necessary, therefore, to adopt a strategy which will promote more broad-based
development in an expeditious manner. With the objective of providing im-
proved production opportunities to the rest of 'Ialawi's farm population over



a 20-year period, a Bank agriculture sector mission identified in 1973 the
possibilities of a more extensive type of development which has become known
as the National Rural Development Project (NRDP). This is now under active
discussion with the Government, and is likely to form an important part of the
Bank's future contribucion to this sector.
The Lilongwe Land Development Program (LLDP)
22.       LLDP evolved in 1967 whlen the Government decided to undertake a
thirteen-year integrated rural development scheme to increase agricultural
production within the Program area. The Program was to achieve this objective
by providing substantial infrastructure facilities such as crop extraction
roads, administrative centers, market facilities and boreholes and improved
farmer services including extension, credit, input supplies, soil conservation
and land survey, demarcation and registration.
23.       An area near the new capital of Lilongwe in the central plateau
of Malawi was selected for the Program. The area has a high agricultural
potential and contains the country's main agricultural research and training
facilities. Its soils are satisfactory and permit good responses to ferti-
lizers and rainfall is adequate and reasonably reliable. About 100,000
families live in the area and the average single unit family size is five.
The farmers live together in extended family units. It is estimated that
each family in the area cultivates about five acres of land. Village com-
mittees are evolving and begirning to play an important role in assisting
authorities to demonstrate better farming practices and to organize the
activities which lead to thle improvement of village life.
24.       The Program is being implemented in three phases.    The Association
helped finance the first phase with a $6.0 million Credit (No. 113-TAI) in
1968.  It was fully implemented in 1972.   In 1971, the Association approved
another credit of $7.25 million (Credit No. 244-MAI) to help finance the
second phase project. Execution of this project is expected to be completed
on schedule later this year.
25.       An analysis of some rural development programs and projects in
Africa, including the Lilongwe Land Development Program, was completed by
the Bank's Development Economics Department late in 1974 and the report
has been published. A performance audit of the Program's first phase was
recently completed by the Operations Evaluation Department and the report
is expected to be distributed shortly.   The deficiencies and implementation
difficulties which the reports highlight have been recognized by the Govern-
ment and various steps are to be undertaken in Phase III to overcome the
problems. The LLDP management was reorganized under the Phase II project and
a staff development plan will be implemernted under the proposed project as
discussed in paragraph 33 below. The tasks of the program evaluation unit
are also being more precisely defined to ensure that it collects and analyses
data which will provide a better understanding of actual performance under
the LLDP.



- 7 -
26.       With the anticipated completion of the second project in June 1975,
the LLDP is expected to have successfully implemented within estimated cost
all the physical infrastructure required to support development under its
first two phases. In particular, the construction of unit centers, roads,
diversion channels, boreholes and marketing facilities has proceeded either
on or ahead of scheeule and the area and number of farmers served by program
infrastructure has thus considerably exceeded estimates. Productivity has
increased on maize cultivation though it is still below appraisal estimates.
Hlowever, productivity on groundnut farms has probably declined. This is due
in part to the farmers' preference for maize, which is a staple food for which
yields could be increased more easily than for groundnuts and to the price
relationship between maize and groundnuts which favored the former. Prices
of groundnuts were recently increased. They are now believed to offer
adequate incentives to farmers to achieve the Program objective of increasing
groundnut yields from 500 to 650 pounds per acre by 1979/80. The prices paid
to farmers for all their produce will be reviewed regularly by the Government
and the Association (see Section 4.02(b) of the Development Credit Agreement).
Another area in which the Program is behind its objective is land registration.
Under Phases I and II of the Program, about 400,000 acres of land was to be
demarcated and registered. While the demarcation program will be completed
on schedule, the registration program is about one-third behind schedule
because the planning and legal procedures involved require more time than
was previously estimated. The proposed project would continue the land
reorganization effort but at the end of the three-year project period, an
estimated 50,000 acres would remain undemarcated and 100,000 acres would
remain unregistered. The Government would complete the registration of such
Program area land (see Section 4.03 of the Development Credit Agreement).
27.       Both studies admit that the LLDP is still too recent to provide a
thorough and meaningful information; available data is scant and unreliable.
As a pioneer effort the LLDP is a learning experience and thie proposed
project has been designed to improve on the performances of its predecessors.
PART IV - THIE PROJECT
28.       An Appraisal Report entitled "Malawi - Lilongwe Land Development
Program - Phase III" dated February 28, 1975 is being circulated separate-
ly. A Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III. The project,
prepared by the Government with the assistance of the Regional Mission in
Eastern Africa, was appraised in the field in May and June 1974. Negotia-
tions for the proposed credit were held in Washington in February 1975. The
Government delegation was led by Mr. Austin Madinga, the Acting Secretary
to the Treasury and included Messrs. Mtawali, Permanent Secretary, Ministry
of Agriculture; Banda, Principal Assistant Secretary, Treasury; Standen, LLDP
Manager; and Alexander, Agricultural economist, Ministry of Agriculture.

Project Description
29.       The proposed project will be the final phase of the LLDP and will
cover an additional estimated 32,000 farmers who have not yet benefited from
the Program directly. In addition to providing services similar to those
provided under the Program's first two phases, it will introduce some new
services like health and poultry and dairy farming. It will be executed over
a three-year period (1975-78) and will consist of the following major elements:
(a) Unit Centers and Infrastructural Requirements
Major development services such as extension, credit and marketing
will be provided through 15 Unit Centers to be constructed under
the project. A typical center will serve about 2,500 farmers and
will contain an input store, offices and housing for the resident
LLDP staff and markets. In the area served by each Unit Centers,
roads, conservation works and boreholes will be constructed. Each
center is located for accessibility to all the farmers in the Unit
area. Some of the centers already have permanent markets and only
seven new markets will be built under the project.
(b) Land Demarcation and Registration
About 200,000 acres of land not covered under the preceding two
phases would be demarcated and a total of about 270,000 acres of
land would be registered.
(c)  Credit
The project will continue to support the LLDP credit program
under which farmers receive seasonal, short-term and medium-
term credits. Seasonal credit would be made to farmers to
cover the purchase of inputs such as fertilizer, insecticides and
improved seeds. Short-term credit would be provided for the
purchase of stall feeders (from Dzalanyama Ranch), dairy
cattle and to support the dairy and egg production scheme.
Medium-term credit would be provided for the purchase of farm
equipment like ox-carts, maize mills and tobacco barns. The
seasonal credit would carry no interest charges. However to
cover the cost of administering the credit program and to
encourage farmers to pay cash, farmers who receive seasonal
credit will be charged mark-ups in the prices of inputs
supplied to them. These mark-ups, which stood at 10 percent in
1973/74 will be increased to 15 percent in 1974/75 and to 20
percent thereafter. To reduce the cost of administering the
credit program, farmers are being encouraged to joint credit
groups under which seasonal credit is provided with only a
7.5 percent mark-up annually. Short- and medium-term credits
carry an interest rate of 10 percent annually. Each farmer



-9-
would be registered at a market through which he would be
obligated to sell his produce. Each farmer will make his
credit repayments each time he is paid for his produce. The
credit program will be administered through the Unit Centers
and will be directed by a Senior Agricultural Credit Officer
in Lilongwe with four assistants in each Unit Center. A
total of about 55,000 farmers are expected to particpate in
the credit program. This represents an increase of about
24,000 farmers over the level of participation expected to
be attained at full implementation of the Phase II Project.
(d) Extension Services and Training
The organizational structure and working methods established
for extension services under the first phase of the Program
was reorganized under the second phase project. It is now pro-
ducing good results and no major changes will be made under
the proposed project. A few dairy, poultry and home economics
workers would be added to the extension service staff. Exten-
sion field staff would continue to assist the farmers in
setting up Village Planning Committees and in selecting and
advising farmers who would receive credit packages under the
project. Wqhen the LLDP is fully implemented, the staff to
farmer ratio will be about 1 to 500 in the Program area
compared to 1 to 1,000 in other parts of the country. All
positions in the extension service program are occupied
by Malawi nationals.   The project would support the continuing
operation of the staff training center at Lilongwe and the
demonstration programs at the Nsaru farmer training center.
The on-going farmer training program under which farmers and
their wives are brought into Unit Centers for training and
the operation of vehicles and audio-visual equipment for
farmer training would also continue under the project.
(e)  Livestock Development
The project includes four schemes for livestock development.
Under the first scheme, it would support the continuing
development of the Dzalanyama Ranch which was started under
Phase II of the LLDP by financing during the three-year
implementation period of the proposed project, the incremental
capital cost of the ranch, mainly for the purchase of coWs
and steers, and part of its operating costs. This ranch
supplies cattle for the stall feeder program which was started
under Phase II of the Program. The second scheme will consider-
ably expand the stall feeder program to provide over 2,000
farmers with credit for the purchase of stall feeders and to
encourage an increased use of crop residues, the production
and storage of fodder crops and controlled grazing. The third



- 10 -
scheme is for dairy development. This scheme would introduce
extension services to encourage farmers to keep dairy cattle
by providing credit to farmers to cover up to two-thirds of
their initial capital requirements and three months' working
capital. The dairy products will be collected at two centers
with cooling facilities which have been built in the Program
area and will be distributed to local markets for domestic con-
sumption from these centers. The fourth scheme will provide
credit to cover fixed and working capital requirements and
extension services to encourage the production of poultry and
eggs to meet increased local demand. About 120 farmers are
expected to participate in this scheme over the three-year
implementation period of the project.
(f) Health Facilities
The project includes a provision for the construction, staffing
and the operating costs for the three-year project implementation
period of five health sub-centers and about 20 health posts and
the improvement and operating costs of some existing health
facilities. The facilities would provide preventive and
curative medical services, health education, maternal and
child care, communicable disease control, environmental
hygiene and the collection of health statistics. The design
and operation of these facilities will be in accordance with
the Government's master plan for the entire country which was
prepared with the assistance of the World IHealth Organization.
(g) Headquarters Unit
The project includes a provision to cover the incremental
capital and operating costs of the LLDP headquarters estab-
lished at Lilongwe.
(h) Program Evaluation Unit
The Unit, established under Phase I of the Program and
continued under Phase II, undertakes land surveys, collects
and processes data and analyses project achievements.
Experience gained from its operations under Phases I and II
of the Program, however, has suggested that for improved
effectiveness, the Unit's role should be more precisely
defined. Under the proposed project, the Unit will collect
and analyse data on crop yields, acreages under cultivation,
number of farmers in the LL;DP area, number of farmers
adopting Program inputs and farmers' incomes. The project
also includes a provision for agro-economic surveys, land
resource surveys and cropping trials to help with the
preparation of the NRDP.



Project Costs and Financing
30.       Total project costs are estimated at US$12.1 million of which US$5.4
million (or 45 percent) is estimated as the foreign exchange component. Except
for tax on salaries, which is not significant, estimated project costs do not
include any tax. The breakdown of project costs is given in Annex III.
31.       The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) has agreed to
participate in the financing of the project. This would be the second UNCDF
participation in a Bank Group financed project. Its first was in the Kigoma
Rural Development Project in Tanzania in 1974. The UNCDF will provide $1.6
million on a grant basis to the Government for financing the capital cost of
the health facilities and farmers credit program components of the project.
The Association will finance the operational costs of both components. The
components will form an integral part of the project. Since UNCDF does not
have at present the requisite staff, it has been agreed (Sections 1 and 2
of the Administration's letter between the Association and the UNCDF) that the
Association would supervise, on behalf of the UNCDF its elements of the
project including the review of procurement arrangements and disbursement
applications.
32.       The proposed credit of US$8.5 million would finance 70 percent of
the total project cost and would cover most of the required foreign exchange
plus a large portion of the local costs. The UNCDF grant of US$1.6 million
would finance 13 percent of the total project cost and would cover the balance
of the required foreign exchange plus some local costs. The Government,
ADMARC, the Dzalanyama Ranch and farmer downpayments would contribute the
balance or US$2.0 million.
Project Management and Execution
33.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) would have
overall responsibility for implementing all aspects of the project, except
the health component which would be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Health. The managemenWt organization of the first two phases of the Program
will be retained under the proposed project. Most of the senior positions
in the management will however continue to be occupied by expatriate personnel.
Efforts to recruit and train Malawi nationals for senior management positions
have so far not succeeded largely because the country produces very few
University graduates.
34.       The Government has therefore decided to intensify and systematise
the training of Malawians for the agricultural sector and has designed a
staff development program to accomplish this aim. The program includes the
on-going expansion of the training facilities of the Bunda Agricultural
College with financial assistance from the United States Government, partici-
pation by about 8 Malawians in each of the three-month management training
courses sponsored in Swaziland by the Commonwealth Development Corporation
each year, and the continuation of on-going post-graduate training programs



- 12 -
for agricultural economists and on-the-job training programs for other senior
staff members. The program is realistic in its aspirations and we are satis-
fied that it will produce Malawian nationals with the required training and in
adequate numbers to substantially meet the projected needs of the agricultural
sector from 1979 onwards. The Association will continue to work with the
Government to ensure its expeditious implementation. The Government will
consult with the Association before making any new appointments to the posts
of Program Manager, Financial Controller and Principal Agricultural Officer
(see Section 3.05 of the Development Credit Agreement).
35.       The health facilities would be staffed and managed by the Ministry
of Health under the direct supervision of a Senior Medical Officer with
public health experience who would be based in Lilongwe and working directly
with the LLDP management. The Government would consult with the Association
regarding the appointment of the Senior Medical Officer and will staff the
health facilities adequately (see Sections 3.08 (a) and 3.08 (b) of the
Development Credit Agreement).
36.       The Program Planning and Conservation Unit will undertake the
comprehensive planning and construction of most of the required infrastruc-
ture including staff housing and offices, roads, and conservation structures.
The Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC) would con-
struct and operate the permanent markets and the input stores. Boreholes
would be constructed by the Geological Survey Department of MANR. Execution
of the project is expected to be completed by 1978.
Procurement
37.       Vehicles, machinery and equipment in orders over US$30,000 equiva-
lent which would be financed with the proposed IDA credit would be procured
under international bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. The
orders would be grouped whenever possible. Fertilizer, vehicles and equipment
which would be financed by the UNCDF would be procured on the basis of
local competitive bidding. The health facilities, also being financed with
the UNCDF would be constructed on the basis of competitive bidding advertized
locally. Staff housing, roads, offices, boreholes and conservation works
would be constructed by force account as in Phase I and II of LLDP.
Disbursement
38.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed against
(a) 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures or 85 percent of local
expenditures for vehicles, machinery and equipment, project salaries and
wages, vehicle and miscellaneous operating costs, farmer credit funds and
Dzalanyama Ranch costs and (b) 85 percent of total expenditures for civil
works. The proceeds of the UNCDF grant would be disbursed against 100 per-
cent of the total cost of the health facilities and the incremental seasonal
and medium-term farm inputs.

Administration of the LLDP after completion
39.       The proposed project to be completed by 1978 is the final phase
of the LLDP but the Program area is not expected to achieve full agricul-
tural production until. 1985. There is therefore a need to maintain a light
administrative struc'-ure with staff, equipment and funds to monitor the con-
tinuing development of the Program and ensure the supply of required farm
inputs and other services. It is estimated that these services would require
about US$1.0 million annually. The Government would design and fund a pro-
gram satisfactory to the Association to ensure the supply of these services
(see Section 3.07 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Economic Justification of the Project
40.       The project will enable increased production of maize, groundnuts,
tobacco, beef, milk and eggs, which results in a rate of return to the economy
estimated at 18 percent. In calculating this rate of return, family labor
whose employment may be slightly increased by the project is not allocated
any incremental cost. The main risks associated with the proposed project
include the possibility that fewer farmers than estimated may adopt the agri-
cultural inputs to be supplied and chat the price of fertilizer may be signi-
ficantly higher than is currently estimated. A 50 percent reduction in maize
yields and fertilizer use would reduce the internal economic rate of return
to 12 percent while a 10 percent reduction in all benefits would result in
a rate of return of 14 percent. If benefits fall by 10 percent and costs
increase simultaneously by 10 percent, the rate of return would be reduced
to a still acceptable 11 percent. The economic rate of return of the total
Program on completion is now conservatively estimated at 13 percent.
Impact and Significance of the Project
41.       The project would extend the LLDP extension services and inputs to
about 32,000 farm families which have not yet benefited from the Program.
The net annual income of a typical farmer cultivating 4.5 acres is estimated
to increase by about 40 percent over the project implementation period of
three years. The Government cash flow arising out of the project shows a
cumulative surplus from 1978/79 while that from the total Program shows a
cumulative surplus from 1977/78. The project would complete the LLDP which
is providing an important demonstration of rural development and provides a
valuable base for planning, launching and administering the proposed National
Rural Development Program.   The success of the LLDP has attracted wide
interest, and has been copied in other parts of Malawi, as well as by other
countries.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of
special interest dealing with charges to farmers for agricultural inputs and
prices paid to farmers for their produce and the administration of the LLDP
after completion of the project are referred to in paragraphs 25 and 38 of
this Report.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 102-MAI - Education: $6.3 million credit of May 4, 1967;
closing date June 30, 1977:
The project consists of the construction and equipping of one
national primary teacher training college and the provision of technical
instruction facilities in 12 secondary schools. The project has been
implemented satisfactorily and school premises have been in use for about
two years. At the request of the Government, the Closing Date was first
extended from the original date of December 31, 1972 to June 30, 1973 to
allow disbursement for the completion of construction of the college,
which was delayed by a change in site. A second extension, to March 29,
1974, was agreed to allow disbursement for installation of electricity in
the secondary school at Dedza. A request from the Government to use
savings under the credit, amounting to about US$420,000 for the construc-
tion of a post and telecommunications school was agreed to by the Execu-
tive Directors on December 4, 1973. The closing date has consequently
been further postponed to June 30, 1977. Implementation of the telecom-
munications school is progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 244-MAI - Agriculture - Lilongwe Land Development Program Phase II:
$7.3 million credit of May 13, 1971; Closing date March 31, 1976:
The project is designed to add approximately 375,000 acres of
smallholder crops and a 160,000 acres of cattle ranch to the 500,000 acres
developed under the Phase I Project. Physical execution of the project is
progressing most satisfactorily. Both the staffing of senior posts and
stocking of the cattle ranch which had previously fallen behind schedule
have now improved.
Credit No. 282-MAI - Agriculture - Karonga Development Project:
$6.6 million credit of January 26, 1971; Closing date December 31, 1977:
The project is the first phase of an agricultural development pro-
gram for the Karonga area. It includes development of irrigated rice cul-
tivation, dry-land crop production, livestock development, extension ser-
vices, credit, health services and the rehabilitation of freight service on
Lake Malawi. Cost overruns are expected on the improvement of the lake
ports involved, due to lack of experience with marine works in Malawi,
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

remoteness of the northern terminal and basic material price increases.
The latter also affects the cost of civil works under the agricultural com-
ponent. Discussions are underway with the Government on how best to meet
the expected cost overruns.
Credit No. 363-MAI - A&riculture - Shire Valley Development Project
Phase II:  $10.5 million credit of March 28, 1973; Closing date
December 31, 1978:
The project is a continuation and expansion of the program com-
pleted under Phase I and includes, in addition to extension services,
credit and marketing facilities, a livestock component, health facilities,
fisheries development, feeder road construction, research on irrigated and
rainfed crops, land registration and wildlife protection. Project execu-
tion is satisfactory.
Credit No. 426-MAI - Second Power Project: $7.5 million credit of
September 7, 1973; Closing date December 31, 1978:
The project provides part of Malawi's power generation develop-
ment program for the period 1973-1977 and consists of: (a) the construc-
tion of a barrage and 20 MW hydroelectric power station at Tedzani, as an
extension to the station financed under Credit 178-MAI; (b) the installa-
tion of a 12 MW gas turbine, to be constructed at Blantyre; and (c) a
tariff study. The project is being financed jointly with CDC which will
lend up to US$6.1 million equivalent. As a result of recent world-wide
increases in prices, cost overruns of about $6.0 million over the appraisal
estimate of S14.3 million are anticipated and the Government is consider-
ing measures to meet additional financing requirements. In spite of the
cost overruns the project remains the best choice among the various al-
ternatives to meet projected power demand.
Credit No. S-17-MAI - Transport Engineering and Services Project:
US$2.0 million credit of June 13, 1974; Closing date June 30, 1978:
The project consists of the determination of the infrastructural
requirements and the provision of technical assistance for the exploitation
of the Viphya forest resources. Necessary transportation studies, design of
the required transport facilities have been completed and work has started
on the preparation of bid documents. VIPCOR, the Malawi organization which
is in charge of the Viphya project is in the process of selecting financial
and technical partners for the Viphya project.
Credit No. 523-MAI - Second Highway Project: US$10.0 million credit of
December 19, 1974; Closing Date June 30, 1978:
The contract for the civil works under this project has been
awarded. Overall execution of the project is satisfactory.
