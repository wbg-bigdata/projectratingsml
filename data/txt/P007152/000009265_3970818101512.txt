PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOANS 1288-ES/1289-TES)
PREFACE
This is a completion report of the Seventh Power Project in El
Salvador (Loans 1288-ES and 1284-ES) for which the Bank provided two loans
amounting to $39 million. The project was approved in 1976 and the loans
were fully disbursed in October 1981.
The project included generation, transmission, communicationus,
geothermal site investigation, and technical assistance components. Despite
cix:il strifes the executing agency, CEL 1/, completed the project's major
parts with delays of only six months.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Latin
America and Caribbean Region's Energy 1 Division, based on the Appraisal
Report, the President Report, the Loan Agreement, Supervision Mission
Reports, correspondence with the borrower and internal Bank memoranda on
project and sector issues.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of the draft report to
the Government and CEL. Comments received from CEL and Staff Observations
on CEL's comments have been reproduced as an Appendix to the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EL SALVADOR,
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN4S 1288-ES/l289-TES)
HIGHLIGHTS
El Salvador has two known indigenous energy resources of moderate
size: the Lempa River and the geothermal fields. CEL1/ has striven to
exploit them and eliminate the power sector's reliance on hydrocarbon fuels.
The project (Loans 1288-ES and 1289-TES) had many parts:
(a) generation, (b) transmission, (c) communication, (d) geothermal site
investigation, and (e) technical assistance. The principal component of the
project was a 30-37.5 MW generator, the third unit in the area, for utilizing
Ahuachapan's geothermal steam. The transmission and communication component,
accounting for one-fourth of project cost, was aimed at supporting the
further expansion of the distribution network and improving system
coordination. Geothermal site investigation and the related feasibility
studies focused primarily on fields other than AhuachtTyan.  In addition,
consultants were to be retained to study an LRMC-based / tariff system, and
undertake detailed engineering and construction supervision of the first
three components of the project.
CEL is managed and organized well. Despite the civil strife, the
agency provided acceptable power supply with system losses of only 14%.
Mbreover, CEL completed the project's najor components with delays
of six months (PCR, para. 3.2.2). The geothermal investigation, which
changed in scope, lagged 27 months behind schedule (PCR, para. 3.2.6). The
tariff study contract, signed 18 months late, was completed 44 months behind
schedule. The result of the study has had no effect on the electricity rates
or CEL's finances.
Cost overruns on the generation and most transmission components
were not appreciable. In contrast, the geothermal studies and exploration
drilling of geothermal fields have cost much more than the SAR 3/ estimate.
So did the equipment of the communication and control systems (PCR, para.
3.4.2).
CEL seems to have been satisfied with the work of consultants (PCR,
para. 3.1.1). But the PCR has expressed reservations: -CEL did not always
receive adequate support from consultants which -may have contributed to the
delays in some project components". The tariff study was also deficient, in
certain aspects".

3/   Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)



- vi -
The performance of contractors and consultants was generally
satisfactory (PCR, para. 3.3.2). Further, because of unsafe conditions in
project areas, the Bank staff was rnable to undertake field supervision
missions "at intervals as required" (PCR, para. 3.3.3).
Adverse economic and political developments have undermined CEL's
power market. Concurrent with the 1979 coup, production decreased in all
major sectors: manufacturing, 29%; agriculture, 14%; construction, 35%; and
commerce, 24%. In contrast, CEL's sales in 1981 were at the 1978 level, but
still 21% below the SAR forecast (PCR, Annex 9).
The borrower has failed to meet the financial covenants. CEL's
rate of return on non-revalued assets decreased from 15.7% in 1977 to 2.9% in
1981. The net cash generation was negative, whereas SAR expected a 37%
contribution to financing investment, after meeting debt service requirements
(FCR, para. 5.3.1).
The ensuing lessons emerge from the project experience:
-    Geothermal exploration should constitute a separate project, since
it is risky, complex, and not a minor item (PCR, para. 7.1.1);
-    Engineering support in planning and design, including the
preparation of tender document, was probably necessary and could have helped
minimize implementation delays (PCR, para. 7.2.1); and
-    Underground waste disposal was successful and should be considered
in other geothermal projects (PCR, para. 7.3.1).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOANS 1288-ES/1289-TES)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1 Sector Organization
The Comision Hidroelectrica Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa (CFL) is a
government-owned autonomous institution responsible for bulk electricity
supply throughout E1 Salvador and for retail distribution in rural areas not
served by other distributors. CEL'S Board of Directors is composed of
representatives of Government ministries, private banks and industrial and
agricultural associations. The Board sets policy and appoints an Executive
Director, who is responsible for all management functions. CEL sells bulk
supplies of electricity to seven private distribution companies. Tne
Minister of Fconomy approves CFL's requests for tariff adjustments.
1.2 Rank Lending to CFL
Annex 1 shows that the IBRI and the International Development
Association (IDA) have provided CEL with financing amounting to US$97.1
million in the form of one credit and seven loans (including a third window
loan to the Government for on-lending to CEL). The first five loans (US$52.1
million) helped to finance utilization of the resources of the: (i) Lempa
River and its tributaries and (ii) geothULmal field at Ahuachapan. The
credit (US$5.6 million) helped to finance construction of a gas turbine plant
at Soyapango. All of the works financed by the first five loans were
completed and are in normal operation. The sixth (889-ES) and seventh loans,
(1288-ES and 1289-TES)1/ helped to finance the first and the third unit of
the geothermal Ahuachapan Project which was completed in January 1981.   The
seventh loan is the subject of this report.
II. PROJECT PRFPARATION AN' APPRAISAL
2.1 Project nrigin, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.1.1     First investigations and studies related to the geothermal
development at Ahuachapan and Lempa were initiated by CEL in 1965 with
technical assistance from TtNTP. A consultant prepared a feasibility study
for the Ahuachapan geothermal plant with three units totalling 100 MW
capacity. The first 30 MW unit was financed by the Bank and was
commissioned in 1975. The second 30 MW unit was financed by a supplier and
was commissioned in 1976.
2.1.2     CFL requested IBRD financing for the third geothermal unit at
Ahuachapan in October 17, 1975. In January 1976 CEL also requested financing
for transmission lines and substations as well as communication and load
dispatch facilities including consulting services. Geothermal studies and
investigations at Berlin, Chinameca and San Vicente as well as studies on
tariffs for electricity were also included in this seventh power project.

2.1.3     An IBRD appraisal mission (November 1975) determined that the third
geothermal unit and the expansion of the transmission/substation facilities
were the least cost solution for meeting the expected average growth (10.5%
per annum) in electric energy consumption up to 1982. In addition to the
project cost and economic justification, IBRD staff devoted particular
attention during appraisal to the assessment of the geothermal resources, and
proposed that the loan finance geological exploration and geothermal studies.
2.1.4     The definition of the transmission/substation and communication
components of the project was based on consultants studies, on discussions
between CEL and Bank representatives in San Salvador and Washington and on
the findings of the IBRn' appraisal mission. Details on CEL's development
program 1976-1982 are set forth in para. 2.2.
2.1.5     To ensure a satisfactory operation of the Ahuachapan plant with
regard to the disposal of its contaminated geothermal waste water which
constituted a hazard to the environment, the Bank required CEL to proceed
with the construction of a separate discharge channel for conducting the
geothermal waste water into the Pacific Ocean instead of discharging it into
the Paz River. This undertaking had been already agreed between CEL and IBRI
during the appraisal of the sixth power project in 1972 and was again made a
condition in the loan agreement of the seventh power project. The
construction of the discharge channel was completed in October 1978. This
channel, although part of the previous sixth power project, was not financed
by the Bank. The PCR for the sixth power project dated June 25, 1979 deals
with this channel in more detail.
2.1.6     No major problems delayed loan processing.  Negotiations took place
in May 1976; the Board of Directors approved the loan on June 17, 1976 and
representatives of the Bank, CEL and the Government signed the loan documents
on July 28, 1976. The Loan Agreement became effective on October 28, 1976
the original terminal date for effectiveness.
2.2 CEL's Major Sector Development Activities in 1976-1982
2.2.1     The following works were undertaken by CEL simultaneously with the
implementation of the Seventh Power Project which is described in paragraph
2.3.1 below:

1984).
2.3 Project Pescription
2.3.1     The appraisal report defined the project as consisting of:
(a) Generation
The third unit at Ahuachapan geothermal station with an estimated
capacity between 30 and 37.5 MW with the provision that the final
capacity would be determined after evaluation of the results of
studies and investigation of the geothermal fields in Ahuachapan.
(b) Transmission and Subtransmission
(i)  Construction of about 39 circuit-km of new 115 kV transmission
lines and about 20 circuit-km of the 46 kV subtransmission
lines;
(ii)  Conversion of about 83 circuit-km of existing 69 kV
transmission lines ro 115 kV; and
(iii)  Construction and/or improvement of 10 substations, including
the addition of about 150 MVA in new transformer capacity to
the system.

2.4.1     Annex 2 describes the major covenants of the Loan and Cuarantee
Agreements and their compliance by the Government and CFL.



III. PROJFCT IMPLEMENTATION AIqP COST
3.1 Loan Effectiveness and the Award of Consultant Contracts
3.1_1     The Loan Agreement became effective on October 28, 1976, as
scheduled. CFL created a satisfactory Planning and Engineering Department
which was fully staffed in Pecember 1978, CEL continued with the services of
the same two consulting firms which had assisted in the SIi-h Power Project.
3.1.2     The services of the first consultant cons sted of the detailed
design and construction supervision for the third geothermal unit at
Ahuachapan as well as of the preparation of feasibility studies for
geothermal power development including supervision of site investigations in
geothermal fields at Ahuachapan, Berlin, Chinameca and San Vicente. Due to
the early engagement of the first consultant (the contract was signed on
September 9, 1976 as scheduled) CEL was able to procure the major generating
equipment practically without delay and at the estimated purchase price.
3.1.3     CEL awarded to the second consultant a contract for consulting
services related to transmission lines and substations as well as to
communication and control facilities on August 25, 1976 as scheduled.
The preparation of tender documents for some of the equipment and materials
for the transmission lines and substations suffered delays which consequently
delayed the implementation of these project components. Procurement and
implementation of the extension of the communication system was advanced by
about 5 months. The preparation of the tender documents for the control
system was delayed by about 7 months, and this delay in turn caused a delay
in the implementation of about 9 months.
3.1.4     The preparation of the terms of reference for the tariff study was
delayed by about 8 months. Ten more months were spent in carrying out the
bidding procedure, evaluation of bids and contract negotiations. The
contract for the tariff study was finally signed on January 24, 1979 about 18
months later than scheduled.
3.2 Timetable of Project Implementation
3.2.1     Annex 3 sets forth original and actual key dates concerning
implementation of the Project.  There was a   promising start in 1976 with
the preparation of detailed design and contract documents for the third
geothermal unit (35 MW), the main project component; but from 1977 onwards
there -zas a slow down in the progress of engineering works for the other
project components. The main reason for the slow progress was the politica'l
and economic crisis which erupted in El Salvador and which created serious
problems and affected negatively CEL's ability to finance local expenditures
from its own revenues.
3.2.2     In spite of extremely difficult conditions in the country
(guerilla actions against electrical installations, labor unrest, curfews and
blocking of roads), CEL was able to complete most of the major project



-5-
components such as the Ahuachapan geothermal plant, one transmission line and
the communication system with delays of only about 6 months. The following
paragraphs set forth details on the completion dates and operation of the
various project components.
3.2.3     Geothermal Unit No.3 at Ahuachapan.  The 35 MW geothermal (third)
unit has operated successfully (after trial runs in December 1980) since
commissioning in January 1981 (six months later than scheduled) with average
plant factor of 0.70 which is a good performance, considering that the plant,
which has a total installed capacity of 95 MW, was initially limited to about
87 MW due to lack of sufficient geothermal steam. After completion of the
geothermal investigations including drilling of seven additional boreholes
and connection of the wells to the plant in Pecember 1982, the plant entered
into normal operation.
3.2.4     Transmission Lines and Substations.  The transmission lines were
completed with delays varying between 4 and 23 months and substations 26 to
50 months as compared with the appraisal schedule. The slowdown was mainly
caused by delays in the preparation of tender documents, design changes and
adjustments to actual load growth and by delays of construction due to unsafe
conditions in sove areas of the country. -rhese postponements did not cause
major problems to power supply because of the reduced demand.
3.2.5     Communication and Control Systems.  The communication system
expansion (microwave equipment) was installed and commissioned in January
1979, 4 months ahead of schedule.  The installation and tests for the
supervisory control system suffered a delay of 9 months because the supplier
refused to send technicians to El Salvador due to the security conditions in
the country. CFL's technicians were able to complete the installation of
this control system by themselves.
3.2.6     Geothermal Studies.  The geothermal investigation program at
Berlin, San Vicente and Chinameca was delayed by about 27 months mainly due
to an increased scope of work. The original program envisaged only 4 (1200 m
deep) boreholes, but it turned out that 10 bore holes, drilled to a much
greater depth (average depth about 2000 m), were actually required to
complete the feasibility study. This work was mainly concentrated in the
Berlin field. The drilling works at San Vincente (one bore hole) and
Chinameca (two bore holes) fields were suspended in late 1979 because of
unsafe conditions due to guerilla actions in that area. The results obtained
from 3 out of 7 bore holes at the Berlin field were encouraging and showed,
according to the feasibility report, a geothermal reservoir of sufficient
capacity to feed a unit of about 50 MW for at least 20 years.
3.2.7     The Ahuachapan geothermal reservoir was considered at appraisal to
have sufficient capacity to feed a plant of about 95 MW. The first 30 MW
unit was installed in 1975 and the second 30 MW unit in 1976. After more
than two years of operation with two 30 MW units, an unexpected decrease in



-6-
the geothermal steam was observed. Five (5) new bore holes were drilled in
1979 in order to previde the steam also needed for the third (35 MW) unit,
which was installed in late 1980.  After commissioning of the third unit, a
maximum production test was carried out in March 1981 which showed a maximum
plant output of 87 MNW when 95 MW were actually installed. Two additions;
bore holes were drilled to ensure full rated output. These bore holes
including connection of the wells to the plant -were successfully corApleted in
Pecember 1982.
3.2.8     Tariff Study.  The contract with the consultant was signed on
January 24, 1979 about 18 months later than scheduled (see paragraph 3.1.4).
The first draft of the study was completed in mid 1980 but not accepted by
CEL because of a disagreement between CEL and the consultant about the
opportunity cost of capital. After prolonged discussions, the consultant
agreed to make additional calculations using a 10% opportunity cost of
capital instead of 7.5%. The revised study was finally completed in August
1981 about 44 months later than the appraisal estimate. The recommendations
of this study have not been implemented because of Government refusal to
-prove further (see para. 5.3) tariff increases. In 1981 the project was
practically completed.
3.3    Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers
and Staff of the Borrower and the Bank
3.3.1     CEL expressed no dissatisfaction with the various consultants.  It
seems however, that CEL did not always receive sufficient engineering
support from consultants during preparation of design and contract documents
for most of the equipment other than the turbo generator. This lack of
sufficient support may have contributed to the delays in some project
components. It appears also, that the physical volume of works and
especiallv the exploratory geothermal drillings as well as the cost of some
of the equipment were underestimated by the consultants. CEL feels that this
was ui:derstandable, taking into consideration the complexity of new
technologies and the risks involved in the exploration and operation of
geothermal fields. Neither CEL nor the Bank were satisfied with certain
aspects of the tariff study (para. 3.2.8).
3.3.2      The performance of contractors and suppliers was generally
satisfactory, with an exception that one company failed to deliver the
electrical (medi-um and low voltage) equipment as scheduled which has
caused a delay of 15 months and additional costs of more than Colons 1.0
million.
3.3.3     The Borrower's staff performed well under the circumstances.  CEL
expressed satisfaction with the performance of the Bank staff. It should be
noted that Bank staff was not able to carry out field supervision missions
(especially technical supervisions) at intervals as required because of
unsafe conditions in project areas due to guerilla actions.

3.4.2     As can be seen in Annex 5, the actual cost (LTSS29.96 million) of
the third geothermal unit, including costs of engineering, administration,
drillings and associated works at Ahuachapan was close to that estimated at
appraisal (US$29.92 million).  The actual and forecast unit costs were close:
USS856/kW vs. USS855/K.-  The costs of transmission lines, actual and
forecast, were close: UTS$3.05 as compared with US$2.99 million (para. 3.4.1).
The costs for all other project components increased substantially (see Annex
4). The highest cost increases were observed for the geothermal studies and
exploration drillings of geothermal fields as well as for the equipments of
the communication and control systems.
3.4.3     The factors contributing to the higher-than-expected costs can be
summarized as follows:



(3)  Increases in the physical volume of works especially for geothermal
drillings. In view of the risks involved in drilling and the
incomplete knowledge of the Berlin field and considering the
complexity of new technologies, physical contingencies for this
component should have been higher.
(ii) Changes in the scope of were for the Communications and Load
Control Systems.
(iii) Increases of the costs for civil and erection works especially for
substations and for the Load Dispatch Center, including a building
which had not been considered at the time of appraisal.
(iv) The political situation in El Salvador which caused uncertainty to
foreign suppliers and resulted in higher prices to offset risks and
delays in the execution of works. This contributed to higher
costs for equipments and erection works as well as to a larger
amount of interest during construction.
(v)  Increases of the staff-months for consulting services related
especially to the geothermal studies.
3.4.3     Sources of financing for the project were as follows:

3.5 Disbursements and Allocations
3.5.1     About 76% of the loan had been disbursed by December 31, 1980, the
original loan closing date. In view of cost changes and disbursement delays,
the Bank agreed to two re-allocations of loan proceeds and one postponement
of the loan closing date (from December 3, 1980 to June 30, 1981). Annexes 7
and 8 show actual and forecast disbursements and allocations.
IV.  PROJECT'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND JUSTIFICATION
4.1 operating Performance
4.1.1     The main objective of the Seventh Power Project was to provide
additional generation and transmission facilities to CEL's power system and
thus enable this utility to meet future demands for electricity in El



-9-.
Salvador without a reduction in the quality of service. Annex 9 shows that
for the sector, actual generation grew about as fast as expected between 1976
and 1979; but thereafter actual generation declined on a year-to-year basis
through 1981. CEL's pattern of actual generation and sales paralleled that
of the sector. This reduced load growth, which ref ected the unsettled
domestic conditions, postponed meeting the load-growth objectives until
1Q86/87 and caused the third unit to be used to replace the existing
oil-fired plants, rather than to meet additional demand. Since commissioning
of this third unit in January 1981, CEL was able to reduce almost to zero its
dependence on imported fuel for electricity generation. The existing
oil-fired plants are being used as standby plants for emergencies only.
4.1.2     Commercial operations of the third geothermal unit at Ahuachapan
(35 MW) commenced in January 1981. The plant has operated satisfactorily
with a plant factor of 0.70 and to date no major problems have been
encountered in the equipment. The temporary decrease in geothermal steam
(see paragraph 3.2.7), which caused a capacity reduction of about 8.5% during
1981 and 1982, did not affect CEL's ability to meet its supply commitments
because of reduced electricity demand. Annex 10 shows details on CEL's
actual and forecast energy generation in comparison with the appraisal
estimate as well as the fuel savings due to the operation of the third
geothermal 'mit at Ahuachapan.
4.2 Project Justification
4.2.1     The appraisal report provided an economic analysis showing that the
Seventh Power Project represented the least-cost solution for meeting El
Salvador's incremental requirements beginning in 1982 (when additional
capacity would be needed) for all discounts rates lower than 23%. At the
time of appraisal there were neither fa ilities nor plans for importing
electricity from neighboring countries which were also short in energy.  Five
generation programs for meeting the energy requirements under different
assumptions were considered in the appraisal report, comparing different
sequential implementations of the third geothermal unit at Ahuachapan with a
corresponding conventional oil-fired steam power plant,which was the only
practical alternative. The appraisal report concluded that the proposed
in-service date June 30, 1980 for the third geothermal unit was the optimum.
For this case, the return on investment of the Seventh Power Project (not
including the costs for geothermal studies other than Ahuachapan but,
including additional investments for distribution facilities), was estimated
at 14.1%, based on 1975 retail tariff levels. At appraisal, there was no
consideration of other geothermal and hydro alternatives because:
(i) investigation of other geothermal fields had not advanced
sufficiently to warrant consideration; and



-10-
(ii)  the development of lower-cost hydro sites on the Lempa River
(downstream of Cerron Grande) was contingent on improved
stream-flow regulation to be provided by the Cerron Grande Dam, at
that time under construction. These sites could not be in service
by the required date.
4.2.2     The project's actual rate of return compared with the appraisal
estimate is shown below:
Appraisal     Actual
Mi)  Overall return to economy based on
a retail sale price for electricity           14.1           11.1
(ii)  Return to CEL based  on a bulk sale
price for electricity                         14.9          13.9
4.2.3     Adversely affecting the actual returns were CaL's reduced load
growth (para. 4.1.1) and, to a lesser extent, the cost overruns of the
Project (para. 3.4.2).  Because of the reduced load growth, the benefits of
the Project have been limited to fuel saving, as the third geothermal unit
has been mainly used for replacing oil-fired plants (until 1986187) instead
of meeting increased energy demand (Annex 10). The estimated return of the
Project to the economy (11.1%) is underestimated to the extent that
incremental benefits (sales) associated with distribution investment were not
taken into account. UTndoubtedly there were incremental sales associated
with the expansion of the distribution system; but it was not possible to
measure them during a period of system-wide sales declines. This factor
makes the return of 11.1% a very conservative estimate of the return of the
Project to the economy.
4.2.4    It should be noted that the average fuel cost of thermal generation
using Bunker "C" in El Salvador (0.0635 US$/kWh in 1981)2/ was higher than
the average sale prices for electricity3!.  Fuel savings during the years
1981 to 1986 were not sufficient to offset the impact an the rate of return
caused by cost overruns. The economic analysis with the rates of return to
the overall economy (retail sale prices measuring benefits) and to CEL (bulk
sale prices measurtng benefits) is shown in Annexes 11 and 12 respectively.
4.2.5     The investment costs considered in the economic analysis are the
direct costs of the entire Seventh Power Project less the costs for
2/ Assum±ng an average plant efficienty of 12,3 KAh per gallon of
Bunker "C".
3/ Bulk price for CFL:0.0394 US$/kWh, retail price for consumers:
0.057 USS/kwh.



-11-
geothermal studies carried out in Rerlin, Chinameca and San Vicente. This
exclusion was made because the costs of these geothermal studies should be
considered as part of investments in future power plants. The costs for
geothermal studies and dr4ll1rgs in Ahuachapan are included in the direct
investment cost for the third geothermal unit at Ahuachapan and are
considered in the economic analysis (Annexes 11 and 12).
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1 CEL's Financial Performance and Rate of Return
5.1.1     Annexes 13 to 16 compare actual and forecast data for key financial
ratios, income statements, funds statements, and balance sheets. As measured
by the rate of return on assets valued at historic costs CEL's financial
performance was sgtisfactory until 1977. However, as measured by
contribution to expansion its performance became unsatisfactory in 1977.
5.1.2     The rate of return on historically valued assets decreased from
15.7% in 1977 to 2.9% in 1981.  The net internal cash generation was negative
from 1977 on, amounting to (minus) Colones 37.2 millions in 1981. This
reflects the difficult financial situation faced by CEL (see para. 5.3.3
below). Improvement of the economic conditions in Fl Salvador and tariff
increases would help CEL's financial recuperation.
5.2   Revaluation of Fixed Assets in Operation
5.2.1     Under the Loan Agreements for Loans 1288-FS and 1289-TES, CEL was
obligated to revalue its fixed assets in operation in a manner acceptable to
the Bank. No date was specified in the Agreements for the change in
valuation, however at negotiations it had been envisaged that the change
would be made in 1977.
5.2.2     In early 1976 CEL had already hired a consultant to carry out a
revaluation of its assets as of December 31, 1975. The consultant's work was
completed in September 1976 with recommendations for increases amounting to
51X of the book value of the net fixed assets in operation.  The Bank
considered the consultant's work to be acceptable but CEL did not want to
follow the consultant's methodology in continuing the revaluation on its own
in future years. CEL felt that the consultant's formulation was
unnecessarily complicated and proposed instead a simplified approach. A
prolonged discussion regarding methodology then followed between CEL and the
Bank which finally concluded with an agreement on methodology reached during
the Bank's mission in May 1979.
5.3   Tariff Increases
5.3.1     The appraisal forecast reflected the expectation that with the
tariff increase put into effect in late 1975, the utility would resume its
strong performance throughout the project period, generating sufficient cash



-12-
to fund 37% of its investment program while meeting high debt service
requirements.
5.3.2     The Loan Agreement includes a rate of return covenant,4/ whereby
such rate is to be not less than 9% on non revalued assets and 8! after asset
revaluation takes place. Given the magnitude of the revaluation subsequently
recommended by the consultant, it would seem that its impact was
underestimated at appraisal.
5.3.3     From 1978 onwards, CEL's financial situation deteriorated due to
cost increases and lower than expected revenues. CEL's requests for tariff
increases in 1978 were not approved by the Government. CEL was forced to
finance cost overruns by large short-term borrowings from the Central Bank
without seeking IBRP's agreement (see paragraph 5.4.2). As a result of Bank
intervention, the Government agreed to a 20X tariff increase in August 1979.
This increase was the only one carried out during the project implementation
period (1976-1981) and was not sufficient to improve substantially CEL's
financial position.
5.3.4     There have been expectations that another tariff increase would
follow after the completion of the Tariff Study which was scheduled for early
1980. In view of the delay of this Study which was completed in August 1981
and considering the deteriorating political conditions in the country as well
as the advanced stage of project completion, and the loan almost disbursed in
late 1980, the Bank refrained from taking further actions with regard to
tariff increases.
5.4 Short-term Borrowings
5.4.1     In order to obtain the necessary funds to meet its financial
commitments, CEL borrowed on a short-term basis (six months), with the
understanding that the loans would be renewed.
5.4.2     CEL did not consult the Bank in the belief that Bank approval was
needed only for new long-term borrowings. CEL explained its understanding
with the interpretation of paragraph 6.10 of the Staff Appraisal Report for
the project which stated that: 'CEL has agreed not to incur any long-term
indebtedness without Bank approval unless its most recent 12 months interval
cash generation is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirement.....
5.4.3     However, the applicable provision in Section 5.07 of the Loan
Agreement for Loan 1288-ES makes no distinction as to the term of the debt
(see Annex 2).
5.4.4     The Bank expressed its concern regarding the excessive short-term
borrowing in several letters and telexes addressed to CEL and the Government,
but did not take further steps because of the following reasons:

-13-
(i) The tariff increase under discussion since 1978 and effective since
August 1979 as well as CEL's announcements of further increases
after completion of the Tariff Study, created some expectations for
improvement;
(ii) Political events in El Salvador were the principal causes of the
difficulties, beyond CEL's and Government's control; and
(iii)  The advanced completion stage of the project and most of the loan
amount already disbursed in 1980.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1  The Borrower
6.1.1     CEL is well managed and well organized and has made efforts to
improve its financial position but has not received adequate support from the
Government of El Salvador regarding tariff increases. Except for the
handling of the geothermal drillings which caused considerable cost overruns
and some engineering weaknesses in preparing contract documents in time,
CEL's staff performed well with regard to technical aspects of the project.
In spite of various political problems and guerrilla actions against
electrical installations in the country, CEL was able to maintain an
acceptable power supply with losses reaching only 14% in 1981.  With regard
to staffing, no significant changes were made during the period of project
implementation. Regarding financial aspects, CFL failed to inform the Bank
in time about its difficulties and to request Bank concurrence to additional
short-term borrowings. Auditing and general reporting on progress of works
were acceptable.
6.1.2     In response to Bank prompting, CEL submitted satisfactory proposals
during appraisal of the project for the future training of its staff (about
140 man-months of training through 1978). The appraisal report indicated
that Bank staff would monitor the implementation of these proposals during
project supervision. From Loan 889-ES, CEL disbursed US$0.17 million for the
purchase of training materials (US$0.15 million) and the training of
individuals in geothermal engineering (US$0.02 million). CEL also carried
out a technical training program involving about 150 persons, taking about 80
specialized courses in such subjects as system expansion planning,
load-dispatch management, operation and maintenance of generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities, and tariff structures based on the
marginal cost of supply. Due to serious political problems of the country
which culminated in guerrilla actions at the project sites, technical field
supervision missions were limited (see para 3.3.3) and Bank staff, by
concentrating on more important project aspects, did not evaluate the results
of the training program.



-14-
6.2 The Bank
6.2.1     In hindsight, the cost estimate developed at appraisal was
optimistic as far as the geothermal field investigations are concerned.
Given the lack of sufficient prior experience and the uncertainties in
geothermal field drillings, a larger amount for physical contingencies should
have been considered in the appraisal estimate. ITnsafe security conditions
in the project area prevented Bank staff from undertaking technical
supervision missions between July 1978 and October 1981. This meant that the
magnitude of CEL's additional investments, like the building of the Dispatch
Center, remained for a long period unknown to the Bank. IBRD did not stop
CEL's short-term borrowings to finance cost overruns. CEL was actively
supported by IBRP in its efforts to obtain tariff action from the
Government. The working relations between the staff of CEL and the IBRr have
been very good.
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1 Cost Overruns
7.1.1     The large difference between the estimated and actual cost of the
geothermal studies, which was caused mainly by substantial increases of
drilling works, shows that the drilling program as envisaged at appraisal
turned out to be not sufficient to deliver the required results. In view of
the complexity of such geothermal undertakings and taking into account the
risk and cost involved, in future projects the Bank would be well advised to
consider these types of studies as a separate project requiring an independent
assessment and not as a minor part of a project dealing with an expansion
program.
7.2   Delays
7.2.1      Although most of the delays can be attributed to the political
situation and late delivery of the medium and low voltage equipment for the
geothermal plant, there are indications that some delays which have occurred
during preparation of the tender documents have contributed to delays in the
completion of some project components. A more thorough assessment during
appraisal on programming of engineering activities would probably have led
to a requirement to engage more engineering support in planning and design,
including preparation of tender documents.
7.3 Handling of Geothermal Waste Water
7.3.1     Injection of geothermal waste water back into the underground
(rather than surface disposal) was successfully carried out in 1982 at
Ahuachapan without adversely affecting geothermal steam temperature. It
seems advisable to consider this alternative of injecting waste water back
into the underground also in other geothermal projects.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1288-ES/1289-TES
MaJor Covenants of the Loan Agreements
1.        The Loan Agreement 1288-ES required CEL to:
(a) Carry out the project with due regard to ecological and
environmental factors (Sections 3.04 and 3.05);
(b) Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall from
time to time effect such adjustments in its rates for the sale of
electricity as shall be necessary to provide sufficient revenues to
yield an annual rate of return on assets which shall be: (i) not
less than 9% until such time as the Borrower shall have revalued
its fixed assets in operation in accordance with methodology
acceptable to the Bank; and (ii) not less than 8% thereafter
(Section 5.05); and
Cc) Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not
incur any debt if its net revenues for the next fiscal year
preceding such incurrence or for a late, twelve-,wnth period ended
prior to such incurrence, whichever amount is the greater, shall be
less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirement on all
debt (including the debt to be incurred) in any succeeding fiscal
year (Section 5.07).
2.        The Guarantee Agreement 1289-TES required the Government of El
Salvador to:
(a) Cause CEL to carry out the project and to perform punctually all
the obligations as set forth in the Loan Agreement (with CEL)
1288-ES (Section 3.01); and
(b) Cause CEL to carry out a tariff study not later than December 31,
1977 or such other date as the Bank shall agree and to adjust the
rate structure on the basis of such study and within the context of
the Borrower's development strategy so as to adequately reflect
marginal costs (Section 3.03).
3.        Regarding Loan Agreement 1288-ES, CEL observed the Sections 3.04
and 3.05 satisfactorily but failed to comply with SEction 5.05 and 5.07 (see
comments in paragraph 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 of this report). Regarding
Guarantee Agreement 1289-TES, the Government has failed to comply with
Section 3.01 and 3.03 by delaying CEL's request for tariff increases (see
comments in paragraph 5.3 of this report).
