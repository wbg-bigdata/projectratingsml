APPRAISAL OF AHUACHAPAN EXPANSION PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
Summary and Conclusions
i.        This report appraises the Ahuachapan expansion project, for which
the Comision Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa (CEL) has requested
financial assistance.
ii.       Since 1949 the Bank and IDA have provided major financial assist-
ance to Salvadorian power development through five loans and one credit to
CEL (as borrower or beneficiary) totalling US$58 million. CEL, a govern-
ment-owned autonomous institution responsible for bulk electricity supply
throughout the country and for retail distribution in rural areas not
served by other utilities, has completed the first five projects success-
fully, and the related works are in operation.
iii.      One component of the sixth project, the first unit at Ahuachapan
geothermal station, was ready for commercial service on schedule in early
1975. However, CEL is far behind schedule in construction of a disposal
channel needed to convey the contaminated geothermal effluent from Ahuachapan
to the sea; the channel's completion is now scheduled for October 1977 instead
of early 1975. As an interim measure, CEL is disposing of the effluent in
the Paz river, which forms the border with Guatemala. CEL has confirmed.
that it will limit its effluent discnarge so that concentrations of arsenic
and boron in the river will not exceed levels suggested by the Bank, (based
on a Pan American Aealth Organization study) and thereby not endanger the well-
being of the population or of the surrounding flora and fauna.
iv.       Construction of the sixth project's other major component, the 135 MW
first stage of the Cerron Grande hydroelectric development, also financed by
the Inter-American Development Bank, is proceeding on schedule. The plant is
expected to be available for commercial operation in early 1977, as originally
scheduled.
v.        Because of problems with the disposal channel and unexpected world-
wide price inflation, the cost overruns of the sixth project are estimated
at about US$30 million. These cost overruns would be financed by loans from
the Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIy) and commercial sources already arranged
and from internal cash generation.
vi.      The proposed seventh project's principal component is a third generation
unit of 30 - 37.5 1'IW at AhuachaPan.Besides meeting El Salvador's electricity
needs in the early 1980s, installation of this unit will continue to lessen
the country's dependence on imported fuel for electricity generation. The
project also includes transmission lines needed to meet increased de-
mands for electricity, communications and control equipment to enable CEL to
operate its system more efficiently, studies of other geothermal fields'
feasibility, and studies of CEL's and the other Salvadorian utilities' tariff



- ii -
structures, improvements in which are intended to promote more efficient
utilization of electricity.
vii.     The proposed US$39 million loarswould cover the project's foreign
financing requirement.  The local currency requirements (US$11.2 million
equivalent) would be financed by a local bond issue (US$8 million) and internal
cash generation (US$3.2 million).
viii.    Procurement of goods and services for the project other than con-
sultants' would be through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. No retroactive financing would be required,
assuming loan signing in FY76.  The Government has requested and the Bank
has accepted the extension of preferences of up to 15% to local or regional
manufacturers.
ix.      The project's generating component represents the lea-st-cost
solution for meeting El Salvador's incremental requirements beginning in
1982 (when additional capacity would be needed) for all discount rates
lower than 23%. However, scheduling its in-service date for year-end 1981
would necessitate high fuel consumption during 1980-81, so that CEL plans
for its completion during the first half of 1980; this is a lesser-cost
solution than postponement to year-end 1981 for discount rates of up to
about 13%. The return on investment in the project, based on 1975 retail
tariff levels, is estimated at 14%.
x.        CEL is a well-managed utility, fully capable of operating the pro-
ject upon its completion. diowever, it needs to expand its planning capability
to remain abreast of system growth and to avoid undue reliance on outside consul-
t,nts. CEL has confirmed that it will expand its planning functions.
xi.      Except for 1975, when unexpected adverse operating conditions and
resultant reliance on fuel caused its rate of return to decrease to 4%, CEL's
financial performance has been strong throughout the 1960s and 1970s. A
tariff increase made effective in December 1975 is expected to enable CEL to
continue this strong performance; its rate of return on a revalued rate base
is expected to exceed 8% throughout the project construction period with no
further rate increases. The utility's internal cash generation will provide
about 37% of its total requirements during the project construction period.
xii.      The project would form a suitable basis for conventional and Third
Window loans for a total of US$39 million. The conventional loan, for US$30
million with a term of 25 years including 4-1/2 of grace, would be made to-
CEL and would be guaranteed by the Republic of El Salvador. The loan from
the Third Window facility, for US$9 million with a term of 25 years including
7 of grace, would be made to the Republic of El Salvador, to be onlent to GEL
under the same terms and conditions as the conventional Bank loan.



APPRAISAL OF A±UACi{APAN EXPANSION PROJECT - EL SALVADCR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEXPA (CEL)
1. Introduction
1.01      This report appraises the Ahuachapan expansion project, for which
the Comision Ejecutiva didroelectrica del Rio Lempa (CEL), supported by the
Government, has requested financial assistance. CEL, a government-owned auto-
nomous institution responsible for bulk electricity supply throughout El Salvador
and for retail distribution in rural areas not served by other utilities, has
received Bank/IDA financing totaling US$58 million in six previous lending
operations as itemized in Annex 1. The first five projects were executed suc-
cessfully (generally within cost and time estimates), and the related works are
in operation.
1.02      As noted in the sixth power project's appraisal (report No. 69a-ES,
April 1973), the effluent from the Ahuachapan geothermal plant represents a
hazard to the environment due to its large content of boron and arsenic.
An environmental study was carried out to assess alternative methods for the
safe disposal of this effluent. This study recommended that an effluent dis-
posal channel be built from the Ahuachapan geothermal station to the sea. The
channel was originally scheduled to be completed œoncurrently with the first
unit in March 1975. dowever, CEL has experienced serious delays in the
construction of the channel, mainly because of inefficiencies df the contrac-
tors. Completion is now not expected before October 1977 despite GEL's efforts
to expedite it. GEL has been discharging most of the effluent into the Paz
river, which forms the border with Guatemala (see map), although it has also
been reinjecting part of it thereby reducing the quantity discharged into the
river. The river discharge has been a matter of concern to the Guatemalan
authorities and the Bank. CEL has agreed to limit such discharges (and hence
operate the 30 MT unit at a reduced output even though it was ready for operation
on schedule ) so that concentrations of arsenic and boron do not exceed 0.2 mgAL
respectively, as measured under agreed conditions. These limits were based on a Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) study and were transmitted to the governments of
El Salvador and Guatemala in October 1975. The Bank has kept the Guatemalan govern-
ment apprised of the above, without receiving objections. CEL has conformed to the
agreed limits, except that on November 28, 1975 they were exceeded by about 6% due
to an operational error which is not expected to recur.
1.03      The sixth project's other component, the 2 x 67.5 MW first stage of
the Cerron Grande hydroelectric development (for which the Inter-American
Development Bank - IDB - is also providing financing) is proceeding on sched-
ule. Unexpected worldwide inflation since 1972 and underestimation of the
Ahuachapan disposal channel's cost, due to inaccurate preliminary layouts and
a serious underestimation of the length, are the principal causes of a sixth
project cost overrun currently estimated at almost 30% over its original
US$98 million cost estimate. The project is still the least cost solution
to meeting the electricity requirements for which it was planned as the cost
of alternative means (i.e. fuel-fired power plants) has increased even more.



-2-
l.04      The proposed project's principal component would be the third geo-
thermal unit at Ahuachapan. Jnit no. 2, a twin of the first, is under con-
struction, financed by the supplier, Mitsubishi of Japan). Installation of
this unit will meet PI Salvador's incremental demand for electricity in
1981-82 and reduce its consumption of imported fuel. As detailed in para-
graph 3.02, the project also includes transmission works, communication and
control equipment, and studies of geothermal fields.
1.05      This report is based on CEL's studies concerning various project
components (which, in the case of the transmission and communications works,
were based on studies completed by Harza Engineering Co. International of
the US), on discussions between CEL and Bank representatives in San Salvador
and Washington in July, September and October 1975 and on the findings of an
appraisal mission composed of Messers. John E. Graves, Rafael A. Moscote and
Felix Perez Rivera (consultant), which visited San Salvador in November 1975.

2. The Sector
Energy resources
2.01      El Salvador has only two known indigenous energy resources of any
magintude: the Rio Lempa and geothermal fields, which together account for
only about 20% of present total commercial energy utilization in the country.
The remainder comes from imported petroleum. A UNDP-financed study to deter-
mine the possibility of offshore oil deposits is underway; exploration drill-
ing would await the conclusions of the study.  There are no known coal depo:sits.
2.02      Since the creation of CEL in 1945, Salvadorian power development
has been concentrated on the Rio Lempa system, with oil-fired steam and gas
turbine units and - beginning in 1975 - geothermal units to balance the power
system. As detailed in annex 2, the ratio of indigenous to fuel-fired in-
stalled generating capacity at the end of 1975 was 51/h9. With the commis-
sioning of the Cerron Grande hydro development in 1977, this ratio will in-
crease to 69/31, and it is expected to increase further in future years,
since future power development focuses on continued exploitation of the Rio
Lempa and geothermal resources (see paragraphs 2.10-11).
Sector organization
2.03      As described in annex 2, CEL is the dominant supplier of public-
service electricity in El Salvador; its plants generated 95% of the country's
electric energy in 197h, and it owned 93% of the installed capacity as of
year-end 1975.  The remaining public service generation is accounted for by
five of the eight distributing companies and a small bulk supplier (Compafnia
Electrica de Cucumacayan).
2.04      CEL sells in bulk to eight private distribution companies, whose
service areas are indicated on the map. It also sells directly to about
20,000 rural customers and a few large industrial customers and government
agencies. The largest of the distributors, both in terms of energy sold
(76% in 1974) and customers served (66%), is Compania de Alumbrado Electrico
de San Salvador (CAESS), 88% owned by Canadian International Power of Montreal
and 12% by Salvadorian and foreign individuals. Local interests own the other
distributors.
2.05      The quality of service in CAESS's and CEL's service areas is good.
Many of the smaller distributors have been unable to install the facilities
necessary to serve the public's needs because of lack of funds. At the gov-
ernment's suggestion, CAESS has begun acquisition discussions with several of
the other distributors. Acquisition should result in economies of scale and
improved service since CAESS should be in a better position to provide the
funds required for investment.
Regulation and tariffs
2.06      Legally, the distributing companies are subject to regulation by
the Inspeccion General de Servicios Electricos (IGSE), with final determination
by the Minister of Economy.  Though CELTs tariffs are not legally subject
to IGSE's jurisdiction, they must be approved by the executive branch of
government, which normally requests IGSE's opinion before taking action.  Under
these arrangements tariff levels in El Salvador have been satisfactory (except



- 4 -
for those of three of the small distributors). Tariff increases were put
into effect with reasonable speed in 1974 and 1975 to offset increased oper-
ating costs.
2.07      As noted in annex 3, bulk and retail tariff structures deserve fur-
ther analysis.  The present tariffs do not appea-r 73 refIectt   long-run
incremental costs of supply. The proposed loan includes funds for studies
to determine the incremental cost of providing service to various customer
classes and to propose an alternative tariff structure which-reflects margi-
nal costs, assuming that it is shown that the present one does not. The
Government has agreed to cause CEL to conduct this study, to be completed by
December 31, 1977, and to discuss its results with the Bank promptly upon
completion.
Electricity consumption and service to rural communities
2.08      As shown below, industrial consumptioncomprises the largest and
fastest-growing market segment for electricity. The relatively faster growth
of industrial consumption is expected to continue because of government poli-
cies stimulating industrial expansion in order to employ El Salvador's surplus
labor.

2.09      El Salvador has been a leader in Central America in extending electric
service to rural areas, Under a program begun in 1962 (see annex 4), CEL and
some of the private utilities have made electricity available to almost 600,000
people, about 25% of the rural population, as compared to the 33% penetration
which is considered to be the maximum level economically feasible in El Salvador
(see paragraph 5 of annex 4). CEL's sales in the rural areas have increased at
an annual rate of about 27% since 1970 and reached 26 G%h in 1975.  The growth
rate is expected to slow down as the market saturates. CEL plans to continue
its progress in establishing new rural distribution networks (as indicated in
the performance indicators in annex 5) using funds provided to it by the govern-
ment.
Sector development
2.10      Annex 6 outlines the future hydro developments which are considered
economic;  their locations are indicated on the map. CEL's present plans are
to install the first stage (120 MW) of the San Lorenzo hydro development before
1983, when it will need additional capacity and energy. Total and foreign
.financing requirements of this project (subject to revision by the feasibility
study to be completed by mid-1976) are expected to be on the order of US$150
million and US$90-100 million respectively; its construction is scheduled to
begin in 1978.



2.11      CEL has also obtained sufficient technical data to justify going
ahead with feasibility studies of geothermal plants in Berlin, Chinameca
and San Vicente, whose locations are also indicated on the map. CEL has
estimated the time required for the studies to be 36 months and their cost
US$2.6 million.  The data provided by these studies will allow CEL to include
geothermal alternatives in developing a least-cost generation program for the
early eighties.
2.12      Bilateral technical discussions have been proceeding for the past
two years between representatives of CEL and Instituto Nacional de Electricidad
(INDE) of Guatemala concerning a possible interconnection of their systems.
The short-term purpose of interconnection would be to cover an expected
Guatemalan deficit with electricity (principally from fuel-fired plants)
available from El Salvador. The United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin
America is conducting a study of the possibilities for interconnection among
the Central American countries. CEL and INDE are cooperating in this study,
which should be completed in late 1976. The study includes an assessment of
the long-term costs and benefits of various interconnection possibilities,
which should provide a basis for strengthening regional cooperation in the
power sector.

3. The Project
The program
3.01      CELts present power construction program through 1983 includes:
a.   completion of the second unit (30 MW) at the Ahuachapan geo-
thermal station, expected to be in service by mid-1976; as
well as the effluent disposal channel, expected to be completed
by October 1977 (see paragraph 1.02);
b.   completion of the first phase (2 units, 67.5 MW each) of the Cerron
Grande hydro station. This project was jointly financed by IBRD
(loan 889-ES) and IDB. The first unit is expected to be in service
by January 1977 and the station should be completed shortly thereafter;
c.   the proposed project, described in paragraph 3.02;
d. expansion of transmission and distribution facilities, including
village electrification, as required. The most important future
line would be a 115 kV loop around San Salvador, to give added
reliability to the city's supply; the project includes a portion
of that loop (see map); and
e.   the first stage of the San Lorenzo hydro project with an installed
capacity of 120 MW which CEL expects to complete in 1982.
3.02      The project includes the following major elements, described in
detail in annex 7:
a.   Generation:
The third unit at the Ahuachapan geothermal station which is
presently programmed to have a capacity of 30 MW but, as explained
in paragraph 6 of annex 7, could be of a larger capacity, up to
about 37.5 MW (see paragraph 4.04).
b.   Transmission and subtransmission:
i. construction of about 39 circuit-km of new 115 kV transmission
lines and about 20 circuit-km of 46 kV subtransmission lines;
ii.  conversion of about 83 circuit-km of existing 69 kV transmis-
sion lines to 115 kV; and
iii.  construction and/or improvement of 10 substations, including the
addition of about 150 MVA in new transformer capacity to the
system.
c.   improvements and additions to GEL's communication and control system;
d.   geothermal studies (paragraph 2.11); and
e.   consultants' services (about 500 man-months) for:



-7-.
i.  tariff studies (paragraph 2.07) - 10 man-months;
ii. for the geothermal studies (paragraph 2.11) - 100 man-months;
and
iii.  for detailed engineering and construction supervision pertaining
to the geothermal unit, the transmission lines, the substations
and the communication and control system expansion (390 man-months).
Estimated cost and financing
3.03      The projectts estimated cost is US$43.8 million, with a US$35.2
million foreign component. Total financing requirements, including interest
during construction are US$50.2 and US$39.0 million,respectively. The pro-
posed loan would cover all the foreign financing requirements.
3.004     The costs for the project were estimated jointly by CEL's technical
personnel and the Bank, based on information from recent bids and quotations
and consultantts estimates. The cost of consulting services has been estimated
on the basis of an average cost of US$4600 per man-month.  The costs are detailed

for the Dossible increase in size of the geothermal unit (see paragraph 4.04).

Engineeringv
3.07      CEL has not yet developed its own technical staff to carry out the
engineering necessary for execution of most parts of the project. It has
therefore agreed to engage consultants acceptable to the Bank for engineering,
bid evaluation and construction supervision of the project except for the
46 kV line from Guajoyo to Metapan, for which it has the necessary expertise.
Project execution
3.08      GEL will request bids for the supply and installation of materials
and equipment for the project, with the exception of the 46 kV line and the
modification of existing substations, for which only invitations to supply
materials and equipment will be issued and for which CELts own staff will
perform the installation and commissioning.
3.09      The project implementation schedule, leading to its completion by
mid 1980, is shown in detail in annex 8. CEL has agreed to this schedule,
which will be used to monitor project execution.
Procurement and disbursement
3.10      All purchases of supplies and equipment for the project would be
made following international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bankts
Guidelines for Procurement. Salvadorian and other Central American Common
Market suppliers would receive a margin of preference of 15%. Such suppliers
may be in a position to supply some items for the transmission lines such as
conductors and poles, estimated to cost up to about US$1.5 million.
3.11      Disbursements from the loan account would be made according to the
schedule shown in annex 9, for:
a.   the foreign cost of imported equipment and materials; and 95% of the
ex-factory cost of locally - procured equipment and materials.
b.   the foreign cost of contracts for installation and/or erection of works;
c.   the cost of consultant studies; and
d.   financial charges on the 3ank loans throu h (i) January 31, 1980 for
the conventional loan; and (ii) January 1T, 1980 for the Third-Window
loan, these being the days before the semi-annual repayment dates
preceding the estimated completion date of the project.
Any unused loan balance would be applied to transmission and subtransmission
system extensions and improvements similar to those included in the project,
after consultation with the Bank.



-9-
Environment
3.12      The installation and subsequent operation of Ahuachapan's third unit
would not materially add to the problems summarized in paragraph 1.02, since
this unit is not expected to increase effluent discharges at the plant significantly
as most of its requirements are expected to be met from steam obtain from the
second flash of already utilized hot geothermal water (see paragraph 5, annex 7)
and since the disposal channel should be completed well before this unit is in
operation.  The gases (94% carbon dioxide and 6% hydrogen sulfide) contained in
the geothermal steam will be diffused harmlessly by means of high (15 to 20 m)
stacks. The noise produced by discharges of steam into the air, which may be
occasionally necessary, will be within tolerable limits, 500 m from each well head.
3.13      The wells to be drilled during the studies of other geothermal fields
could produce hazardous effluents which should be safely disposed of. GEL
has agreed to carry out these studies with due regard to ecological and
environmental factors.
Project risks
3.14      Although CEL, its consultants and the Bank are satisfied that the
geothermal field may be successfully utilized for 25 to 30 years, with an
estimated energy content in excess of 24,000 GWh and even though the third
unit would not materially contribute to the depletion of the resource, it is
still possible that the geothermal field may not provide the expected energy.
To minimize this risk, CEL will have to adequately manage the field. CEL
has agreed to report at intervals of not less than 12 months on its
management of the field and to have its report reviewed by consultants acceptable
to the 3ank, until the Bank agrees that such periodic report is no longer
necessary.

4. Justification of the Project
Objectives
4.01      The project would add required generation and transmission facili-
ties to CEL's power system and thus enable this utility to meet future de-
mands for electricity in El Salvador without a reduction in the quality of
service. The project would also be instrumental in utilizing El Salvador's
indigenous geothermal energy resources for generating electricity and thus
reducing the countryts dependence on imported fuel. It would also assist
CEL in further studcying these resources with a view to continuing their
utilization in the future.
4.02        A reliable supply of electric power is essential to El Salvador's
economic growth and the improvement of the standard of living of its population.
As noted in para. 2.08, industry is the largest consumer of electricity. The
future needs of the largest enterprises in th    sector  could be met through
captive generation rather than through reliance on CEL's system. However, such
a pattern of development would be wasteful of the country's resources, since it
would result in duplication of investment, loss of the considerable economies
of scale inherent in large-scale generation facilities, and uneconomic use of
fuel.  Even more serious would be the impact on medium- and small-scale enter-
prises, for which captive generation would in many cases be excessively costly.
The project, therefore, is expected to facilitate in particular the development
of medium- and small-scale economic activity in the country.
Demand and generation forecast
4.0o      The average growth of electricity consumption in El Salvador in the
past five years has beenl0.5% p.a. while CEL's net generation has increased
at an 11% average rate.  AnnexlO gives details of both historical and fore-
cast energy sales and maximum demand for the country as a whole and for the
CEL system. The projection, which assumes an average 10.4% p.a. rate of
increase in the energy requirements through 1985 for the country and 10.7% p.a.
for CEL's sales has been prepared by CEL's consultants, Harza Engineering Co.
International (USA) and appears to be realistic.
Size and type of the project
4.04      The size of the third unit at Ahuachapan has been tentatively selected
on the basis of the estimated capacity of the geothermal field and the plan for
utilizing it. However, observations at the Ahuachapan geothermal field made
since the first unit started operations have indicated that it might be possible
to install a unit somewhat larger (up to about 25% larger) than the presently
contemplated 30 MW. Installation of the largest unit possible is desirable be-
cause it would enable CEL to substitute geothermal generation for more costly
fuel-fired generation. CEL has therefore agreed to conduct such studies as
may be necessary, before award of the turbine-generator contract, to determine
the gtimum size that can be installod at the site without prejudicing the
field and to install such a unit. The related contingency, not expected to
exceed 10% of the turbine-generator's base cost, has been included in the pro-
posed loan amount (paragraph 3.05).
4.05      The type of turbine proposed to be used at Ahuachapan is compatible
with the characteristics of the available steam and is thus adequate.



4.06      The type of the facilities proposed by CEL and its consultant, Harza,
for the substations, transmission lines and communication and control equipment
is adequate for the system. CEL has proposed the utilization of standard-
sized transformers compatible with the loads to be served. On completion of the
project, the ratio of stepdown substation capacity to maximum demand in the
system will have decreased from about 1.49 in 1975 to about 1.25; the envisaged
better utilization of the transformer capacity indicates that no overinvestment
is contemplated;on the other hand,the latter ratio is still high enough to en-
sure adequate reserve and provision for diversity between substations. The
transmission lines and oommunication system additions have been adequately sized.
4.07      The proposed program for further studies of the geothermal resources
is satisfactory and there is enough evidence of geothermal activity in the
areas to be studied to justify the expectations of positive results.
Least-cost solution
14.08     The system costs resulting from an expansion of CEL's generating
facilities with the proposed third unit at Ahuachapan were compared with an
alternative program envisaging the installation of a 30 NW conventional steam
unit at the existing Acajutla power plant. The third unit at Ahuachapan
represents the least-cost solution for meeting the power and energy require-
ments after 1981 for all discount rates lower than 23%. As shown in detail
in annex 11, the selected program is the least-cost solution for discount
rates lower than 17% even with optimistic assumptions regarding the costs of
the alternative program, such as a 30% reduction in the capital cost of the
conventional steam unit (from US$400 to US$280/kW) or in the present price
of fuel (from US$11.00 to US$7.70 per barrel). This range of discount rates
ensures that the proposed unit would also be the least-cost solution when
compared to other types of conventional thermal plants (such as low-speed,
residual oil-burning diesel units). Any cozparison made with the possible in-
creased size of the unit (paragraph 4.03) would-result in a higher equaliz-
ing discount rate due to the small incremental cost of the additional capacity.
4.09      For much of the rest of the equipment included in the project, such
as transformers or communication equipment, no reasonable alternative exists.
Where alternatives do exist, e.g. in routing of lines and location of sub-
stations, CEL has selected the least-cost solution which is compatible with
safety considerations.
Timing
4.10      CEL can meet the forecast requirements for power and energy with its
existing plants and those under construction with a reserve equal to the largest
unit in the system through the end of 1981. Accordingly, from this point of
view, CEL would not be required to add capacity to the system before then;
however, this line of action would require the utilization of fuel-fired plants
and would constitute a higher cost solution, at CEL's present fuel price of
USp11.00/bb, for a13 discount rates lower than 13.6%, than the proposed program,
which envisages the third geothermal unit starting operations by mid-1i9d, some
18 months before required for meeting the expected demands. Annex 11 shows the
details of these calculations, which demonstrate the correctness of the timing
of the unit.

Return on Investment
4.11     As shown in detail in annex 11, the project's benefits to the
country have been compared with its costs.  This comparison equates the
streams of costs associated with the project through its assumed life of
about 30 years and those of the related distribution system investment
(not included in the project) with the estimated benefits as measured by
the forecast revenues from sales of electricity at the retail level and
the savings in fuel. At the 1975 tariff level, the return is 14%. An
increase in the project's costs of 15% would lower this rate to 12.5%.
If the forecast fuel savings did not materialize (because of, e.g., a
series of above-average hydrological years - which would allow hydro
generation to substitute for thermal generation, or a shortfall in sales),
the rate of return would then be 13% and a reduction of all expected bene-
fits by 25% would provide a 9.6% rate of return. These rates of return
indicate that electricity prices will, on average, be higher than incremental
system costs, suggesting that wasteful use of electricity, and thus pre-
mature expansion of capacity will be avoided. However, deficiencies in
the tariff structure may still preclude an optimal rate of development in
the sector, a problem the proposed tariff study (para 2.07) is designed to
address.
4>.12    Annex 11 also shows the return to CEL on its investment as deter-
mined from a comparison of the costs of the project throughout its life
and its benefits as measured by the forecast revenues from sales of electri-
city at the bulk level and the expected savings in fuel. On the basis of
the recently approved bulk tariff level, the return to CEL is about 15%.
4.13      The above calculations probably understate the benefits of the
project as the electricity rates, which were used as a measure of benefits,
may not fully consider the indirect benefits to industry and commerce,
whose production and employment depend on a reliable electricity supply,
nor the social benefits of residential and public uses. However, even on
the basis of present tariffs, the range of rates of return obtained for
the project compare favorably with the opportunity cost of capital for
El Salvador. The above results are based on economic efficiency prices for
all inputs except labor. The use of efficiency prices for labor - which
would be appropriate due to El Salvador's underemployment - would increase
the rates of return.



- 13 -
5. The Borrower
5.01      The borrower (dr, in the case of the Third Window funds, the bene-
ficiary) would be CEL, which was created in 1945 as an autonomous government-
owned enterprise to study the hydro electric resources of the Rio Lempa;
subsequent amendments to its enabling legislation gave it the responsi-
bility of developing all means of electricity generation for public service.
Since 1959 it has also had responsibility for installing distribution facili-
ties in areas not served by private companies.
Organization and management
5.02      CEL's organization, described in annex 13, has not changed signi-
ficantly since the sixth project appraisal (report no. 69a-ES, April 1973).
Its management and engineering staff are capable; it is well-administered
and carries on its operations efficiently. In 1975, the utility had about
1000 operational employees, of whom about 150 were associated with rural
electrification administration. Its energy sales/employee ratio (see annex
5) compares very favorably with that of other bulk suppliers in Central America.
In the areas of planning and training, however, CEL may be taking a short-term
view and achieving savings at the expense of sound development of its organization.
5.03      CELts planning capability needs improvement.  Since 1973, CEL has
tried to organize a planning department; before that date it had relied exclusively
on the use of outside consultants for this purpose. Since then, CEL has
continued to use consultants on an ad hoc basis, which arrangement has not
provided entirely satisfactory results. The Bank has provided funds for training
(see paragraph 5.04) inter alia to help strengthen planning within CEL. However,
GELts planning department is at the present time basically a financial planning
unit, with system development planning responsibility assigned to the studies
department and actual work divided between this department and the operations
department. Actual man-power devoted to system planning activities is not enough
for CEL's requirements either in quantity or quality. CEL has agreed to substantially
expand its planning within its planning department.
5.04      CEL had not, until recently, formulated a training program or utilized
funds provided by loan 889-ES for that purpose.  It has concentrated in ad hoc
training. The necessity of programming its training has been recognized by CELts
management, which has submitted proposals for future training, using funds from
loan 889-ES, envisaging about 140 man-months of training through 1978. Implement-
ation of these proposals will be monitored during project supervision.
Management information systems and audit
5.05      CEL's internal management information system is satisfactory;
operating and financial reports are prepared accurately and promptly, and
accounting systems have been computerized. Its financial statements are
audited by a local firm with extensive experience in audits of public
utilities, including CEL. However, CEL is also audited by El Salvadorts
Corte de Cuentas and by a firm designated by the Central Reserve Bank. Re-
sulting complications often delay the submission of audited reports to the



- 14 -
Bank beyond the four-month period stipulated in existing loan agreements.
In view of these problems, it was agreed that CEL would provide
the Bank unaudited financial data within three months of the close of the
fiscal year, and financial statements audited by an independent auditor
satisfactory to the Bank together with the auditorfs report, within six
months.
Performance indicators
5.06      Annex 5 shows a representative selection of indicators of CELts
marketing, operating and financial performance (other than those covered
by proposed covenants) through the year following project completion. Per-
formance as measured by theee indicators would be monitored during project
execution.



- 15 -
6. Finance
6.01      As detailed in annex 14, CELts financial performance has been
exemplary. CEL has consistently exceeded its rate of return requirements
except in 1975 when its rate of return was about 4% due to adverse hydro-
logical conditions and limitations on geothermal generation which resulted
in higher-than-expected fuel consumption. A tariff increase made
effective in late 1975 provides assurance that CEL's income and cash gener-
ation will remain satisfactory daring the project construction period. The
utilityts rate of return on a revalued rate base is expected to exceed 8%
during that period; its self-financing ratio, to be 37%; and its debt/equity
ratio, to decline from 55/45 in 1975 to 40/60 by 1980.
Financial performance, rate base revaluation and tariff levels
6.02      As detailed in paragraph 3 of annex 14, CEL maintained a rate of
return higher than the 9% stipulated in existing loan/project agreements
from 1960 through 1974 (measured on an original-cost base) with only one
tariff increase; its tariff levels were increased by 60% in mid-1974 to
offset increases in its fuel prices. Despite this increase, adverse hydro-
logical conditions and limitations on geothermal output (see paragraph 1.02)
caused CELts rate of return to decline to about 4% in 1975; in December of
that year CEL received a further 31% tariff increase, which would restore its
cash generation to satisfactory levels (see paragrpph 6.06).
6.03      CEL has recognized the necessity of revaluing its rate base.  It
has therefore engaged a consultant to make recommendations concerning reval-
ation; completion of his report is expected by September 1976. CEL has
confirmed that it will discuss this study and its recommendations as well as
the method and timing of its implementation with the Bank by December 31, 1976.
6.04      CEL agreed to achieve a rate of return of not less than 9% on net
fixed assets in operation until its assets are revalued. Thereafter, the
minimum rate of return would be 8%.
6.05      The rate of return resulting from existing tariff levels is ex-
pected to exceed 8% on revalued assets throughout the project construction
period. Because the projected cash generation is necessary to pay for the
rest of CEL's investment program, particularly cost overruns on the sixth
project, CEL has agreed to maintain its average tariff level during the project
period.  The projected rate of return, without further tariff increases, is
forecast to fall to below 7% in 1981; remedial action would be considered in
the light of requirements at that time.
Financing plan
6.o6      CELts financing plan for the project construction period, summarized
below and detailed in attachment 3 to annex 14, is satisfactory. Net internal



- 16 -
cash generation would pay for 37% of the investment program, borrowings (see
paragraph 6.07) for 62%, and government contributions for rural electrifica-
tion (see paragraph 6, attachment 8 to annex 14) for the remaining 1%. The
financing plan is based on reinvestment of all net internal cash generation
during the project period.  CEL has agreed to such reinvestment.

6.07.     CEL has received authorization to issue up to 025 (US$lb) iillilor
of 15-year bonds in El Salvador.  Of this amount, A5 (US$6) million is re-
quired in 1976, and prior to declaring the loan effective, the Bank should
be notified that CEL has received payment for this amount of bonds. The
financial projections assume that an additional V5 (US$2) million would be
sold in 1977. The balance of the authorized bond issue would be reserved
for use in the event of unforeseen contingencies.
6.08      Before CEL can borrow money or invest its own money in the project,
it must receive approval of its extraordinary budget for the project from El
Salvadorts Legislative Assembly. As in previous Bank operations, consider-
ation of this budget by the assembly would follow approval of the proposed
loan by the Executive Directors. The loan should not become effective until
the Legislative Assembly has approved the extraordinary budget.

Financial position and debt-service coverage
6.09      As detailed in paragraph 7 of annex 14, GEL's financial position
is expected to improve during the project period; its debt/equity ratio
would decrease from current relatively high levels (55/45) and its debt-
service coverage would be adequate.
6.10      CEL has agreed not to incur any long-term indebtedness without
Bank approval unless its most recent 12-month internal cash generation is
at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirement for any succeeding
fiscal year. Because CEL's debt service will be high throughout the project
period, Bank approval of other future borrowing is expected to be necessary.

7. Agreements Reached and Recommendations
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
issues:
a. The government has agreed to cause CEL to study the tariff
structures of CEL and the distribution utilities (paragraph
2.07);
b.  CEL has agreed to conduct feasibility studies of other
geothermal fields, with due regard to ecological and
environmental factors (paragraph 3.13);
c.  CEL gave assurances that it would periodically report on its
management practices at the Ahuachapan field (paragraph 3.14);
d.  CEL would not award the contract for the geothermal generating unit
until it had determined, in consultation with the Bank, the optimum
size of such a generating unit (paragraph 4.05);
e.  CEL agreed to carry out a yearly financial audit by inde-
pendent auditors (paragraph 5.05);
f.  CEL agreed to maintain a rate of return of at least 3% on
a revalued rate base (paragraph 6.04);
g.  CEL would maintain its existing tariff levels (paragraph 6.05);
h.  CEL would retain its net internal cash generation (paragraph 6.06);
and
i.  CEL would not incur new debt, without Bankts concurrence, unless its
debt-service coverage exceeds l.5 times (paragraph 6.10).
7.02      Before declaring the loan effective, the Bank should be notified that:
a.  CEL has received payment for ¢15 (US$6) million of its bond issue
(paragraph 6.07); and
b.  the Salvadorian Legislative Assembly has approved GEL's extraordinary
budget for the project (paragraph 6.08).
7.03      In the foregoing circumstances, the project is suitable for a con-
ventional Bank loan and a Third Window loan for a total of US.39 million.  The
conventional loan, for US$30 million with a term of 25 years including 4-1/2 of
grace, would be made to GEL and would be guaranteed by the Republic of El Salvador.
The loan from the Third Window facility, for US$9 million with a term of 25 years
including 7 of grace, would be made to the Republic of El Salvador, to be onlent
to CEL under the same terms and conditions as the conventional Bank loan.

COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
Organization of the Electric Power Sector
1.        Prior to GEL's creation in 1945, El Salvador's electricity needs
were served exclusively by private companies. CEL was created by law to
study the hydro resources of the Rio Lempa; subsequent amendments to its
enabling legislation gave it the responsibility of developing all means
of electricity generation for public service.
Public-service generation
2.        Since 1954, when its first installation - the Cinco de Noviembre
hydro plant at Guayabo - was commissioned, CEL has provided practically all
generating and transmission facilities in El Salvador and has interconnected
all the distribution companies serving the country. In addition to the almost
20,000 retail customers it serves in nine rural zones as a result of its rural
electrification program (see paragraph 2.09 of the text and annex 4), CEL sells
electricity to two industrial customers, various government agencies and eight
private distribution companies. Details of 1974 generation and electricity
sales by each utility, shown in attachment 1, indicate CEL's dominance in
generation and capacity; it generated about 95% of the energy provided for
public service. This percentage will increase in 1975-77 when the first two
30 MW units at the Ahuachapan geothermal station and the first two 67.5 MW
units at the Cerron Grande hydro development are put into service.
3.        Attachment 2 details the public-service generating facilities.  CEL
owned 93% of the country's capacity at year-end 1975; this percentage will
increase to 95% in 1977. The other utilities' hydro facilities are all run-
of-river installations, and their thermal facilities are kept in reserve.
4.        As shown below, slightly over half of El Salvador's public-service
generating capacity at year-end 1975 utilized indigenous energy sources -
hydro power and geothermal steam. The remaining 49% was oil-fired. By early
1977, the ratio is expected to change to 69% indigenous - 31% fuel-fired as
presently under-construction units come into service.

Transmission and subtransmission
5.        CEL has a system of 115 kV and 69 kV transmission lines which
covers the entire country, interconnecting all major load centers and generat-
ing plants.  At present CEL has 529.3 circuit-km of transmission lines, 361.5
MVA of bulk-power stepdown transformer capacity, about 400 circuit-km of 44 kV
and 22 kV subtransmission lines, and about 1,000 circuit-km of 13.2 kV rural
distribution lines. The distribution companies also have subtransmission lines
within their service areas.
Distribution
6.        CAESS, which serves both the central portion of the country (includ-
ing the capital city) and a zone in the eastern part (see map), is the dominant
distributor of electricity, both in terms of GWh sold (76%) and number of con-
sumers served (66%). Its quality of service has been satisfactory.
7.        However, many of the smaller distributors (excluding CEL, which ser-
ves several rural zones - see annex 4 ) have not maintained high quality ser-
vice inter alia because of their inability to provide enough capital - either
from external sources or through internal cash generation - to support neces-
sary investment levels. Because of the inability of one of the distributing
companies to invest in facilities to serve new large industrial installations,
CEL has made arrangements to do so itself. At the government's suggestion,
CAESS has begun negotiations to acquire some of the distribution utilities.
8.        Acquisition of the smaller utilities by CAESS would be a satis-
factory solution to the problem as long as CAESS' cash generation is suffic-
ient to meet its own dividend requirements, maintain its investment program
in its present service area at satisfactory levels and invest in facilities
sufficient to remedy existing problems in areas of new responsibility. How-
ever, CAESS' earnings have deteriorated slightly (by the company's reckoning)
from the 8% return permitted by law - which the company achieved in 1973 -
to less than 7% in 1974 and 1975, although IGSE's figures show higher return
for 1974. Wile this alleged deterioration is not drastic, its effect on
quality of service could be serious over the long run, so that the Bank would
continue to monitor CAESS' earnings levels during project execution.
Captive plants
9.        As of year-end 1973 there were 69 private power plants with a total
capacity of 23.6 MW operating in El Salvador. In that year they generated a
total of 40 GWn.  Of this total capacity, about 12 MW are steam units which
are installed in sugar refineries and burn bagasse, about 11 MW are diesel
units, and about 1 MW are hydroelectric and gasoline units. About 6 MW of
the diesel capacity is installed in two large industries: the petroleum re-
finery at Acajutla, and a steel scrap foundry and rolling mill in Zacatecoluca.
The remaining diesel capacity is installed in various units, each of which is
less than 400 kW.

APPRAISAL OF AHAUACHAPAN EXPANSION PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
Electricity Regulation and Tariffs in El Salvador
Regulation
1.        Regulatory procedures in El Salvador are based on the 1936 Electric
Service Law and subsequent regulations and modifications.  The Inspeccion
General de Servicios Electricos (IGSE) under the Minister of Economy reviews
the financial and technical condition of the distribution companies; and the
Minister of Economy decides policy matters concerning the power sector with
the advice of the executive director of CEL and the director of IGSE.
2.        Officially, all utilities except CEL are subject to regulation by
IGSE. The private companies are permitted an 8% annual return on net assets
after all expenses, including taxes imposed on the companies and on dividends
and remittances to shareholders. Net assets include 75% of assessed value
of assets in 1952 plus net additions at cost less depreciation since 1952.
As noted in annex 2, CAESS's rate of return has generally been close to the
8% target, but the other companies' have not. All Salvadorian utilities have
approximately equal tariffs, as shown in attachment 1; the resultant revenues
have generally been insufficient for the smaller, higher-cost distributors.
3.        Under its charter CEL is allowed, with the approval of the Executive
branch of government, to establish tariffs sufficient to cover its costs in-
cluding its expansion costs and meet its obligations with creditors. CEL is
therefore obliged to discuss its tariff proposals with the national planning
council, IGSE, and other presidential advisers before they are approved. This
process has not been unduly cumersome; CEL was able to obtain approval of
tariff increases in 1974 and late 1975 in about five months.
Retail tariffs
4.        The principal retail tariffs of the five largest Salvadorian distri-
butors are detailed in attachment 1.
5.        Prior to 1974 Salvadorian tariff levels had not changed substantially
for about 20 years. To recover increases in its fuel costs, beginning in late
1973, CEL increased its bulk tariff by 00.024 (US$.01)/kWAh in mid-1974, and
the distributors increased energy charges for almost all consumer categories
except minimum residential consumption equally, or almost so (+ 00.00l/kEh).
6.        The resultant average tariffs by consumer category are:
0/kTWh                  US$/kWAh
Residential                .098                     .039
Commercial                 .112                     .045
Industrial                 .088                     .035
Governmental               .095                     .038



Annex 3
Page 2 of 2 pages
The above averages and the detailed tariffs illustrate a potential problem:
industrial tariffs may exceed marginal costs, providing incentive for in-
dustries to install their own fuel-burning generating units. At the same
time, other tariff levels appear too low.
7.        Other aspects of the tariff schedules which deserve investigation
are:
a.   differing demand charges among various sizes of industrial customers;
b.   the pattern of residential energy rates per kWh, which first in-
creases, then decreases with higher consumption;
C.   the absence of price incentives for offpeak consumption, either
on a daily or seasonal basis; and
d.   the lack of provision for reactive energy in some of the tariffs.
Bulk tariffs
8.        CEL's tariffs to the distribution companies are:
a.   an energy charge of 00.054/kW; and
b.   a demand charge of 045 per kW/year to the larger companies (CAESS,
CLESA, CLES, CLEA, DEUSEM and IESSEM) and 050 per kW/year to the
smaller companies and the other bulk customers.
CEL has a slightly higher energy charge to the industrial customers it serves
directly.
9.        As is true with the retail tariff schedules, CEL's bulk tariffs may
not reflect the incremental cost of supplying electricity, do not provide for
reactive energy, and do not allow for cost differentials related to season,
time-of-day, or distance from energy source. The seasonal factor is of some
importance, since the system's peak demand is in the dry season (November-May)
and excess water is available during the rainy season (May-October). A further
item deserving analysis is CEL's practice of basing its demand charge on co-
incident demand where more than one delivery point is involved. While this
practice may compensate CEL for its investment in generating facilities, it may
not do so for transmission lines and substation equipment.
Proposed study
10.       The proposed loan includes funds for consultants to determine the long-
range incremental cost of providing electricity for various categories of con-
sumption in El Salvador and, assuming that the present bulk and retail tariff
schedules do not reflect incremental costs, to propose an alternative tariff
strucuture which does so. Prompt completion of such a study is feasible because
CEL and IGSE have adequate nationwide statistics.

Rural Electrification in El Salvador
Background
1.        El Salvador was one of the first countries in Latin America, to
use a systematic nationwide approach to providing public-service electri-
city supply to rural areas. In 1961 CEL completed a general rural electri-
fication plan, which provided the basis for subsequent installation of
facilities.
2.        As a result of the plan, CEL divided the country into 17 zones
and established criteria for determining priorities in selecting areas in
which to install facilities: principal among these criteria were popula-
tion density, nature of resources, ease of access and relative probability
of increasing regional productivity. Recognizing that rural electrifica-
tion systems often sustain operating losses, particularly in their early
years, GEL elected to have existing utilities (including CEL itself in areas
not served by other companies) serve the public directly, rather than attempt-
ing to form cooperatives.
3.        Implementation of the rural electrification plan through 1968 pro-
ceeded in three stages:
a.   the Pilot Plan, executed in 1962 in one zone near San Salvador
with financial assistance from a 24-year 4.25% loan from IDB;
b.   the First Development Plan (1962-64), in which CEL extended
electrification in four zones in western and central El Salvador,
and DEUSEM, in its own service area in the east; and
c.   the Second Development Plan (1965-68), in which CEL extended ser-
vice in existing zones and in four new zones in eastern El Salvador,
and CAESS, DEUSEM and DESSEM, in their own service areas.
Beginning in 1969, the utilities have extended their own rural networks in
the same zone. Except for the IDB loan and a 01 (US$o.4) million commercial
loan which CAESS obtained locally, the utilities have paid for the facilities
from their own resources. Beginning in 1975, the government has transferred
the debt-service differential of 01.5 (US$0.6) million on IDA credit 227-ES
to CEL for rural electrification.
Progress to date
4.        By the end of 1974, about 25% of the country's rural population had
access to public-service electricity; other statistics are summarized below:

Thousands of customers                      20              14               34
5.        The Bank and the Universidad Centroamericana Jose Simeon Canas, San
Salvador, completed a case study of rural electrification in Bl Salvador
(Public Utilities Report No. RES 5, Costs and Benefits of Rural Electrification)
in early 1975. The principal conclusions of the study are:
a.   initial costs per kWh are very high, reflecting relatively large
investments and low load factors;
b.   initial consumer response is low, but demand subsequently increases
quite rapidly;
c.   for the above reasons and because of low and/or poorly-structured
tariffs (see annex 3), financial returns are poor, even over the
long run;
d.   however, as the tariffs do not fully measure the economic value of
electricity, the economic returns are higher than the financial returns
and are comparable to the opportunity cost of capital in El Salvador;
and
e.   it is difficult to justify economically extensions of supply outside
main rural villages and their immediate environs, especially in the
absence of agro-industrial loads, which improve the utilization of
facilities.
Future development
6.        Using its own funds and government transfers (paragraph 4), CEL
intends to maintain its level of investment in rural electrification at 01.5
to 2.5 (US$0.6 to 1.0) million annually, selecting projects based on economic
merit. Continuation of its program is expected to result in a gradually higher
penetration of the rural market as shown in the performance indicators (see
annex 5). It must be recognized, however, that two-thirds of El Salvador's
rural population lives outside the areas for which electrification is considered
justifiable (paragraph 5e) at the present time, and that the rate of progress
in achieving rural electrification will necessarily diminish.

Possible Future Hydroelectric Developments
1.        In its 1974 study of system expansion for 1977-78, CEL's consultant
(Harza Engineering International of the US) analyzed all possible future hydro
developments in the country. Several which had been identified previously
(the Astillero project on the Rio Lempa and three other projects on smaller
rivers) were eliminated as uneconomic. The following projects, all on the
Rio Lempa, were compared on a pre-feasibility basis (see map for locations):

costs                capacity              energy

Construction costs were estimated at September 1974 price levels with escala-
tion during the construction period at 11% p.a. for civil works and 12-15% p.a.
for various equipment items. Excluded from the cost estimates were escalation
from September 1974 to the start of construction, interest during construction,
transmission lines and stepdown substations.
2.        Because its reservoir would inundate Honduran territory as well as
Salvadorian, development of the least-cost alternative - the El Tigre site -
would require an agreement between the two countries and must therefore await
resolution of current political difficulties with Honduras.
3.        The recommended version of the El Zapotillo project would flood the
existing Guajoyo plant, with installed capacity of 15 MW and annual energy of
53 Gih, so that a lower version might also be considered. In any event, be-
cause of low river flows on the upper Dempa, neither of the projects located
there would be the least-cost alternative for expanding generating capacity.
4.        Expansion of the existing Cinco de Noviembre plant would produce
relatively little additional energy,
5.        By virtue of elimination of the other hydro alternatives, the first
(120 MW) stage of the San Lorenzo development appears to be the least-cost
hydro solution to the country's electricity needs in the early 1980s. How-
ever, the project's cost is expected to be high; including full escalation
and interest during construction, its total financing requirements are on
the order of US$150 million, with a foreign component of US$90-100 million.

6.        For this reason, it may be advantageous for CEL to make a comparison
between its proposed San Lorenzo project and an advancement of the installation
of geothermal units at locations other than Ahuachapan, possibly in combination
with peaking units at Cinco de Noviembre or Cerron Grande. To be able to do this,
CEL must proceed with studies of at least one of the fields promptly so that the
studies can be completed by 1978.

Detailed Description of the Project
A.  Ahuachapan Geothermal Power Station
Background
1.        CEL has been studying El Salvador's geothermal resources since 1953
with UNDP-provided technical and financial assistance. The Ahuachapan geo-
thermal field, of about 25 km2 was selected as the most promising one for
exploratory and later for production drilling. The first production well was
drilled in 1968. Based on present information, an estimated value for the
total potential energy from the field is around 24,O00 GTh. The estimated
total energy could be utilized by a generating capacity of around 100 MW
operating for 30 years; these figures should be reviewed after three or four
years of operation of the first three generating units.
2.        CEL now has one 30-MW unit actually operating at the Ahuachapan plant,
albeit with a reduced output to avoid excessive contamination of the river Paz
(see paragraph 4) and another identical unit under construction which is expected
to be in operation by mid-1976. These two units utilize medium pressure steam
(about 6kg/cm2, abs) separated in a first flash from the geothermal mixture by
means of vertical cyclone separators installed near each well-head.
3.        At the time of appraisal, there were thirteen wells actually pro-
ducing, or capable of producing steam from a layer located at an average depth
of about 800 meters under the surface. At the producing layer, water at a
pressure of 13-15 kg/cm2 and a temperature of around 2300C is found. At the
surface, approximately 25% of the enthalpy of 230 kcal/kg can be obtained in
the form of usable steam and 75% in form of hot water at 1000C with a very
high content of salts (mainly silicates and cholorides), which precipitate
as the water temperature decreases. The presently contemplated installation
of about 100 MW would produce an amount of effluent water of the order of 1.0
m3/sec.
4.        The high boron and arsenic content of the effluent makes this water
unsuitable for agricultural or residential uses and requires its careful dis-
posal to avoid contamination. CEL is presently building a channel to the sea to dis-
charge the effluent but construction has been seriously delayed and completion which
had been expected by early 1975 is now scheduled for October 1977. In the mean-
time, CEL is discharging part of the effluent to the nearby river Paz (see
map) and reinjecting the remainder (seeparagraph 1.02 of the text).
The output of the plant is limited by an agreed-upon - between CEL and the
Bank - concentration limit of boron (3.0 mg/i) and arsenic (0.2 mg/l) in the
river, which is also contaminated from natural sources
The proposed unit
5.        The proposed third unit will be partially fed by low-pressure steam
obtained from hot geothermal water discharged by the cyclone separators which
provide steam for the first two units and which will be transported to the



Annex 7

power plant area where low-pressure (about 1.5 kg/cm2 abs) steam will be ob-
tained in a second flash by means of separators. It is intended that about
74% of the required steam will be obtained from the first two units and the
remainder from three existing low-pressure productive wells. The unit may
also be supplied from medium-pressure sources through a pressure reducing
station. Alternatively, the unit may be a double-pressure one if ongoing
studies confirm that the present availability of steam warrants this.
6.        Preliminary measurements and observations made after the initial
operation of the first unit indicate that there could be enough low-pressure
steam available from all sources in the field to provide the prime mover for
a generating unit up to about 25% larger than the proposed 30 MW unit. CEL
has agreed to continue investigations to determine whether this is confirmed,
and if so, the proposed unit would be larger than presently proposed.
B.   The transmission system expansion
7.        Ahuachapan-Sonsonate.  This 27 km, 115 kV line will allow the output
of the Ahuachapan line to be transmitted through alternate routes to San
Salvador, the major load center. It will also complete a loop into which the
existing Acajutla and Guajoyo plant may feed. Switching substations will be
built at both ends of the line.
8.        Nuevo Cuscatlan line and substation.  This 115 kV, double circuit line,
about 6 km in length will branch from the existing Acajutla - San Antonio Abad line
and is expected to become part of the proposed future loop around the city of San
Salvador (see map). The new substation (30/40/50 MVA) will allow the Southwest por-
tion of the city, where a major portion of the load growth is expected,to be
served directly from the transmission system rather than through the existing
three substations and distribution systems. The new substation will also
replace obsolete long distribution lines in the area.
9.        San Rafael Cedros - San Miguel. This 83 km,69 kV line to the eastern
part of the country has almost reached its capacity and, due to its physical
condition has too many outages. It is proposed to upgrade the lines to 115 kV.
The project also includes modification of the 5 substations in the area.
10.       Guajoyo-Metapan.  This 20 lon,46 kV line is proposed for supplying
power to a proposed new cement plant and for the expansion of service to another
existing cement plant in the area. The existing lines in the area do not have
enough capacity to handle these additional loads. The project also includes
expansion of the Guajoyo substation by 30/40/50 MVA.
11.       Santa Ana substation.  The existing transformer at this substation
is old and in poor physical condition and has reached the limit of its capacity
(15 MVA). The project includes,a new 30/40/50 MVA transformer for this sub-
station.
C.  The communication and control system expansion
12.       The communications and control system expansion will provide the
following functions:



Annex 7
Page 3 of 3   pages
a.   Economic dispatch, communication, automatic load frequency control,
data logging, and supervisory control of the existing hydroelectric
power plants including Guajoyo, which will be completely automated
under the project.  Data haridling will include the gathering of
relevant information such as MW, MVAR, KA, KV, MWH, and iVARH of
all 115 kV lines and all generating units, checks for limits and rates
of rise, issue of hourly logging reports, and issue of comments to the
data and event loggers. Data displays will include monitoring status
and data.
b.   Extension of the microwave system to include the following locations:
i.   Ahuachapan power plant;
ii.   Santa Ana substation;
iii.   Opico substation;
iv.   Guajoyo power plant;
v.   Acajutla power plant; and
vi.   Nuevo Cuscatlan substation.
c.   Supervisory control of San Rafael Cedros and Santa Ana substations.
D.   Proposed studies of the geothermal fields at San Vicente, Berlin and Chinameca
13.       Eighteen areas of possible utilization of geothermal resources for
power production were identified during the first phase of the studies, carried
out in El-Salvador in the late 50's and 60's with UNDP assistance. Of these,
the four most likely to be suitable for development were Ahuachapan, already
being utilized, San Vicente, Berlin and Chinameca (see map).
14.       As part of these studies, two exploratory deep wells (1,400 and 600 m)
were drilled at Berlin, both with positive production of steam. Geological
and geophysical reconnaissance in this area indicates a strong probability of
finding a suitable geothermal reservoir at a depth below 4O0 m.
15.       Geological, geomorphological and geophysical reconnaissance studies
made at the time at San Vicente and Chinameca as well as shallow wells drilled
also indicate strong probabilities of finding suitable geothermal resources,
even though no deep wells have been drilled in these two areas.
16.       CEL now proposes to follow up on these studies by completing geo-
physical; geochemical and geologic studies to be followed by a deep-well
drilling program according to the schedule shown in annex 8.

APPRAISAL OF AHUACHAPAN EXPANSION PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HTDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
Least-cost Solution and Timing
1.        CEL can meet the forecast requirements for power and energy shown
in annex 10 through the end of 1981 with its existing plants and those under
construction and still have, at the time of the yearly peak, a reserve equal
to the largest unit in the system.
2.        Accordingly, CEL would require the installation of additional genera-
tion of some type before the end of 1981. There are two possible hydro alterna-
tives that could be considered:
a.   Expansion of the 5 de Noviembre plant:  thisprojectwould not add
firm energy to the system. Since additional firm energy is re-
quired by 1982, the project is not practicable.
b.   The San Lorenzo project:  this project can meet the capacity and
energy requirements. However, the project has a long lead time,
and the feasibility study is still underway. Since there is no
assurance that the project can be commissioned by the end of 1981
it, too, was discarded.
The only practical alternative to the proposed unit would therefore be a thermal
plant.  Because of the need to add energy to the system, gas turDines, wnicn
have a high unit energy cost, are not considered.  The alternative to the third
unit at Ahuachapan, therefore, is an oil-fired plant of the same capacity with
an installed cost of about US400/kW and a thermal efficiency of about 2,500 Kcal/
kWh.  It has been assumed that the fuel cost would be US11 .00 per barrel of oil,
CEL's present fuel price.
3.        In order to meet the forecast requirements for power and energy through
1981, CEL requires the utilization of fuel-fired plants so that it could be
economically advantageous to advance the unit and save fuel, it is therefore
important to determine the optimum timing for the proposed unit.

L4. The following generation programs (in G14h) were developed to meet the energy requirements under  different assumptioas .nae
with regards to the possibilities of installation of the proposed third geothermal unit at Ahuachapan and the alternative
conventional steam unit.

j/ The equalizing discount rate would be 10.8 if the disbursement schedules are modified
so that the yearly disbursements, 1977 to 1981 (in US$|10) are 1.5, 7.4, 8.0, 7.0 and
0.0 for the 1-1-81 alternative and 0.0, 1.5, 7.4, 8.0 and 7.0 for the 1-1-82 alternative
to reflect the additional lead time these alternatives have over the project.
The equalizing discount rate would be 11.2 if the disbursement schedule for the 1-1-82
alternative is modified as in footnote J/.
T5/ The equalizing discount rate would be 5.2% if a 10% increase in investment cost is
assumed for the accelerated program required to complete the unit by 1-1-80; if in
addition, the disbursement schedule for the 1-1-82 alternative is modified as in
footnote 1/, the equalizing discount rate becomes 4.5%.

8.        From all of the above, it is concluded that :
a.   the third unit at Ahuachapan is the least-cost solution
when compared with the only practical alternative; and
b.   the proposed timing is the optimum timing as either advancing
or delaying by six months the unit from its proposed in-service-
date (June 30, 1980) would result in lower equalizing discount
rates. Ifo comparisons were made with in-service-dates prior to
January 1930 as it would not be realistic to attempt to advance
the unit to an earlier date.

APPRAISAL OF AHUACHAPAN EXPMASION PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
Rate of Return
Three sets of rate of return calculations were made:
a.   The rate of return of the investment in the project to El Salvador
for which the benefits were calculated on the basis of the estima-
ted fuel savings and the increase in energy sales due to the pro-
ject. The revenues were calculated on the basis of the retail
tariff levels in effect in 1975 and the costs included all those
associated with the project plus estimated costs for the distribu-
tion system expansion that would be required because of the project.
Detailed explanations regarding the assumptions made in calculating
the costs and benefits are provided in the footnotes which appear
in the following pages.
b.   The rate of return of the project to CEL, for which the benefits
were calculated on the basis of the expected fuel savings and the
bulk tariffs put into effect in late 1975. The costs do not in-
clude those associated with the expansion of the distribution
systems,
c.   The rate of return of each of the transmission lines and associated
substations, for which the benefits included the estimated additional
revenues calculated on the basis of the 1975 retail tariffs, the
reduction of system losses and the additional reliability, as applic-
able to each line and as detailed in the footnotes in the following
pages. The estimated costs included the costs of the associated
distribution system expansion.

5% of the total forecast increase in sales for 1978 over the previous year plus,
10% at the total forecast increase in sales for 1979 over the previous year pluts,
-5% of the total forecast increase in sales for 1980 over the-previous year plus,

40% of the total forecast increase in sales for 1983 over the previous year plus,
50% of the total forecast increase in sales for 1984 over the previous year.

I/ The difference (if any) between estimated energy generated with the third unit at Ahuachapan and the
increase in sales of energy (plus associated- 15% - losses) is considered as generation which substitutes
for fuel-fired generation. This energy is valued at 1U3$0.325/lkh, vhich is the estimated incremental cost
of fuel-fired generation in 1981-83.

a/ Refers to the value of the additional reliability provided the system as
measured by the energy that would not be supplied to the system during unexpected
outages if the line were not built. The existing line which would be paralleled
by the proposed line is subject to 0.17 outages per km-year according to avail-
able statistics.  Each outage on the average lasts for 32.5 minutes.  Of the 83
average MW carried by the line, 47 MW can be generated by other means within 5
minutes and 26 MW within 12 minutes; the remainder cannot be supplied from other
sources; the energy not supplied in the absence of the proposed line is thus,
90,816 kWh/year.  The loss to the economy is valued at the 1974 ratio of GNP and
total energy consumption in E Salvador or about US$1.00/kWh not supplied (see
footnote (al page 6 of this annex).
b/ Refers to the energy that would have to be supplied to the system (85,000 kWh/year)
in the absence of the proposed line using gas turbines to replace geothermal
generation during unexpected outages. The unit cost is US$0.042 kWh.
c/ Refers to energy that would have to be supplied to the system (166,000 kih/year)
in the absence of the proposed line using fuel-fired steam turbines to replace
geothermal generation during planned maintenance. Unit cost is US$0.022/kWh.
d/ Refers to reduction in losses in the amount of 10 Gih/year as determined by load-
flow calculations made with and without the proposed line. The unit cost is
the forecast weighted average cost of all fuel-fired generation for 1981 -
US$0.025/kih.
e/ The existing 83 km-69 kV line is subject to 0.35 outages per km-year with an
average outage time of 3 minutes. The line also requires about 4 hours of
maintenance per year. Thus, the total energy not supplied to the system in
the absence of the proposed line is about 92,000 kWh/year, valued at US$1.00.
f/ Refers to reduction in losses calculated in about 1%, which results in about
2 GWh/year valued at US$0.025/kWh, the forecast weighted average cost of all
fuel-fired generation for 1981.
g/ 25% of the increase in energy sales due to project in 1978 through 1980, valued
at the retail rates less fuel and operating and maintenance expenses for the
distribution and transmission systems and less an allowance of US$0.01/kWh for
distribution investment equivalent to a total of US$0o01/kih. The additional
revenues are kept constant after 1981.
h/ The Nuevo Cuscatlan 115 kV line and substation will replace an old distribution
system, in poor condition, subject to about 12 outages of about 30 minutes
duration per year, with a loss of supply to the system of about 120,000 kih/year
valued at US$1.00 kTh.
i/ This line will allow CEL to sell energy to a cement factory with estimated
eventual peak load of 8 MW and 40 GWii/year consumption - energy has been valued
at US$0.01 net of fuel, other operating and maintenance expenses and an allowance
for distribution investment.

Organization and Management
1.        CEL's organization chart is attached. The utility is well-
administered; lines of authority and responsibility are well-defined and
adhered to.
2.        CEL's seven-man Board of Directors is comprised of a representative
of the Ministry of the Interior, who serves as President, and representatives
of the Ministries of Economy, Agriculture, Development and Public Works of
CEL's bondholders and of the country's private banks and industrial and agri-
cultural associations. The Board, whose president has held office since 1950,
establishes policy. It appoints an Executive Director who is responsible for
all management functions; the present Executive Director, a capable civil
engineer, had previous experience with CEL and private industry before assuming
his present position in 1971. The utility's management and engineering staffs
are capable.  However, its planning organization is deficient (see para. 5.03
of the text) and the proposed loan agreement provides for its strengthening.
3.        As shown in paragraph 4, attachment 7 to annex 14, CEL's operating
staff members about 1,000 and is expected to increase to about 1,100 by the
end of the project period. Expected increases in personnel in the rural zones,
the control center and central office will be partially offset by staff de-
creases at thermal generating facilities.

COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
Financial History and Projections
Summary
1.        Except for 1975, when unexpected dependence on thermal generation
reduced its rate of return to 4.1%, CEL's financial performance since 1959
has been strong (paragraphs 3-4). To compensate for previous underinvestment
and pay for unexpected construction cost increases, the utility undertook
substantial borrowing from both development-agency and commercial sources
in 1973-75, thereby weakening its previously strong financial position and
increasing its debt-service requirements during the project period (paragraph
5). With a tariff increase put into effect in late 1975, the utility is
expected to resume its strong performance throughout the project period,
generating sufficient cash to pay for 37% of its investment program while
meeting high debt-service requirements (paragraphs 7-8).
2.        Attached to the annex are the following financial statements and
forecasts for 1 973-81:
attachment 1 - key financial ratios
attachment 2  -  income statements
attachment 3 -  forecast sources and applications of funds 1976-81
attachment 4  -  estimated debt service 1976-81
attachment 5 - long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1974
attachment 6  - balance sheets
attachment 7  -  assumptions used in financial projections.
Earnings history and financial position
3.        CEL's financial performance has been exemplary. From 1960 through
1973, its annual rate of return on an original-cost rate base exceeded the
5% stipulated in IBRD/IDA loan/project agreements without any tariff adjust-
ments. To offset the increase in fuel prices, its overall tariff levels were
increased by 60% in mid-1974 from about 0 0.04 (USso.o16)/kWh to # 0.064
(US$0.026)/kWh; its 1974 operating income was 9.7% of its original-cost
rate base.
4.        Extremely adverse hydrological conditions in early 1975 and restric-
tions on geothermal generation caused CEL to rely on conventional thermal
generation more than it had expected. As a result of this unanticipated



Annex 1 4
Page 2 of 3 pages
increase in fuel expense, its rate of return for 1975 is estimated to have
declined to 4.1% on an original-cost basis (3.7% on revalued assets). To
restore its earnings levels and provide a sufficient cash contribution to its
investment program, the utility requested a further tariff increase in
August 1975; the requested increase of ¢ 0.02 (US$0.008)/kWh was put into
effect in December.
5.        Reflecting its satisfactory operatingperformance, CEL's financial
position was extremely strong through 1974. Its debt/equity ratio seldom
exceeded 50/50 and in the early 1970s (reflecting its inability - because
of then-prevailing political opposition - to begin construction on what is
now known as the Cerron Grande Hydro development, which would have required
substantial borrowing) declined to less than 25/75. Beginning in 1973,
largely to compensate for previous underinvestment in generating facilities,
the utility undertook substantial borrowing from suppliers as well as inter-
national lending agencies for the Cerron Grande development, the first two
Ahuachapan units and a 25 MS gas turbine. To finance unforeseen cost
escalation of its major projects (resulting from both world-wide price
inflation and the Ahuachapan channel delays - see paragraph 1.02 of the
text), CEL had to issue bonds locally (US$8 million equivalent in 1973), to
borrow US$30 million from foreign private sources in 1975 and US$10.3 million
from the Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV) in 1976. The result of all this
borrowing is a relatively high debt/equity ratio at year-end 1975 and high
debt-service requirements through 1980.
Revaluation
6.        CEL's accounts are maintained on an original-cost basis.  Realizing
the limitations of this arrangement, CEL engaged an individual Chilean
consultant to malre recommend bions concerning revaluations; his report is
expected in September 1976. To reflect the impact of inflation this report
has assumed a 25% revaluation at year-end 1975 applicable to plant-in-
service and related depreciation and subsequent annual revaluations of 10%,
8% and 7% respectively in 1976, 1977-79 and 1980-81 applicable to plant-in-
service, accwuulated depreciation and construction work in progress. The
year-end 1975 adjustment is based on the consultant's preliminary estimates.
The subsequent annual adjustments are those estimated for worldwide inflation
in project cost estimates (see paragraph 3.07 of the text).
Projected financial performance
7.        The tariff-level increase put into effect in December 1975 is
expected to provide CEL with earnings sufficiently high to pa for a
reasonable portion (37%) of its 1976-80 construction program, maintain
adequate debt-service converage (between 1.7 and 2.0 times) and decrease
the debt/equity ratio from 55/45 to 40/60 by 1980.  CEL's working capital
position is expected to remain negative or marginal through 1979 primarily
because of the large amounts of long-term debt currently payable, which
results from CEL's medium-term borrowing in 1975. The utility's projected
build-up of cash (from about ¢ 2 (US$0.8) million at the beginning of the



Annex 14
Page 3 of 3 pages
project period to about $ 14 (US$5.7) million at the end is desirable to
provide for day-to-day cash needs and unforeseen contingencies and possible
changes in its construction program (see paragraph 9).
8.        CEL s rate of return on an original-cost rate base would vary
between 12.6% and 16.2% during the project period; on a revalued rate base,
it would decline from about 1 2  in 1976 to 8-5% in 1978-80.  These rates
would be above the rate-of-return requirement of 8% on a revalued rate base
set forth in the loan agreement.
9.        CELts investment program after the proposed project is subject to
revision as the feasibility studies of its next projects have not been
completed.  Even if such revision confirms CEL's present plans to proceed
with San Lorenzo as the next project, the related disbursement estimates are
extremely uncertain now. Consequently, forecasts of CEL's cash generation
(which result in an apparently excessive cash accumulation of ¢ 45 (US$18)
million by year-end 1981 despite a low (less than 7%) rate of return that
year) would require further analysis after the investment program has been
confirmed.

COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
Assumptions Used in Financial Projections
Income statement
1.        CEL's generating plan for 1976-81 is based on an assumed annua'
growth in energy sales (paragraph 4L2 of the text) of about 10.5% beginning
1977, after lower growth rates - about 8% p.a. - in 1975-76, reflecting the
effects of the worldwide economic slowdown. The plan is as follows, in GWAh:
1976    1977    1978    1979    1980    1981
Sales                            958   1,056   1,18g   1,304   1,4   1 4#

Hydro production in 1976-77 will be limited as the Cerron Grande reservoir
is filled. Based on costs per gallon of 0.715 (US$.286) for Bunker C at
Acajutla and 1.012 (US$.405) for light diesel oil at Soyapango - reflecting
a 10% price increase expected at the beginning of 1976 - and fuel consumption
rates of 12.3 kWh/gal at Acajutla and 8 5 kIh/gal at Soyapango - reflecting
CEL's experience - the fuel costs are estimated (in 0 millions):
Acajutla       Soyapango         Total
1976                                18.3             6.9           25.2

4.        Other operating expenses are principally (about 70%) labor.  They
are expected to increase at 10-12% p.a. plus increments related to hiring' of
operating personnel for new generating facilities.

In addition, CEL borrowed principally to pay for cost overrims of the sixth
project:
(1) % 75 (US$30) million in 1975 arranged by the HBS Investment Corpora-
tion of Panama and hence called by HBS credit. Terms of the credit are 6-1/2
years total including two years' grace, interest at 1-3/4 points above LIBOR; and
(ii)  % 25.8 (US$10.3) million in 1976 from the Venezuelan Investment Fund
(FIV). Terms of this loan were 21 years total including one year of grace,
interest 8%.
6.        The contribution represents the difference between CEL's debt service
to the government an IDA credit 227-ES and the government's debt service to
IDA,, which is to be used for rural electrification.
7.        Based on the interest outlays from the related loans (¢ x 106) IDC
has been estimated as follows:

8.        Increases in working capital other than cash represent increments
in accounts receivable (estimated at the equivalent of two months' billings)
and in materials and supplies (estimated at 80% of operating and maintenance
expense) at each year-end. Both estimates reflect CELts experience. Cash
changes are a resultant figure. Other current and deferred items are not
assumed to change during the forecast period.

12.       IDB made its 095.3 (US$38.1) million Cerron Grande loan from its
Fund for Special Operations to the government for 40 years including ten of
grace with interest at 1% and 2% p.a. respectively during the grace and
amortization periods. The government is onlending the funds to CEL by means
of a 25-year loan including five of grace with interest at 1% and 5'2% p.a.
respectively during the grace and amortization periods. In 1975 the govern-
ment at GEL's request because of its cash-flow difficulties, petitioned IDB
to approve an extension of the grace period provided CEL to ten years, with
interest of 1% p.a. throughout the extended grace period. The forecasts
assume IDB's approval of the Salvadorian request; otherwise, CEL's debt-
service requirements will increase by about ¢7.0 (US$2.8) million annually
beginning April 1978, which would require additional borrowing by CEL during
the project period.
