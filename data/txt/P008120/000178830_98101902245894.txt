INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY FOR A
FIFTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
loan to the Republica Oriental del Uruguay for the equivalent of US$17 mil-
lion to help finance the Fifth Livestock Development Project. The loan would
have a term of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8.5%
per annum. The proceeds of the proposed loan would be made available to the
Central Bank's Livestock Fund on the same terms and conditions; the Live-
stock Fund would on-lend the proceeds to the state-owned Bank of the Republic
which would make subloans for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years, including
one to five years of grace, depending upon the repayment capacity of the
sub-borrower. The principal of each subloan would be subject to monetary
adjustment and the interest rate would range from 3% to 8%, depending upon
farm size.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Uruguay in December 1974 and again in
March 1975. The resulting economic report (498-UR) was distributed on
September 17, 1975. A summary of Country Basic Data is attached as Annex I.
3.        The dramatic changes in the world economy which began in late 1973
had a staggering impact on the Uruguayan economy. The threefold increase in
the price of imported oil (upon which the country is totally dependent),
followed by substantial increases in other import prices and culminating in
the closure of the EEC to meat imports, brought the country to the brink of
economic disaster. The terms of trade loss produced by these developments
was equivalent to 2.2% of Gross Domestic Income and resulted in a sharp turn-
about in the balance of payments--from a current account surplus of US$37 mil-
lion and net reserve gain of US$66 million in 1973 when beef and wool prices
were at historic highs, to a current account deficit of US$105 million
(equivalent to about 23% of exports) and net reserve loss of US$58 million
in 1974 (despite substantial external borrowing).
4.        Faced with this extremely difficult situation, the Government ap-
pointed a new economic team in July 1974. In addition to the weak balance-
of-payments position, the new economic leadership was confronted with a
severe fiscal problem. In an effort to sustain real income levels, budgetary
subsidies for basic imports had been increased while import levies had been
reduced, producing a deficit equivalent to 30% of expenditures. It also



faced skyrocketing inflation, exceeding 100% in 1974, resulting from the fis-
cal deficit and inadequate monetary management, and a wage and price policy
which generated a wage-price spiral by attempting to maintain incomes of pro-
ducers and consumers in the face of declining Gross Domestic Income.
5.        The new economic team has moved ahead to introduce a stabilization
and economic reform program, the cornerstone of which is liberalization of
domestic prices and the foreign trade and payments systems designed to im-
prove resource allocation and productive efficiency, and to promote the ex-
pansion and diversification of exports in order to stimulate output, income
and employment. In line with this, it has already taken action to decontrol
domestic prices, eliminate import quotas and relax other import restrictions,
and continue frequent exchange rate adjustments (minidevaluations). It has
also moved to reduce the disincentives inherent in the tax structure by
shifting its revenue base from export and import taxes to taxes on imputed
agricultural income (IMPROME) and on value-added. In addition, except for
milk, it has eliminated all budgetary subsidies.
6.        A new foreign investment law has been passed which accords foreign
investment approximately the same treatment as domestic investment. Profit
remittance provisions are quite liberal and, in any case, the financial
foreign exchange market has been completely freed from all forms of restric-
tion and intervention, including those on the remittance of profits. Index-
ing of financial instruments is being broadened and maximum loan and deposit
rates of financial institutions have been raised to levels which should sti-
mulate financial savings, contain the demand for credit and allocate real
resources more efficiently. Favorable trade agreements have been negotiated
with Argentina and Brazil that should encourage the export of Uruguayan
manufactures to these countries.
7.        With respect to the stabilization phase of the economic reform
program, the Government concluded a Stand-by Agreement with the IMF, the
actions of which should result in considerably improved price, fiscal and
balance-of-payments performance in 1975. Substantial progress has already
been made in stabilizing the economy as evidenced by reduction in the rate
of inflation. Thus, in the first seven months of 1975 the cost of living
index rose 28.6% compared with 45.1% and 57.3% in the corresponding periods
of 1974 and 1973, respectively.
8.        While, in view of the disappointing performance over the past two
decades, much more in terms of sustained accomplishments will be necessary
to reactivate the economy, the response of the private sector so far has
been quite encouraging. As a result of the Government's export oriented
policies, in the first half of 1975 non-traditional exports rose by about
one-fourth to US$127 million over the corresponding period of 1974. The
increased export activity has led to a revival of crop and industrial pro-
duction, the latter showing the most significant increase in fifteen years.
This and the country's resource base augur well for Uruguay's medium- and
long-term prospects. For an export-led growth strategy Uruguay has certain
advantages -- a highly skilled and well-educated labor force, a strateaic
location between the large and expanding markets of Southern Brazil and



3-
Buenos Aires, an adequate transport infrastructure to both markets, ease of
long distance ocean transport for both imports and exports through the port
city of Montevideo and a distinct natural resource advantage in the inten-
sive and extensive exploitation of export-oriented agricultural production,
especially beef and wool. In addition, there is largely untapped export
potential in crop agriculture, food and fruit processing, fisheries and
manufactures. The Government is aware of this potential and is determined
to exploit it.
9.        The successful implementation of the Government's stabilization
and economic reform program will, however, not be easy. The program will
have to be carried out within the context of a generally depressed world
economy, exacerbated in Uruguay's case, by adverse near-term price and mar-
keting prospects for its principal exports (beef and wool). Nevertheless,
with substantial external financial assistance, it should be possible to
implement the program successfully.
10.       With a recovery of Uruguay's*principal exports and an expansion of
nontraditional exports, GDP growth could be gradually accelerated to 4%
per year by 1980. This would be a marked improvement over the 1.4% growth
rate of the preceding five years, and would contribute to substantially in-
creased employment. This growth pattern would require domestic savings to
increase from their depressed level of about 8% of GDP in 1974 to about 12%
in 1980. The implied marginal savings effort would partly result from an
improvement in Uruguay's terms of trade expected later in the decade.
11.       Assuming the reopening of the EEC market and an upswing in the
prices of beef and wool, exports may increase more rapidly than imports in
the latter part of the period 1975-80. By 1980, exports and imports would
be approximately in balance and, as a result, the current account deficit
would be relatively small. Thus, despite heavy near-term borrowing require-
ments, Uruguay should be able to maintain its international creditworthiness.
12.       As of December 31, 1974, Uruguay's outstanding and disbursed ex-
ternal public debt repayable in foreign currency was estimated to be US$559
million. The Bank share in the debt was 13%. External debt is expected to
increase substantially (by about 12%) in 1975 due to continued poor prospects
for beef exports and increased import requirements associated with industrial
re-equipment and the Government's foreign trade liberation program. There-
after, in line with the expected improvements in export performance and the
ongoing efforts of the Government to improve the country's external debt
structure, external public debt should grow at a more moderate rate (about
9% annually). The debt service ratio was 30% in 1973, 29% in 1974, and is
expected to climb to 41% in 1975. The IBRD share in debt service was 7.7%
in 1973, 7.8% in 1974 and it Is expected to decline to 4.7% in 1975. The
high debt service ratio in 1975 is largely a reflection of a poor term
structure rather than an absolute size of the debt; Uruguay has sufficient
foreign exchange reserves (equivalent to about twelve-months imports) and
should have no difficulties in meeting its external debt obligations during
1975.  Debt service should decline to about 23% and 16% of exports of goods



- 4 -
and nonfactor services by 1976 and 1980, respectively, if required medium-
and long-term external credits can be mobilized to improve the country's
debt structure. Tn this context, Uruguay has already contracted new external
long-term loans with IDB, AID), the Government of South Africa, and a IJS$130
million seven-year Eurodollar loan was recently obtained from a group of US,
Canadian and European private banks.
PART II - THE BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN URUG7UAY
13.       Uruguay has received US$155.2 million (net of cancellations) in Bank
loans.  As of August 31, 1975, the Bank held US$73.9 million, including US$4.0
million undisbursed. On a sectoral basis, Bank assistance to Uruguay (11
loans in total) has been 53% for power, 35% for livestock and 12% for trans-
port. Execution of Bank financed projects has, on the whole, been satisfac-
tory. So far, IFC has not made any investments in Uruguay. Annex II con-
tains a summary of Bank loans as of AuWust 31, 1975, and notes on the execu-
tion of ongoing projects.
14.       The last loan to Uruguay, for the Fourth Livestock Development Proj-
ect (Loan 940-UR), was approved in FY-74. The FY-76 program includes the
proposed livestock project under consideration today, and a proposed loan
to rehabilitate and expand the capacity of non-traditional industrial export-
ing enterprises. In addition, work is underway on power and agricultural
diversification projects for possible consideration bv the Fxecutive Directors
during the next two years.
15.       In lending to Uruguay, the Bank tries to assist the Government in
achieving four major objectives which are interdependent and complementary.
One objective is to bring about a recoverv of the economy by supporting pro-
grams leading to increased output, income and employment. A second objec-
tive is to help Uruguay increase and diversifv its export earnings. A third
objective is to encourage institutional improvements in the management of the
economy, particularly in the formulation and implementation of sectoral
policies. A fourth objective is to transfer sufficient external resources
to complement Uruguay's domestic savings and provide the necessary funds for
maintaining an adequate level of investment in a framework of sound domestic
finances and a viable balance of payments.
16.       While the last objective primarily influences the size of the Bank
program in lUruguay, the other three jointly determine its structure. The Fifth
Livestock D)evelopment Project is designed to help expand livestock production
and exports, and to assist the Government in its efforts to increase crop pro-
duction by releasing fertile land now under pastures by more intensive exploi-
tion of them. Bank lending for industry and agriculture is aimed at increasing
and diversifying exports to assist Uruguay in reducing its dependence on beef
and wool for foreign exchange earnings. Lastly, Bank assistance for power is
designed to help the country meet its growing power demand, while helping to
increase the reliance on local energy sources.



-5-
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
17.       The contribution of agriculture to national output and employment is
relatively modest but its importance in the country's foreign exchange earnings
and in the supply of raw materials for the domestic industry is very signi-
ficant. In 1974, the sector contributed 15.7% of GDP and employed 18% of the
labor force; however, it provided 86% of the value of all exports (72% live-
stock products and 14% crops) and a considerable portion of the raw materials
required by the domestic industry, in this way contributing indirectly an
additional 15% of GDP. Also, agriculture provided about one-fifth of
Central Government revenue.
18.       Although practically all of Uruguay's land is classified as suitable
for farming and ranching, most of it is under pasture. The proportion of land
under crops was only 10% in 1956 and dropped to 8% in 1961, where it has
remained since. lJruguay, however, has potential for more than doubling its
crop land (from 1.3 million ha to 3.4 million ha), provided fertile land now
under pasture is freed to crops (this would require improving pastures to
accommodate the large livestock herd), and investments are undertaken to help
prevent erosion, conserve soil moisture, and maintain and improve soil fer-
tility.
19.       Farm size distribution, although skewed, does not constitute a
major constraint on growth in farm output nor does it have a major effect on
welfare since almost 90% of the population lives in urban areas. Furthermore,
the long established social welfare system has ensured that rural poverty
has not developed to a serious extent. Uruguay, therefore, differs from
nearly all other developing nations, including manv of the South American
countries, which are basically rural societies. The great majority of the
population is employed in the secondary and tertiary sectors; thus, the
typical problems of maldistribution of income, unemployment and underemploy-
ment have, to a large extent, been transferred to the cities. This does not
mean that these problems do not exist in the rural areas but rather that rural
poverty occurs on a much smaller scale in Uruguay than is common in developing
countries.
20.       Three fundamental problems have limited the development and intensi-
fication of agricultural production. Firstly, for many years the national
development strategy focused on industrial import substitution; secondly,
there was a high degree of urbanization and sometimes shortage of labor in
the rural areas; and thirdly, the Government had an overwhelming concern with
holding down food prices in the urban areas by controlling agricultural prices
at an uneconomically low level. The heavy emphasis on industrial development
led to policies which turned the terms of trade against agriculture and, as
a result, during the 1966-70 period GDP in agriculture decreased at an annual
rate of 1.6%. Since 1970, however, as a result of gradually improving sector
policies, agricultture has been recovering. During 1970-74, agricultural GDP
grew at an annual rate of 3.7%. With the Government's economic reform program,
further increases in agricultural production are anticipated. In the near



-6-
term, however, growth in the sector will be curtailed by the currently
depressed international beef market. The EEC restriction on beef import has
been particularly damaging; this has occurred at a time when the size and
productivity of the beef herd is at a record level and Uruguay has the
potential to more than double the export volume of recent years. Of signifi-
cant importance is also the fact that the country's grazing capacity is not
sufficient for the large beef herd and, consequently, substantial cattle
losses may result. Livestock producers are already encountering serious
financial difficulties. To alleviate this problem, the Government has pro-
vided a moratorium on repayments of loans made to livestock producers and
additional credit to finance the retention of heifers. Also, it is encourag-
ing the improvement of additional pastures, including forage, to help main-
tain herds at the largest possible number and benefit fully from the favor-
able export conditions expected later in the decade.
The Bank's Approach
21.       Although the Bank's approach to agriculture in the past has been
primarily designed to support increased production in the livestock subsector,
it will in the future also p:lace heavy emphasis on expanding crop production.
The main objectives will be: (a) to increase livestock and crop production,
particularly for export, through intensive land use; (b) to encourage the
Government to follow price, credit and foreign exchange policies that closely
reflect market prices; and (c) to assist in strengthening public sector insti-
tutions that play a vital role in the development of agriculture. Within this
framework, the Bank would continue to assist. in financing a program to in-
crease the carrying capacity of Uruguay's grazing lands to help counteract
the negative effects arising from the currently depressed international beef
market and promote the diversification of agricultural production. Consist-
ent with this, the Bank is executing agency for an agricultural diversification
study being financed by UNDP.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project would be the seventh Bank operation for live-
stock development in Uruguay, bringing the total assistance for this purpose
to approximately US$72 million since 1959 when the first loan for US$7 mil-
lion was made. By and large, the execution of projects have been satisfactory.
The last operation, Fourth Livestock Project (Loan 940-UR) for US$13.5 million
was originally desioned to finance part of Uruguay's livestock development
program in 1974. In view of the depressed international beef market, how-
ever, only UJS$8.3 million had been disbtursed by end 1974.  The remaining
portion is expected to be fully committe,i by end 1975.
23.       The achievements brought about by the Bank's assistance for live-
stock development in Uruguay have been considerable. Over 1.2 million ha of
pasture land has been improved. Participating ranchers have increased wean-
ing rates by 7%, reduced the age of first calving by nearly a year, lowered



-7-
the age of marketable steers by at least six months, and raised extraction
rates by 3%. Bank assistance also helped to strengthen PLAN, which success-
fully channeled US$123 million equivalent (US$54.7 million from the Bank and
US$68.3 million from domestic resources) into credits to livestock producers.
Lastly, Bank support for livestock development contributed to improving over-
all sector policies. The most important are the adoption of: (a) flexible
foreign exchange rate policy; (b) lower export taxes on beef and wool facil-
itated by increasing reliance on taxes on imputed agricultural income and
(c) more realistic interest rates for long-term credit..
24.       The proposed project was appraised in May 1974 and subsequently
updated in April 1975. A project appraisal report entitled "Uruguay--Fifth
Livestock Development Project" (No. 769-UR), dated September 19, 1975, is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were
held in Washington from August 19 to August 21, 1975. The main features of
the project and loan are summarized in Annex III.
Project Description
25.       The proposed project would support the Government's Livestock De-
velopment Program during 1976 and 1977 and would consist of: (a) investments
totalling US$23.8 million for pasture and other on-ranch improvements (50.7%
and 22.1% of project cost, respectively); (b) investments of about US$0.8 mil-
lion to help develop contractor machinery services (2.4% of project cost);
(c) US$1.2 million for technical assistance to help improve pasture technology
and management and train local personnel (3.7% of project cost); and (d) a
contingency allowance of US$6.9 million (about 21.1% of project cost). The
proposed project would be implemented nationwide.
Ranch Development
26.       Beef/Sheep Ranches.   The proposed project would finance annually the
development of about 1,700 beef ranches averaging about 700 ha each. The
typical ranch development plan would consist of: (a) investments in pasture
improvements to increase the area under improved pasture from 105 ha to 145 ha
(from 15% to 21% of the total area); (b) investments in fencing, water points
and machinery to improve pasture management; and (c) investments in breeding
stock, especially for areas where intensive crop production has caused a de-
pletion of soil fertility and for settlers sponsored by the National Coloni-
zation Institute. Average investment cost per unit, including physical
contingencies, would be US$6,348 equivalent.
27.       Dairy Farming.   The proposed project would also help finance annually
about 900 dairy ranches, each consisting of an area of about 75 ha. The ob-
jective would be to increase the area under improved pasture for each unit
from an average of about 20 ha to 30 ha (from 27% to 40% of the area). About
58% of the investment would be for pasture improvement. Each ranch development
plan would also include a component for machinery to increase the level of
fodder conservation, a practice that is essential for increasing productivity
in Uruguay's dairy ranches. Some investments would also be made in fencing,



water points, and, to a lesser extent, breeding stock.    Average investment
cost per unit, including physical contingencies, would be US$2,563 equivalent.
Contractor Machinery
28.       The proposed project would help finance loans to individual producers,
cooperatives or machinery contractors to purchase agricultural machinery and
equipment for the carrying out of ranch development plans. The machinery pur-
chased would mainly consist of balers, rakes, seed harvesters and tractors.
Technical Services
29.       The proposed project would support existing technical services.
It would help finance a training program for technicians of PLAN and other
agencies, particularly the training of 20 additional staff that would be
recruited for the project. It would also help finance additional investments
in (a) vehicles; (b) office equipment; and (c) machinery, equipment and mate-
rials for demonstration work and extension.
Project Costs and Financing
30.       Total project cost is estimated at US$32.7 million equivalent, of
which US$17.0 million, or 52%', represents foreign exchange requirements.   The
cost estimate has been based on prices prevailing in Uruguay during the period
February-March 1975, and includes a price contingency of 15% and a physical
contingency of 10%. The price contingency was estimated under the assumption
of a 10.8% inflation rate in 1975, dropping to 8% in 1977. The project would
be financed as follows: (a) the Bank loan of US$17.0 million, or 52% of proj-
ect cost; (b) the contributions of Banco de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay
(BROU) and the Central Bank's Livestock Fund (LF) of US$6.7 million, or 20%
of project cost; and (c) the contributions of subborrowers of US$9.0 million,
or 28% of project cost.
Organization and Execution
31.       Plan Agropecuario (PLAN) would continue to be responsible for
assessing the technical soundness of ranch development plans, and for coordi-
nating and supervising the on-lending. PLAN's technical staff, comprising
about 100 university graduates, is well qualified. To improve further its
capabilities, assurances were obtained from the Government that it will
cause PLAN to employ, for a period of at least five years, a technical
director and a senior agricultural economist, both of whom would be accept-
able to the Bank (Section 3.01 (b) of the Loan Agreement).
32.       The Livestock Fund of the Central Bank (LF), established under the
Third Livestock Project (Loan 698-UR), would continue to be depositary of all
funds under the project. The state-owned Banco de la Republica (BROU), upon
receipt of ranch development plans approved by PLAN, would continue to make



-9-
subloans and collect repayments. BROU would rediscount with LF (Central Bank)
85% of each subloan made and, for its service, would receive a 2% interest
rate spread.
Relending Terms
33.       Subloans would be granted to ranchers for a period of not less than
five years or more than ten years, including up to five years of grace. Within
these limits and on the basis of the repayment capacity of subborrowers, PLAN
will determine the terms for each subloan. The maximum grace period permitted
would be one year longer than in the preceding program. The extension seems
justified to help participating ranchers recover from the negative effects of
the currently depressed international beef market. In the case of machinery
contractors, subloans would be for a period of five to ten years, including
one year of grace. Any subloan that, by itself or when added to earlier
subloans made to the same subborrower, either under the proposed project or
earlier projects, is in excess of US$100,000, would require prior Bank
approval (Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement).
34.       As in the two previous projects, all subloans would be subject to
monetary adjustment. The principal of the subloans would continue to be
adjusted on April 30 of each year by applying an index constructed by adding
to the value of the index at the end of the previous year the lower of the
percentage increase in (a) the average cost-of-living index for the 12 months
ending on October 31 of the immediately preceding year, compared with the
average for the previous 12 months, or (b) the average price of 48.0 kg live-
weight of beef and 3.9 kg of wool during the 12 months ending on October 31
of the immediately preceding year, compared with the average for the previous
12 months. A three-tier system of interest rates would continue to be applied
to the subloans (higher for the large producer and lower for the small produ-
cer). For holdings of up to 250 ha the interest rate would be 3%; for hold-
ings of between 251 and 400 ha the interest rate would be 6%; and for holditgs
above 400 ha and machinery contractors the interest rate would be 8% (Schedule
5 to the Loan Agreement).
35.       In view of the inflationarv conditions still present in Uruguay
and the currently depressed beef prices, the latter can be expected to limit
the extent of monetary adjustment. Thus, in the short run it is unlikely
that the indexing system will result in positive real interest rates. Assum-
ing an average inflation rate of 25% for 1976-77 and 15% thereafter and a
strengthening of beef prices as forcast by the Bank, a zero real rate of
interest would be achieved over the 10-year repayment period of a subloan.
Given the depressed state of the livestock industry, a hardening of the
indexing formula so as to achieve more positive interest rates would appear
inappropriate at the present time, and likely to discourage the necessary
long-term investment. Nevertheless, if the Government succeeds in its
efforts to achieve lower inflation rates than those assumed above, the real
interest rates charged under the project would become positive.



Procurement
36.       Subborrowers would procure investment inputs through normal commer-
cial channels. International competitive bidding following Bank Guidelines
for Procurement would be required in the procurement of vehicles, machinery
and equipment directly imported by PLAN whenever the size of individual con-
tracts exceeds US$100,000. PLAN would be encouraged to bulk together such
items into larger contracts whenever possible. Similar type contracts of
less than US$100,000 would be awarded in accordance with the Borrower's
internal procurement procedures, which include local competitive bidding and
are considered satisfactory.
Disbursements
37.      IWith commitments by Banco de la Republica (BROU) extending over two
years, Bank's disbursements are expected to occur over a two-and-one-half year
period.  The Bank would disburse against 37° of all subloans made by BROU,
which is the estimated foreign exchange cost of the on-lending. Since
liruguay is following a policy of frequient minidevaluations, when dishursement
applications are received (normallv at time intervals of folur to six months),
the exchange rate on which the disbuirsement is based is higher than the one pre-
vailing at the time when BROU made the disbursement. Disbursing on the basis
of the current exchange rate as is the present practice would result in the
Bank financing substantially less than the foreign exchange cost of the project.
To correct this distortion, applications for withdrawal would be calculated on
the basis of the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the mid-point of the
month in which BROU's subloan was made and not at the exchange rate existing
on the day the Bank's disbursement would actually be (Schedule 1 to the Loan
Agreement).
38.       Disbursements under on-lending categories would be made against
certificates of expenditure. The documentation for expenditures under on-
lending categories, however, would not be submitted for Bank review, but would
be retained by BROU and made available for inspection by Bank's project super-
vision missions. Standard documentation would be required for disbursements
under the technical services and training categories. Certification by
BROU ancl the Central Bank would be required under on-lending categories.
Production and Marketing
39.       During the first three years of the project, investments in pasture
improvement are expected to help increase the rate of retention of heifers.
At full development, about six years from the date of the initial investment,
incremental beef production is expected to reach about i5,000 tons per annum.
or the equivalent of 5% of 1974 national production.    At full development,
incremental milk production would be about 13 million liters, equivalent to
2%"v of 1974 national production.
40.       The long-term market: outlook for beef remains favorable despite the
disruptions resulting from the import ban imposed by the EEC and the reduction



- 11 -
of United States import demand due to temporary excess supplies. Bank projec-
tions indicate that world beef supply will fall short of demand within five
years. The production generated under the project, therefore, should be
readily marketable.
41.       As far as beef-processing capacity is concerned, Uruguay's meat-
processing plants are under heavy pressure to diversify their production to
include canned, cooked and special cuts so that they would be able to penetrate
new markets. Although some of the meat processors have carried out some plant
diversification and expansion, it is evident that the investment activities
so far undertaken have fallen short of the country's needs. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that Government would define a plan of action,
including the proposed financing, for the meat-processing industry within six
months of loan effectiveness (Section 4.05 of Loan Agreement).
42.       W4ith respect to milk production, under the existing Fourth Livestock
Project (Loan 940-UR), the Bank is financing a study to explore the possibili-
ties of exporting dairy products. While in the next two years significant ex-
ports to neighboring countries are likely to materialize, the incremental
production resulting from the project would largely be consumed domestically.
Additional Assurances and Undertakings
43.       To improve the project's accounting system, to effectively monitor
the progress of the project, to maintain producers' incentives and to prevent
distortions in the structure of necessary inputs, the following assurances
were obtained from the Government:
(a) The Project Unit within BROU would improve its accounting
system for project accounts, both at the main office and at
branch offices, and assign adequate staff and equipment for
the purpose (Section 4.03 of Loan Agreement).
(b) PLAN would prepare detailed long-term investment plans per
annum for at least 300 subborrowers, of which 100 would be
Ranch Development Loans that include the purchase of live-
stock. The plans would include financial projections and
expected improvements in technical coefficients. PLAN
would also establish a monitoring system for about 50% of
these plans to measure progress in achieving project
objectives (Schedule 5 of Loan Agreement).
(c) The Government would pursue livestock policies in such a
manner that would afford livestock producers a reasonable
opportunity to secure a financial rate of return of 13%
on new investments under normal conditions of production.
Before establishing fertilizer subsidies or raising
export taxes on livestock products above 10% of livestock
exports during any calendar year, it would consult the
Bank (Section 3.05 of Loan Agreement).



Economic Benefits and Justification
44.       The project should promote the Government's objective of increasing
exports. Over the short-run, the project would contribute to enlarging the
country's capacity to retain heifers, while over the long-run, it would
facilitate the expansion of beef exports. The more intensive use of existing
pastures would permit the continuing devotion of fertile land for crop pro-
duction, or even eventually free some land presently under pasture for such
production and, in this way, contribute to increased agricultural production
for export.
45.       The project's overall rate of return to the economy is estimated at
18%. The economic rate of return of the project's beef component is estimated
at 17% and the dairy component at 20%. If world market prices for beef drop by
10% from those projected, the rate of return of the project as a whole would
be 16% and the beef component, 15%. The financial rates of return are 16%
for beef production and 22% for dairy production. These rates are sufficiently
high to make these investments attractive to producers. Nevertheless, a risk
is present in the project in that subloans may not be made as scheduled
because demand for credit may lag as a result of the currently depressed
international beef market. If, as projected, the market recuperates in late
1976, such lag would be of short duration.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republica Oriental del Uruguay
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for the Article III, Sec-
tion 4(III) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approv-
ing the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans for
livestock development projects. A special condition for the effectiveness of
the Loan Agreement is that the Central Bank of Uruguay has entered into a
subsidiary Loan Agreement with Banco de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay on
the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule 6 to the Loan Agreement.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Projects in Execution and Notes on Compiled Projects-/
Loan 712       Power Generation and Distribution, ITS$18.0 million,
November 25, 1970.
1.        Because of delays in procurement and supply difficulties, the
installation of Battle Unit No. 6, which is the main part of the project,
was completed in July 1975 after a delay of about 18 months. UTE has ob-
tained additional financing from the suppliers for the cost overruns. Pro-
gress has been achieved in improving the financial situation of the institu-
tion, particularly through a reorganization of its financial and bill collec-
tion procedures. Other organizational problems are in the process of being
resolved.
Loan 940       Fourth Livestock Project, Second Stage, UTSS13.5 million,
October 25, 1973.
2.        Originally, this project was designed to finance part of Uruguay's
livestock development program for 1974. In view of the depressed interna-
tional beef market, however, by the end of 1974 only UJS$8.3 million had been
disbursed. The remaining portion will be committed by the end of 1975, al-
though some disbursements spill over to early 1976. To permit the Borrower
to utilize the undisbursed balance, the closing date of the Loan was extended
to June 30, 1976.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

FIFTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AN D PROJECT STMVMA1'Y
Borrower:           Republic of IJrtiguay
Beneficiary:         Central Bank's Livestock Fund
Amount:              US$17.0 million equivalent
Terms:               Repayable in 15 years, including 5 years grace, at
8.5% interest per annum.
Relending Terms:     The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk
and re-lend the proceeds of the loan to Bank of the
Republic, which in turn would on-lend to ranchers
and farmers for periods of 5 to 10 years, including
a grace period of up to five years, at an annual
interest rate of 3% for holdings of up to 250 ha,
6% for holdings of 251 ha to 400 ha and 8% for
ranchers and farmers with holdings of over 400 ha
and for machinery contractors. The principal of all
sub-loans will be subject to morietary adjustment
based on the percentage increase in the ranch-gate
price of beef and wool during the 12-month period
ending in October of the immediately preceding year
or the increase in the cost of liviig index during
the same period, whichever is lower.
Project Description:The project would support a lending program over a
two-year commitment period for the development of
beef and dairy production.   Technical services and
related goods will be provided to support the credit
program and to providle local and overseas training
for technicians. The project would help finance a
credit program to increase beef, cattle, dairy and
pig production through loans for fart/ranch develop-
ment; contractor machinery; technical services. and
related goods for continued introduction of new
technology in livestock production, pasture pro-
duction and management, demonstration of related
pasture and forage techniques, improvement of meat
and dairy processing and marketing and hygiene
techniques; and overseas training'for livestock,
meat processing and livestock banking and credit
technicians.
