PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
URUGUAY
LOAN 1166-UR
FIFTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PREFACE
1.        This is the completion report of the Fifth Livestock Development
Project for which Loan 1166-UR was approved on October 7, 1975 for US$17
million. The loan was closed on March 31, 1981, with no cancellations, and
the last disbursement of previously committed funds was made on May 20, 1981.
2.        This report is based on the loan documentation; correspondence and
data included in project files maintained by the Project Unit and the Bank;
results of a survey of sub-borrowers receiving credit in the four calendar
years 1976-1979; and findings of a Bank mission that visited Uruguay in
December 1981. Interviews were held with Bank staff who participated in
appraisal and supervision missions, government personnel who were with the
executing agency at appraisal and at completion, and producers.
3.        The report focuses on the following issues not covered in the
evaluations of preceding projects: institution-building efforts, success of
the small-scale farmer lending activities begun in this project, and project
impact at the farm level. Local staff have been most cooperative in providing
data for this report, but the lack of a continuous monitoring and evaluation
system has restricted its quantity and quality. Thus, only information
considered reliable has been used.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
URUGUAY
LOAN 1166-UR
FIFTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Highlights
The project continued efforts begun in 1961 to develop beef cattle,
dairy, sheep and pork production focusing on the spread of improved pastures
(improved grass-legume seeds in association with phosphatic fertilizer) to
improve herd nutrition and increase productivity. Other complementary ranch
infrastructure, machinery, breeding stock and intensive technical assistance
were provided. A small-scale farmer pilot component became operational under
this project and was successful. Indexing, albeit with an imperfect index,
was applied to all subloans.
The major deviation from appraisal expectations was a four-year
disbursement period instead of a two-year period, the consequence of the
international crisis of 1973 and the beef sector crisis beginning in 1974
(para 1.07).  Otherwise, the project performed overall as appraised in cost
(US$33 million), beneficiaries reached (5,200) and economic profitability
(about 17%). Fewer beef/sheep ranches than expected were financed,
but this was compensated by a larger number of dairy loans, a trend
reflecting the relative stability of the small but growing dairy sector.
Government fulfilled all loan covenants.
The following points may be of special interest:
-  real meat prices received by farmers were some 15 to 20% below
expectations but were partially compensated by higher on-farm
technical coefficients and cost reductions (paras 4.05-5.02);
-  the semi-autonomous technical assistance unit of the project
(PLAN) was administratively affected by the crisis of the
livestock subsector but it managed to increase and diversify
services to project and non-project farmers (para 6.08-6.14 and
6.19-6.21); and
-  pilot activities with small-scale producers showed the
complexity of dealing with these groups in Uruguay and the
need for further actions with this type of producers
(paras 6.22-6.30).

I. INTRODUCTION
A. The Livestock Subsector
The World Beef Market Situation
1.01      World oversupply of beef occurred in the mid-1970s (especially
1974-76), when beef production cycles peaked simultaneously in all the major
producing regions. Likewise, the liquidation phase of the cattle cycle in
the mid-1970s occurred simultaneously in North America, South America and
Oceania. Expansion of EEC beef production in 1975 coincided with heavy
slaughterings in other parts of the world, bringing about surpluses,
increased stocks, restrictive trade policies and a sharp drop in
international prices. With the downturn in world production in 1978/79, beef
prices increased sharply in 1979 and 1980.
1.02      World beef production is projected to increase at a long-term rate
of 1.8% a year --to about 60 million tons by 1990. The developing countries'
share of this world production is projected to increase slightly to about 30%
by 1990, from the 25% prevailing in the mid-1970s.
1.03      Over 90% of world beef is consumed domestically.     The remainder is
traded internationally with neighboring countries or with countries in the
northern hemisphere. Sanitary regulations (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease
regulations) have kept South American fresh, chilled, and frozen (uncooked)
beef from entering the North American and Japanese markets, while bone-in
beef from South America is not permitted in the EEC. Developing country
exporters have responded by diversifying markets to South Africa, Southern
Europe and the Middle East.
1.04      While beef prices vary according to quality and from country to
country, market forces create parallel movements among them, with fairly
well-known leads and lags.     Internationally traded beef prices fluctuate
more widely in the traditional exporting countries than do domestic prices in
importing countries (largely because changes in overall world demand for beef
have a major effect on the prices of the relatively small amount of beef
traded in world markets). The world indicator price fluctuated quite widely
in the 1970s, dropping from an unprecedented high of US214 c/kg in 1973 (all
data are given in 1977 constant US dollars) to 68 c/kg in 1975, reflecting
the overproduction and trade restrictions referred to earlier. The low price
levels continued until 1979 and 1980 when prices almost doubled (to 125 c
and 128 c/kg, respectively). Real prices eased up a bit in 1981 and should
follow a downward trend until 1990, when a recovery is once again forecast
(147 c/kg). Australian prices are expected to increase faster (and their
level to be higher) in the short term than Argentine and Uruguayan prices.
This is likely because all Argentine and Uruguayan fresh, chilled and frozen
(uncooked) beef is barred from the major Northern hemisphere markets. In the
long run, the two price series are projected to run parallel to each other.

Uruguayl/
1.05      The agricultural sector has played a role in Uruguayan economic
development which far transcends its comparatively modest direct contribution
to domestic output and employment. Between 1976 and 1980, nearly one out of
every five workers was employed in primary agricultural activities, which
accounted for roughly one-eighth of total output. Unlike most developing
countries, value added per worker in Uruguayan agriculture (US$7,000 in 1980)
is almost equal to that in industry or in services. Beef alone has
traditionally accounted for two-thirds of the total value of agricultural
production and for one-fourth of the country's total exports. Total GDP
growth has averaged 0.7% between 1971-75 and 5.2% between 1976-80 compared
with agriculture's -0.9% and 1.2%, respectively, in the same periods. Growth
rates of beef output averaged 5.8% in 1970/71, 4.8% in 1972/73, -3.9% in
1974/75, -4.2% in 1976/77, and returned to earlier peaks with 5.9% in
1979/80.
1.06      Uruguay's unusually good conditions for livestock production have
been historically neutralized by instability in sectoral policies, which, in
many cases, have actually accentuated the impact of world instability
referred to above. Official wavering between stimulating cattle production
and beef exports and protecting the interests of consumers and the meat
packing industry led to the need for continual manipulation of exchange
rates, subsidies, pricing policies, tariffs, taxes and production controls in
an often vain attempt to reconcile goals.
1.07      The conditions prevailing in the four project years of Loan 1166-UR
(1976-79) are summarized below. The dominant policy objective from 1974 to
1977 was to assist the financially indebted and Government-owned meat packing
plants within a macro-economic environment that featured a world oil crisis;
a domestic balance of payments crisis and sharp recession; closing by the EEC
of the meat import market; and a sharp decline in world beef prices. The
policy actions taken in this period include removal of export taxes and
import duties on machinery, an increase in land tax, imposition of state
marketing controls to increase meat packing margins, sharp reduction in
fertilizer subsidies, and minidevaluation of exchange rates. As a net
result, the producer sector entered a crisis, declines occurred in producer
investment and in the demand for technical assistance, and meat packing
industry's losses decreased. In August 1978, the Government began to
announce a series of major reforms in its agricultural policies, mainly
affecting the livestock subsector. The dominant policy objectives from 1978
to 1981 were to increase the role of market forces in the livestock sector,
increase exports, stabilize consumer prices, and keep assisting the meat
packing plants. Overall environment can be described as featuring a sharp
rise in world beef prices through 1980, a strong domestic economic recovery,
and high and fluctuating inflation rates. The policy actions taken were

sector included in Economic Memorandum of Uruguay, Report 3252-UR,
March 1982.

many, such as: (a) ending formal beef marketing and price and production
controls; (b) imposing spot bans on exports and internal marketing; (c)
increasing official beef stocks and supply intervention; (d) slowing down
preannounced devaluations; (e) reducing land taxes; (f) reducing fertilizer
subsidies and other tariffs in inputs; (g) financially bailing out producers;
(h) giving tax rebates on beef exports; and (i) awarding conditional
authorization for live cattle exports. This variety of measures, often
changing within months to correct earlier contradictory measures, resulted in
the following: real producer prices rose sharply and then declined; the
financial indebtedness of producers grew; beef exports declined sharply, then
increased; meat packing margins deteriorated, then improved; and the
budgetary cost of short-term relief measures grew (see Chart 1).
1.08      At present, the producer sector is reluctant to undertake major
long-term investments because of past governmental policies in what basically
is a sector that needs a long response time, requiring stable policies.
Producers also felt that resources would continue to be withdrawn from
livestock and invested in other sectors.
1.09      A second and basic factor affecting Uruguay's profitability in the
livestock sector is the meat processing and exporting subsector. Adding to
the organizational complexity of the subsector internationally and to the
perishable nature of the product, there is the historical passivity of export
promotion in Uruguay. The new markets opening up will demand a continuous
flow of high-quality meat, a requirement that, in general, is not met by
Uruguay's industry. Although recent efforts have been made in Uruguay to
consult and exchange information with other meat exporting countries, the
development of specialty cuts, deboned meat and meat derivatives is only in
the beginning stage. Beginning in September 1981, the National Meat
Institute, with participation of the producer sector, has negotiated
important exports to the Middle East.
B. Previous Bank-Financed Livestock Projects2/
1.10      Previous to Loan 1166-UR, the Bank made six loans to Uruguay's
agricultural sector amounting to US$58.2 million to help finance four
livestock development projects in support of the National Livestock
Development Program launched by the Government in July 1957. The main
objective of those projects was to increase beef production and exports
through: (a) introduction of technological improvements in livestock
production; (b) institution building; and (c) improvement of sector and
economic policies.
1.11      Loan 245-UR for US$7 million was signed in 1959 to finance the
First Livestock Development Project, implemented between 1961 and 1965.
Proceeds were used essentially to demonstrate methods of pasture improvement
on a large sample of farms. Loan 407-UR for US$12.7 million was made in 1965
to finance the Second Livestock Development Project, benefiting a large
number of commercial farms. The implementation of the first and second
projects was behind schedule.
2/   The published reports and audits on earlier projects are listed in
Annex 1.



-4-
1.12      The Third Livestock Development Project, started in 1971, was
financed by Loan 698-UR (US$6.3 million) and a supplementary loan, 773-UR,
for US$4.0 million. It supported the continuation of the livestock program
for one year while the Government resolved certain sector policy issues,
especially in the meat packing industry, and restored ranchers'confidence
sufficiently to encourage them to invest. The project (consisting of two
loans) provided for the financing of ranch improvements aimed at increasing
the carrying capacity of farms and the production of beef and wool; technical
and consultant services; equipment and technical services; and the machinery
necessary to grow, harvest, and process quality legume and grass seed. It
also provided funds to help the Government improve meat inspection hygiene
and processing services to raise the quality of exports.
1.13       The Fourth Project, started in 1972, was financed in two stages:
Loan 816-UR (US$11.2 million), which financed operation in 1972 but actually
covered operations for both 1972 and 1973, and Loan 940-UR (US$13.5 million),
which was intended to finance 1974 operations but in fact financed 1974 and
1975 activities. The main reasons why this project covered a longer period
than anticipated were, first, repeated devaluations of the peso following
appraisal, which reduced dollar disbursements, and, second, delays by the
Central Bank in claiming reimbursements from the Bank, thereby further
reducing dollar disbursements due to changes in exchange rates between the
time subloans were granted and the time disbursements were actually made.
1.14       The second stage was essentially completed when the Fifth Project
was signed in November 1975. The Fifth Livestock Development Project was
financed through Loan 1166-UR (US$17 million) and covered operations for the
originally intended two years (1976 and 1977), plus two more (1978 and 1979).
II. FORMULATION OF THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
2.01       The Fifth Livestock Development Project was designed to continue
assistance to Uruguay's national livestock development program by providing
medium- and long-term credit to beef cattle and sheep ranchers, dairy
farmers, pork producers and machinery contractors. As in earlier projects,
the beneficiaries of colonization schemes sponsored by the National Institute
of Settlement (INC) were eligible to participate with the approval of the
Institute. The project included the financing of technical services,
training and demonstrations.
2.02       The project's objectives were to expand beef and milk production
so as to enable Uruguay to increase meat exports, to substitute domestically
produced dairy products for imports, and help the Government to improve
sector policies. The strategy used for meeting project objectives was to:
(a) step up pasture production through use of phosphatic fertilizer and
better seeds; (b) improve ranch and farm management by constructing fences,
water points, and cattle handling facilities; and (c) initiate product
diversification on small-scale farm holdings.



-5-
2.03       As in previous projects, funds were to be channeled through a
Livestock Fund (FG) in the Central Bank to the Bank of Republic (BROU) for
making on-farm development loans based on farm plans and technical
evaluations made by the Honorary Commission of the Livestock Plan (PLAN), the
institution which was also to provide the technical services.
B. Pre-appraisal
2.04        As the second stage of the Fourth Project (Loan 816-UR) had been
approved on October 23, 1973 and disbursement of that US$13.5 million loan
was expected to be completed by end of 1974, a mission visited Uruguay from
January 10 to 26, 1974 to pre-appraise the fifth loan.      The quick follow-up
was to avoid disrupting livestock lending to Uruguay since the extremely
critical political situation in the country and the Bank's own reorganization
effects caused operations with Uruguay to be slow and often delayed.
2.05        Only two main issues were identified at the pre-appraisal stage:
(a) slow disbursements due to indexation of farm loans; and (b) the need to
include small-scale farmer lending in the program. The pre-appraisal mission
studied the small farmer crop subsector and concluded that lending to that
sector posed many problems not solvable through livestock lending. Instead,
the mission identified a possible small-scale farmer lending operation within
the livestock sector in the form of lending for dairy (a relatively
small-scale farmer activity in Uruguay) and lending to colonization settlers.
C. Appraisal
2.06       An appraisal mission visited Uruguay between April 28 and May 20,
1974. The goals of the loan were similar to those of previous projects but a
credit component to machinery contractors was introduced; lending to farmers
in two-year tranches according to farm plans was suggested; and the mission
insisted on liberalizing duties and eliminating rebates affecting meat and
its inputs.    Due to hyper-inflation in Uruguay and the depressed meat sector
worldwide (the Common Market was closed to meat imports in September 1974),
disbursements of the fourth loan in dollar terms slowed down significantly.
2.07        The two main questions at this stage were: (a) whether the Fifth
Project should cover a one-year or a two-year lending program, and (b)
whether funds for financing fertilizer imports should be paid directly to
importers or by disbursements through the farmer lending mechanism. In
retrospect, the Bank made good decisions. First, on institutional and
farm-level grounds, a two-year loan rationalized subloan preparation at
PLAN's level and standardized on-lending terms facing the farmer. With the
passage of time, prospective livestock borrowers became familiar with
Bank-related lending (its terms, supervision, bookkeeping and the like),
distinguished between it and normal credit lines offered by BROU, and felt
comfortable with Bank procedures. Second, the decision to finance fertilizer
through on-lending served to eliminate stockpiling and waste and liberated
PLAN from its unwanted role as manager of physical inputs.

D. Post-appraisal
2.08       When the economic situation improved in Uruguay and
internationally at the beginning of 1975, and it was observed that on-farm
credit commitments were expected to be completed by end-1975, a
post-appraisal mission visited Uruguay in April 1975 to update project
calculations. Uruguay's economic policy had moved towards liberalization
with removal of fertilizer subsidies, sharply reduced beef export taxes, and
adoption of a flexible exchange rate.
2.09       Two issues were raised at this stage, as well as during
negotiations. The first one involved the exchange rate to be used in
calculating Bank disbursements. To ameliorate effects of the slowdown in
Bank disbursements and the loss of foreign exchange to Uruguay, Government
requested that Bank disbursements be calculated at the average monthly
exchange rate prevailing when BROU disbursed the subloans, instead of at the
exchange rate prevailing when the reimbursement claim was processed in
Washington. This formula was accepted reluctantly by the Bank, but the
arrangement became more common in later years in countries experiencing
frequent devaluations. It worked very smoothly in Uruguay by reducing
exchange rate uncertainties between farm plan preparation and Bank
disbursements. The second issue concerned subsidies to fertilizer imports.
In this matter, the Bank maintained a strong posture and obtained an
agreement that such subsidies were not to be reintroduced by Government
unless prior approval was obtained from the Bank. This policy measure was
adhered to during the duration of the project.
2.10       The sectoral theme then guiding the Bank's approach to
agricultural lending under the project can be summarized as follows: (a)
increase livestock and crop production through intensive land use; (b) give
institutional support to the extension service system serving the livestock
sector; and (c) encourage the Government to follow price, credit and foreign
exchange policies that closely reflect market prices. The Bank acknowledged
the depressed state of the sector and supported the loan with the goal of
promoting change through economic dialogue.
E. Questions by the Board
2.11       The queries raised by the Board before and during loan
presentation have been grouped in the following main headings.
Technical Director and Senior Economist Appointments.
2.12       The Technical Director and Senior Economist for the project were
to be internationally-recruited with very detailed terms of reference. The
Board requested justification for the requirement that the posts be filled by
expatriates in light of PLAN's existence since 1959, but it was pointed out
that the Government had requested the clause to ensure appointment of well
qualified staff to those two important positions. The posts have remained
key in PLAN's operations (see para 6.17).



-7-
Large vs. Small-scale Farmers
2.13       The Board's concerns dealt with the large size of farm area held
by prospective sub-borrowers and the small amount of loan funds going to
small-scale farmers. Uruguay is a unique case in that about 80% of commodity
exports are livestock based and most land can only be grazed; therefore,
export policy often overrides equity considerations. Income inequalities
arising from ownership of agricultural land exist but are not as pronounced
as in most other economies. Given human and financial constraints affecting
agriculture's public sector and the project's experience in designing
technological packages for small-scale farmers, the above emphasis on
productive aspects can be understood. During the project's life (1976-79),
PLAN worked successfully with small-scale farmers and the image of PLAN staff
improved in this respect. A follow-up project (Loan 1831-UR) deals with
small-scale farmers more thoroughly.
Meat Processing and Diversification of Bank Lending.
2.14       The Board queried the lack of diversification of past agricultural
lending to Uruguay. As with the case of the large- vs. small-scale farmer
considerations, export policy demanded priority for livestock development.
Lending to the meat packing sector was about to be undertaken by the
Inter-American Development Bank, while the Bank was considering a loan for
small labor-intensive industries. No precise judgment can be made, but, in
retrospect, the situation was such that the Bank could not follow up with a
diversified agricultural project as planned two years later due to policy
changes in Uruguay, changes which occurred after the project had been
appraised and negotiated. The IDB loan to the meat packing sector was
partially successful but not followed up by similar lending, and the then
partially nationalized meat .packing industry floundered and all Government
plants were offered for sale in 1978.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01       The major deviation in Loan 1166-UR from appraisal expectations is
a four-year disbursement period instead of a two-year period. There were no
significant changes'in its operation and arrangements, which simply followed
earlier practices. Salient execution parameters are discussed below.
A. Effectiveness and Start-up
3.02       The loan was signed on October 15, 1975, and the project became
effective on February 13, 1976, four days earlier than envisaged. The only
condition of effectiveness was that the Government enter into a subsidiary
loan agreement with BROU (Section 3.03(d) of L.A.). A major change therein
was that credit disbursements repayable by the Bank to Government would be
computed at the exchange rate prevailing when BROU made its subloan
disbursement (Schedule 1, para 8 of the Loan Agreement and para 2.09).
3.03       At the beginning of the 1976 credit campaign, PLAN departed from
earlier practices by preparing a farm plan analysis based on longer term
horizons (investments of up to three-year tranches and disbursements of up to
four years, as needed in each individual analysis). Also, the traditional



May 30 closing date for a credit campaign was removed, permitting farmers to
begin operations any time during the year. These measures proved to be
welcome to all parties because: (a) the longer term plan removed uncertainty
with regard to the direction of a farmer's operation; (b) lending
calculations were simplified in later stages while providing benchmarks for
updating farm plans; and (c) friction between the staff of PLAN and staff of
BROU declined as more data for decision-making were put in writing. It is
not too surprising that such measures were not put in place earlier
considering that, beginning with the Fifth Project, lending changed in
character. In fact, during the appraisal process, there was an implied
change in attitude by the Bank toward more project lending and less toward
annual program-type operations.
B. Extensions and Reallocations
3.04        The two-year project was intended to close on June 30, 1978, but
in June 1978, Government requested an extension of almost two years.
Disbursements at that point were only 44% of appraisal estimates. The Bank
approved a one-year extension instead of two, with the hope that policy
changes could be best encouraged by keeping extension periods short.      It is
difficult to say what impact this attitude had vis-a-vis the sectoral
situation then prevailing, but, in August 1978, a new set of policy measures
was announced which liberalized the sector a great deal.
3.05        By mid-1979 (when only 60% of funds were disbursed but almost all
were completely committed), a second extension was approved (to September
1980), with a reallocation of the unallocated category, mostly to the on-farm
credit component after projections were carried out to ascertain disbursement
demands in all categories.
3.06        By September 1980, the credit component was almost fully disbursed
and a third extension was approved (to March 1981), with final adjustments in
categories to allow for purchase of vehicles and provision of some delayed
training (see table below). The reallocations did not affect project
performance and were carried out routinely.

17,000           17,000
C. Covenants
3.07       Project implementation was fairly smooth and no covenant became a
project issue. The comments presented below are an evaluation of certain
covenants for future projects in light of the experience.
3.08       According to Section 3.05(b), PLAN was to have employed a
Technical Director and a Senior Agricultural Economist for at least five
years from the effectiveness date. As the loan was intended to be a two-year
project, such a requirement meant that qualified technical expertise was
called for beyond the actual project period to ensure the follow-up
technicial supervision. At about the middle of extended project life,
however, both posts become vacant, and the Bank approved appointment of a
qualified PLAN technician as Technical Director. In hindsight, this approval
was timely, considering the problems being encountered by the sector and
PLAN, but the Bank did not formally agree to a similar handling of the Senior
Agricultural Economist vacancy. Project documentation does not provide much
information on what actions were taken by the Bank, while the post was only
sporadically filled.   In any case, the monitoring and evaluation activities
were not fully performned between 1978 and 1980, and this could have been
prevented by an internationally recruited economist (para 6.17).
3.09       By Section 3.05 (a), Government agreed to ensure "at least a 13%
financial rate of return on subloans for productive livestock investment."
Although the clause has meaning in controlled sectors or industries such as
public utilities where a long-term rate can be assured by accounting
methodologies, tariff increases, and the like, it has less meaning in a
"free" sector, where no one controls or can be asked to control all economic
variables (prices, outputs, costs, and such), and even less meaning in a

two-year loan. The merit may be in the signal such statement sends to
policymakers; however, similar ends could have been achieved without being so
specific. No numerical result (high or low) can be guaranteed, even if all
economic decision units acted in accord.
3.10        Under the Fifth Project, Government guaranteed BROU's income
losses against sub-borrower defaults and it is still not known whether this
should or should not have been continued. The results show that defaults are
very low under the PLAN-sponsored credit system, indicating little need for a
guarantee, but it is also true that, without the guarantee, BROU is reluctant
to take in any but the safest customers, a problem that is plaguing the
follow-up project, and small-scale farmers are the first to suffer.
Government also carried the foreign exchange risk under the project.
D. Consultants' Performance
3.11        Government and the Bank agree that the Technical Director and
Senior Agricultural Economist appointed under the project performed
satisfactorily. Both adapted well and quickly to PLAN's activities and both
were, during their terms in office, officially and privately sought out for
advice. They made particular efforts to impart formal and informal
training. The economist remained in Uruguay after the project assignment and
held a variety of consulting and international jobs.
E. Project Cost and Financing
3.12   Planned and actual project investment and its financing were as
follows:
Sub-borrowers       Govt.      Bank        Total
Amount  %      Amount  %  Amount %   Amount    %

A=Actual, P=Planned
3.13        Total project costs were 7% below (or US$2.2 million) the original
estimate, mainly because of the lack of disbursements in the machinery
contractors' category. Of the eight machinery loans prepared, only three
were actually disbursed and were classified as normal ranch development plans
because the loans were primarily for on-farm development, with the spare



machinery capacity to be occasionally rented.     The rest of the categories
were very close to appraisal estimates, mainly because of the historically
good data base available in PLAN, which is used in preparing projects. The
average investment per subloan through the first three project years was
comparable to the original estimates, except in the last project year (1979),
reflecting the investment upsurge following the liberalizing measures used in
August 1978 (Annex 2, Table 1, and para 1.07).
3.14      The volumes in financing sources were also comparable to original
estimates. The sub-borrowers and the Bank exceeded original estimates by
three percentage points, while BROU fell short by six points. Farmer
contributions were 32%, exceeding by far the loan requirements of at least
20%, and slightly surpassing earlier projects' actual results of 30%. The
increases in sub-borrower's self-financing are attributable to the farmers'
desires to limit borrowing as much as possible (except in the last project
year), because of the relatively high adjustment indices expected, leading to
increased debt burden.
F. Physical Progress
3.15      Physical progress of the project was slower than anticipated and
with differences in lending amounts, as indicated below:

The main reason for this slowdown was the crisis affecting the sector that
hit the international beef markets in 1974. The project financed 5,222 new
subloans in four years compared with 5,225 estimated at appraisal over two
years. The shortfall in beef/sheep ranches was compensated by about an equal
increase in the number of dairy loans, a trend reflecting the relative
stability of the small but growing dairy sector. In addition to the farmers
served by PLAN through the credit scheme, about 1,300 farmers annually, on
the average, received technical assistance in the same detailed farm plans
without receiving farm credit. In addition, about 125 INC settlers annually
received the same technical assistance.
3.16       The composition of on-farm investments (by value) during the
project execution period, compared to the estimates at appraisal, are as
follows:

* = Unquantified at appraisal but estimated to be very minor amounts.
**= Less than 1%.
As shown in the table, the main deviations from appraisal estimates resulted
from lower than projected investments in pasture improvement (where
fertilizer expenditures were substantially reduced and partly compensated by
high expenditures on improved seeds). Also, investments in machinery and
equipment were about double those of appraisal forecasts, reflecting the
popularity of seed machinery and dairy equipment.
3.17       The choice and working mechanism of the indices for adjustment to
be applied to subloans repayments were not an issue either at appraisal or
during project execution, as the same index applicable under the Fourth was
applied to the Fifth Project (the indices applied during project life are
shown in Annex 2, Table 2).

IV. PROJECT IMPACT
A. Background
4.01       The quantitative assessment of the impact of credit projects is
traditionally difficult, but the more so in this case for two reasons: (a)
although there is a project monitoring unit with an excellent data base of
relevant records on a sample basis, it is too early to evaluate the effects
of on-ranch project investment on technical coefficients and production; and
(b) the country's sector policies have been unstable and changes occurred in
the international beef markets upon which Uruguay depends, and which had an
impact on the sector difficult to quantify.
4.02       PLAN's monitoring unit has assessed the impact of the project using
actual information and statistics obtained from a special survey, coupled
with official and trade price statistics of outputs and costs. In addition,
the unit has furnished summaries of the detailed financial and physical
records kept annually on PLAN-assisted farms since the early 1970s. The
mission feels that, even though some of the estimates may represent average
conditions, the assessment made by PLAN's monitoring unit, which is presented
in the following paragraphs, represents the best method available for
estimating the on-ranch production impact of the project.
B. Data Source and Methodology Used
4.03      Assessment of the project's agricultural impact is based on data
collected and analyzed by PLAN's Division of Economics between 1975 and
1980. Specifically, there were two main sources of ranch data. First, in
1981, a stratified survey was conducted on a sample of 118 sub-borrowers who
repeated farm plans at least three times between 1976 and 1980. From the
survey and with the help of the farm plans, the without project (1975)
situation, the annual with-project variations and the full development
results were calculated. The exact annual herd numbers and composition were
obtained for the same producers surveyed from records (sworn statements)
compiled by DINACOSE6/. In addition, the information for each year
processed by PLAN included total areas and land use (particularly grazing
area and improved pastures), investments and their composition, production,
and other technical coefficients. The data were broken down into the three
groups by which PLAN traditionally classifies its borrowers: livestock,
mixed farming, and dairy. With time, it became apparent that farm size and
technical coefficients for livestock and mixed producers were very similar
and resources were used primarily for beef and wool production.
4.04      Detailed financial and physical records kept annually on
PLAN-assisted farms since the early 1970s (commonly referred to as Green
Folders) are the second source of information. Although the records are not
a representative sample since they are kept voluntarily under PLAN technical
control, they are very detailed and cover a wide range of farm types and
geographical locations. Even though the annual records are not all for the
same farmers, they have proved to be a useful source for special exercises
and planning calculations, and that such data are fairly consistent and
approximate most data ranges. Besides the special purpose surveys done from
time to time, the Green Folders are scheduled for revision and will be the
6/   Direccion Nacional de la Contraloria de Semovientes.

evaluation.    The time series data of these Green Folders are presented in
Annex 3, Tables 1-4 for the past 10 years.

4.06       Considering the high variability in beef prices and Government
policies prevailing during the implementation period, the impact of project
investments on pasture infrastructure and production and productivity
coefficients in beef/sheep ranches is acceptable (see Table in para 4.05).
The percentage of total land in improved pasture was higher than appraisal
estimates in both the without and with project situations. While this
percentage might still be considered low, it is necessary to point out that
the range of variation in percentage of land in improved pasture among farms
is great. In certain areas of Uruguay, it is difficult to find even 5% of
7/   Of which 23 ha are in annual crops.
8/   Plus in actual case, 4.7 kg wool w/o project and 7.6 w/project.



- 15 -
the land suitable for improved pasture either because of topography or soil
type, while in other areas almost 100% of the land would be suitable. The
increase in improved pasture resulted in an increased stocking rate from 0.8
animal units per hectare without the project to 1.1 AU with the project.
4.07     There is a decrease in total animal sales in the initial years of
project implementation (Annex 2, Tables 12 and 15) but this is due primarily
to a reduced sale of females of both sheep and cattle to increase the flock
and herd. However, by year 3 of development, both the numbers of animals
sold and total kilograms sold increased significantly. At this time there
was an increase in the average weight of steers, heifers and lambs sold as
compared to the without project situation, reflecting the higher percentage
of improved pastures, as well as improvements in general management of the
flocks and herds.   In spite of lower than expected prices received by beef
ranchers, these factors account for the slightly higher return on investment
projected in the with project situation.
4.08      In the case of dairy farms, the average size of sub-borrower farms
was 55 ha larger than appraisal estimates. While this accounts in part for
the increased milk production, data in table in paragraph 4.05 indicate that
productivity per cow was a more significant factor. Comparing without
project data on actual farms with estimated data, there was a difference of
only 229 kg of milk per cow.     However, at full development this difference
had increased to 1,021 kg, and the increase on surveyed farms averaged 869 kg
in five years.
4.09       These tabular data as well as observations in the field indicate
the effects of a more stable pricing and marketing environment which obtained
for milk as compared with beef/wool, which led to the dairy farmers taking
greater advantage of the credit and technical assistance offered and adopting
higher technology and better overall farm management.
V. RATES OF RETURN

Real meat prices received by farmers were generally lower than appraisal
estimates by some 15 to 20% through the period (excluding 1978 and 1979 when
prices fell and then increased sharply). The technical coefficients
experienced by producers more than compensated generally the lower prices
received by farmers. Milk prices received, however, were about the same as
those projected at appraisal. It has been Government policy to maintain
stability in the milk subsector and the indication are that the trend is
likely to continue.

B. Economic
5.03      Annex 2, Table 18 summarizes total benefit and costs of the project
which have been used to calculate the economic rate of return. The basic
cash flows used for the financial analysis, after adjustment for taxes and
subsidies, have been phased by the number of producers and the timing of the
individual investments. The price trends follow the same methodology given
in para 5.02 above. The best estimate of the economic rate of return is
19.9% when no account is taken of all institutional costs of PLAN and 17.3%
if the full and actual budgetary expenditures of PLAN's operations are
charged (the appraisal estimate in the latter case is 18%).
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A. The Honorary Commission of the Livestock Plan (PLAN)
Background
6.01      PLAN was legally created in 1957 and began operations in 1961 with
the First Livestock Development Project (Loan 245-UR). PLAN was promoted in
the absence of a nationally organized technical assistance scheme to the
livestock sector, and, even to the present, remains the only source of
continuous assistance and technology transfer to livestock producers.
Objectives
6.02      The main objective of    PLAN is to increase livestock production by
helping farmers prepare suitable ranch plans, recommending subloans to BROU
and furnishing technical assistance and supervision during the disbursement
period. PLAN has provided extension services to non-borrower ranchers,
supported applied farm level research, and provided a myriad of ancillary
services to Government (discussed in para 6.16).
Management
6.03      The Commission.   PLAN has been directed by an Honorary Commission
of eight members: four delegates from four farmers'associations, one from the
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP), one from BROU, and one from the
Central Bank. The President is elected by the seven delegates with the
approval of Government. The Commission members are unpaid, direct broad
agency policy, and meet once a week (the Commission has consistently met an
average of 48 to 50 times annually). Administrative expenses of PLAN are
financed by Government through the annual budget of MAP.
6.04       PLAN's organizational set-up is unique in the public agricultural
sector, as it had to be to succeed in providing a flexible and tailor-made
service. From its inception, PLAN directed its efforts to the individual
producer at the field level and achieved in the course of time the high
regard of farmers, business suppliers and other Government departments.
The good relations with producer groups is indicated by the fact that office
space in the interior of the country is provided by these groups, thus
lowering the administrative expenses of the institution.



- 18 -
6.05       Beginning with the early 1970s, however, PLAN began to be
administratively absorbed by MAP, as were other ministerial departments, and
to lose its power to be flexible and to take risks.     The composition of the
Commission has been directly responsible for preventing complete absorption
of PLAN by other Government departments, but that in itself could not prevent
a general downgrading of PLAN in administrative terms (the President was
reduced to the rank of Subprogram Director in 1979, one level below what it
had been). That further power loss has not occurred is due to the
personalities of the presidents in recent years, who have managed to have
good relations with Government departments and with producer groups as well.
6.06      The Technical Staff.    The technical staff of PLAN is headed by a
Technical Subdirector who coordinates field activities through five area
delegations and five divisions in headquarters, namely, for support (seeds,
machinery, water and such), central area (coordination), extension, soil
microbiology, and economics (analysis, records and statistics). Staffing has
traditionally averaged about 100 professionals and 40 administrative and
service personnel, 80% of whom are stationed in field offices. The
administrative and accounting services are well staffed, with project
accounting being of high standards. Audit reports were prepared on time,
were of good quality, and have maintained a homogeneous format, which has
simplified project follow-up.
6.07       PLAN's structure and management style are well suited to its
objectives.   All technical staff are employed full-time.      Staff have
flexible working hours and free work schedules enabling them to fit work
programs to the type of clientele prevailing in their work areas (small- vs.
large-scale farms, and such) and to their private business (usually
farming). Producers view staff as farming partners, enhancing the latter's
credibility in imparting technical advice.    Staff have the freedom to orient
efforts to the area's needs, sometimes emphasizing research transfer while
others orient on-farm trials, training courses, special studies with other
Government departments, and the like.
6.08       Given the staff available and the large amount of effort required
to plan and supervise credit of the integral type that it offers, PLAN has
performed remarkably well --at the institutional and individual level.
Although morale has decreased, beginning with the sectoral crisis in late
1976 and continuing down until early 1980 (crisis which affected PLAN
internally as three Presidents and three Technical Directors held office
during the life of the project), normal credit activities continued at a
reduced level, and new ones were begun. Some staff left and the trend was
reversed when the sector recovered in early 1980. The loss in administrative
power and reduced control over its approved budget has affected PLAN's daily
management. Although there are certainly advantages in centralizing
departmental power within MAP, there would be more pronounced disadvantages
if this trend were to continue. At present, PLAN is headed toward a



- 19 -
situation where the vital link with the producers (in terms of support, as
well as in its actions) may be lost. Also, PLAN has had to work on problems
as they were detected, which forced flexibility but eliminated any chance of
pursuing general purpose goals or making long-term plans.
6.09      A positive hiring policy followed by PLAN is that it     requires that
an open and competitive exam be passed by individuals entering the
institution. This rule has served very well to ensure quality staff, win a
high regard by producers, and prevent possible outside interference in
recruitment. Unfortunately, these exams (concursos de oposicion) are held at
infrequent intervals and the staff lost (especially that lost in 1978 and
1979) cannot be quickly replaced. With hindsight, however, it appears that
PLAN should continue the hiring policy in view of the administrative
environment and the repercussions that could be generated in the producing
sector if it were to be changed.
New Actions
6.10      During the project life, several new policies or actions were taken
by PLAN which affected its institutional role. The most significant ones are
discussed briefly below.
6.11      Advisory Service.   Advisory services directed to producers who
desire technical assistance but who do not require credit hve been available
since PLAN's early days. But it was not until 1971 when demand for such
services became significant, year when Government instituted fiscal
incentives (IMPROME), for on-farm investments planned and supervised by PLAN,
which were followed by another scheme (IMAGRO) in 1977. Over 1,000 farm
plans are prepared under this service annually even though the fiscal
incentives are being gradually reduced, activities which have helped to build
up PLAN's stature in the sector.
6.12      Advice on Cost-reducing Techniques.    Advice has been provided to
ranchers on an experimental basis and is being increasingly followed.
Examples of some of the work performed are: promotion of practices with
little additional costs, such as tailored breeding calendars, animal health
measures, management of traditional pastures, use of PLAN-provided
inoculants, change and simplification of farm record-keeping forms in view of
past experiences, and detailed analysis of farm credit needs by investment
categories, with a view to reduce total indebtedness.
6.13      Farm-Level Research.    Research on grass-legume mixes and improved
seed production using farmers' plots has proved to be popular, with many
farmers today harvesting most of their own seed needs, and, in several
instances, selling seed to others. The availability of quality seed is
critical due to import difficulties and because the research system is not
able to produce significant quantities. Some farmers, in fact, derive most
of their income from seed production.
6.14      Courses for Farmers.    Courses were offered farmers, beginning in
1978, on rural administration, the economics of farm management, and farm
machinery.    Such courses have been formalized with time, with the result
that in 1981, PLAN held the fifth (and the first international) course in
adjustment of farm machinery.



- 20 -
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.15      With Bank encouragement and financing, and to build up a base for
policy- making in the livestock sector, a monitoring and evaluation office
(SERPA)9/ was created in PLAN beginning with the Third Project. The
philosophy in creating this Unit was to accumulate and analyze sectoral
information with a view to monitoring the sector's development and to
advising on economic policy.
6.16      SERPA built up slowly as staff gathered information and acquired
knowledge on PLAN's lending and sectoral policies. Questionnaires were
designed to fit PLAN's operations and some 250 to 300 farmers volunteered to
provide and maintain farming data. The Unit, since inception, was headed by
an expatriate Senior Agricultural Economist and staffed by four to six highly
qualified and well regarded people. SERPA maintained, however, a different
personality within PLAN, partly because of differences in policy between the
two in extension work, and partly because the staff of the two organizations
had little contact (SERPA was housed in a separate building). Also, because
of the high-quality staff in SERPA, demands were increasingly made on it for
special studies, quick sectoral analyses, and the like. Additionally, staff
turned over frequently as other ministerial departments offered jobs with
important responsibilities, and SERPA became a sort of training unit. Of the
21 staff sent abroad for training with Bank funds, 15 remain with PLAN at
present, and of eight staff trained abroad through bilateral funds, only
three remained. Most of those who left had received long-term training.
6.17      Coinciding with the depressed state of the livestock sector,
staff morale in SERPA declined, and in September 1977, the Senior
Agricultural Economist resigned. His replacement, a locally recuited expert
(para 3.08), did not stay long, and within a year SERPA disintegrated, not by
design but by neglect, as PLAN had more pressing problems. The monitoring
and evaluation functions were kept to a minimum, while the Unit still had to
provide quick research services to MAP's departments. The project ended with
one highly qualified technician, over-extended in his work, dealing with
short-run problems and located physically in the Division of Economics of
PLAN, since SERPA no longer existed as an entity.
6.18      There is a tremendous amount of excellent data in PLAN's files.
Farm record-keeping has been kept up by field technicians, but little or no
staff time and few facilities have been available at headquarters to process
data to their fullest extent. The minimum requirements of reporting agreed
with the Bank were met in the spirit if not fully to the letter of the
agreement.   Progress reports and audits were received by the Bank on time.
As agreed in Schedule 5(A)(f), 8i) and (ii), detailed farm records were kept
for at least 150 sub-borrowers' /, the data processed, and annual summaries
issued. Also, on-lending statistical summaries have been issued regularly
(Operacion Uruguay- Repartido Final), but, at the institutional level, much
more should have been done to spread the information and apply the
experiences gained (even the annual reports by PLAN were not issued in 1976).
Although such information is being used within PLAN for preparation of farm

plans, for training, and as a data base for work requests from outside, no
time has been available to dispense it to other quarters, who badly need
such well-documented and homogeneous material (public and private banks,
MAP's departments, input suppliers, and such). Although the tradition has
been to report lending by programmed subloans, in late 1981 PLAN finished a
complete redesign of data formats, with a view to using one data source for
various reporting needs, simplifying monitoring and evaluation, and moving
toward identifying sub-borrowers instead of subloans. PLAN is about to
purchase small computers to mechanize all record-keeping, and the Division of
Economics has hired another highly qualified economist. However, because
PLAN is under pressure to perform financial and economic work of various
kinds, it needs more resources if it is to restore monitoring and evaluation
to the peak condition it enjoyed in the mid-1970s.
B. Private Advisory Service
6.19      Some private technical assistance services have developed in recent
years and coexist with PLAN's services without significant duplication. In
1962, the first Regional Center for Agricultural Trials (CREA)11/ was
created, following the pattern of models developed in France a7ir introduced
in Argentina. The 40 CREA groups distributed throughout the country, and
covering more than 400,000 ha, are associated in a national federation, which
provides overall assistance and national coordination. The activities and
powers of CREAs lie at the base, with each center being different. Although
CREAs cannot be directly attributed to PLAN, they are discussed here because
many PLAN technicians participate in a CREA and because the two organizations
complement each other in function.
6.20      A CREA group is usually composed of 12 neighboring full-time (and
usually medium-size) farmers, who aim to improve their agricultural
development through the exchange of information and detailed farm data. The
groups meet monthly for a day-long session that includes a formal technical
or economic presentation and discussion, the exchange of farm results, and a
family-oriented social event. These activities are complemented every two or
three months with CREA regional meetings, outside speakers, demonstration
courses, and the like.
6.21      The strength of   CREA groups comes from the constructive
self-criticism expressed at meetings, the impact of CREA groups on non-CREA
groups, and the exchange of continuous and homogeneous farm accounting data
and coefficients.   The accounting is carried out by professionals, financed
by modest fees from group members and patterned after PLAN's farm recording.
In addition, each group has a technical advisor, often a PLAN technician.
The group effort is directed at improving each member's farm operations and
to individually exceed agreed-upon farm technical coefficients. Although
CREA members are not more likely that non-members to be borrowers through
PLAN, they benefit from PLAN's techniques and knowledge of the sector.     The
research and management experimentations carried by CREA members are fed back
to PLAN through its technicians.

C. Experiences with Small-scale Farmer Lending
6.22       Although the appraisal report is not explicit on small-scale farmer
lending, perhaps because the loan was appraised and approved in the midst of
a world economic crisis and perhaps because not enough was known about such
lending within Uruguay's livestock sector, the first attempts at it were made
under the project.   During the latter stages of loan processing and
especially at Board presentation, statements were made that reflected the
intention to encourage such lending.    The preparation efforts towards
development of the small farmer component began in mid-1975, following some
guidelines presented in the appraisal report of the Fourth Project (and
absent in that of the Fifth).
6.23      During mid-1975 (and right after the reappraisal of the Fifth
Project), PLAN held a series of meetings to establish the farmer selection
criteria and objectives of the small-scale farmer program.12/ Basically,
producers had to be established full-time farmers and have little capital,
good references, and access to less than 200 ha of land. The objectives to
be fulfilled in each individual loan were to: (a) improve the family's
standard of living; (b) recuperate soil fertility; (c) increase outputs and
incomes; (d) diversify production to decrease risk; and (e) increase farmers'
equity capital.
Pre-project Situation
6.24      With the agreement of BROU, PLAN, and INC, eight producers were
initially selected. These producers met the selection criteria and were also
found to have a low cultural level; possess few animals of varied types; and
have high debts, very poor equipment, deficient supplies of water, and little
infrastructure for mixed farming (crops-beef-milk). The sub-borrowers were
located in western littoral because of the good natural conditions, and the
staff working in the program were in the western regional offices. Farms
ranged from 42 ha to 169 ha in size, with an average of 95 ha; there were no
improved pastures; and each had a wide variety of crops (wheat, sugarbeets,
linseed, and such). The average number of livestock on the farm was 26.
Farm Plans
6.25       Beginning in 1976, detailed farm plans for the short and medium
term were prepared by the technicians of PLAN with assistance from BROU and
INC staff, and it is to their credit that the staff involved were cautious
and tailored each plan to the farm circumstances.      In the succession of
draft farm plans, it became apparent that two items had to be financed from
the beginning to ensure a reasonable cash flow: machinery and buildings. The
staff spent much time in rearranging plans to minimize debt burden and
over-investment.
12/ Formally known as Plan Piloto para Pequenos Productores Mixtos
(Pilot Plan for Small-Scale Agricultural Producers).



- 23 -
Technical Assistance
6.26       The technical assistance given to these producers by PLAN was very
different from that given to commercial producers.
(a)   Integrated and Centralized Assistance.    Only one technician served
a producer, and this was done to ensure continuity and avoid conflicting
opinions. The technician was responsible for providing advice on all aspects
of farm operations and family life or for seeking appropriate outside help.
He even managed the family accounts on a daily basis. BROU also collaborated
in that credit matters were channeled through the PLAN technician.
Surprisingly, farmers who were to be graduated from this financial
supervision insisted on remaining under the system to continue receiving the
same attention as other farmers under the program.
(b)   Frequency of Visits.   Up to plan implementation, visits were very
frequent, at least twice a week, but thereafter, they were once a week, a
practice that is still followed. In addition, monthly meetings are held with
all producers to exchange results, and discuss problems; and
(c)   Reaching the Family.   Technicians quickly learned that the
housewife had to become involved if farm planning was to succeed; therefore,
women were included at the very beginning of farm plan preparation. It also
soon became apparent to the technician that farm profits went mainly to meet
medical care costs. Therefore, he arranged to have the most pressing medical
needs of the family taken care of free of charge or at low cost through
personal contacts. Educational advice was also very much in demand. To deal
with these social aspects, PLAN obtained approval to hire a social assistant
from the locality who then received some training in agriculture and who
worked exclusively with the 22 families reached through the project, taking
over non-agricultural tasks from the PLAN technicians.
Credit Assistance
6.27       Planning for credit was extremely complicated.    Farmers had a very
high debt/equity ratio, were undercapitalized, and there was no productive
structure through which to achieve significant improvements. It was agreed,
therefore, that investment plans had to be carefully tailored and full
financing given. With BROU's help, debt rescheduling was included in the
package, as was short- and long-term financing and funds to cover family
living expenses. Investmentsawere reduced as much as possible. Long-term
financing turned out to be a key factor, because of the slow nature of
livestock productivity. Based on data kept on the original eight producers,
incomes increased modestly but significantly and debt/equity ratios rose in
years 1 and 2 but decreased years 3 and 4 in all cases but one (from 55% to
46%), as compared with the without project situation. Ratios are projected
to decrease even further.



- 24 -
Farm Level Results
6.28       In view of the initial situation, PLAN's goal was to save the farm,
with satisfactory results in five years of operations. Because Government
guaranteed on-farm lending under the Fifth Project, considerable flexibility
was afforded to the credit planning process. Some farms obtained average
production per milk cow of 2,400 liters annually (or 1,500 1/ha), with the
average being 8 to 10 liters daily per head. This income diversification
helped a great deal in generating positive cash flows as farmers now earned
incomes weekly. All cattle in the farms are now of the Holstein type, while
in the without project situation, there were cross-breeds with very low milk
production potential. In year 4 of the project, the average area under
improved pastures was 65%, between two and three times greater than in larger
project farms. All eroded land had been recuperated by year 3 in every farm,
and all of the farmers benefiting from the project (except one) are at
present farming full time under viable conditions. Failure of the
unsuccessful subloan is, in PLAN's judgment, attributable to the reluctance
of the farmer to adjust to the supervised credit pattern of the program and
also to a change of technician mid-course in project execution.
Lessons Learned
6.29       The following summarize the lessons learned from the small-scale
farmer pilot scheme.
(a) Early Bank involvement (at the preparation and post-appraisal
stages) in discussions with Government on the background of
criteria for selection of farmers encouraged the development of
such pilot scheme;
(b)  It is important to gain the support and interest of officials at
the policy and executing levels. The Minister of Agriculture in
1974, after a visit to an INC settlement, initiated the preparatory
work. Also, PLAN gave regional technicians the freedom to work
on the program at their own discretion and combine such work with
their normal duties. Also, regional technicians took an inordinate
amount of interest in the program;
(c) Good working relations among the institutions involved is a
prerequisite, due to the land, credit and technical requirements of
undercapitalized rental tenants;
(d) The size of the project area should be kept within practical
limits.    PLAN was initially too ambitious in attempting to reach
farmers in too wide an area. The subloans succeeded partly
because the areas where farmers were located became eventually
restricted geographically;
(e) The family as a unit needs to be reached very early in
the planning process (social assistance, water supply, hygiene,
and such); otherwise, achieving momentum toward full farm
development may be delayed;



- 25 -
(f) Long-term credit on appropriate terms and conditions is
fundamental, with flexibility permitted in mixing credit
lines, so as to tailor them to individual farm plans;
(g) Crop selection needs careful study because growing most crops is
very risky (in terms of marketing, weather, and such), as compared
with traditional livestock activity;
(h) The pilot effort took a relatively large but unquantified
amount of official and private staff time, with little cash
agency costs; and
(i) The opportunity which may be missed because the farmer is
restricted to a single source of advice is more than compensated by
the continuity and confidence in a highly motivated technician
channeling the technological package.
6.30      Replication of the pilot scheme has taken place through lending to
dairy farmers in the department of Colonia 33 under the Agricultural
Development Project. INC and other PLAN staff were trained by the
technicians who worked in the original scheme.
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01      As the project was the fifth in an unbroken sequence of loans to
the livestock sector, the relations between Government and the Bank were
relatively smooth and the modes of operation understood by all concerned.
Dialogues at the country and project levels were open, and relations were not
strained during project life.
7.02      Project preparation by Government and appraisal by the Bank
took into account the perceived experiences of earlier projects and the
difficult sectoral situation in the mid-1970s,13/ but apparently no
sufficient consideration was given to the low credit demand prevailing. As a
result, it took four years to execute the two-year operation.
7.03      Some of the gains made under earlier projects (physical, economic,
and institutional) were lost and subsequently regained in part during the
project period. The economic crisis prevailing during 1980 and 81 could
result in some other losses, as well as open up opportunities to retrieve
some benefits. A continuing Bank presence in the subsector for a reasonable
period of time would enable PLAN to face and overcome the problems of its
recovery with a greater likelihood of success.
7.04      The quality of supervision is viewed by Government as good but
little time was allowed, especially for field visits. In the first two
years, the project did not receive much supervision from the Bank,
although it can be argued that, considering the high quality of PLAN's senior
staff and the well-organized field extension service, supervision missions
gave their attention to other matters (procurement, training, etc.).
13/ The project was prepared and appraised before the OED comprehensive
auditing exercise of 1976.



- 26 -
Government staff complained about the number of different Bank staff
supervising the project, but they also praised missions for trying to resolve
problems on the spot in the field. Lastly, a Government request to the Bank
for information on disbursements to reconcile accounting records was answered
after a considerable delay.
7.05      Although PLAN recognizes that the Bank could not have done much
when PLAN lost budgetary control and assimilated as a lower department in MAP
(paras 6.04, 6.08), it sees the Bank as having assumed the role of merely a
bystander. On the other hand, PLAN, justifiably, feels that its operations,
results and behavior have been more than adequately reviewed by various Bank
exercises on Uruguay (audits, special Bank reviews, economic missions and the
like).

Re: Completion Report on Fifth Livestock
Development Project, (Loan 1166-UR)
Dear Sir:
Regarding the above-mentioned Project Completion Report, the
undersigned suggests the following changes:
(a)     Page 3, paragraph 1.09.  It is suggested that the following be added:
"Since September 1981, the State, through INAC, has used its negotiating
power and arranged sizable meat exports to the Middle East. The missions
sent for the purpose included producing sector participation."
(b)     Page 4, paragraph 2.01.   The following change is suggested:   "As in
previous projects, beneficiaries of colonization schemes sponsored by the
National Institute of Settlement (INC) were also included."
(c)     Page 8, paragraph 2.14.   It should be noted that prior to 1978 the
meat packing industry was not nationalized, in the sense that all the plants
were State-owned. Up to that time there were both State and private plants
in operation.
(d)    Page 13, paragraph 4.03.   DINACOSE does not keep tax records. It is
accordingly suggested that the word "tax" be omitted from the relevant part
of the sentence which would then read: "....surveyed from records compiled by
DINACOSE."
(e)    Page 18, paragraph 6.05.   It is suggested that this paragraph be
omitted, as the post of PLAN President is remunerated out of the Minister's
allocation for confidential expenditures.
(f)    Page 18, paragraph 6.08.   It is suggested that the last two sentences,
beginning: "At present, PLAN is headed toward...." be omitted.

(g)     Page 19, paragraph 6.11.   The tax incentives for investments have
been maintained and are still in effect today, although a gradual reduction
of them is envisaged under the new tax (IMAGRO) applicable to the sector
since the 1977-78 tax year. It is accordingly suggested that the closing
part of the paragraph beginning: "although these incentives do not exist at
present...." be omitted.

Re: Completion Report of the Fifth Livestock
Development Project (Loan 1166-UR)
Dear Sir:
We have read the document under reference and we are generally in
agreement with its contents.
There could be some changes in the text that I list below, besides
some suggestions of our Economics Division which are attached.
Suggestions
- Para 2.07 (last sentence): Change the word "reduce" to "eliminate";
- Para 3.08 (last sentence): Change by: "In any case, the monitoring and
evaluation activities were not fully performed between 1978 and 1980,
situation which could have been prevented if an internationally-recruited
economist would have been recruited (para 6.17).
- Para 6.18: Where it says between parantheses (even the annual reports by
PLAN ended in 1976); it should say (the annual report of PLAN was not
issued in 1976).
Sincerely yours,
Agric. Eng. Luis A. Carrau

MEMORANDUM
TO:       TECHNICAL DIRECTORATE
FROM:     ECONOMICS DIVISION - Engrs. Grana and Prosper
SUBJECT:  Comments to the Completion Report, Loan 1166-UR
Para 2.01. Not too clear. It should say:
....of machinery.  As in earlier projects, project participants
could include producers benefitting from National Institute of Settlement's
programs, with the approval of the Institute."
Para 4.03 (line 8)
Of the records obtained by DINACOSE (Sworn statements)..."
Para 5.03. Correct Annex 2, Table 8 as per sample attached.
Para 6.06. Correct (line 2 ff.)
....... the field activities through five field divisions and five
divisions in headquarters, namely, support (seeds, agricultural machinery,
water), central area (coordination), extension, soil microbiology, and
economics (analysis, records and statistics)."
Para 6.16. Staff trained abroad (line 14 ff.)
The number is incorrect. There were not 21 technicians of SERPA
trained abroad. It should say: "of the technicians who worked in SERPA (13
in total), eight received training abroad, two financed by the Bank and six
financed by bilateral programs. Of those trained abroad, two work in the
Economics Division and the remaining six work in the private sector or
abroad."

Para 6.30    Clarification.   The Pilot Plan has been replicated through
lending to dairy producers in Colonia 33 of INC under the new
livestock project.
Annex 2, Table 3. Update data from 1979 and 1980 and correct others
according to attached table.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur

Washington, D.C.
Dear Sir:
I acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 1, 1982 with which
you sent us a draft version of the Project Completion Report on Uruguay's
Fifth Livestock Development Project (Loan 1166-UR) and asked for our comments
for inclusion in the final version of the report.
As you are aware, the audit reports issued by this department
pursuant to Section 4.02 (b) of IBRD Loan Agreement 1166-UR only cover
the administrative and financial area and do not therefore include any sort
of evaluation of the technical aspects of the project, which aspects are
discussed in considerable detail in the draft forwarded to us. However, we
have analyzed the financial data contained in the text and the tables which,
in Spanish, are included in the draft and have compared them with the audit
reports issued by this department on March 31, 1977, June 8, 1978, July 12, 1979,
September 4, 1980, August 12, 1981 and August 26, 1982 in respect of fiscal
1976 through 1981, which reports were sent to you as scheduled.
As a result of this analysis, I am pleased to inform you that we
have no comments to make on the report.
