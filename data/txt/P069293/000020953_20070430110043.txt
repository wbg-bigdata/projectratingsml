F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's overall development objective was to implement alternative approaches to
strengthen and reform district primary health care services. The project also had two
component specific outcomes: (i) increasing the knowledge and capacity among MOH
officials to design and implement appropriate primary health care reforms, and (ii)
providing improved primary health care services, and increasing utilization of primary
health care services in facilities in targeted districts.

  Key indicators
  The HR LIL had as key indicators the following:




                                               ii

   Development by the government of a mid-term strategy for health reform, with
World Bank assistance;
   Development and use by the district health authorities of district-specific annual work
plans;
   Development by the government of a policy paper on improving health services and
access for the poor;
   Improvements in access, quality, and utilization of primary health care services in the
targeted districts;
   Increased knowledge among the staff in the MOH and the targeted districts about
strategies for strengthening and reforming PHC services.
  In addition, the HR LIL had indicators related to component outcomes.

  The indicators of increased knowledge and capacity in the MOH were:
   Regular meetings of MOH and inter-ministerial colleagues to discuss PHC reforms;
   Development of a model and plan for PHC reforms for the country;
   MOH officials trained to become familiar with health financing options and issues;
   Adoption of a national essential drug policy and formulary for use at facilities
supported by the MOH;
   Hardware for management information system installed and key MOH and targeted
district staff trained to use it.

  The indicators of strengthened primary health care services in targeted districts were:
   An increase of 40 percent in the number of patients seen at reformed PHC facilities;
   An increase of 20 percent in the proportion on infants in the population that receive
immunization (DPT3) on time;
   An increase of 30 percent in the proportion of pregnant women in the population who
have at least six prenatal visits;
   An increase of 50 percent in the proportion of adult patients seen in the reformed
PHC facilities for whom a blood pressure is recorded in the patients' medical records;
   A decrease of 50 percent in the proportion of patients seen in the reformed PHC
facilities who receive antibiotics by means of injection;
   A decrease of 25 percent in the per capita number of hospital and polyclinic beds;
   An increase of 20 percent in patient satisfaction with access and quality of care
provided in the reformed PHC facilities.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)
1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale
for Bank assistance)


Country macroeconomic background
During the early 1990s, Azerbaijan experienced a sharp output decline; however, starting
1997, there was a resumption of growth mostly attributed to investment activity in oil and
oil related sectors. Although the overall picture in the late 1990s was one of a macroeconomic
success story in a transition country, a deeper analysis revealed that economic progress was
unequal and that major social problems persisted. Following a tight fiscal policy since early
1995, public expenditure declined by about one third in revenues in relation to GDP as compared
to 1992. Fiscal adjustment hit harder public investment and the non-wage component of current
expenditures in social sectors. At the same time, in the second half of the 1990s, there was a
substantial concern that poverty might not have decreased, even though, at that time, there was no
data to provide a definitive judgment. Nevertheless, it was clear that inequality in the distribution
of expenditure had increased and that strengthening and reform of social services were urgently
needed.

Structural/sector background
Following independence in 1991, Azerbaijan's health status indicators worsened
considerably. Even during the Soviet period, health outcomes in Azerbaijan were worse than
those in Western European countries. However, starting in mid-1980s the health status of the
population began to stagnate as it did for all former Soviet republics, and by the early 1990s, it
deteriorated sharply. Despite this, since 1995, many national health status statistics (i.e., infant
mortality, maternal mortality, life expectancy, etc.) reported improvements and by 2000 health
outcomes had reached their pre-independence levels. Contrary to official statistics, the evidence
from social assessments and household surveys in the early 2000s suggested that much of the
apparent improvement was because of under-reporting, as an increasing number of households
did not use public facilities from which official statistics were generated. Moreover, there were
substantial regional variations in reported health status and worse health outcomes in rural areas
as compared to urban ones.

The collapse of public finances after independence resulted in a drastic decrease of public
resources for the health sector.     In real terms, health expenditure in Azerbaijan dropped from
US$148 per person in 1991 to US$18 in 1997. Public expenditure on health amounted to
US$4.41 per capita in 1997, representing no more than 25 percent of per capita total expenditure
on health. The reduced budget resulted in drug shortages, dilapidated buildings, obsolete
equipment, lack of food and heating in health facilities, low wage levels, and late payment of
salaries. The insufficient wage levels and lack of internal controls led to an increase in informal
payments.

Lack of public financing was coupled with inefficiencies in resource use.         The health sector
was characterized by overprovision of hospital beds and medical staff. Hospitals were financed
on the basis of health personnel and number of beds (historical budgets) and thus had no
incentives to reduce either of the two. The average length of stay was long (17.5 days in 2000)
while the average bed occupancy rate was less than 30 percent. There was high reliance on
specialist doctors at the primary care level. Family medicine did not exist, nor did an effective
referral system. The competence level of medical staff was low and the majority of treatment


                                                 5

protocols were outdated.

Lack of public resources and inefficiencies in resource use led to reduction in access to and
quality of health services. There were various reasons for this: the high informal cost of care, the
lack of essential drugs and equipment, and the poor quality of facilities. Consequently, half of the
population reported not seeking care from the formal health system even when acutely ill.
Results from household surveys indicated that in mid-1990s private expenditure amounted to four
times the level of public expenditure on health.

To address the serious problems facing the health sector, in 1998 the government
established a Health Reform Commission to develop a reform strategy and in 1999 a
document entitled 'General Concept of Health Care Reorientation' was produced. The
strategy envisioned, among other things, setting primary care as a priority, reforming the sanitary
and epidemiological services, introducing principles of insurance, reforming the pharmaceutical
sector, privatizing public facilities, introducing fee-for-service, creating a system of licensing,
certification, and accreditation, and reforming the health information system. The government's
strategy appeared to be focusing on cost recovery for medical services, albeit with fee exemptions
for selected social groups. The Ministry of Health (MOH) also developed draft documents on
mandatory health insurance, and in 1999 a Law on Health Insurance was adopted by the
Parliament. Nonetheless, at the time, there were serious doubts by the Bank team about the fiscal
and institutional capacity to introduce a mandatory health payroll tax given the already heavy tax
burden on enterprises and the financial position of the public pension system.

Country Assistance Strategy
The objective of the FY00-02 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was "to persuade and work
with authorities and civil society to help create the appropriate institutional and policy framework
which would steer the country to the path of good governance and equitable development." The
CAS set three program targets: (i) to support radical reform of public sector institutions, (ii) to
strengthen the regulatory and business environment for private sector development, and (iii) to
invest in social development including poverty alleviation measures. In the health sector, the
CAS had the objective of addressing the inefficient health financing system and over-reliance on
specialist facilities and physicians.

Rationale for Bank Assistance
The Health Reform Project was a Learning and Innovation Credit, henceforth HR LIL. The HR
LIL was the first Word Bank health operation in Azerbaijan and it aimed at addressing two of the
three program targets of the CAS: contributing to poverty alleviation and supporting public sector
reform.     The focus of the project was on strengthening the MOH to design and carry out
primary health care (PHC) reforms through: (i) building up institutional capacity and training
officials working on health sector reform policies, and (ii) enhancing critical PHC services and
assisting the most vulnerable in five targeted districts. The project built on the ongoing, at the
time, and largely successful pilot program of UNICEF in Guba.

The project represented an initial effort on part of the government in the process of health reform,
and was an important instrument in measuring the impact of the strategies adopted, ascertaining
whether and why these strategies were successful or not, refining the direction of reform efforts,
and building support and momentum for the expansion of the health reform program. The project
was also an opportunity for the Bank to work with the Government of Azerbaijan (GOA) for the
first time and hence to be able to explore ways of providing support to a new client both at
national and district level, and to ensure complementarity between the policy dialogue on health
reform and the Poverty Reduction Strategy agenda.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Project Development Objective
The project's overall development objective was to implement alternative approaches to
strengthen and reform district primary health care services. The project also had two component-
specific outcomes: (i) to increase the knowledge and capacity among MOH officials to design
and implement appropriate primary health care reforms, and (ii) to provide improved primary
health care services, and increase utilization of primary health care services in facilities in
targeted districts.

Key indicators
The HR LIL had as key indicators the following:

     Development by the government of a mid-term strategy for health reform, with World
      Bank assistance;
     Development and use by the district health authorities of district-specific annual work
      plans;
     Development by the government of a policy paper on improving health services and access
      for the poor;
     Improvements in access, quality, and utilization of primary health care services in the
      targeted districts;
     Increased knowledge among the staff in the MOH and the targeted districts about strategies
      for strengthening and reforming PHC services.

In addition, the HR LIL had indicators related to component outputs/outcomes.

The indicators of increased knowledge and capacity in the MOH were:

     Regular meetings of MOH and inter-ministerial colleagues to discuss PHC reforms;
     Development of a model and plan for PHC reforms for the country;
     MOH officials trained to become familiar with health financing options and issues;
     Adoption of a national essential drug policy and formulary for use at facilities supported by
      the MOH;
     Hardware for management information system installed and key MOH and targeted district
      staff trained to use it.

The indicators of strengthened primary health care services in targeted districts were:

     An increase of 40 percent in the number of patients seen at reformed PHC facilities;
     An increase of 20 percent in the proportion on infants in the population that receive
      immunization (DPT3) on time;
     An increase of 30 percent in the proportion of pregnant women in the population who have
      at least six prenatal visits;
     An increase of 50 percent in the proportion of adult patients seen in the reformed PHC
      facilities for whom a blood pressure is recorded in the patients' medical records;
     A decrease of 50 percent in the proportion of patients seen in the reformed PHC facilities
      who receive antibiotics by means of injection;
     A decrease of 25 percent in the per capita number of hospital and polyclinic beds;


                                                 7

      An increase of 20 percent in patient satisfaction with access and quality of care provided in
       the reformed PHC facilities.



1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification

The project development objectives and key indicators did not change during the project life.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised
(briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured in the
PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the
project)

The largest component of the project (Component 2. District Level Primary Health Care Reform)
focused on improving the health, nutrition and population outcomes in targeted districts in
Azerbaijan by improving access to and quality of health care services. The project aimed at
establishing and equipping up to 16 newly developed outpatient clinics (each clinic serving
approximately 8,000-10,000 population) in each of the five districts. The clinics addressed the
leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the country by providing PHC services, including:
maternity care; preventive and curative care of newborn, children, and infants; reproductive
health; prevention and management of STIs/HIV/AIDS; prevention and curative care for leading
infectious diseases e.g., TB, malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory diseases; prevention and
management of cardiovascular diseases; and, prevention of iodine deficiency. The project aimed
at improving the health status of poor populations by emphasizing provision of services outside
the capital city and focusing on districts that are primarily rural and/or geographically isolated
(i.e., Nakhchivan). The districts were also selected on the basis of qualitative and quantitative
indicators that included proxy indicators for poverty. The project also improved quality of health
care services and management of the health care system by providing approximately 1,300 hours
of training to district health authorities on management and clinical topics. Furthermore, all
physicians in the participating districts underwent approximately 1,200 of clinical in-service
training on PHC topics and leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the country. Finally, the
project financed a variety of national and international training events and observational tours to
other transitional countries for government officials.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The HR LIL project had three components:

Component 1. Capacity Building for Health Policy Reform (estimated total cost US$0.87
million). The primary objectives of this component were to: complement and support the district-
level component (Component 2), and to explore ways to stimulate a national dialogue on policy
changes necessary for health reform in Azerbaijan; generate support in the government for the
reform process itself; introduce a common understanding of terms and objectives; perform
critical assessments related to health financing reform; and strengthen the capacity in the MOH to
plan, implement, and evaluate health reforms.

Sub-component 1.1. Analysis and Planning Development (estimated total cost US$0.13
million). This sub-component aimed at supporting the development of appropriate models for
PHC, and envisaged a variety of national and international training events and observational


                                                  8

tours for government officials to other transition countries where more efficient and cost effective
health care delivery models had been implemented.

Sub-component 1.2. Health Financing Reform (estimated total cost US$0.34 million). This sub-
component was designed to provide training, survey work, and technical assistance support in
three main areas: financial planning of the health system (including analysis of user fees and
equity, estimation of the content and cost of a basic health care package, and analysis of health
care financing options); the feasibility and possible development of health insurance; and
analysis of private health spending. It also included staff training.

Sub-component 1.3. Pharmaceutical Policy Development (estimated total cost US$0.09 million).
This sub-component aimed at supporting the development and implementation of policy reforms
in the form of appropriate treatment protocols, essential drug policy, national drug formulary,
promotion of rational drug use, and decentralized decision-making. This sub-component also
aimed at supporting limited pharmaceutical sector studies, focusing on lessons learned from the
evaluation of the UNICEF-supported pilots of revolving drug funds.

Sub-component 1.4. Management Information System Development (estimated total cost US$0.31
million). This sub-component aimed at supporting the strengthening of the health information
system to assist in the management of the reformed health services, as well as to enhance
monitoring, evaluation, supervision and staff development.

Component 2: District Level Primary Health Care Reform (estimated total cost US$3.63 million).
This component was designed to support actual implementation and extension of district-level
PHC reforms that have been previously piloted by UNICEF. This component would support
reforms in targeted districts to enhance and implement the UNICEF-supported program already
piloted elsewhere in the country; rationalize PHC services; improve the quality of and access to
PHC services; and strengthen the management and clinical capabilities of district health
personnel. This component envisaged providing material support and staff training to five
districts (Xacmaz, Samkir, Salyan, Goycay, and Sarur) with five other districts (Gusar, Gazakh,
Sabirabad, Kurdamir and Babek) acting as "control" districts. In these control districts, data
would be collected on key project indicators. The implementation of the component was to be
done in five stages:

    1. Rationalization of health care services was expected to be undertaken, with substantial
         community involvement, to plan the PHC reform for each district, reduce the number of
         hospital beds, and rationalize medical staff.
    2. The implementation of the PHC models was to be supported by field monitors and
         clinical facilitators. They were expected to provide on-site technical assistance and
         evaluation to doctors and nurses in the primary care clinics, as well as facilitate and
         monitor the uptake of new diagnostic and treatment methods and guidelines. Community
         involvement, through the creation of district and community steering committees, was to
         ensure that community needs were met.
    3. Civil works were to be carried out to refurbish approximately 16 primary health care
         facilities (including a Central District PHC Center) in each district to improve access to
         PHC services. This aimed at making the health services more attractive and conducive to
         better quality care. A small amount of money was to be provided to each district to make
         basic repairs in the health centers in accordance with the rationalization plan. The
         provision of good quality primary health care services also required the availability of
         basic medical equipment, supplies, and cold chain equipment to support primary care.
         Each participating district was to be provided with an initial quantity of essential drugs


                                                  9

         valued at about $0.50 per capita to establish a Revolving Drug Fund (RDF).
     4. Training was envisaged to strengthen the management capabilities of district health
         personnel to implement specific reforms, i.e., use and maintenance of RDFs; rational
         drug use; use and application of health services utilization information; use of computers;
         public health management; and financial management.
     5. Clinical in-service training was planned using the 16 existing and modified UNICEF
         training modules, as well as about four new modules in multiple clinical subject areas.

The Bank credit was expected to finance the entire cost of the district component, with the
exception of civil works where there would be a cost-sharing with the government. It was
envisaged that the implementation of Component 2 would be contracted to UNICEF because of
its successful ongoing experience with the implementation of a similar program elsewhere in the
country. The two objectives of this arrangement were: (i) for UNICEF to have major
responsibility (with the chief doctors, other health staff and the communities) for the success of
investments in the five pilot districts; and (ii) for the MOH staff to learn more about the design
and implementation of PHC reform programs and thus increase the government's capacity for
later extending such reforms to other districts in the country.

Component 3: Project Coordination and Evaluation (estimated total cost US$1.0 million). This
component supported the operation of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), staffed by project
management and technical staff, and a strong monitoring and evaluation program. The
evaluation of the project was the responsibility of the MOH, assisted by international technical
assistance. To support Component 2, this sub-component was to finance a series of household
surveys and observational studies to get baseline and end-of project data in both the intervention
districts and the control districts in order to assess the outcomes and the impact of the project.

1.6 Revised Components

Component 1. There was no substantial restructuring of this component during project
implementation. However, the implementation of sub-component 1.4. Management Information
System (MIS) Development was significantly delayed due to a disagreement between the Bank
and the counterpart in the MOH, the Department of Information and Statistics Administration,
over specifications of hardware and software to be procured under the project. In addition, an
agreement was reached for the sake of economies of scale and consistency that all procurement
of hardware and software for the MOH would be carried out under the HR LIL and all technical
assistance under another World Bank-financed project, the Second Institutional Building
Technical Assistance project (IBTA-II). While the bidding for the supply and installation of the
MIS was completed in the Summer 2004, the MOH canceled the bid arguing that technical
specifications had to be revised. The Bank agreed with the MOH and a new bidding process was
initiated. Nevertheless, eventually, the MOH decided to cancel the procurement of MIS and use
its own resources to procure the necessary hardware to upgrade the system and carry out training.
At the request of the MOH, savings from the MIS sub-component were used to purchase goods
(i.e., ambulances).

Component 2. There was no substantial restructuring of this component during project
implementation. Component 2 included setting up a scheme of RDFs in pilot districts based on
the high drug cost and the scarcity of some essential drugs in the market at project preparation.
However, during project implementation, the market conditions changed leading to wider
availability of drugs and reduction in prices. Following a July 2003 UNICEF study that showed
that prices of project delivered essential drugs were nearly identical to those of their equivalents
in the market and that there was wider drug availability in the market, the MOH, in agreement


                                                   10

with the Bank, decided to discontinue the implementation of the RDFs and to allow for the free
distribution of all drugs thus far procured. Other savings from procurement of essential drugs
were used to purchase basic furniture for refurbished PHC facilities in pilot districts.

6.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

Extensions of project closing date. The original closing date of the HR LIL was December 31,
2004. The closing date was extended three times and the project closed on September 30, 2006.

The first extension, from January 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005, was due to delays in project
implementation (see Section 7.2) as well as due to the fact that the original project
implementation period of 3.5 years was too short, particularly for a first Bank-supported health
project in Azerbaijan. The government requested the extension of the project's closing date in
order to complete: (i) studies on health financing and pharmaceuticals; (ii) the full
implementation of the MIS; and (iii) the civil works and their assessment under Component 2.
The extension would also allow more time between the baseline survey (carried out in November
2002) and the evaluation as well as use of savings under the UNICEF contract for additional
training activities.

The second extension from October 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 was granted to keep the
allocation for Category 3(a) for consultant services open until December 31, 2005 in order to use
the remaining credit funds to finance the following consultant services: (i) a final audit for the
HR LIL; and (ii) an architect for hospital design and an environmental assessment for the follow-
up operation (Health Sector Reform Project, HSRP) which was under preparation.

The third extension covered the period from January 1, 2006 to September 30, 2006. In
December 2005, the Bank reviewed the status of outstanding payments under the project and
estimated that once the final replenishment was done, there were still likely to remain roughly
US$930,000, partly due to the SDR/US$ exchange rate fluctuations. The Bank advised the
government of this situation and the MOH requested another extension until September 30, 2006
to use these remaining credit funds to purchase some necessary equipment for the MOH and to
finance some critical activities as part of the preparation of the HSRP. The activities financed
during the third extension period included: (i) the project implementation/preparation team which
managed the completion of the HR LIL and assisted in the preparation of the HSRP; (ii) purchase
of necessary office equipment and furniture for the PCU; (iii) purchase of IT and other office
equipment for 40 MOH staff; (iv) two architects (an international and a local one) for the
assessment of construction sites for the preparation of the HSRP; (v) an auditing firm to carry out
the 2004-2006 project audit; and (vi) goods and equipment to address emergency needs with the
Avian Influenza outbreak in the country in the Winter of 2006.

Change of PCU
In the Fall of 2005, there were important changes in the MOH affecting both the leadership of the
ministry and the PCU of the HR LIL. In September 2005, following a ministerial decision, the
PCU for the HR LIL was dissolved and the Minister announced that regular ministerial staff
would oversee the implementation of the HR LIL until its, then, closing date (December 31,
2005). However, in November 2005, there was a change of ministers in the MOH and the new
Minister requested a third extension of the closing date (from January 1, 2006 to September 30,
2006) and the continuation of the preparation of the HSRP. A new project team was hired soon
after to manage the completion of the HR LIL and to assist in the preparation of the HSRP.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Quality at entry is rated satisfactory by this ICR.

The project was based on sound background analysis. Although the project preparation period
seemed to be relatively short (approximately 7 months from the Concept Review to Board
approval), the involvement of the World Bank in the health sector in Azerbaijan dated back to
1992. Between 1992 and 2000, the Bank was engaged in policy dialogue with the government
on the health sector and carried out a systematic situation analysis well documented in various
Bank studies (CAS, CEM, poverty assessments, as well as a concept paper on health in 1998).
This process enabled the Bank to have a good understanding of the main sector's issues and the
necessary reform actions. However, the difficult political climate, serious concerns regarding
transparency and accountability, and the low institutional capacity in the sector did not allow for
the preparation of a project earlier than 2000.

The project expanded on a previously successful health pilot program and took into
account the lessons learned from that operation. The focus of Component 2 of the HR LIL
was to enhance critical PHC services and assist the most vulnerable groups in five selected
districts, building on the ongoing pilot program already implemented by UNICEF. UNICEF
established a pilot program in 1996 as part of an attempt to reform the financing and delivery of
PHC to ensure access to effective, efficient and equitable services. By the time of project
preparation, the UNICEF program had recently been evaluated by an external team and the
evaluation concluded that there was enough evidence of success to justify further development.
The lessons highlighted in the UNICEF evaluation were incorporated in the design of the HR LIL
and the Bank team, taking into account the high risk nature of the operation, opted for an
arrangement under which UNICEF would be contracted by the government to implement
Component 2 apart from civil works, while the PCU would administer the implementation of
Component 1 and the civil works under Component 2. The rationale for expanding on the
UNICEF pilot drew on its largely successful outcomes, while the rationale for selecting UNICEF
as a co-implementer was based on the previous collaboration between UNICEF and the MOH on
district health care reform. Furthermore, UNICEF staff was instrumental in implementing the
pilot program and had an already established relation with the various actors in the health sector.
UNICEF's participation was also expected to provide an additional level of control and
accountability, and contribute to closer donor collaboration.

The project adopted a participatory approach consistent with lessons learned from other
Bank operations.        Based on lessons derived from Bank operations in other countries,
participatory approaches enhance project ownership, and contribute to better project
implementation. Implementation of the district component was expected to involve considerable
participation from beneficiaries and community groups. In addition, the district administration
and the health care providers were expected to contribute greatly in the preparation and
implementation of the rationalization plans. These actors were brought together for the first time
in order to discuss and propose solutions to the challenges faced by the health sector in the
selected districts.

The PDO was well defined and focused on an outcome for which the project could
reasonably be held accountable for. The project's objective was to be achieved by actions


                                                 12

taken at the central level, through increased knowledge and capacity of the MOH officials, but
also at the local (district) level, through the development of rationalization plans, refurbishment
of facilities, provision of equipment and pharmaceuticals, and training. Given the limited
amount of resources made available by the credit, the project initial duration period (3.5 years),
and the limited institutional capacity, the project was rightly designed to support the
implementation of a relatively strong package of primary care reforms in only five districts. The
lessons drawn from the implementation of reforms at the five selected districts was expected to
enhance the ability of the MOH to carry out similar reforms in the rest of the country. The
importance placed by the project on the primary health sector in Azerbaijan was in line with
health sector developments in other CIS countries where there was a clear shift from secondary
and tertiary level health services towards a family medicine model.

The limited number of project components reflected the clear and realistic project
objectives, while at the same time it did not compromise expectations regarding what the
project could achieve.        The first component targeted the central level, while the second
component the district level, albeit close interaction between MOH officials and district
authorities was a key factor for the successful implementation of both components. Although the
project did not cover areas such as health care financing, it financed a major study on this subject,
as well as other studies on pharmaceuticals, a needs assessment and rationalization plans for the
pilot districts. These studies were later complemented by a full-scale Health Sector Review
(2005) and served as the analytical basis for the preparation of the second World Bank-financed
health operation in Azerbaijan.

A different project design might have contributed to a more successful implementation of
the project. Although the implementation of Component 2 was successfully completed by
UNICEF, the fact that an important component was executed by an external agency limited the
strengthening of the in-house capacity at the MOH and resulted in a lower level of project
ownership. In addition, the project envisaged that funds for the refurbishment of facilities would
not be available for use until rationalization plans were completed by the districts and approved
by the MOH. However, there was no legal covenant attached to this condition. As a result,
rationalization plans were prepared but they were not fully implemented, thus leading to no
reduction on number of hospital beds or health personnel.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable)

The implementation of Component 2 was considerably delayed and it started only in the
Summer of 2002. Soon after project approval, the MOH and UNICEF signed an Agreement for
the implementation of Component 2.             However, it took approximately a year for the
implementation to start as there was a disagreement between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and
the Ministry of Health (on one side) and the World Bank and UNICEF (on the other side) on the
procedure of drawing down credit funds. The Ministry of Health wanted credit funds committed
under the UNICEF contract to be deposited in the account of the MOH at the International Bank
of Azerbaijan. This was against standard disbursements procedures of the Bank and in
disagreement with UNICEF. UNICEF agreed in accepting an annual blanket withdrawal
application based on the work program of the year, instead of the whole amount of the contract as
stipulated in the contract signed by the MOH. This disagreement resulted in major delays in
implementing the contract with UNICEF and the project as a whole, and project implementation
was rated unsatisfactory in March 2002. Following negotiations between the Bank and the
Government, the latter agreed to proceed with the initial withdrawal application of funds in late


                                                 13

Spring 2002, and both UNICEF and the PCU agreed on an accelerated implementation of
activities under Component 2 to meet the originally planned project schedule.

Due to the inadequate procurement capacity of the PCU, delays were also observed in the
implementation of Component 1. During the initial project period, the PCU encountered
difficulties in procurement management for the more complex activities, namely, the Baseline
Survey and the Health Financing Study. To address this problem, a procurement adviser was
hired to assist the PCU team with the most complex assignments and procurement packages and
worked with the PCU during most of the project implementation period. In addition, a consultant
was hired to assist in developing the Terms of Reference for the Health Financing Study.

Two project activities, the MIS sub-component and the establishment of district Revolving
Drug Funds (RDF), did not materialize. The implementation of the MIS sub-component faced
delays early in the project due to a disagreement between the Bank and the Department of
Information and Statistics Administration in the MOH, over specifications of hardware and
software to be procured under the project (see also section 1.6 for more details). Eventually, the
MOH decided to cancel this sub-component and use its own resources to procure the necessary
equipment for the MIS. Regarding RDFs, two factors outside the government's and the
implementing agency' control resulted in the cancellation of this activity: the wider availability of
essential drugs in the districts and reductions in drug prices. Both factors rendered drugs
financed under the project non competitive as compared to market drugs and during the mid-term
review (September 2003), based on expert advice and its own findings, the mission
recommended discontinuing the supply of drugs under the RDF scheme.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E design identified an adequate set of indicators and collection methods to monitor
progress towards the PDO and component outcomes. As already discussed in Section 1.2, a
set of indicators for measuring progress against the stated PDO and components was developed
during the project design. The HR LIL was also considered a unique opportunity to assess
several key questions mainly related to Component 2, namely:

     Can the availability of medications in near clinics and the provision of basic laboratory
         and medical equipment significantly increase patient utilization of PHC services
         especially among children?
     Is a RDF sustainable under the specific circumstances set in this project?
     Does retraining of specialist physicians in limited topics related to PHC improve their
         knowledge and their use of knowledge in clinical practice?
     Does on-going, on-site training and clinical facilitation improve uptake of new
         approaches and knowledge in clinical practice?
     Do integrated approaches to providing clinical services at the primary health care level
         improve the quality of care?
     Does training in rational drug use with clinical facilitation actually change physician
         prescribing habits?
     Does the provision of integrated primary health care services improve patient satisfaction
         with access and quality of care?

The baseline and end-project data were to be collected using four methods: routine project
monitoring, household surveys, clinical user surveys and observational studies. Data collection
was expected to take place in the five districts to which the project provided direct material
support and substantive training, while to better evaluate the project five additional districts were


                                                14

also selected to serve as comparisons (control districts).

The implementation of M&E arrangements during the project life is considered
satisfactory. International and local consultants carried out three types of surveys for M&E
purposes: a household survey, a patient satisfaction survey, and a clinical service and practice
style survey. Data were collected at two points in time, in 2002 (baseline) and 2004 (evaluation).
In addition, the same group collected secondary data for project and control districts on
catchment populations, availability of medical equipment, cold boxes, refrigerators, medical
records, education material, training programs, no. of hospital beds, etc. The surveys provided
information not only on key project indicators but also on a greater number of indicators and
demonstrated the multiple effects of project interventions (see also Section 3.5). UNICEF carried
out an additional evaluation of Component 2 of the HR LIL in October 2004. The UNICEF
evaluation outlined major achievements of Component 2 such as improvements in the availability
of basic medical equipment and essential drugs, increased knowledge of health staff and more
active participation of community health councils in health related issues. At the same time, the
evaluation pointed out areas where additional efforts were required, i.e. the establishment of a
proper referral system, rationalization of health care services, sustainability of reforms and the
legal basis for community health councils.

Data collected during the project were not explicitly used to inform decision-making and
resource allocation processes, but they were employed in the preparation of the Health
Sector Review Note and subsequently in the economic analysis of the follow-up operation,
the Health Sector Reform Project, approved by the World Bank Board in June, 2006. As
discussed above, data was collected and analyzed during project implementation, as planned.
The project demonstrated clear improvements in strengthening primary health care services in the
intervention districts and increasing the knowledge of MOH officials in strategies related to
delivery and financing of health care services. Unfortunately, no subsequent major policy reform
actions took place. As a result, for example, rationalizations plans were not fully implemented
during the project; also, financial arrangements remained the same with health care facilities
receiving financing on the basis of health personnel and number of hospital beds, and no
financial incentives were introduced to enhance the use of knowledge acquired during the on-site
in-service clinical training and clinical facilitation. In sum, for the most part, the data collected
did not inform policy making. This is mostly due to the fact that MOH leadership was not as
involved and committed to serious reforms at that time. On the positive side, however, data
related to decreases in morbidity and mortality rates in intervention districts were used in the
economic analysis for the preparation of the second Bank-financed health operation, the HSRP.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Overall financial management is rated moderately satisfactory. This is because of the risk
involved in accounting for all project fixed assets when the PCU was dismantled. Project
assets were distributed to the regions when the PCU was dismissed. When the project closing
date was extended and a new PCU established, none of these assets were returned or accounted
for in the new PCU.

Nevertheless, the PCU's financial management systems during project implementation,
including project accounting and financial reporting, internal controls, staffing,
disbursements, and auditing arrangements were considered adequate.                    The moderate
shortcomings in delays in provision of counterpart funds, and submission of the annual audit


                                                  15

report for the UNICEF implemented component did not materially affect the system's capacity to
provide timely and reliable information for managing and monitoring project implementation.
The PCU took great initiative to ensure project documents were secured and available for review
by Bank staff and by the auditors after the Minister disbanded the PCU before the extension of
the project closing date. When the audit of the project financial statements was completed and
the audit report was submitted to the Bank, the PCU handed over the project documents to the
new PCU which ensured smooth transition without affecting the project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

During the last year of HR LIL, a second health operation (HSRP) was prepared and
approved by the World Bank Board in June 2006.               The follow-on operation, which is now
effective, aims to improve the overall health system stewardship and financing, and enhance
equitable access to, and technical and perceived quality of essential healthcare services, in the
selected districts in a fiscally responsible and sustainable manner with a view to improving health
outcomes. The HSRP amounts to US$86.75 million of which US$50 million is financed by IDA,
US$28.25 million is financed by the Government, US$8 million is financed by USAID, US$0.47
million by UNICEF and US$0.04 million by WHO.

The HSRP, like the HR LIL, includes a rigorous set of key performance criteria and
indicators against which project performance will be assessed.            Indicators are grouped in
system governance, financial sustainability, equity, access, quality, efficiency and health
outcome related ones. Primary data will be collected both ex-ante and ex-post through surveys in
pilot and control districts and indicators will also be regularly monitored by the staff of the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU), in close collaboration with the staff of the Health Policy and
Planning Unit (HPPU) to be established in the MOH in order to strengthen the MOH capacity to
lead health and health care policy analysis and development. The HPPU is expected to
institutionalize the M&E system of the health sector in Azerbaijan beyond the scope of any
specific project/operation, as it has been observed with similar units in other ECA countries.

The follow-up operation comes at a very opportune time for the health reform country
program and is in accordance with the wider set of goals set for the HR LIL. The
experience in implementing health reforms in ECA points to the need to: (i) preserve, to the
extent possible, the strengths of the previous healthcare system in terms of public ownership of
health care facilities, state financing of essential healthcare services and planning and regulating
the supply of physical and human resources; (ii) introduce new management and financing
models; and (iii) introduce the changes gradually so as to allow for a shift from a mind set that
commands and controls towards one that introduces the right incentives and regulates. A Health
Sector Review Note prepared by the Bank in 2005 examined these issues and offered a set of
reform options. Subsequently, the MOH (under a new leadership) prepared in 2006 a health
concept note recognizing for the first time the various deficiencies of the existing health care
system and proposing a compelling reform agenda. Important elements of this reform agenda
form the content of the second health operation and are widely supported in the country not only
by the MOH but also by other ministries/agencies (such as a the MOF, the Ministry of Economic
Development and the Social Security Fund). At the same time, one of the wider goals of the HR
LIL, which represented only an initial and a financially small-magnitude operation (US$5
million), was to create the basis for refinement of health sector reform strategies, and to build
support and momentum for a further phase and expansion of the reform program in the country.


                                                  16

This goal was successfully accomplished through the second health operation as demonstrated by
the content of the HSRP, the total financial amount (US$86.75 million) involved and the
substantial government contribution to it (US$28.25 million).




                                              17

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objectives, design and implementation of the HR LIL remained relevant and consistent
with Azerbaijan's current development priorities in the health sector and with current
Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals. The 2006 health
concept note prepared by the MOH states that 'the primary objective of a socially-oriented
community is to ensure a reliable medical service, to improve the living conditions and to prevent
disease thereby contributing to the overall improvement of the public's health conditions.' The
HR LIL was one of the first efforts on the government part to achieve this objective through the
strengthening of PHC services in the pilot districts and the building up of increased knowledge
and capacity of MOH officials to carry out similar type of reforms in the rest of the country. The
project was and is consistent with the stated goals of the State Program on Poverty Reduction and
Sustainable Development (SPPRED) which focuses on the need to improve the quality of and
equity in access to health, a goal central to the HR LIL. The SPPRED emphasizes the large
burden of disease in Azerbaijan, the deterioration in quality of care and the need to strengthen
services to the population. Furthermore, the FY03-05 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and
the FY06-09 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) underline the importance of improving the
quality, efficiency and coverage of health services for better health outcomes.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 4)




                                                18

The project has achieved its development objectives in a satisfactory way as demonstrated
through the accomplishment of most targets set out in outcome and output indicators in the
Results Framework, attached in Annex 1. The project has contributed to the strengthening
and reform of PHC services in pilot districts and increased the knowledge and capacity among
MOH officials to design and implement appropriate PHC reforms. By investing in civil works,
training, equipment and medicine, the project has laid the foundation for the provision of more
and better quality health care services to the population of pilot districts and significantly
increased patient satisfaction. During the project period, the proportion of individuals with some
chronic or acute illness in pilot districts decreased from 18% in 2002 to 15% in 2004. By
contrast, during the same period, deterioration was observed in control districts with an increase
in the proportion of individuals with some chronic or acute illness from 18% in 2002 to 20% in
2004. The project supported training for MOH officials that would enable them to design and
implement PHC reforms in the rest of the country, as well as studies in the areas of health care
financing and pharmaceuticals that could serve as an analytical basis for political decisions. As
mentioned earlier, stronger and more committed leadership was needed in order to translate these
outputs and outcomes to concrete policy documents or reform actions during the project
implementation period. The lack of policy changes was also due to the fact that the capacity of
the MOH staff, while somewhat improved through the project, remained relatively weak.
Finally, the project served as a catalyst in raising awareness regarding the situation of the health
sector in Azerbaijan and built support and momentum for a follow-up health operation, the
HSRP, which is expected to deepen reforms in the areas of institutional strengthening, health care
financing, service delivery and human resources development.

The Results Framework of the HR LIL identified three set of indicators: (i) PDO indicators; (ii)
Component A indicators; and (iii) Component B indicators (see section 1.2 for a list of
indicators). Achievement of the project development objectives is measured by progress made
against each project indicator, as follows:

PDO indicators
Development by the government of a mid-term strategy for health reform. This indicator was
fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way. A concept note on health reform was developed by
the government only in November 2006. This was despite the fact that (i) in December 2004 a
National Health Conference was organized, with assistance from the World Bank, aiming at
building a consensus on system diagnostics and policy recommendations, and (ii) in 2005 the
Bank prepared a Health Sector Review Note providing a comprehensive diagnosis of health
sector issues and presenting a set of health reform options. In November 2006 there was a
change in MOH leadership and it was only after this change that the MOH prepared a concept
note on "Health Care Reform in the Republic of Azerbaijan." This concept note although not a
full-blown mid-term strategy was a substantial positive advancement in the sector dialogue and
development as it acknowledged for the first time the shortcomings of the current system and
advocated for a comprehensive reform agenda on the same lines with the Health Sector Review
Note.

Development and use by the district health authorities of district-specific annual work plans.
This indicator was fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way. Although in the Results
Framework matrix district plans are mentioned as work plans, in the PAD, back-to-office reports,
aide memoires and other project related documents, district plans are identified as rationalization
plans and this is how we will refer to them in this section. The purpose of the rationalization
plans was to reduce the over-capacity of the health system by reduction of beds and personnel in




                                                  19

pilot districts, and were later revised and approved by the MOH and the Bank in June 2003.
However, the implementation of these plans did not progress accordingly mainly due to the lack
of policy and legal decisions required by the MOH (i.e. changes in the criteria for budget
allocation and staffing norms). At the district level, rationalization plans were employed to a
certain extent for the selection of the PHC facilities to be refurbished and equipped under the HR
LIL. Nevertheless, with no changes in the national resource allocation formula (which finances
facilities on the basis of no. of beds and salaries), district health authorities had no incentive to
reduce hospital beds and/or health personnel to increase efficiency, as this would result in a
reduction of their annual budget. Subsequently, as Figure 1 shows the number of hospital beds
remained unchanged between the baseline (2002) and evaluation (2004) surveys in the five pilot
districts. Similar are the results for the control districts. Figure 2 shows that the average no. of
doctors in Village Doctor Ambulatories (SVA) and District Polyclinics (DP) increased (albeit
from a low base) between 2002 and 2004 in pilot districts. This might be an indication that the
government placed greater importance on PHC during the project period by an increase of the
personnel in these facilities. Nevertheless, data on the proportion of specialists in Central District
Hospitals (CDH) and Village Site Hospitals (SUB) also shows an increase between 2002 and
2004 despite the fact that the HR LIL envisaged a movement away from services provided by
specialists and towards services provided by general practitioners (Figure 3).

Development by the government of a policy paper on improving health services and access for
the poor. This indicator was fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way. Although there is no
MOH policy paper on improving health services and access for the poor, the government placed
special emphasis on the health sector while elaborating the SPPRED. The SPPRED focuses on
the need to improve the quality of and equity in access to, health and education, and emphasizes
the large burden of disease in Azerbaijan, the deterioration in quality of care and the need to
strengthen services to the population.

Improvements in access, quality, and utilization of primary health care services in the targeted
districts. This indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. Improvements in access,
quality and utilization of PHC services in targeted districts were clearly demonstrated during the
project cycle through an increase in the number of patients seen at reformed facilities, an increase
in the proportion of immunized children for various diseases, an increase in the number of

pregnant women receiving prenatal care, a decrease in the proportion of patients receiving
antibiotics by means of injections and a notable increase in the level of patient satisfaction (See
also evaluation of Component 2 indicators below). These results were all together more
impressive when compared to evident deterioration of service delivery with respect to access,
quality and utilization in control districts. This comparison provides a powerful insight on the
way health care services could have been provided in project districts in the absence of the HR
LIL, and reinforces the positive outcomes stemming from project interventions.

Increased knowledge among the staff in the MOH and the targeted districts about strategies for
strengthening and reforming PHC services. This indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory way.
Training events were carried out under both Components 1 and 2 and aimed at strengthening
management capabilities in the MOH and management and clinical capabilities in the districts.
Under Component 1, training aimed at strengthening the capacity in the MOH to plan, implement
and evaluate health reforms, complement and support the district-level reform activities and
stimulate the national dialogue on policy changes necessary for health reform in Azerbaijan.
Under Component 2, district training put emphasis on the introduction of improved methods of
patient treatment and the development of new treatment protocols and procedures. Under
Component 1, training involved events both in Azerbaijan and abroad with the participation of
various MOH officials and district health authorities, while under Component 2, a total of
approximately 3,000 district health staff and community representatives were trained locally in
23 different subjects.

The UNICEF evaluation provides some useful insights on the results of clinical training in the
five districts. A comparison between pre and post training tests reveals a significant increase in
the knowledge (correct answers) of the trained medical staff (Table 1). The number of
prescriptions per consultation declined in pilot districts between 2002 and 2004 (Table 2), while
the number of medical tests increased (Table 3). Provided that health care needs in the pilot
districts have remained the same during this period, changes in the number of prescriptions and
tests can be considered positive and attributed to medical training. Finally, information selected
by clinical facilitators suggests that the knowledge and skills acquired during training have been
successfully applied in practice by the majority of staff through ongoing in-service training and
encouragement by the facilitators themselves.

Component 1 indicators
Development of a model and plan for PHC reforms for the country. This indicator was not
fulfilled. The development of a model and plan for PHC reforms for the country did not take
place during the course of the project. Partly this was the result of the low level of commitment
and support to the project by the MOH leadership. Although within the MOH there were groups
of project supporters, the ambivalent and ever changing attitude of the leadership of the MOH
until November 2006 did not allow ministry officials to get fully involved in project activities or
expand these activities in other districts. During a National Health Conference held in Baku in
December 2004, participants strongly signaled the importance of PHC and other reform actions
for the development of the health sector, however the lack of political decisions to carry out these
reforms did not allow the elaboration of a concrete PHC model and plan for the country.

Regular meetings of MOH and inter-ministerial colleagues to discuss PHC reforms. This
indicator was not fulfilled. Regular meetings between MOH and inter-ministerial colleagues to
discuss PHC reforms did not take place during the course of the project. The lack of a clear and
unified position within the MOH with respect to the project and the directions health care reforms
were supposed to take in Azerbaijan, negatively affected the relations between the MOH and
other ministries/agencies in the country. During interviews conducted with officials of other
ministerial agencies for the purposes of this ICR, some officials expressed willingness to know
what was achieved under the HR LIL because information about the project was incomplete,
confusing or in many cases unavailable. However, it is worth noting that the preparation of the
2005 Health Sector Note partially changed this situation. Although the Note did not offer
information on the project per se, it provided a vivid picture of where the health sector in
Azerbaijan was compared to the expectations of the Azeri population and other countries in the
region. Consequently, the Note in combination with studies conducted under Component 1 (and
cited in the Note) raised awareness on the rather dire situation of the health sector and provided a
basis for wider discussion on health. The launch of the follow-up health operation in Baku in
October 2006 was assisted, apart from the Minister of Health, by the Minister of Finance, the
Head of the Social Security Fund, the Head of the President's Apparat and the Deputy Minister of
Economic Development, showing the increasing interest of other sectors for health.

MOH officials trained to become familiar with health financing options and issues. This
indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory way. During the project, MOH officials attended both
international and national events and received training on health financing options and issues. In
addition, two studies on health financing were prepared (one under the IBTA-II project and
another one under Component 1 of the HR LIL) and shared with the MOH staff. These studies
were also used in the preparation of the Health Sector Note. The Note was presented to MOH
officials and inter-ministerial colleagues in a workshop organized in the Baku World Bank office
in September 2005. Although the PCU made a great effort for the dissemination of the studies'
findings, better results could have been achieved with the active participation of the MOH
leadership. The latter seemed uncomfortable with the various findings and recommendations of
the studies and adopted a rather defensive approach. It was only after the change in the MOH
leadership and the development of the MOH's own concept note, that the ministry admitted a
number of difficulties faced by the health sector in Azerbaijan today and expressed its
willingness to carry out the necessary reforms for the system's improvement.

Adoption of a national essential drug policy and formulary for use at facilities supported by the
MOH. This indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory way. Under the subcomponent of
Pharmaceutical Policy Development, the Central Control Laboratory, MOH, an agency
established in 2003, developed an essential drug list and a national drug formulary in
collaboration with academic teams. Similarly, standard treatment protocols were developed by
clinical pharmacologists in the areas of antibacterial treatment, acute respiratory infections, acute
diarrheal diseases, hypertension and gastro-intestinal diseases. Both processes were assisted by
international and national consultants in the framework of a Pharmaceutical Study. All three
documents were printed and distributed in 2005. Approximately, 5,000 drugs were listed in the
national drug formulary, while the essential drug list comprised around 250 generic drugs. The
national drug formulary and the standard treatment protocols are planned to be revised every two
years, while the essential drug list will be revised every year. In addition, the MOH started to
address the problem of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and to improve the quality control in
laboratories having employed a group of 11 inspectors in the Central Control Laboratory.
However, ensuring quality drugs in the market is still an issue due to limited resources allocated
by the MOH to enforce the existing rules and regulations.

Hardware for management information system installed and key MOH and targeted district staff
trained to use it. This indicator cannot be assessed. The MOH cancelled this sub-component.
Nevertheless, the MOH used its own resources to procure the necessary hardware to upgrade the
system and conduct training, thus showing the government's commitment to this task despite the
lack of agreement with the Bank on procedures.

Component 2 indicators
An increase of 40% in the number of patients seen at reformed PHC facilities. This indicator
was fulfilled in a satisfactory way. Increases in the average number of patients per month have
been registered between the baseline and evaluation surveys for all types of facilities offering
PHC services (Figure 4). The greatest increases were registered for Village Site Hospitals (SUB)
at 34% and District Polyclinics (DP) at 33%, while the number of patients increased by 8% in
Feldsher Midwife Points (FAP) and by 11% at Village Doctor Ambulatories (SVA). These
increases, although they did not reach 40% which was the target value, are considered impressive
when taking into account that in some facilities civil works were still on-going during the
evaluation survey. Given that the number of doctors also increased between the baseline and
evaluation surveys, data on the average number of patients per doctor are presented in Figure 4.
As can be seen, there is a much greater increase in the number of patients per doctor for SVA


                                                 23

(30%), which can be considered purely PHC facilities, as compared to SUB (10.5%) and DP
(7%). In the control districts both the number of average patients and the number of average
patients per doctor slightly declined between 2002 and 2004 for all types of facilities.

An increase of 20% in the proportion on infants in the population that receive immunization
(DPT3) on time. This indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory way. Immunization rates for first
dose increased in pilot districts between 2002 and 2004 for polio, DPT3, measles, BCG and
Hepatitis B (Table 4). The average increase was between 8% and 12%, with the exception of
Hepatitis B where immunization rates increased only 2.3%. By 2004, immunization rates for
first dose for polio and DPT3 reached 96%, for measles 94%, for BCG 95% and for Hepatitis B
89%. Although rates did not increase by 20% of the baseline value, increases are considered
important and immunization rates in 2004 in project districts were above average immunization
rates in neighboring countries. Immunization rates for follow-up vaccination also increased for
all types of vaccines, although the average increase was lower than the one registered for first
dose vaccines. Increases in immunization rates were also registered in control districts (with the
exception of Hepatitis B where there was a decline) albeit of a lower magnitude than in the
project districts (this applies mainly to first dose). Despite increases in immunization rates, when
individuals were requested to show their immunization card only 0.9% of respondents were able
to show it in both project and control districts. By the time of evaluation, the percentage of
respondents with an immunization card had increased slightly in project districts (1.5%) and had
remained the same in control districts.

An increase of 30% in the proportion of pregnant women in the population who have at least six
prenatal visits. This indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. Between 2002 and
2004, the percentage of women in project districts who did not have any prenatal visits decreased
by 63%, while the average number of prenatal visits increased by 62% (Figure 5). At the time of
the baseline survey, 41% of respondents in project districts did not have any prenatal visits; the
percentage was higher is rural areas (44%) as compared to urban areas (41%). At the time of
evaluation, the percentage of respondents who did not receive prenatal care during their
pregnancies had significantly decreased to 15% (17% for rural areas and 10% for urban areas).
In terms of average number of prenatal visits, there was an increase from 2.4 visits in 2002 to 3.9
visits in 2004 (Figure 6). In rural areas, visits increased from 2 in 2002 to 3.6, while in urban
areas from 2.7 to 5.2 (approaching the WHO norm of at least 4 to 6 visits during the pregnancy
period). This impressive increase in the average number of prenatal visits was observed in all
project districts with the exception of Sharur. In control districts, by contrast, the percentage of
women who did not have any prenatal visit increased by 72% (from 22% in 2002 to 38% in
2004). The only exception was the Sabirabad district; nevertheless this district had been an
earlier project intervention district for UNICEF and IMC. The average number of prenatal visits
increased slightly in control districts from 2.2 in 2002 to 2.3 in 2004.

An increase of 50% in the proportion of adult patients seen in the reformed PHC facilities for
whom a blood pressure is recorded in the patients' medical records. This indicator was not
fulfilled. Both during the baseline and evaluation surveys, rural facilities in project districts did
not record blood pressure systematically. The only exception was District Polyclinics. A similar
situation was observed in control districts. The failure to record blood pressure systematically in
project districts might be related to the lack of incentives for practitioners, thus signaling that
training although necessary is not always a sufficient condition for a change in practice style.

A decrease of 50% in the proportion of patients seen in the reformed PHC facilities who receive
antibiotics by means of injection. This indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way.
The percentage of individuals who received antibiotics by means of injection decreased by 23%
in project districts (Figure 7). This decrease was higher than the target value decrease of 50% of
the baseline value (50%*34.7%=17.3%). The greatest decrease was recorded for patients seen in
SUBs (50%), followed by patients seen in SVAs (14%). No change was observed between 2002
and 2004 for District Polyclinics. On the contrary, in control districts, there has been an overall
increase in the proportion of individuals who received antibiotics by means of injection by 6%.
Patterns are opposite to the ones observed in project districts with SVAs and SUBs recording
increases (around 10% each) and District Polyclinics recording decreases (5%).

A decrease of 25% in the per capita number of hospital and polyclinic beds. This indicator was
not fulfilled. The number of hospital beds per 1,000 population has remained unchanged
between the baseline and evaluation surveys in the five pilot districts (Figure 1). Similar are the
results for the control districts (See also discussion on rationalization plans under PDO indicator
Development and use by the district health authorities of district-specific annual work plans).

An increase of 20% in patient satisfaction with access and quality of care provided in the
reformed PHC facilities. This indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. Patient
satisfaction increased overall in rural PHC facilities (FAPs, SVAs and SUBs) by 144% between
2002 and 2004. Increases were registered in all types of rural PHC facilities, District Polyclinics
and Central District Hospitals (Figure 8). Project interventions in terms of civil works, training
and equipment in health care facilities contributed significantly in increased patient satisfaction.
Results were similar across project districts. The main reasons of dissatisfaction cited by
respondents were long waiting time, unfriendly personnel, and access problems. The percentage
of respondents citing informal payments and lack of medicine as factors of dissatisfaction
decreased between the baseline and evaluation surveys. In control districts, by contrast, patient
satisfaction decreased overall in rural PHC facilities by 18% between 2002 and 2004 (Figure 9).
Decreases in patient satisfaction were also recorded in District Polyclinics and Central District
Hospitals. The main reasons of dissatisfaction in the case of control districts were informal fees,
lack of medicine, poor physical condition of the facility, and lack of medical equipment.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The HR LIL was not subject to a quantitative cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis.
However, during project preparation there has been a preliminary review of some of the main
economic aspects of the approach proposed which showed that the implemented package of
reforms in the five pilot districts seemed to be the appropriate strategy given the amount of funds
available and other constraints that needed to be faced. The project put emphasis on the
strengthening of PHC service delivery which in principle is expected to affect the majority of the
population and especially the poorer segments as compared to secondary and tertiary care. These
considerations were valid during project preparation and are still valid today given experience in
the ECA region which shows that rationalization of hospital services in post-Soviet health
systems cannot be achieved without strong improvement of the PHC network and provision of a
package of essential health care services. Furthermore, as demonstrated through the baseline and
evaluation surveys, there were improvements in utilization and quality of health care services, as
well as patient satisfaction in project districts which were not observed in control districts.
Finally, a cost benefit-analysis for the HSRP, the follow-up operation, that proposes, inter alia,
expansion of the PHC interventions to other districts in the country, had a positive rate of return.
In the case of institutional strengthening, benefits are more difficult to quantify and for that
reason have not been considered in the cost-benefit analysis of the HSRP.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of the project is satisfactory.              The objectives, design and
implementation of the HR LIL remained relevant and consistent with Azerbaijan's current
development priorities in the health sector as presented in the 2006 health concept paper and the
SPPRED, and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
outlined in the FY03-05 CAS, the FY06-FY09 CPS and the HSRP. The project has achieved its
development objectives in a satisfactory way as demonstrated through the accomplishment of
intended outcomes and outputs for most project indicators, while in some cases it achieved
objectives beyond the original ones (i.e. improvements in health outcomes). The project has
contributed to the strengthening and reform of PHC services in pilot districts and increased, albeit
to a lesser extent, the knowledge and capacity among MOH officials to design and implement
appropriate PHC reforms. One of the most important contributions of the project to the
development of the health sector in Azerbaijan is paving the way for the continuation and
deepening of sectoral reforms through the use of increased public resources for health and greater
inter-ministerial engagement. Although, there is ample room for improvement in the health
sector overall, the country appears to be on the right track and in a relatively favorable position of
learning from the experiences of other ECA countries that pioneered health sector reforms at
earlier points in time. Efficiency wise, while the project lacks a complete economic analysis,
M&E arrangements suggest that it significantly improved provision of health care services in
pilot districts as compared to control districts. The deterioration that could have been observed in
health service delivery in project districts in the absence of project interventions reinforces the
positive project outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The baseline and evaluation surveys provided a wealth of information regarding outcomes of
project interventions other than the ones identified through the key project indicators. Various of
these outcomes are related to maternal and child health given the emphasis put by the project on
the strengthening of primary health care services.

Below, we provide a brief overview of various outcomes for adult, maternal, child health and
other outcomes in project districts (For more details with respect to outcomes see Annex 10.1).
This list is not exhaustive.

Adult Health
     Decrease in incidence of chronic and acute illnesses.
      Increase in utilization of rural facilities and outpatient urban facilities as compared to
inpatient facilities.
     Slight improvement of referral system in rural facilities.
     Improvements in diagnosis and treatment of common ailments.
     There were no significant changes in mortality rates in project and control districts between
the baseline and evaluation surveys.

Maternal health
     Decline in the proportion of pregnancies that led to a miscarriage or still-born birth and
increase in the proportion of babies born with a higher weight.
     Decrease in the number of home deliveries.
      Improved information on birth control, but no significant change in the proportion of
individuals using birth control measures.

Child health
     Decrease in morbidity levels.
     Increase in utilization of rural facilities.
     Improvements in record keeping regarding malnourishment.
     Increased use of Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS).
     There were no significant changes in breast-feeding practices and use of iodized salt for
children in project and control districts between the baseline and evaluation surveys.
     There were no significant changes in mortality rates among children in project and control
districts between the baseline and evaluation surveys.

 Other outcomes
      There were no significant differences in household expenditure on health in project and
control districts between the baseline and evaluation surveys.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The project had a substantial impact on institutional development in Azerbaijan's health
sector. Outcome indicators showing marked improvements in health service delivery and
patients' satisfaction are pointing out the substantially increased knowledge and capacity of the
physicians trained under the project. Results are less obvious in the case of increased knowledge

                                                 28

and capacity of MOH officials, at least during the project period. However, the preparation of a
follow-up operation in a short time period and with wide involvement from the MOH suggests
that the capacity of MOH officials has actually increased. The element possibly missing during
the project period was a stable and well-defined policy framework within the ministry that would
have allowed officials to formulate reform proposals and proceed with their implementation. The
need to build the MOH staff capacity in policy making, planning, management and regulation
remains and is being addressed under the follow-up project (HSRP).

At the district level, the project assisted the creation of community health councils (CHC) in
order to foster community participation across the health sector, ensure that decision making was
based on a diversity of views, improve public accountability and encourage communities to take
greater responsibility for their own health care. Community health councils were created in each
district and CHC members became involved in strategic planning process i.e. the formulation of
district rationalization plans, and the implementation of civic initiative activities. The latter
involved health talks covering a variety of topics such as malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS/STI, healthy
life style, rational drug use, etc. The creation of CHC enabled for the first time stakeholders other
than medical personnel and ministry officials to become involved in the health sector dialogue.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)



3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Beneficiary Surveys
International and local consultants carried out three types of beneficiary surveys for M&E
purposes: a household survey, a patient satisfaction survey, and a clinical service and practice
style survey. Data were collected at two points in time, in 2002 (baseline) and 2004 (evaluation).
The surveys provided information on key project indicators as well as a greater number of
indicators and demonstrated the multiple effects of project interventions. For details on survey
results see Sections 3.2 and 3.5, and Annex 10.1.

Stakeholder Workshop
During the Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission (September 15-19, 2003), a stakeholder workshop
was organized (September 17-18, 2008) in Baku, Azerbaijan. The workshop aimed to review the
progress of HR LIL to date, reinforce the reform concepts, and analyze and discuss major
concerns at the district level. The workshop was attended by 45 participants from the pilot
districts, PCU, WB and UNICEF. The mid-term review evaluated and analyzed the project from
the standpoint of current priorities, results achieved and experience accumulated. Results of the
stakeholder workshop became a revised plan for further project work and a clarified list of
project indicators.

National Health Conference
A National Health Conference took place in Baku in December 2004. The aim of the conference
was to present the main findings from the studies financed under the HR LIL and the Health
Sector Note, build consensus on system diagnostics and come up with a list of actions for further
sector reforms. The conference was organized in a participatory way where groups of
participants were asked to define the main system diagnostics for specific health sector areas (i.e.
provision and delivery of care, health care financing, human resources, etc.), identify problem
areas and propose solutions. The material from the group discussions was put together in
conference minutes. For more details see Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome is estimated to be moderate. The risk, at the time of
evaluation that the development outcomes of the HR LIL will not be maintained in the medium
and long-run depends on financial, social, and political factors. Risks related to financial and
social factors are moderate, while risk related to political factors is substantial.

At financial level, it is imperative that a continuous, sustained and increasing stream of public
funds is destined to the health sector to maintain investments carried out during the HR LIL,
provide additional financing for the follow-up operation and expand the reforms to the rest of
country. Azerbaijan's national income has been growing in real terms at an average rate of 15
percent during the last five years. This impressive growth rate has been the result of a booming
oil sector, as well as a rapidly growing non-oil economy. The SPPRED envisages that public
expenditure on health will increase from approximately 1 percent of the GDP in 2005 to 3.6
percent of GDP by 2015 which provides evidence of the government's intention to ensure the
socio-economic wellbeing of current and future generations. Increased public resources will
ensure more adequate financing both for capital investment and recurrent costs of the reforming
health sector, while structural sector reforms will lead to more efficient use of these resources. In
addition, close collaboration among donors, as expressed through the co-financing of the HSRP,
suggests a strong unified front against resistance and uncertainties around the reform process.

At social level, there is a risk that stakeholder groups such as health professionals or district
population with vested interests in the health sector might attempt to postpone or stop reform
efforts. This risk is partly mitigated by the close link, in terms of timing and sequencing,
between the HSRP and the government plans as expressed in the SPPRED. At the same time,
reform proposals and HSRP activities recognize the need to address issues such as informal
payments, ultimately linked to the low level of salaries of health personnel and the lack of
funding for recurrent expenditures and training. Social risk will also be mitigated by the strong
involvement of ministries/agencies other than the MOH in health sector issues.

At political level, government ownership and commitment to the health reform process is crucial.
Leadership at the MOH can have a catalytic role in the way reforms are advancing or not as
demonstrated during the HR LIL. Given the complex nature of the reforms needed in
Azerbaijan, the government decided to implement the follow-up operation in selected districts in
the country. Although the HSRP does not envisage any activities in the five HR LIL districts, it
is in the interest of the MOH to maintain the positive outcomes in these districts and expand new
activities under the HSRP to these districts and the rest of the country. Increased involvement
from the MOH leadership and support from other ministries for the health reform process are
positive signs of government ownership and commitment and need to be maintained in the future.

Some of the issues that can raise the risk to development outcome have been demonstrated during
the HR LIL implementation and are been mitigated through activities of the HSRP, as well as the
SPPRED and MTEF framework. These issues involve the implementation of the rationalization
plans, the level of institutional capacity in the MOH and the districts, and legal arrangements
related to health insurance issues and the creation of a health fund. Regarding the rationalization
plans, the design of the HSRP is such that no investment in health facilities will be financed
unless there is a clear agreement on district specific rationalization plans. The HSRP will also
invest heavily on building the human capacity of the MOH officials, district authorities and


                                                 30

health personnel, and re-organizing the MOH so as the latter will be able to respond to the
increasing demands of the reform implementation agenda. Similarly, under the continuous
dialogue between the World Bank and the government on the SPPRED and MTEF issues, MOH
officials are to be provided with further training on budget and financial issues. Finally, the
HSRP recognizes the need to pool resources under a common fund which will also act as a
purchaser of health services and to put in place the legal arrangement for the fund's
establishment.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during project preparation was satisfactory. Project preparation
profited from the long previous involvement of the Bank in the health sector in Azerbaijan and
the good understanding of the main sector issues by the Bank team. The project was based on a
sound background analysis and contributed to poverty alleviation and supporting public sector
reform, two out of the three CAS program targets. The project expanded a previously successful
health pilot program by UNICEF and took into account the lessons learned from this operation.
The project adopted a participatory approach consistent with lessons learned from other Bank
operations and put emphasis on the development of a strong M&E framework that could justify
project interventions and provide responses to various issues raised from the implementation of a
first health operation in Azerbaijan. Taking into account the small financial size of the operation,
the project rightly focused on a limited number of components addressing burning issues in the
provision of PHC and the need for capacity building for health policy reform. Strengthening the
provision of district PHC services was in accordance with health sector developments in other
CIS countries. Given the high risk related to borrower's commitment to carry out the project in a
transparent way and the weak institutional capacity of the MOH, the Bank team opted for an
arrangement under which UNICEF would be contracted by the government to implement
Component 2 apart from civil works, while the PCU would administer the implementation of
Component 1 and the civil works under Component 2. This approach was a sensible way of
mitigating the rather high governance risk however it might have compromised the degree of
involvement of the MOH in project implementation and the process of building in-house
capacity. Finally, rationalization of health care facilities might have been more successful by
linking investments in facilities with the implementation of district plans through project legal
covenants.


(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during project supervision was satisfactory. The project was
supervised through frequent and technically sound supervision missions. Supervision products
(aide memoires and follow-up letters) were timely prepared and served as an institutional
memory for the project and for highlighting pending or important issues to be followed up.
Mission teams spent equally long time in Baku and the field, visiting facilities in project districts
to become better acquainted with project interventions. Close project monitoring allowed for fast
identification of bottlenecks in project implementation and development of appropriate solutions.


                                                31

The Bank team closely collaborated with other Bank teams in the country in order to better co-
ordinate activities affecting the health sector (i.e., IBTA-II team). The Bank team worked closely
with UNICEF as well as other donors (WHO, USAID, IMC, etc.) during the HR LIL
implementation and the preparation of the follow-up project. This subsequently led to WHO,
USAID and UNICEF participating as co-financiers in the operation. To promote inter-ministerial
coordination and exchange of information, the Bank team frequently met with top officials of the
MOF, MED, the President's and Prime Minister's office and the Social Security Fund. When the
government expressed its interest in preparing a second health project in an accelerated pace
during the last year of implementation of the HR LIL, the Bank team ensured project preparation
in a fast, participatory and technically sound way.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance during project preparation, appraisal and supervision is
rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The government's performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

The leadership of the MOH up to October 2005 did not exhibit consistent and continuous
support for the HR LIL and the health sector reforms in general. Although, the MOH
participated in project preparation and approved the HR LIL, it took approximately one year to
reach an agreement with the Bank and UNICEF on the procedure of drawing down of funds for
Component 2.         This led to a serious delay in project implementation.          After project
implementation was initiated, the leadership of the MOH failed to provide a stable and enabling
political environment for the reforms to flourish and in a number of cases expressed its
disapproval of project activities, especially the ones which were not under its immediate control.
The MOH leadership eventually dismantled the PCU in September 2005.

The situation changed under the new leadership of the MOH which requested the extension
of the HR LIL and the preparation of a follow up project.

The government provided timely counterpart financing for the project. An exception was
recorded during the last year of project implementation but it was mainly related to fact that the
last extension of the project's closing date did not allow the MOF to include counterpart financing
in the budget in a timely matter. Eventually, the issue was resolved.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


Implementing Agency Performance
The implementing agency's performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

The performance of the MOH leadership is rated moderately satisfactory due to
lack of political commitment and support towards the HR LIL and the health


                                                   32

sector reforms in general.

The performance of the PCU is rated highly satisfactory. The PCU under adverse
political circumstances within the MOH managed to implement the project in a timely
and transparent manner due to the dedication and hard work of its members. The
PCU was responsive and attentive to Bank requests and suggestions. The PCU
greatly assisted in the preparation of the National Health Conference in December
2004.     Even during exceptionally difficult personal times, when the PCU was
dismissed and asked to leave the premises of the MOH, they ensured that project files
and material were safely stored and continued to cooperate with the Bank team to
guarantee a continuous and smooth transition process for project implementation.
They also assisted greatly the ICR team in carrying out interviews and collecting all
necessary and relevant project information.

The performance of UNICEF during project implementation is rated satisfactory
in accordance with its prior experience of successful health project
implementation in the country.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The borrower's overall performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The following lessons can be drawn from the implementation of the first health sector operation
of the World Bank in Azerbaijan:

1. The availability of medication in or near PHC facilities and the provision of basic
    laboratory equipment significantly increase patient utilization of PHC services,
    especially among women and children, and improve patient satisfaction with respect to
    access and quality of care. Based on this finding, the second health project expands
    activities related to the strengthening of health care services, including PHC and hospital
    services, to five districts, while the government is planning to gradually unroll this pilot to
    the rest of the country.
2. Training of specialist physicians in topics related to PHC and clinical facilitation
    improves the knowledge of trainees. However, training activities need to be accompanied
    by availability of resources for medicine and other medical equipment as well as financial
    incentives to allow health professionals to put into practice their newly acquired knowledge.
    Revision of the existing provider payment system under the HSRP is expected to reflect on
    the need to match available financial resources with demand for medicine and equipment and
    financial incentives for health professionals.
3. While project evaluation demonstrated in an unambiguous way the positive effects of
    training on the improvement of medical knowledge, it was less clear regarding the effect
    of training on the use of new knowledge in clinical practice. This is a result which is
    observed in various health projects in the region. In the majority of projects, evaluation of
    training activities invariably includes pre and post-tests for trainees. Nevertheless, the
    evaluation of the influence of training on increasing clinical skills and enhancing the use of
    new practices in everyday work has not been as well planned or executed. The second health


                                                33

    project aims at addressing this issue by evaluating not only the increased knowledge acquired
    through training activities but also the degree to which this knowledge is been used by health
    professionals in clinical practice.
4. Rationalization plans related to physical infrastructure and health personnel need
    concrete project resources, activities and some type of conditionality in order to be
    implemented. This lesson is shared by other country experiences in the region (e.g.
    Georgia). The HSRP is planning to carry out a national mapping exercise which will identify
    not only the number, location and profile of PHC and hospital providers in Azerbaijan, but
    also utilization and referral patterns, catchment population, etc. Based on the mapping
    exercise district plans to rationalize health facilities will be developed and implemented.
    Following agreement on these plans the project will finance investments in particular
    facilities.
5. High-level involvement from the government side is a necessary ingredient for
    successful project implementation. Government ownership not only leads to better
    implemented projects but also and perhaps more importantly, increases the probability
    of continuing with the reform efforts after the completion of the project.            Even in
    settings where government ministries have limited knowledge of project management, they
    need to be on the driver's seat. It is likely that in countries with no past experience in
    implementing health or other projects, a fair amount of 'trial and error' efforts will be
    observed. Nevertheless, the cost of some potential, initial mistakes is cancelled out by the
    progress made due to the strong feeling of ownership from the government side.
6. Flexibility and prompt reaction from the Bank side during project supervision
    facilitates successful project implementation and ensures appropriate post-completion
    arrangements and follow-up operations.
7. The development of a comprehensive M&E system in project design assists in
    demonstrating the connection between project activities and outcomes and provides
    valuable input for follow-up operations.
8. Reaching out to a broad range of stakeholders prevents the derailing of the health
    reform process. The evidence of the success of this strategy is the development of the
    follow-up project per se as well as the wide involvement of various ministries and donors in
    this operation.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

On the indicator of Development by the government of a mid-term strategy for health reform,
with World Bank assistance. The government's completion report refers under this indicator to
the HR LIL mid-term review evaluation developed during a stakeholder workshop in September
2003. Workshop products cannot be considered as a mid-term strategy for health reform for the
country in general, but they are rather focused on project implementation aspects and issues.

On the indicator of Development by the government of a policy paper on improving health
services and access for the poor. The government's completion report refers under this indicator
to the minutes of the National Health Conference held in Baku in December 2005. However,
conference minutes do not constitute a policy paper on improving health services and access for
the poor.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This section aims at providing separate evaluations and ratings of achievements by components.
Information on project outputs that are closely related to key project indicators and commented in
the main body of the ICR is not repeated. The section rather presents a summary of what has
been achieved and how it is related to project objectives.

Component 1. Capacity Building for Health Policy Reform: Moderately Satisfactory (actual total
cost US$0.69 million). Outputs related to capacity building for health policy reform were
generated according to HR LIL requirements. However, it was only in the case of Pharmaceutical
Policy Development that these outcomes were put into practice during the project cycle and some
level of institutionalization of policy formulation took place in the MOH. No major changes
occurred in the areas of PHC and health care financing. Having said this, the results of
institutional capacity building were demonstrated through the development of a follow-up
operation, the HSRP, which puts special emphasis on health care financing reform issues and the
continuation of strengthening of PHC service delivery.

Component 1.1. Analysis and Planning Development: Moderately Satisfactory. This sub-
component supported observational tours for top-level MOH officials to other CIS or Eastern
European countries, annual national stakeholder seminars and international conferences. Despite
the fact that activities under this sub-component were duly implemented, they did not necessarily
lead to the development of important policy documents or the formulation of national policy as
demonstrated by the PDO and Component 1 key indicators. The main reasons for the
discontinuity between training and application were the lack of political will by the MOH
leadership and possibly the fact that further training was required for strengthening the capacity
of the MOH staff for analysis and planning development.

Component 1.2. Health Financing Reform: Moderately Satisfactory. The project financed a
comprehensive study on Health Care Financing. This study comprised a household and a facility
survey, and a detailed analysis of the establishment of a National Health Insurance Fund
(including regulatory and procedural arrangements, methodologies for benefit packages, methods
of provider contracting, and a health financing model). The Health Care Financing study built on
a previous study on Health Expenditure Analysis financed under the IBTA-II project. The IBTA-
II study provided an in depth understanding of how the Azerbaijan health sector is financed and
how health funds are spent, with particular attention to pro-poor targeting of health expenditure.
While both studies offered valuable material to the MOH officials to initiate work on health care
financing reforms, no changes regarding health care financing arrangements were observed
during the project period. Similar to Component 1.1 the main reasons for this inertia are related
to lack of political will and inadequate institutional capacity.

Component 1.3. Pharmaceutical Policy Development: Satisfactory. While the Revolving Drug
Funds did not materialize due to changing circumstances in the national and district markets,
under this sub-component the government developed and adopted an essential drug list, a
national drug formulary and various standard treatment protocols. At the same time, a Central
Control Laboratory was created in 2003 as part of the MOH. The Laboratory participated in the
development of the essential drug list and the national drug formulary and is currently
responsible for improving laboratory quality control and fighting against counterfeit drugs. All
three products developed under Component 1.3 will be updated regularly and the creation of a
specific agency/department related to pharmaceuticals provides evidence for the
institutionalization of the pharmaceutical development process.



                                                  36

Component 1.4. Management Information System Development.The MOH cancelled this sub-
component.

Component 2. District Level Primary Health Care Reform: Satisfactory (actual total cost
US$3.55 million). This component supported reforms in the targeted districts to enhance and
implement the UNICEF-supported program already piloted elsewhere in the country; rationalize
PHC services; improve the quality of and access to PHC services; and strengthen the
management and clinical capabilities of district health personnel. The project activities led to the
formulation of rationalization plans for the five intervention districts with active participation of
health personnel and community members. The latter were represented through Community
Health Councils, bodies created during the project life in 45 communities. Health promotion was
another key activity in project districts. In order to increase community member's awareness and
involve individuals in the project, information, education and communication materials were
produced and distributed, community information boards were provided and local and regional
media got actively involved in the HR LIL implementation process. These community centered
activities in combination with civil works in health care facilities, and the provision of basic
equipment, drugs, and training for managers, health staff and community representatives in
selected topics led to an impressive increase in the utilization of PHC services in project districts,
improvements in the quality of care and increased patient satisfaction. Nevertheless, there are a
number of areas that further improvements could have been achieved. First, with the exception of
the refurbishment of selected district facilities, rationalization plans were not further
implemented and thus there was no decrease in the number of hospital beds or health personnel
in pilot districts. Second, while health personnel expressed great satisfaction with respect to
clinical training, they also expressed their worries about having to put in practice their newly
acquired knowledge in an environment of scarce economic resources for recurrent costs and no
financial incentives for providers. Third, the quality of civil works in some cases was less than
optimal, thus raising concerns from the side of providers. This situation occurred despite the fact
that there were regular inspection controls by individuals assigned from the MOH.

Component 3. Project Coordination and Evaluation: Satisfactory (actual total cost US$1.13
million). The HR LIL supported the operation of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), staffed by a
project director and technical staff, which was responsible for the overall coordination and
administration during project life. The PCU formed part of the MOH and it was housed in the
MOH premises. The PCU reported to the Minister and Deputy Ministers upon order by the
Minister. The PCU was a vital link between the Bank team and the leadership of the MOH which
exhibited an erratic behavior during project implementation. Despite the frequently unfavorable
political circumstances in the MOH, the PCU carried on its normal activities and ensured project
implementation to the degree dependent on its authority and competencies. The PCU interacted
well with UNICEF. The PCU also cooperated well with the Bank team by being responsive to its
requests and suggestions. During the first year of project implementation, the PCU experienced
problems with procurement issues. These problems were mainly related to the PCU staff's
limited experience and were addressed through additional training of PCU staff and hiring of an
international procurement specialist to assist in the preparation of procurement documents. The
PCU contributed greatly to the organization of the National Health Conference in Baku in
December, 2004. The conference offered a unique opportunity to various stakeholders to debate
health sector issues and raised awareness regarding health sector development and project
achievements. Continuity in the staffing of PCU positions, including the one of the project
director, characterized most of project life and was important for smooth and uninterrupted
project implementation. However, in September 2005 the PCU was dismissed and this caused
considerable uncertainty in the MOH and the Bank with respect to the continuity of project
implementation. Nevertheless, soon after the PCU's dismissal there was also a change in the

leadership of the MOH and the new leadership established a new PCU which completed the HR
LIL and assisted in the preparation of the HSRP.

Component 3 also included a rigorous monitoring and evaluation (M&E) program. The
evaluation of the project was the responsibility of the MOH with cooperation of international
technical assistance. Under this activity three types of surveys were carried out for the baseline
and evaluation period: (i) a household survey, (ii) a patient satisfaction survey, and (iii) a clinical
service and practice style survey (for PHC facilities and the maternity ward of central district
hospitals). The studies presenting and analyzing the above mentioned surveys provided valuable
information not only with respect to the specific outcome indicators identified in the project but
also with various other outcomes. Furthermore, the studies established areas where further
efforts need to be made. Although the PCU worked closely with the international consultants on
project M&E, due to changes in the PCU staffing and limited involvement of other MOH
officials, at present it is rather difficult to claim that there is a strong M&E capacity in the MOH.
Nevertheless, the creation of a Health Policy and Planning Unit in the MOH under Component A
of the HSRP aims at strengthening the M&E capacity of the ministry and use the M&E feedback
to support health care policy analysis.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the
analysis)

The HR LIL was not subject to a quantitative cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis.
However, during project preparation there has been a preliminary review of some of the main
economic aspects of the approach proposed which showed that the implemented package of
reforms in the five pilot districts seemed to be the appropriate strategy given the amount of funds
available and other constraints that needed to be faced. The project put emphasis on the
strengthening of PHC service delivery which in principle is expected to affect the majority of the
population and especially the poorer segments as compared to secondary and tertiary care. These
considerations were valid during project preparation and are still valid today given experience in
the ECA region which shows that rationalization of hospital services in post-Soviet health
systems cannot be achieved without strong improvement of the PHC network and provision of a
package of essential health care services. Furthermore, as demonstrated through the baseline and
evaluation surveys, there were improvements in utilization and quality of health care services, as
well as patient satisfaction in project districts which were not observed in control districts.
Finally, a cost benefit-analysis for the HSRP, the follow-up operation, that proposes, inter alia,
expansion of the PHC interventions to other districts in the country, had a positive rate of return.
In the case of institutional strengthening, benefits are more difficult to quantify and for that
reason have not been considered in the cost-benefit analysis of the HSRP.

purposes: a household survey, a patient satisfaction survey, and a clinical service and practice
style survey. Data were collected at two points in time, in 2002 (baseline) and 2004 (evaluation).
The surveys provided information on key project indicators as well as a greater number of
indicators and demonstrated the multiple effects of project interventions. For details on survey
results see Sections 3.2 and 3.5, and Annex 10.1.

Mid-Term Review Workshop
During the Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission (September 15-19, 2003), a stakeholder workshop
was organized (September 17-18, 2008) in Baku, Azerbaijan. The workshop aimed to review the
progress of HR LIL to date, reinforce the reform concepts, and analyze and discuss major
concerns at the district level. The workshop was attended by 45 participants from the pilot
districts, PCU, WB and UNICEF. The mid-term review evaluated and analyzed the project from
the standpoint of current priorities, results achieved and experience accumulated. Based on the
outputs of the one and a half year of the project implementation activities, the mid-term review
envisaged determination of the following aspects:

 Compliance of the project goals and objectives with the health reform implementation in
     Azerbaijan;
 Compliance of the project structure with the goals and objectives set;
 Interim outputs of project implementation by components and by pilot districts in compliance
     with the goals and objectives determined and project monitoring indicators;
 Factors that hindered or fostered the project implementation process.

Results of the stakeholder workshop became a revised plan of further project work and a clarified
list of project indicators.

National Health Conference
A National Health Conference took place in Baku in December 2004. The aim of the conference
was to present the main findings from the studies financed under the HR LIL and the Health
Sector Note, build consensus on system diagnostics and come up with a list of actions for further
sector reforms. The conference was organized in a participatory way where groups of
participants (approximately 120) were asked to define the main system diagnostics for specific
health sector areas (i.e. provision and delivery of care, health care financing, human resources
etc.), identify problem areas and propose solutions. The material from the group discussions was
put together in conference minutes. Some of the directions identified were the following:

Service provision
 Improving the service mix of preventive, rehabilitative and curative services is desirable but
     contingent upon additional financial resources. Action is needed to increase public funds
     allocated to health as well as funds from other sources (i.e., insurance contributions).
 There is awareness of excess installed capacity (especially in terms of local hospital beds).
     The increased availability of funds should be accompanied by legal changes which should
     give to the districts proper room to manage funds and personnel. Districts have the will and
     the ability to do so with two caveats: (i) not abandoning the rural population; and (ii) no lay
     offs.

Human Resources
 Supply to rural areas should be improved by creating incentives for medical staff such as
     financial incentives, training, and improvement of working conditions.
 Accreditation and licensing of medical staff needs to be improved by studying international
     models of regulation and the role of professional associations. Options may include creating
     a Human Resources unit within the MOH.
 Training needs to be developed and improved. There is a need for in-service training
     programs for specialist doctors. The PHC training program should be extended from pilot


                                                 43

  districts to the rest of the country.

Pharmaceuticals
 The national pharmaceutical policy needs to be strengthened through the adoption of an
  Essential Drug List, a National Drug Formulary, Standardized Treatment Protocols and a
  program for the Rational Use of Drugs. Key implementation tools should be pre-service and
  in-service training for health practitioners, and information campaigns for the public in the
  above areas.
 Improvements are needed in the licensing and certification of drugs. Azerbaijan also needs to
  adopt a certification process of drug production.
 Access to and affordability of quality drugs, especially for the poor, need to be improved.
  This can be achieved through the identification of poor beneficiaries (via means-tested
  targeting) and the distribution of a package of essential drugs for the poor.

Health Policy and Planning
 There is a need to establish a Health Policy and Planning Unit. It may be under the MOH or
  an independent agency. It should be staffed with competent and highly qualified people with
  different skills mix (policy analyst, economist, epidemiologist, etc.).
 The stewardship function in Azerbaijan requires a more pluralistic arrangement, one which
  incorporates the views of professional associations, citizens and other stakeholders. The
  MOH needs to adapt its roles and structures in order to "steer more and row less".
 Good planning, implementation and evaluation of reforms, including performance
  measurement are necessary to improve service provision to the population.

Health Insurance
 Evaluation of a mandatory health insurance scheme (define contributions, benefits,
  entitlements, premium collection, contracting health care providers, etc.) has to be carried
  out, with due attention to the experience of other countries. The Health Policy and Planning
  Unit could be responsible for the assessment of the feasibility and fiscal sustainability of such
  a scheme.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Borrower's ICR

Introduction
The development objective of the Health Reform Project (HRP) was to test ways to strengthen
and reform district primary health care services.

The government's completion report deems the project's quality at entry to be satisfactory and
the project as well conceived. The project was prepared according to the Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) standards of the Bank. It was subject to normal peer review process and had
political support of the Government of Azerbaijan. The project design was clearly in line with
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS Document number: 19892 쵡Z, date of latest CAS
discussion: 09/14/99) and the government priorities and met the critical needs of Azerbaijan's
health sector. The project was also in line with the government reform strategy (a document
entitled "General Concept of Health Care Reorientation"1999). Before settling on the proposed
LIL project, various alternative types of project and the selection of the project components
were considered. During preparation of the project, lessons from other World Bank supported
projects in Azerbaijan have been taken into account in the conceptualization of the project.
Lessons from the design and implementation of health projects in the region were also
considered in the design of the project.

The national ownership of the project concept was demonstrated by the Task Force which had
been established for the design of the project comprised both MOH staff and also representatives
of external organizations (specifically WHO and UNICEF). The health reform process was in
line with poverty reduction activities, and specifically with the IPRSP/PRSP process. In this
context, there was potentially high value added from World Bank support. Economic, financial,
technical, institutional, social, environmental assessment and participatory analysis were also
done during the preparation. The project design recognized and took into account the critical
risks factors which could affect project implementation. Overall, the project was viewed as being
of high risk. The most important risks relate to the extent of borrower commitment to carrying
out the project in a transparent manner and the weak institutional capacity of the MOH. Many of
the staff in the MOH were definitely committed to collaborating with the World Bank and there
was some genuine support for a project; but this was the first such project in the health sector in
Azerbaijan and its implementation clearly faced substantial challenges. Mitigating strategies for
each of these risk factors were shown and put into place. The objectives were clearly stated,
important to the country's social development, and realistic in scale and scope.

Objectives

The project's achievement of its objectives and outputs is considered Satisfactory. The project
succeeded in achieving its specific objectives and laid a good basis for Azerbaijan in continuing
with health reforms and undertaking needed investments. The major outcomes and achievements
of the project according to the 5 indicators were as follows:

(i) Development by the Government of a midterm strategy for health reform, with World Bank
assistance. The HRP Midterm strategy was developed by Government in consultation with WB.
For this purpose HRP Mid-term Review Workshop was held in September 17-18, 2003 in Baku,
Azerbaijan. The aim of the workshops was to review progress of the HRP to date, reinforce the
basic concepts of reforms, and analyze and discuss major concerns at the district level. This
workshop served as both training to stimulate motivation and understanding of the reforms.
There were 45 participants from the pilot districts, PCU, WB and UNICEF participating in the


                                                45

workshop. The workshop was organized during the World Bank's mid-term review mission
(September 15-19, 2003). The mid-term review of the project implementation was carried out
with the purpose of doing a detailed evaluation and analysis of the project from the standpoint of
current priorities, results achieved and experience accumulated. Results of the mid-term
conference became a revised plan of further work on the project and a clarified list of specific
indicators of the project implementation and achievement of outlined goals and objectives.

(ii) Development and use by the district health authorities of district-specific annual work
/rationalization plans. Rationalization of district health care services was an integral part of the
Primary Health Care Reform Project. The first step was a structured, self-administered analysis
of the capacity and resources available in each intervention district to implement the intended
reforms. Needs assessment instruments were designed, based on those already used by UNICEF
in the existing districts where PHC reforms had been introduced, and a methodology developed
for its implementation. Orientation seminars were held in each district in July-August 2002 to
explain the nature of the anticipated reforms, and the methodology to be employed with the
needs assessment. District Chief Doctors took the lead with UNICEF in the needs assessment
process, with active participation of community members, local government, and other local
stakeholders. Development of needs assessment process included workshops in each district and
two three-day observational visits (September and November 2002) by teams of each district to
other districts where reforms had already been implemented to discuss options and seek solutions
to this difficult process.


Upon completion of the needs assessment, rationalization plans were drafted. These drafted
versions were discussed during another seminar held in each intervention district in Nov 2002 to
present findings and to discuss the same basic concepts of reform, as further material inputs to
each district based on the district-specific needs assessments. First two days of the seminar the
draft rationalization plans were discussed, during the third day the plans were reported to the
local community and wide stakeholders. The development of these plans was a joint effort
involving local health staff, community members, and other key local stakeholders.


After that process, rationalization plans had been reported by the District Chief Doctors at the
MOH Annual Review Meeting (Jan 2003). A number of comments and suggestions were made
by MOH officials during the meeting. Revised rationalization plans were under the consideration
of key MOH officials during one-day workshops, finalizing with the approval of "District
Rationalization Plans" in June 2003. District-specific rationalization plans emphasize the
following: (i) Decreasing the number of inpatient beds, inpatient facilities and personnel,(ii)
Establishing new services if there is a need, (iii) Increasing the number of primary health care
outpatient clinics; (iv) Re-orientation of services and personnel from specialized care toward
basic primary care, general practice and preventive medicine.


Rationalization plans were elaborated for Khachmaz, Salyan , Goychay, Shamkir, and Sharur. In
line with the overall design of the Component 2 of the project the completion of the
rationalization plans was a pre-requisite for further implementation of reforms in the districts and
for the refurbishment of facilities by the Ministry of Health. The completed rationalization plans
were finally reviewed by the Ministry of Health and the World Bank. Rationalization plans were
elaborated and approved by Ministry of Health. It should be noticed that plans were not designed
specifically oriented to the project objectives, such as beds reduction and redistribution of staff
according to a Primary Health Care oriented system. Rationalization plans have not progressed
according to the project time-table, due to the lack of the proper regulatory and policy tools


                                                  46

required for their implementation.


(iii) Development by the Government of a policy paper on improving health services and access
for the poor. A National Health Conference was held with the purpose of development by the
Government of a policy paper on improving health services and access for the poor. This
conference was held by the assistance of International consultant and WB. National Conference
presented the main findings of various studies that are being conducted as part of the health
sector review note. The conference was opened by the Minister of Health with high level
attendance from various government agencies and their field offices. The conference was well
attended by about 120 participants and the methodology that it followed was well received by
participants who actively contributed towards building a consensus on the system diagnostics and
on issues and options for health sector reform, a very crucial input for the sector note. The
Government has identified health as a high priority sector, and it continues to increase its
budgetary allocations as indicated by the MOF senior officials. In addition, there is new impetus
to revise the existing health insurance law which is being drafted by MOH and the State Social
Protection Fund. During the Conference, the main directions were identified with respect to
services provision, human resources, pharmaceuticals, health policy and planning and mandatory
health insurance.

The summary recommendation of the Conference is that key stakeholders should start up the
production of a clear national policy for health, to shape and drive health system reforms. As part
of it:

a. Presidential, prime ministerial and parliamentary nominees should be consulted and involved
signaling top level support of health sector reform. The Minister of Health and the MoH should
review and reaffirm their commitment to change, building a consensus internally and nominating
individuals to champion change.
b. A comprehensive coalition should be built involving actors from other ministries, relevant
government departments and districts, and ultimately drawing institutions and individuals into
the consultation process. The Ministry of Finance should be fully included in strategic thinking
and practical plans, and international agencies should also be engaged.
c. How the leadership of the overall initiative will work and who will lead on specific pieces of
work should be defined, specifying how governance will be developed in parallel, with emphasis
on creating the necessary information.
d. The Ministry of Health and international agencies need to do more to coordinate across
projects and initiatives in order to ensure that lessons are shared and that pilots and reforms
achieve the kind of critical mass that supports consistent and successful application of new
policies.
e. Policy proposals should be clearly communicated to a wider public with explicit statements
about the values and goals that will underpin health sector development.

(iv) Improvements in access, quality and utilization of primary health care services in the targeted
districts. The Baseline and Evaluation survey was carried out during the project life. Refer to
information based on Evaluation Survey in all the project districts, the patient satisfaction has
increased very significantly. On the contrary, in the control districts, the patient satisfaction has
decreased, except in Sabirabad, where there was a moderate increase. It is worthwhile to note that
Sabirabad had earlier project intervention from IMC and UNICEF.

According to the original structure of the project and based on the needs assessment, performed
at the beginning of the implementation process, a number of strategies to improve the
accessibility to essential primary health care were developed:


                                                 47

      Refurbishment of the facilities by MOH in consistency with the project strategies
         (rationalization).
      Establishment of financial & pharmaceutical sustainability mechanisms.
      Procurement of basic medical and lab equipment to selected facilities as well as to
         Central OPD & CDH.
      Procurement of cold chain equipment for targeted facilities & development of the
         capacity for maintenance.
      Promotion of "User-friendly" services to sensitize health personnel to policies enhancing
         the quality of treatment, and eventually promotion of "Patients' Rights", and education of
         the public to those rights.

There are two aspects of this list that remain as a non accomplished objective, the User-friendly
services approach and the sustainability for the essential drugs supply. As a result of that
unaccomplished goals most of HC큦 personnel does not know and not have a "User-Friendly"
attitude, there is no accessibility maps for the Health units, nor schedules analysis or patients
flow analysis and there is a lack of a Patient's Rights document.

Another finding in field춖ite visits is that there is no adequate referral system working, according
to international standards. An acceptable referral system should be based on a sounded analysis
of the resolutional capacity of the health facilities, the epidemiological profile of the population,
the time measuring and the accessibility of the main routes among these units. The second aspect
of an adequate referral system is the establishment of the follow up responsibility scheme, in
which the problem-solving capacity of PHC facilities is enhanced. The referral system currently
in use at the district level is based on the "Epicrisis Document", which is delivered to the patient
or relative along with a non-formal piece of paper with the name of the patient and the name of
the health facility and type of service. As mentioned before, new formats need to be designed and
implemented, personnel training in this matter is also needed.

(v) Increased knowledge among the staff in the MOH and the targeted districts about strategies
for strengthening and reforming primary health care services. The institutional capacity building
within the Ministry of Health has been accelerated through knowledge sharing and participation
in various learning activities, i.e., seminars, workshops, and conferences. Since the start of the
project in 2001, officials and staff from the national and local levels of the MOH and the targeted
districts have participated in many learning activities in family medicine, immunization, health
reform, and health financing.

Training programs were very useful for improving the knowledge and practice behavior of both
the district and rural health providers. To cover the rural health staff from each Rural PHC, 1-2
health practioners were invited for the training programs. From each CDH, 4-6 doctors attended
the training. During September 2003- September 2004, clinical in-service training programs were
conducted by MOH and UNICEF on the following topics: (1) Breastfeeding /BFHI, (2) Rational
Drug Use including Appropriate Use of Antibiotics, (3) Health Information System, (4) Malaria
Diagnosis and Treatment (Laboratory and Clinical Training), (5) Iodine Deficiency Disorder, (6)
Prevention of Substance Abuse, (7) Counseling Services for Health Staff, (8) Reproductive
Health and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and HIV/AIDS, (9) Health Information System, (10)
Health and Financial Management, (11) ARI/DD, (12) Computer Knowledge, (13) Prevention
and management of Cardiovascular Diseases, (14) Safe motherhood and Essential newborn Care,
(15) Management of the most Common health problem in PHC, (16) Hereditary Disease and
Counseling Service, (17) Zoonotic Diseases for HS and community, (18) Health Life Style, (19)
Emergency Management, (20) IMCI, (21) Family Practices, (22) Acute Flaccid Paralysis. No
such training programs were conducted before the project.


                                                  48

Each district had 1-2 trainings on the Training on Family practice topic and number of
participants varied from 12 to 30 heath providers, depending on the district. Unfortunately, not a
single Specialist Doctor has returned to family practice, envisaged under the project. Further
efforts should be directed on this crucial aspect. The descriptions in these learning activities are
enumerated in the a training monitoring recording system as part of the institutional memory.
The importance of the lessons to be learned from this project through proper documentation of
the experiences of the activities carried out under this project includes: (i) the quality of the
participation in terms of the relevance of the courses to the participants' responsibilities; (ii) the
usefulness of the participation as indicated in the proposed work plans of the participants after
their course attendance; and (iii) selection process of the candidates to ensure broadening
stakeholders involvement thereby strengthening support to the overall health reform process in
the country.

Components

Component A: Capacity Building for Health Policy Reform. Satisfactory
A.1 Analysis and Planning Development. Satisfactory
As discussed in Section 4.1, substantial progress was done during implementation of the HRP
2001-2005. Within the framework of this sub-component many learning activities have been
successfully carried out. Further increasing of capacity building is very important for health
reform process. It recommended:

a) Developing long term human resources police and plan and strengthening the personnel unit.
HR planning and management capacity needs to be developed, by means of a new approach to
demand-based planning, reflecting population needs at local level, involving all key stakeholders
and especially medical staff. The effort should be based on productivity and efficiency
considerations, with a project approach to short-term and long-term requirements (five to ten
years).
b) Curriculum review and licensing of health professionals. Accreditation and licensing of
medical staff needs to be improved by studying international models of regulation and role of
professional associations. The role and legal status of professional associations should be
reviewed prior to considerable changes in restructuring and delegation of authority.
c) Based on the health care needs for the population formal and in-service training of health
professionals should be conducted using highly qualified technical assistance.

A.2 Health Financing Reform. Satisfactory
This sub-component which includes studies and training on health financing has been put on hold
until after the conclusion of the health expenditure study (HES) under the IBTA-II Project. This
was based on the necessity to: (i) avoid any potential overlapping between the two projects; and
(ii) refocus the health financing study under the LIL project towards certain emerging needs of
the sector. In accordance with this plan, G&G Consulting was selected to conduct the health
expenditure study on May 28, 2003. A meeting was held with the G&G consulting about the
progress and scope of the study. In August 2004 the consulting team began working. The scope
of the work included the following: (i) design options for a basic package of publicly financed
care; (ii) develop mechanisms for regional equalization; (iii) undertake economic evaluation of
service rationalization plans in pilot regions; (iv) carry out a feasibility study of health insurance
implementation; (v) develop mechanisms of regulation to ensure access to medical care for the
vulnerable; and (vi) strengthen the capacity of financial planning, monitoring and evaluation of
health reforms amongst state administration and health managers. Within this scope the
consulting team was expected to carry out a household health expenditure and utilization survey,
a health facilities cost survey, qualitative interviews and other data collection.


                                                   49

A.3 Pharmaceutical Policy Development. Satisfactory
The assistance regarding development of framework for national drug formulary system was
provided. It included specific work with local experts, faculty members, health care managers
and expert committee members. In this process the National Therapeutic Committee has been
established; its activities have been approved by the decree of the Ministry of Health. This
committee has become the main partner in the development of project deliverables as a national
essential drug list, national drug formulary and standard treatment guidelines. The following
documents have been developed:
    - Essential Drug List;
    - Standard treatment guidelines on common diseases of esophagus, stomach and
        duodenum;
    - Standard treatment guideline on acute respiratory disease;
    - Standard treatment guidelines on diarrheas diseases;
    - Standard treatment guidelines on rational use of antibacterial;
    - Standard treatment guidelines on arterial hypertension; (together covering more than 30
        diseases)
    - National Drug Formulary;
    - Elaborated and systematized National Drug Register.
During discussions and workshop, it was understood that the alignment of the National Drug
Register is crucial for further development drug formulary system in Azerbaijan. It was agreed
with the Ministry of Health that full information from National Drug Register should be
accessible to the expert group. Also it was advised to the Ministry of Health that the way how the
National Drug Register has been managed has to be improved. This advice was accepted by the
Ministry of Health.

In cooperation with WHO-Europe project the pharmaceutical study was performed in July 2004.
The results of this study were presented during the workshop organized by the project for main
stakeholders in August, 2004. It was illustrative tool to convince the national partners that urgent
changes of prescribing practices of health care professionals are urgently needed in order to use
more rationally the scare resource for health care. During the workshop the formulary system as a
part of whole national drug policy was presented and discussed. Materials for further national
drug policy development and formulary system in CD format distributed to all participants.

Within process of technical assistance it was agreed that internationally recognized drug
classification (ATC/DDD) will be used for the National Drug Formulary and Standard Treatment
Guidelines instead of the old system. Special emphasis was made on the following principles:
        1) use of International Non-proprietary Names (INN) for pharmaceuticals;
        2) understanding of difference between INN and brand names;
        3) understanding of difference between generic drugs and brand products;
        4) application of rational drug use principles in prescribing at all level of health care.

A.4 Management Information System Development. Satisfactory
This component aimed at assisting the MOH with the development and implementation of an
integrated national HMIS, including the peripheral setup in project districts. During the meeting
held with the MOH and IBTA-II PCU Director on the previous agreement was agreed in
principle that for the sake of economies of scale and consistency all procurement of hardware and
software for the MOH had been carried out under the Health Reform Project and all Technical
Assistance under IBTA-II.

Component B. District Level Primary Health Care Reform. Satisfactory


                                                50

This Component with the exception of CW was carried out by UNICEF. Civil works were
undertaken by MOH to refurbish approximately 16 primary health care facilities (including a
Central District PHC Center) in each district to improve the access to the PHC services. This
was primarily to make the health services more attractive and conducive to better quality care. A
small amount of money was provided to each district to make basic repairs in the health centers
in accordance with the rationalization plan. In terms of procurement and other activities,
implementation of Component 2 of PHCR Project was successfully completed by UNICEF in
almost all planned activities. Drugs, Equipment, Training, Community Development activities,
Technical Assistance to the districts and other actions were developed within the Component 2
Framework and time table. Primary Health Care orientation to the Health Services in the five
selected districts is functioning, equipment are in place and functioning, supply is in place and
properly stored and controlled. Essential Drugs are in place in every PHC facility of the project
and is expended to the population in the correct manner (according to UNICEF IMCI protocols).

Component C: Project Coordination and Evaluation. Satisfactory.
Project management was handled smoothly and efficiently, both in terms of organization and
substance. All fiduciary responsibilities, audits, procurement processes and reporting obligations
were effectively managed. Specific requests for information or follow-up were handled quickly
and efficiently. The PCU played a major role in the successful organization of the National
Health Conference.

Overall coordination and evaluation of the project was assured by a PCU which was staffed by
project management as well as technical staff to support implementation planning of key project
activities. The PCU benefited from continuity in the Director position, proactive management
and an overall well qualified and committed group of management and technical staff. The PCU
interacted well with the technical personnel of UNICEF, the MOH and the districts authorities.

Under this Component the data collection for the impact evaluation study was completed and the
results were tabulated by the consultant who also had conducted the baseline study using the
same methodology and sampling scheme. This study covered the pilot and controlled districts
and data was generated based on: (i) a Household survey; (ii) Patient Satisfaction survey; (iii)
Clinical Services and Practice Style survey; and, (iv) Clinical Services and Practice Styles for
Maternity Ward of Central District Hospitals survey.

Institutional development impact
The project had substantial institutional development impact. At the national level, the project
significantly increased the capacity of the MOH to plan and manage the health system. Specific
attention was focused on health services rationalization planning and analysis. The project also
assisted the overall health sector reform and strengthened the national capacity for managing
three of the main systems in the healthcare system  Primary Healthcare, Health Financing,
Pharmaceutical Policy Reform. A policy paper on improving health services and access for the
poor was also written by the Government. At the local level, the project strengthened the local
government capacity to implement health reform by providing training in analyzing local health
services and planning for the restructuring of the health care in all regions of the country. The
completion of district rationalization plans is one of the major achievements. In addition, through
the various communications and public information campaigns financed or otherwise supported
through the project under Component 2, the people of Azerbaijan gained a better understanding
of health issues.

Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency. There were no major factors


                                                 51

outside of Government's control. However, it should be noted in a positive light that donor
coordination under the project was an example of good cooperation and coordination. The delay
on UNICEF contract was compensated through efforts during implementation of activities that
provided support to the reform process.

The original reasons for setting up RDFs were the high cost and unavailability of essential drugs
in the market. Since the start of the project, this situation has changed. A July 2003 UNICEF
study comparing various drug prices has shown that prices of UNICEF delivered essential drugs
are now nearly the identical to those of their equivalents in the market which are also widely
available in the market. UNICEF supplied tablets may be somewhat cheaper, but injections for
instance are more expensive. This has both reduced the urgency of establishing RDFs and
required a considerable rethinking of the plans to improve availability of and access to essential
drugs in rural areas.

Factors generally subject to government control. During the first two years of the project, there
were various delays in project implementation caused by factors within the control of the
Government. The weak institutional capacity of the MOH and poor understanding the objectives
of the health reform created difficulties during implementation of the project. For example, early
in the project implementation process (2001), there were MOF delays with review and approvals
of Blanket Application for Withdrawal for UNICEF Contract. The MOF took seven months to
review and approve the AW. It was decided to divide the total amount of Blanket Application of
Withdrawal which was equal to the total amount of UNICEF contract into three parts the amount
for the year 2002, 2003 and 2004.

There was delay and in procurement of Goods for MIS-sub-component. While the bidding was
completed in Summer 2004, the Ministry of Health decided to cancel the bid arguing that the
Technical Specifications (TS) would have to be revised.

The overall environment and political support for health care reforms especially health care
financing reforms was difficult throughout the life of the project. Overall commitment and
ownership of the reforms has varied quite a bit throughout the time of the project.

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control. The project benefited from strong and
committed leadership at the PCU throughout preparation and implementation. Continuity in
strong PCU leadership was an essential part of successful project implementation. Overall, the
PCU often also acted as a technical resource to support MOH in the planning and implementation
of reforms particularly should be noted the effort that the PCU staff has put in order to make
National Conference a success. For the most part, essential government decisions were made in a
timely fashion. Decisions were mostly met in a timely way through a concerted effort of the
MOH and MOF and other key government ministries. This was particularly evident toward the
end of the project relative to the rationalization plans and the Public Government Policy paper
development.

Proposed arrangements for future project operation
The Government has identified health as a high priority sector, and it continues to increase its
budgetary allocations as indicated by the MOF senior officials. There is new impetus to revise
the existing health insurance law which is being drafted by MOH and the State Social Protection
Fund. The Government is committed to build on achievements of the completed project and
continue to improve health sector. This commitment is demonstrated by the strategy developed
by the Government in December, 2004 on National Conference. A substantial number of health
sector and other MOH staff have been trained in the areas of strategic planning, health financing


                                                52

and management. Health rationalization plans were developed. A wide variety of primary health
care professionals have been trained, accredited and certified. New guidelines and procedures
have been developed. The low level of public financing for health care must be addressed if
support for the reform process is to be maintained, and public approval enhanced. The Bank has
discussed options with the Government of Azerbaijan for continued involvement to enhance the
sustainability and impact of the reform process. The sustainability of the changes in Primary
Health Care Services originated by the District level implementation is endangered by: a) the
limitations on resources allocations coming from national Budget for maintenance of equipment,
supply, and drugs and b) the current methodology for budgeting based on hospital beds instead of
Health Priorities and needs. Health reforms are continuing in Azerbaijan, including with the
support of the Bank. The IDA financed New Health Reform Project (HRP) outline was
developed. The development objective of the proposed new project is to improve governance of
the health sector and enhance access to primary and secondary healthcare.

Bank Performance
During phases of identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project the Bank's performance
has shown to be satisfactory. The content and design of the project related directly to the main
priorities of the World Bank's Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) Sector Strategy. The
project was in line with the government's development priorities and strategies in the health
sector, especially poverty reduction activities, and specifically with the IPRSP/PRSP process
which is now underway. In this context, there was potentially high value added from World
Bank support. The project was also consistent with the objectives of the Bank's country
assistance strategy. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of
project design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and
institutional, including procurement and financial management. In addition, during the appraisal,
the Bank assessed the project's risks, benefits and identified risk mitigation measures. The Bank
was also right in identifying successful implementation of health reform pilots as key to
furthering the implementation of these reforms in other districts. It should be noted that the Bank
had a constant good working relationship with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.
Extensive stakeholder consultation was highly productive, and initiated a process of ownership
that proved invaluable at the implementation stage.

Supervision of the HRP was satisfactory. Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated,
and the project was adequately supervised and closely monitored. During four years of project
implementation, there were many supervision missions. They typically lasted for 5 to 8 working
days in the field which in normal circumstances is an appropriate duration for an effective
supervision. There was frequent consultation with the Ministry and other stakeholders impacted
by the project. The relationship between Bank and client was very productive. Supervision
reporting was mainly impact-oriented and dealt with those implementation issues that were likely
to affect implementation and outcomes. Review teams included specialists in public health,
information systems, financial management, operations, disbursement, and procurement. External
consultants were used for specific aspects of project components.

Aide-Memoires were regularly prepared and transmitted, flagging outstanding issues and
underscoring benchmarks for actions. These alerted the government and the implementing
agencies to problems with project execution and facilitated remedies in a timely manner, in
conformity with Bank procedures. The Project Status Reports (PSRs) realistically rated the
performance of the project both in terms of achievement of development objectives and project
implementation. Whenever delays in implementation occurred, the Bank's task team was able to
define concrete steps and timetable for putting the project back on track and pace. The Bank paid
sufficient attention to the project's likely development impact. The quality of advice, and the


                                                53

follow-up on agreed actions were adequate. Loan covenants and remedies were enforced
effectively.

With the decentralization of Bank functions to the Resident Mission in Azerbaijan, the Bank
could provide quick response and follow-up. The staff also showed flexibility in suggesting
needed modifications in implementation. They worked closely with the government and the
implementing agency, and provided them with extensive assistance including technical advice.

Borrower Performance
Although relatively low planning and research capacity in the Ministry of Health and in the
health sector in general prevented more active involvement of the MOH in the project
preparation and implementation the Borrower's performance in the preparation of the project was
satisfactory. The government officials and staff of the implementing agencies both at the central
and state levels worked closely with the Bank's project team on a continual basis, with full
cooperation Government commitment to the policy program and the project was demonstrated
through policy dialogue with the Bank. Key policies have been agreed on National Health
Conference.

The government implementation performance was satisfactory. Appropriate levels of review and
approval were usually in place; financial accountability and follow-up was observed, and
expenditures were duly authorized before they were incurred; and documentation was maintained
properly for periodic review. The project did not suffer from any counterpart funding problems,
as GOA took timely corrective measures and made appropriate budget provisions. Regular
reports and data on project management, procurement, disbursements, and financial status were
made available to the Bank. The audit reports were also duly provided. The Mid-term Review
(MTR) process was handled very smoothly, both in terms of the organization and the content.
Specific requests for information or follow-up were handled quickly and efficiently. The
government showed ownership of the project and good will and capacity to advance the
objectives. Project implementation was on track, and project objective was achieved.

The commitment to the project and its objectives by the implementing agencies was very strong.
The PCU was very well organized and effective in dealing with procurement, disbursement,
progress reports, and in maintaining proper records of the project. They were receptive to Bank
advice, and highly collaborative with respect to meeting demanding benchmarks and deadlines.
The PCU regularly updated the project procurement plans. The project management unit
gradually became more proficient at writing reference, providing technical specifications and
identifying vendors and firms, thereby easing the procurement process. The project financial
accounting was performed consistently and in accordance with International Accounting
Standards. PCU regularly prepared project financial plans and ensured execution of payments for
rendered goods and services.

Lessons Learned
     The HRP was the first IDA health project in Azerbaijan. From the learning point of view,
        most of what occurred was the raised individual awareness and knowledge related to
        health reform. Therefore, one important aspect of this project was to help the MOH,
        health authorities, principals and doctors to understand health policy change. In other
        words, central expectation related to this project was to learn about how to make the
        intended reforms alive at district and central level. More effort is needed up front in
        following critical areas: (a) strengthening MOH's capacity to fulfill its stewardship
        function; (b) improving access to quality health care services in pilot areas; (c)
        strengthening technical competence and improving geographic distribution of health


                                               54

  workforce; and (d) establishing Mandatory Health Insurance system.
 It was observed that plans for reform in Azerbaijan in general tended to have too wide
  objectives and no implementation strategy.
 Mandatory Health Insurance is one of the major steps that need to be taken in the nearest
  future.
 Bank supervision of health reform projects has to be clearly linked to ongoing policy
  dialogue in the country: The Bank is increasingly highlighting the importance of
  proactive, continuous and flexible supervision and linking project supervision to ongoing
  policy dialogue of the Bank. This is very important for complex health reform projects.
 It is important for the Bank to make the Borrower understand the value-added of the
  Bank's involvement in Azerbaijan, over and above financing a project.
 It is important to ensure that the working groups are adequately staffed and take primary
  responsibility for the technical content of the various project components.
 Project management staff should play supportive roles, with respect to procurement,
  financial and other management issues.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

This annex includes:

    (i)      the executive summary of the final consolidated report for Component 2 provided by
             UNICEF
    (ii)     comments received by UNICEF on the draft ICR.

UNICEF's report has been used as a background material for this ICR, while UNICEF's
comments have been reflected in the present version of the ICR.

Executive Summary
This is the final consolidated report of the District level Component of the Primary Health Care
Reform (PHCR) Project which was implemented from June 2002 to December 2004. UNICEF
has, with the Ministry of Health and the District Health authorities and communities,
implemented a number of strategic activities in the districts of Goychay, Salyan, Shamkir, Sharur
and Khachmaz under the World Bank financed PHCR project. These include capacity building
of managers and health staff, rationalizing health care services, implementing PHC models and
improving access to primary health care services.

During the project period, over 3000 district health personnel and community members were
trained in 23 different modules, over $825,000 of basic medical supplies and drugs were
distributed to the selected facilities, community participation was enhanced through
establishment of community health councils serving 45 communities, and promotion of health
information improved. These activities considerably improved access and quality of health
services in the five districts, according to the findings of the two external evaluations.

However, the sustainability of these gains was not assured. The project was intended to have a
significant impact on policy, as Azerbaijan attempts to reform its health system in order to
deliver better services at the primary level, and to emphasise efficiency and cost effectiveness.
One of the key elements of the project was the development and implementation of
rationalisation plans, by the project districts. These plans were to include a reduction in the
number of hospital beds, reorientation of staff from inpatient to outpatient services, establishment
of new services as per assessed needs in the pilot districts. However, although these plans were
developed, they were not implemented by the Ministry of Health, who remained cautious and
reluctant to conduct even modest rationalization.

The project ended on 31 December 2004 since the majority of planned activities envisaged had
been completed. This report summarizes the key activities and inputs, and impact of the PHCR
project. Total expenditures for the project were $2,500,044.99, which includes the UNICEF cost
recovery portion.

Summary of UNICEF comments
The report is quite balanced and gives good credit to UNICEF. However while the report
acknowledges that the project was necessary for the country and rates the MOH performance as
moderately satisfactory, it yet argues that the involvement of an external agency limited the in-
house capacity of the MOH and resulted in a lower level of project ownership. It might be worth
reflecting and analyzing, what would have happened if the MOH was responsible for both project
components and if the project, in this case, would have been rated as satisfactory. In addition,
some issues are raised about the rating of the PCU's performance as `highly satisfactory' as
compared to UNICEF's performance which is rated as `satisfactory' given the better ratings

Annex 10. Additional Annexes
10.1 Other Outcomes and Impacts

The Baseline and Evaluation Survey provided a wealth of information regarding outcomes of
project interventions other than the ones identified through the key project indicators. A great
number of these outcomes are related to maternal and child health given the emphasis put by the
project on the strengthening of primary health care services.

Below, we provide a brief overview of various outcomes for adult, maternal, child health and
other outcomes. This list is not exhaustive.

Adult Health
     Decrease in incidence of chronic and acute illnesses. The major causes of chronic and
acute illnesses in the project and control districts in 2002-2004 were cardio-vascular diseases,
respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, endocrine disorders, digestive and intestinal disorders,
and dental problems. Between 2002 and 2004, there was a decrease in the proportion of
individuals with chronic or acute illnesses from 18% to 15%. Such a trend is not observed in
control districts where the proportion of individuals with chronic or acute illnesses increased
from 18% in 2002 to 20% in 2004.
      Increase in utilization of rural facilities and outpatient urban facilities. The
improvement in the premises of rural health facilities due to civil works and drug availability led
to an increase of the number of patients that visited these facilities to seek care. In project
districts, 43% of all patients used rural facilities at the evaluation survey as compared to only
26% at the baseline survey. At the same time, there was a significant decline in self treatment
and no treatment rates between the two surveys. In urban areas, the proportion of patients who
visited outpatient units of the Central District Hospital increased (from 23% in 2002 to 29% in
2004), while the proportion of patients who visited inpatient units of the same facility decreased
(from 23% in 2002 to 20% in 2004). In pilots districts, by contrast, situation worsened during the
period 2002-2004 with a declining number of patients visiting rural facilities, and an increase of
the overall self treatment and no treatment rates (these trends are observed in all control districts
with the exception of Sabirabad, a prior intervention district for UNICEF and IMC).
     Slight improvement of referral system in rural facilities. Although a systematic referral
system in rural facilities does not exist in Azerbaijan, it is worth mentioning that in three out of
the five pilot districts (Salyan, Xachmaz, and Shamkir), there was an improvement in referral
rates which increased from 13% in 2002 to 26% in 2004. In the control districts, referral rates
decreased from 13% to 10% between the baseline and evaluation surveys.
     Improvements in diagnosis and treatment of common ailments. The proportion of
individuals seeking treatment for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peptic/gastric ulcer and
bronchial asthma has increased in project districts between the baseline and evaluation surveys.
Opposite trends in the treatment of the above mentioned illnesses are observed in control
districts.
     There were no significant changes in mortality rates in project and control districts
between the baseline and evaluation surveys.

Maternal health
     Decline in the proportion of pregnancies that led to a miscarriage or still-born birth
and increase in the proportion of babies born with a higher weight. In 2004 on average 1.2%
of pregnancies led to a miscarriage or still born birth as compared to 2% in 2002. Similarly, the
proportion of babies weighting less than 2.5 kilograms decreased from 38% in 2002 to 31% in
2004. Although these developments are positive, it is important to point out that the proportion
of babies weighting less than 2.5 kilograms is still considerably high in project districts. In


                                                 60

control districts during the same period the proportion of pregnancies that lead to a miscarriage or
still-born birth increased and the same applied on the proportion of under-weight babies. This
reflects the poor quality and gradual deterioration of maternal services in control districts.
     Decrease in the number of home deliveries. Home deliveries decreased from 53% of all
deliveries in 2002 to 28% in 2004 in project districts. At the same time, more urban residents
delivered in district hospitals, while more rural residents delivered in rural facilities. By contrast,
in control districts, home deliveries increased from 66% to 71% between 2002 and 2004.
     Improved information on birth control, but no significant change in the proportion of
individuals using birth control measures. Although in project districts there was an increase in
the proportion of respondents (from 41% to 49%) who reported that good information was
available on birth control between the baseline and evaluation surveys, there has been no
significant change in the proportion of individuals actually using birth control measures (38% at
baseline as compared to 40% at evaluation). In control districts, the proportion of respondents
who reported that good information was available on birth control decreased from 17% at
baseline to 14% at evaluation, while the proportion of individuals actually using birth control
increased slightly (21% in 2002 as compared to 23% in 2004). The most worrying fact is that in
both pilot and control districts, traditional medicines and abortions featured amongst the most
commonly used anti-contraception methods.

Child health
     Decrease in morbidity levels. The major causes of illness in children during the period
2002-2004 were: respiratory illnesses; traumas; accidents, and poisoning; ear, nose, and throat
infections; stomach, digestive and intestinal disorders; and dental problems. There has been a
decrease in the level of morbidity among children in pilot districts between 2002 and 2004. The
opposite trend was observed in control districts.
     Increase in utilization of rural facilities. In the project districts, at baseline only 1.8% of
children living in rural areas sought care in rural facilities (FAPs, SVAs, and SUBs). At
evaluation, this percentage had increased to 30%, showing the high level of satisfaction due to
better conditions at rural facilities and greater availability of drugs and equipment. By contrast, in
control districts, no one from the rural population took their children to rural facilities at
evaluation as compared to a very low 1.1% at baseline.
     Improvements in record keeping regarding malnourishment. At baseline there were no
proper malnourishment records in both project and control districts. By evaluation, project
districts had acquired a reasonably good recording and diagnosis system for malnourishment with
an overall malnourishment rate of 39% of all children, while no records were available in control
districts.
      Increased use of Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS). In project districts the use of ORS
increased from 7% of cases in 2002 to 25% in 2004. This was the result of training programs
that advocated the wider use of ORS in project districts. In control areas, on the contrary, the use
of ORS declined from 6% of cases in 2002 to 3% in 2004.
     There were no significant changes in breast feeding practices and use of iodized salt
for children in project and control districts between the baseline and evaluation
surveys.
      There were no significant changes in mortality rates among children in project and
control districts between the baseline and evaluation surveys.

 Other outcomes
      There were no significant differences in household expenditure on health in project
and control districts between the baseline and evaluation surveys. In control districts this
might imply a lower level of expenditure per visit/episode of care, given the increase in the
utilization of health care services between 2002 and 2004.
