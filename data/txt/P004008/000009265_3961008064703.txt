1. PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.1   Land and Population. The two provinces of West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) and
East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) cover a land area of about 68,000 sq.km, spanning the double
chain of islands extending eastward from Bali: on the north, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores
and Alor and on the south, Sumba and Timor. According to the 1990 Census, the total
population of NTB was 3.4 million and NTT 3.3 million, unevenly distributed among the
islands. Lombok with 500 inhabitants/sq.km has the highest population density
approximating Java, while East Sumba only has about 22 persons/sq.km. The population
of both provinces expanded in the 1980s: NTT 1.8 percent and NTB 2.15 percent per
year, compared to the national average growth rate of 2.0 percent per year during the
period. However, analysis of migration data indicate that NTT and NTB have recently
been losing population through out-migration. The population is predominantly rural: 83
percent in NTB and 89 percent in NTT. There is a high level of cultural diversity among
the inhabitants of Nusa Tenggara. In NTB the major ethnic and language groups are the
Sasaks of Lombok and the people of Sumbawa who lived under the Sultanates of
Sumbawa and Bima/Dompu with minority settlers from South Sulawesi, Buton and Bali.
In NTT, the main ethnic groups are the Timorese, descendants of several kingdoms on the
islands of Sumba and Flores, and the ethnic groups of the smaller islands, including Roti
and Savu. Geographical and ethnic fragmentation has tended to evolve different
agricultural technologies, suited to the ecological niches which they inhabit. Political
traditions also are fragmented, with some areas having a feudal system (Lombok and
Timor), others having absolute monarchies and slaveholding (Sumba), while others have a
more democratic clan or tribal organization whose nobility is to be "first among equals"
(Flores).
1.2   Nusa Tenggara is Poor. Among the twenty-seven provinces in Indonesia, NTT
has the lowest GRDP per capita (about Rp 400,000 p.a.) while NTB (Rp 450,000 p.a.)
ranks third from the lowest. The percentages of inhabitants below the poverty line are 23
percent for NTB and 24 percent for NTT placing both provinces significantly poorer than
the national average of 15 percent. In NTB some 63 percent of the population had
monthly levels of expenditures below Rp 20,000 and in NTT - 69 percent of the
population. The national average is 45 percent. Other welfare indicators show that:
(a)   NTB has the lowest life expectancy of all provinces of Indonesia while
NTT also is below the national average;
(b)   infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births in NTB of 145 is the highest in
the country, compared with 77 in NTT and the national average of 71;



-2 -
(c)   malnutrition rate is among the highest in Indonesia: the incidence of
moderate and severe protein energy malnutrition (PEM) in the rural areas
where most of the people live is about 16 percent; and
(d)   illiteracy rates in the rural areas of 48 percent in NTB and 24 percent in
NTT are significantly higher than in the urban areas and in Indonesia as a
whole.
Macroeconomic Background
1.3   GRDP Growth and Sectoral Distribution. Available data point to a widening
gap in income and welfare indicators between Indonesia's eastern islands and the rest of
the country, more especially Java.' GDP of both provinces has grown quite steadily over
the last decade: 6.8 percent in NTB and 5.2 percent in NTT from 1983 to 1991. This
compares to an average GDP growth rate of 6.6 percent for Indonesia and 7.4 percent for
Java. Over the period 1983-199 1, the structure of the regional economy has changed very
little. Although its share in GRDP decreased slightly in the two provinces, agriculture
remains the dominant sector in the two provinces contributing almost half of the regional
output. This is more than double the 20 percent average contribution of agriculture to
national GDP. In both provinces, agriculture was the major source of growth in the
economy with 43 percent and 36 percent of GRDP in NTB and NTT, respectively. Other
sectors with significant contributions to GRDP were trade hotel and restaurant-16 percent
for both NTB and NTT, and government services-1O percent and 13 percent, respectively
for NTB and NTT. Industry accounted for a relatively insignificant share of less than 3
percent of the regional economy in both provinces. The sectoral distribution of the labor
force shows the agricultural sector still as the dominant sector employing 81 percent of the
work force in NTT and 59 percent in NTB. Industry has contributed minimally to
provincial employment, with an average of 9 percent in NTB and 7 percent in NTT. A
striking characteristic of the labor force pattern in NTT is that only 14 percent is engaged
in trade and services compared to 32 percent in NTB and 36 percent in the whole country.
1.4   Exports. Direct foreign exports from NTB and NTT in 1991 amounted to
US$8.8 million and US$11.4 million, respectively. For NTB, fishery products comprised
two-thirds of the exports, i.e., US$6.0 million worth of pearls, seaweed, shrimp and sea
cucumber. Agricultural exports, primarily cashew and spices, amounted to US$1.7 million
and pumice stones about US$1.1 million. NTT's primary exports were US$6.7 million
worth of cocoa, cashew and vanilla, US$3.1 million of sandalwood, and US$1.4 million
of pearls, tuna, and fish oil. Exports accounted for less than 2 percent of total GDP in the
two provinces.

The Agricultural Sector
1.5   The 5.9 percent growth of the agricultural sector in NTB was almost double the
national average of 3.1 percent, while NTT's agricultural growth rate of 3.5 percent still
exceeded the national average. The food crop subsector made up the largest share of
regional agricultural GDP: 66 percent in NTB and 57 percent in NTT. The second most
important subsector was livestock, which accounted for 15 percent and 23 percent of
agriculture GRDP of NTB and NTT, respectively. Fisheries, the only other significant
subsector, contributed 11 and 9 percent to the agricultural economy in NTB and NTT,
respectively.
1.6   The food crop subsector in NTB grew at a rate of 5.4 percent during 1984-91, or
more than double the rate of growth of 2.6 percent achieved by the subsector in NTT.
The main food crop in NTB is paddy (240,000 ha), while in NTT maize is more widely
planted (200,000 ha) and paddy is the second most commonly planted crop (180,000 ha).
Production of legume food crops as cash crops (soybeans, mungbeans and peanuts), and
also that of red onions and garlic, has been increasing in economic importance, especially
in NTB. Harvesting of fruits from backyard gardens is common but in most areas not yet
commercialized.
1.7   During the period 1984 to 1991 the livestock subsectors of NTB and NTT grew at
an average annual rate of 5.4 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. Economically, cattle
are the most important large livestock in the region and ownership of cattle brings a high
level of status among the rural people. Nusa Tenggara supplies slaughter cattle to
Indonesia's urban centers and has also been a major source of breeding cattle for other
provinces. Ownership of cattle is concentrated among the higher income rural households
and extensive range management systems prevail in many areas. In NTT the cattle
population has been stagnating in recent years due to increased off-take of breeding cows
for development projects in other provinces, increased market demand for beef, and high
levels of calf mortality during the first year. Goats and chickens are widely owned in both
provinces. There now are some 250,000 goats in NTB and 450,000 in NTT. Several
LCOs are operating schemes to further expand goat keeping among the poorer segments
of the rural population. There are some 4.5 million chickens in each province. Chickens
are raised in the home gardens of almost every rural household. A typical farm family
owns approximately ten chickens which provide a significant portion of the family's annual
protein. Chickens can be maintained with a minimum of inputs, but they are subject to
Newcastle disease which periodically may cause death losses of up to 80 percent of the
flock in a village.
1.8   The estate crops subsector is relatively small in Nusa Tenggara and almost entirely
comprised of smallholder production. The subsector's contribution to agricultural GDRP
was 8 percent in NTB in 1991 and 10 percent in NTT. Coconut is by far the most widely
planted estate crop in both provinces (220,000 ha), followed by cashews (80,000 ha),



- 4 -
coffee (55,000 ha) and cocoa (17,500 ha). Cocoa from NTT is the leading export
commodity of the region (US$5.3 million in 1991) and cashew exports are now increasing
in importance.
1.9   The fisheries subsector plays a significant role in the provincial economy of both
provinces and in the nutrition of the coastal populations. In NTB, the fisheries subsector
achieved an average annual growth rate of 9.2 percent during 1984-199 1. In NTT, the
average annual growth rate reported during 1984-1991 was 9.4 percent. Export of fishery
products from both provinces was significant in 1991 with fishery exports from NTB
reported as US$6.1 million and from NTT as US$1.4 million. Pearls were the leading
fishery commodity exported from both provinces. Although at present the annual catch
from the coastal zone appears to be significantly below sustainable yields, there are high
rates of exploitation in the narrow coastal zone where fishing efforts are concentrated and
fishing practices are environmentally destructive.
1.10  About 90 percent of farm families cultivate rice and/or secondary crops, and about
40 percent keep livestock. About 9 percent of households are dependent on the fisheries
subsector. Net annual incomes are low, ranging from about Rp 300,000 for a 0.75 ha
dryland farm to Rp 1.0 million per household for a 0.5 ha of village irrigated farm. Where
feasible, farmers establish simple irrigation systems based on existing surface and
groundwater (springs) resources. Relatively few farmers practice conservation farming
and intensive husbandry techniques except in areas targeted by the Nusa Tenggara
Agricultural Support Services Project (Loan 2638-IND) and other development projects
implemented in the two provinces (see Chapter 2). Many farmers continue to practice
shifting cultivation among several dryland plots in order to reduce production losses from
declining soil fertility. Routine farm management operations such as pruning, fertilization
and replanting with selected seedlings are not widely practiced as yet. Off-farm
employment opportunities are limited.
Constraints to Agricultural Area Development
1.11  Natural and Physical Factors. The most binding constraint to the development
of Nusa Tenggara is environmental: limited arable land, poor soils, aridity, fragmentation,
and remoteness. Only 20 percent and 16 percent of the land area in NTB and NTT,
respectively, is cultivated, mainly through upland and shifting cultivation. NTT has the
largest area of erosion prone land of all provinces in Indonesia with about 1.75 million ha
while NTB has nearly 300,000 ha. Data on land use show the relatively large areas in both
provinces that are under brush/scrubs, grasslands, shifting cultivation and upland
agriculture. Forest cover is only 21 percent in NTT and 48 percent in NTB. Degradation
of upland areas is a serious environmental concern. The soils of the northern arc of islands
comprising Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores and Alor are mainly of volcanic origin and have
acidic to slightly alkaline soils. The southern arc composed of Sumba, Sawu, Roti and
Timor were mainly formned from uplifted marine floor or coralline islands with generally
alkaline and occasionally sodic soils. Both volcanic and coralline soils are porous and

prone to drought during the dry season. In addition, the climate of Nusa Tenggara is
harsh with some of the lowest rainfall amounts in the whole of Indonesia (as low as 500
mm in some coastal areas). The mountainous topography of the islands gives rise to a
diversity of mnicrocimates which affects crop production. Reliable rainfall is restricted to
the three months of December through February when over one-half of the annual
precipitation occurs. But even during these three months distribution can be uneven.
From the months of May to October, drought conditions frequently prevail which
sometimes result in food shortages. Conservation practices in the dryland farming
systems, through moisture retention during the dry season and erosion control during the
rains, are of critical importance to arrest resource degradation in the uplands.
1.12  Technology. In general, levels of productivity in the agricultural sector of Nusa
Tenggara are among the lowest in Indonesia. Almost all farmers rely on traditional
technologies to cultivate food crops for food security. The farming systems are
predominantly rainfed with extensive fallow periods due to the long dry seasons. Typical
yields for major food and estate crops are below the national averages due to climatic
disadvantages and also the absence of technology best suited to the conditions of the
region. In the case of cattle, improved intensive farmer management systems (provision of
improved legume fodder, drinking water, and improved veterinary services) could
significantly impact on growth of the livestock sector. In fisheries, future efforts are
required to promote research and extension on coastal marine culture of fish and seaweed.
1.13  Infrastructure. Transportation is a key constraint in remote regions such as Nusa
Tenggara. During the first long-term development period, the Government has given
special attention to this sector and considerable progress has been achieved in improving
infrastructure of the eastern islands. Among these, NTB has the largest percentage of
asphalted roads (60 percent) and NTT (23 percent) one of the lowest. In NTT there is
considerable scope to further improve local roads to provide all-weather access to more
areas. Within NTB and NTT, the less populated areas are generally those with less
developed village roads. Improvement of the network of local roads would reduce local
transport costs and improve the terms of trade for rural communities.
1.14 Policies and Incentives Affecting Investment and Trade. Indonesia has
recently been listed as one of five countries which had spectacular successes in agricultural
growth and rural poverty reduction based on favorable policies, strong development
institutions, and rapid technical change.2 Deregulation measures taken over the last decade
had a strongly positive effect on making the Indonesian economy more internationally
competitive at the national level. However, further reform of the trade and investment

regime in agriculture and agro-processing is necessary if Indonesia is to achieve the
agricultural growth targets that it has set itself in REPELITA VI.
1.15  A number of interventions exist at the regional and local levels in the trade of
agricultural products. Input supplies are provided by a mixture of private and public
sector sources, with few interventions. Often, interventions in agricultural product
markets are undertaken by provincial and kabupaten (district) level authorities in the belief
that government intervention is in the best interests of smallholders and local economies.
The restrictions tend to vary widely from one kabupaten to the other and can take several
forms, e.g. minimum prices, preference to cooperatives, marketing taxes, licensing
requirements, etc. These do not seem to have a major impact on trade. Furthermore,
Ministry of Home Affairs submitted an instruction to local authorities to refrain from
interventions affecting a number of key commercial crops (Keputusan Menteri Dalam
Negeri No. 48, 1984, amended by KEPMEN No. 29, 1986). The potentially most
stringent restrictions appear to exist in the livestock sector where the central government
uses a quota system to regulate inter-island movements of slaughter animals and breeding
cattle. The indications are that inspite of the resultant distortions, cattle raising is
profitable, given the interest and extent of the livestock business in NTT. The Bank has
initiated a dialogue on this issue with the Department of Livestock at the central
government level. Similar to the restrictions, local authorities can also levy taxes or
retributions on agricultural products for purposes of raising revenue. These levies in
general do not appear to be a major cost that would discourage local or inter-island trade
compared to transport costs. A more detailed discussion on policy and institutional
aspects of input and output markets in the province is provided in Annex 8.
1.16 Capital Constraint: Investments and Credit Availability. During the first
long-term development plan, the national budget was the largest single source of public
investments in the region. The greatest share of public investments in Nusa Tenggara has
been for the development of infrastructure and transportation. Although kabupaten
development funding has been increasing in recent years, average development
expenditures for agriculture and irrigafion amounted to only 3.2 percent of the total.
Domestic and foreign private investments on a per capita basis were lower in two
provinces than in other major regions of Indonesia. The value of foreign and domestic
investment projects in the two provinces is less than 1.0 percent of the national total.
Foreign investments in the eastem provinces have been concentrated in copper and gold
mining in Irian Jaya, and nickel mining in South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi and
Maluku.
1.17 Banking and financial services contribute less than 2 percent of GRDP in Nusa
Tenggara. Most of the banking institutions are in Mataram and Kupang (the two
provincial capitals), but the rural areas are little served by the formal financial sector.

Agricultural Transformation, Challenges and Opportunities, September 1992).

Credit from informal moneylenders and relatives is widely available in the rural areas, but
this is used mostly for consumption purposes. As development programs and projects are
being decentralized, it becomes increasingly necessary to explore the prospects for
alternative forms of credit for farmers, herders and fishers, through formal or informal
systems. The ICR for the now completed NTASP concluded that in kind revolving credit
systems have the potential to reach beneficiaries effectively, and in some instances are
more attractive alternatives to smallholder credit than through financial intermediaries.4
Recent experience with informal revolving funds for annual farm inputs (seeds, fertilizers,
etc.) in Bank-financed upland and swamps development projects has been encouraging.
Training of community development facilitators in alternative farmer credit arrangements
has a high priority.
1.18  Institutions. Government services (defense and public administration) is the
second most important sector in NTT, contributing 16 percent of GRDP in 1991, and
third in NTB with a 10 percent share of GRDP. The levels of staffing of local government
agencies at both the provincial and kabupaten levels are sufficient. Within each agency
there is a nucleus of academically qualified specialists. However, agency staff in the
region tend to have low civil service ranks, limited experience, and are not accustomed to
taking initiative in planning and targeting development activities. The main problems cited
by the BAPPEDAs in planning for development in their provinces include the following:
(a)   limited staff capacity to carry out and coordinate systematic and
comprehensive development planning;
(b)   limitations in data base and survey information on the provinces' human
and physical resources and limited budgets to carry out the necessary
surveys; and
(c)   inadequate funds for training and operations.
1.19  Similar problems are evident at the kabupaten and kecamatan (sub-district) levels.
Dinas staff have had few opportunities for specialized short-term training. A large
segment of the staff of Dinas Food Crops Tk. II consists of extension workers (PPL). In
NTB, there are on average about 67 extension workers per kabupaten and in NTT only
33. Rural extension centers (REC) have not been well maintained and are not fully
utilized. The RECs were handed over in 1992 from the national level to the Dinas Tk. II.
All technical agencies suffer from lack of office facilities, field staff housing, training,
vehicles, field laboratories, extension equipment and materials.
1.20 In both NTB and NTT, there are a large numbers of local community
organizations (LCOs) based at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels. These LCOs are
usually organized by the community and religious leaders (Pesantren in NTB and Christian
4 Implenentation Completion Report for NTASP, June 1995.



institutions in NTT) and have broad memberships at the local level. The experience of
implementing rural development activities in cooperation with local LCOs under NTASP
and other projects has shown that they have the potential to increase the participation of
the community in the development activities. One notable characteristic in NTB and NTT
is the willingness of local governments to involve LCOs in their development activities.
This has considerably strengthened the cooperation between LCOs and local government
agencies to the benefit of the public.
Prospects for Development
1.21 Government's development objective for the eastern islands aims at arresting the
relative decline of some of the provinces vis-a-vis the rest of the country to increase social
equity and preserve unity.5 In the foreseeable future, agriculture will remain a key sector
in the strategy for the region's development, as spelled out in REPELITA VI. While
development of other sectors such as tourism is envisaged, agriculture is still the largest
single sector and employer. Broad-based income generation will therefore need to rely
first on agricultural intensification. The challenge is to raise subsistence production and
generate a marketable surplus in a more diversified and sustainable dryland farming
environment. While acknowledging that the agro-climatic environment is less favorable
than in many other areas of Indonesia, there still is a potential for agricultural growth in
Nusa Tenggara, provided that major constraints, such as poor access to public services,
limited diffusion of improved technology, inadequate infrastructure at the village and
kecamatan level, and at times restrictive government regulations, are addressed.
Improvement on these fronts will provide incentives for private on-farm investment, as
well as private investment in complementary economic activities, e.g. agro-processing and
exports.

2. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED
Bank Experience and Lessons Learned
2.1   The Bank has financed a series of relevant agricultural projects including the
Upland Agriculture and Conservation Project (Loan 2474-IND, 1985), the Yogyakarta
Upland Area Development Project (Loan 3305-IND, 1991), the Provincial Irrigated
Agricultural Development Project (Loan 3302-IND, 1991) and the Nusa Tenggara
Agricultural Support Project (NTASP, Loan 2638-IND, 1986). The latter project
covered the same two provinces as the proposed project and was successfully completed
in 1994. All four projects demonstrated the importance of (a) decentralized and flexible
planning and control; (b) timely input delivery; (c) opportunistic water resources
development for crops and livestock; (d) complementary inputs and adoption packages;
(e) research in dryland farming systems; and (f) revolving credit/repayment-in-kind
approaches to adoption of improved farm practices. Other donors assisting Nusa
Tenggara development projects include CARE, CIDA, USAID, AusAID, ADB, World
Neighbors, IFAD and UNDP. Ownership commitment from the local governments and
broad participation by the beneficiaries are the key requirements for the success of project
implementation.
2.2   The ICR for NTASP rated the overall outcome and achievements of the project as
satisfactory, particularly when judged from the perspective of the operation being the first-
phase of a long-term program for the development of an area where a poor natural
resource base, harsh agro-ecological conditions, and deficient institutions and
infrastructure act as major constraints to agricultural development. Instituting a process
of addressing these constraints in a systematic way was perhaps the most important overall
outcome of the project.' The project directly benefited some 100,000 rural households,
most of them in the lowest income group, and increased their incomes by 25-50 percent
depending on the nature of support received.
2.3   Specific lessons from NTASP are:
(a)   broad-based development needs of areas characterized by serious physical,
institutional and infrastructural constraints will require a wide range of
interventions to initiate development of such areas;
(b)   program planning and implementation should be decentralized to the level
closest to the potential beneficiaries, but with clear administrative, technical
and operational linkages between the different tiers of government;
6 Implementation Completion Report for the Nusa Tenggara Agricultural Support Project, Loan 2638-IND, June
1995.



- 10-
(c)    a participation strategy should be formulated early in the project cycle to
ensure community and beneficiary participation in planning and
implementation;
(d)   block financial allocations for local level development are attractive due to
their flexibility and demand responsiveness, but they should be backed by
appropriate guidelines and mechanisms for establishing clear objectives,
priorities, and rationale for any proposed development initiative;
(e)   investments in technology generation, as well as for addressing key
infrastructure bottlenecks should be programmed early in the project
implementation period;
(f)    development of agro-ecologically and socio-economically complex areas
should be approached as a long-term program requiring a succession of
interventions, building on the experiences and lessons of each preceding
operation; and
(g)   comprehensive and appropriately focused mid-term reviews should be used
for major mid-course corrections while routine M&E should continuously
focus on reviewing the rationale, technical and management soundness, and
likely development impact of all project activities.
The NTASP targeted particular kabupaten and contained a number of experimental
components, the more successful of which would be extended in the proposed project.
2.4    Worldwide, the Bank has assisted a large number of area development projects, 45
percent of them in Africa and 13 percent in the East Asia and Pacific Region. These
projects, however, fell in disfavor in the mid-1980s following the evaluated poor
performance of many earlier projects. In several countries, a series of projects had been
launched in quick succession, leaving little time for learning and applying lessons from
experience. Based on OED reviews and other sources', lessons include the following
prerequisites for success of area development projects:
(a)   clear government commitment to rural development objectives;
(b)   beneficiary participation as an essential feature of the identification,
planning and implementation process;
(c)   incentives in the form of potential benefits rural people may derive from a
public investment (e.g. a new road, a canal, etc.) which in turn may cause
7 Area Development Projects, Lessons and Practices, Operations Evaluation Department, September 1993.



the return on smallholder investments to be high enough to justify the risks
involved;
(d)   a realistic and flexible project design with goals that are specific and
monitorable, not too complex, and scheduled over a realistic
implementation period;
(e)   institutional capability of government agencies and others involved (e.g.
LCOs) to implement the program efficiently; and
(f)   proven technology and support services to provide the necessary
production growth.
Government Strategy
2.5   For reasons of social equity and regional balance, the Government of Indonesia
(GOI) has highlighted development in the eastern islands in the Second Long Term
Development Plan and in REPELITA VI. The Government strategy for the east
emphasizes human resource development through education and training, improving
accessibility through development of transportation and communication systems, and
integrated area development. Poverty alleviation through low-income group targeting and
improved distribution of income are stressed in the Second Long Term Development Plan
which features a 7.8 percent growth rate for NTB and 6.1 percent for NTT. The sectoral
emphasis contains five categories:
(a)   infrastructure, particularly transportation to regional growth centers such
as Mataram (NTB) and Kupang (NTT);
(b)   productivity gains in agriculture, food security, cultivation of export crops,
farming systems research, post harvest technology, private sector
investment and land titling;
(c)   mining through private sector investment;
(d)   agribusiness and small scale village processing of agricultural commodities,
facilitated by tax and credit incentives and relaxed regulations; and
(e)   eco-tourism along coastal areas financed by both the private and public
sectors.
2.6   The Government is promoting regional development through increased block
grants to local governments and specific local government grants for health facilities,
village schools and the new village-based poverty program (IDT - Inpres Desa
Tertinggal). The IDT Program, launched in April 1994, was targeted at over 20,000 poor



- 12 -
villages, providing each with US$10,000 equivalent of seed capital. The proposed project
will cover some IDT villages, but the modalities of program planning, implementation and
financing will be different. The proposed project is agriculture based while IDT funds can
be spent on any productive purpose agreed upon by the villagers. Community workers
will assist the villages in identifying sub-projects in both IDT and the proposed project, but
local government line agencies will be used more extensively under the proposed project.
2.7   The national budget has been the largest source of public investments in Nusa
Tenggara: about 68 percent of total development expenditures in NTB and 52 percent in
NTT in 1990/91. Infrastructure and transportation are usually the largest recipients of
national funds, about 53 percent and 48 percent of APBN funds for NTB and NTT,
respectively. In FY 1993/94, the APBN allocations for agriculture were 7.6 percent for
NTB and 8.6 percent for NTT. In the provincial and kabupaten development budgets
(APBD I and APBD II, respectively), transportation and tourism also have been the main
recipients. Total annual development expenditures from all sources of NTB in 1990/91
was estimated at about Rp 219 billion and for NTT Rp 277 billion. Annual investment in
agriculture from all budget sources is estimated at Rp 62 billion for NTB and Rp 64 billion
for NTT. Annual disbursement flow under the proposed project is estimated at about
US$6.8 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of the total development budget of the two
provinces and 12 percent of annual public investment in agriculture.
Bank Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.8   Given the dominant role of agriculture and the prevalence of poverty in the rural
areas of Nusa Tenggara, broad-based and participatory agricultural income generation,
within cost-effective and technological limits, should be the over-riding objective. The
Bank's agricultural development strategy for Nusa Tenggara is based on lessons learned
worldwide and in Indonesia:
(a)   farmers and fishers are the majority of the poor, hence targeting geographic
areas and production systems is more effective and broad-based than
targeting poor households in these provinces (except possibly for livestock
distribution);
(b)   income generation and economic growth should be the primary means of
poverty alleviation in Nusa Tenggara rather than targeted welfare
measures;
(c)   protecting the means of production in rural areas, such as erosion control,
preservation of livestock assets, and improved fisheries management is a
priority;
(d)   farmers consider water resources and livestock development as their
highest priorities;



- 13 -
(e)   new technologies should have low capital investment and low operational
costs and result in higher labor productivity and thereby reduce the
farmers' risk when adopting new crop varieties or production systems; and
(f)   implementation should be decentralized with more local control of design
and expenditure.
2.9   The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia8 supports the Government
in the following key areas: (a) maintaining growth with macro-economic stability; (b)
enhancing competitiveness; (c) reducing poverty; (d) enhancing human resource
development; and (e) managing resources sustainably. The proposed project reflects the
more decentralized region-specific approach that is now emerging and is consistent with
the Bank's assistance strategy basic approaches for poverty alleviation and
decentralization of development activities. The project has a poverty-reduction emphasis
and promotes sustainable food security while seeking out cash earning opportunities. In
recognition of the limits to growth in agriculture, especially given the poor factor
endowments of the two provinces and the need to protect the fragile ecosystems, efforts
will be made to strike an appropriate balance between improving subsistence consumption
and exploiting market opportunities. This strategy is consistent with the GOI approach to
agricultural development. The Bank's broad experience in the agriculture sector in
Indonesia, in particular its involvement with the recently completed NTASP, its sector
work (Eastern Island Rural Sector Strategy Study of 1994), and its complementary
lending program discussed below justify continued involvement in the Nusa Tenggara
agricultural development effort.
2.10  The proposed project complements ongoing Bank-financed infrastructure and
human resources development projects in the region. In particular, the Eastern Indonesia
Kabupaten Roads Project (Loan 3579-IND, 1993, US$155 million); the Water Supply and
Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project (Loan 3629-IND, 1993, US$80 million,
NTT and other areas); the Third Health Project (Loan 3042-IND, 1989, US$43.5 million,
NTB and other areas); and the Third Nutrition and Community Health Project (Loan
3550-IND, 1993, US$93.5 million, NTT) address basic human needs and improve
linkages between farms and markets. The Government's strong focus on infrastructure in
the region will also assist the strategy.
2.11   The Second Agricultural Research Management Project (ARM II, Loan 3886-
IND, 1995, US$63.0 million) will strengthen farming systems research throughout the
country through decentralized budgeting, local control and identifying and promoting
technologies appropriate to the local ecosystems. The ARM II Project and the proposed
project will both institutionalize the farming systems research begun under NTASP in
Kupang (Timor), Maumere (Flores) and Sandubaya (Lombok).

3. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.1   The proposed project is the second major intervention by a Bank-financed project
to support long-term agricultural development in two of Indonesia's poorest provinces. It
would build on experience gained under NTASP since 1986/87 and other programs which
have been irnplemented in the region. The project objectives are to raise smallholder
incomes, strengthen local level institutions andfoster broad- based participation at the
grassroots level. The project is part of Govermment's strategy to promote equitable
regional development
Project Areas
3.2   Target areas within the two Nusa Tenggara provinces have been identified by the
local government authorities in accordance with the following criteria:
(a)   high percentage of households below or near the poverty level;
(b)   significant potential for agricultural development;
(c)   potential for positive impact on environment through conservation farming;
(d)   existence of basic surface transportation infrastructure connecting target
areas with regional centers;
(e)    minimum level of government support services to support project
implementation; and
(f)   areas requiring special attention under the provincial and district
REPELITA VI plans and which have not received any funding from other
projects and programs.
3.3   In NTB, the project would target seven areas covering 23 kecamatan in six
kabupaten9 with a total land area of about 9,700 sq.km, or 48 percent of the total area of
the province. There are about 200 target villages of which 22 percent have been classified
as poor villages. Total population in the target area is estimated at 1.2 million (280,000
households), or 3 5 percent of the total population of the province. In NTT, there are ten
areas comprising 19 kecamatan in eight kabupaten' with a total land area of 11,595
9 Lonbok Barat, Lombok Tengah, Lombok Timur, Sumbawa, Dompu and Bima.
10 Belu, Kupang, Timor Tengah Utara, Sumba Timur, Sumba Barat, Manggarai, Ende and Flores Tinur.



- 15 -
sq.km, or 24 percent of the total area of the province and a population of 0.7 million
(125,000 households), or 21 percent of the total population. The areas contain about 310
villages of which 24 percent have been classified as poor villages. The target areas in
NTB are outside the central rice production areas in Lombok and Sumbawa which already
have benefited from considerable previous investments in irrigation and transportation
infrastructure. In NTT, ten areas outside the selected project target areas also have been
designated as priority areas for agricultural development during the next three years and
would be financed from the provincial budget.
Project Scope
3.4   The project would be implemented over a six-year period (1996-2002) and provide
funds to support the establishment of the Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agricultural
Technology (NAIAT), implementation of agriculture-based area development activities,
and strengthening of agricultural support services, project administration, and community-
based development planning.
Detailed Project Features
Component A: Establishment of the Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agricultural
Technology (NAIAT); Base Cost US$4.3 million (14 percent of total base cost).
3.5   The NTASP established the physical infrastructure, institutions and programs for
improving the technological base for agricultural development in the two provinces. It has
introduced a whole farm (farming systems) approach for improving smalUholder
production and income, and also identified and tested technological packages for some of
the arid and semi-arid areas of the two provinces. The proposed project would further
refine the technical parameters of these packages and evaluate more rigorously their
viability and acceptability among the farmers. Main lessons of NTASP were the need to:
(a) fully identify the constraints affecting the production of low-income farmers; and (b)
start with low input-low cost technology and build the confidence of the farmers step-by-
step (see Annex 1 for further details).
3.6   Building on the experience and lessons of NTASP, the proposed project would
support the Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD) in order to:
(a)   carry out research activities to develop technology packages appropriate to
the agro-ecological systems of Nusa Tenggara;
(b)   strengthen the linkages between agricultural research, agricultural
extension, local government authorities, local community organizations
(LCOs) and the private sector; and
(c)   transfer technology packages to area farmers.



- 16 -
Details are given in the following paragraphs and in Annex 1.
3.7    Establishment and Operation of the NAIAT. The project would:
(a)    establish for each province a Regional Advisory Comrnittee for policy and
management advice and a Regional Technical Working Group for
technical support;
(b)   develop a regional Research and Development (R&D) master plan, a
human resource development program, and an MIS program;
(c)   in NTT, construct a new liaison office at Kupang, a seed cold storage unit,
a drying floor and a soil preparation facility at Naibonat, and an irrigation
system for about 50 ha at the Livestock Research Station at Lili;
(d)   in NTB, convert part of the Mataram Installation of NAIAT to a liaison
office, and construct a general service laboratory building and three staff
houses at Mataram on Lombok;
(e)    provide furniture and equipment for the new installations, and computer
systems for Naibonat (Timor) main station and Maumere (Flores),
Sandubaya and Mataram (Lombok) installations;
(f)    provide nine vehicles and nine motorcycles for the main station and
installations and a boat for Maumere sub-basis;
(g)   provide journals, periodicals and textbooks to the libraries of the main
station and installations; and
(h)   provide funds for honoraria and allowances of research staff and operation
and maintenance of facilities.
3.8    Definition of Agro-Ecological Zones. The project would prepare additional
detailed studies of the agro-ecological zones (AEZ), based on existing data from
reconnaissance soil surveys and climatic information, combined with information on the
social, cultural and ethnic characteristics of the zones. Farning systems research and
diagnosis of the socio-economic context of the agro-ecosystems zones would include
rapid rural appraisal and participatory rural appraisal methods and gender analysis,
including environmental assessment and conservation technologies to identify input
constraints, allocation of resources and division of tasks and responsibilities within farm
households. It also would include a cattle marketing study to examine the impact of trade
restrictions on farmers' incomes (see also para. 6.9). The studies would be implemented
by research staff working with local provincial government staff, LCO members, and staff



- 17-
of local universities. The findings would form the basis for location-specific definition of
potential and constraints facing the farmers and would assist in the formulation of low
input technology packages.
3.9   Staff Resources Development, Technical Assistance and R&D Collaboration.
The project would provide:
(a)   local training within Indonesia for masters, doctorate and short-term non-
degree or diploma training to strengthen staff capability in specific skills to
effectively implement the R&D;
(b)   about 18 staff-months of expatriate and 66 staff-months of local technical
support for farming systems research, gender analysis studies and other
needs; and
(c)   R&D collaboration with international research centers, twinning
arrangement between NAIAT and one of these centers, and collaboration
with the private sector, local universities, and community organizations to
undertake topic surveys and field research.
3.10  Technology Generation and Dissemination. The project would support:
(a)   trials of improved and new technology, including production and post-
production systems involving women, under farmer and field station
conditions;
(b)   inputs and technical guidance for about 680 ha (280 ha in NTB and 400 ha
in NTT) of dryland field demonstrations;
(c)   dissemination of technology recommendations through organization of field
days, production of leaflets, posters, slides and videos, organization of
workshops and publication of research findings; and
(d)   travel, per diem and allowances for research and extension staff involved.
Component B: Agriculture-Based Area Development; Base Cost US$22.7 million
(73 percent of total base cost).
3.11  The project would support a program of agriculture-based area development
activities in the target areas. The approach would be participatory, based on an
assessment of the resources of each area and consultations with the people through a
community based planning system. A menu of potential agricultural development
activities for this component has been identified, including improved cropping in village



- 18 -
irrigation schemes, dryland farming systems development, cattle distribution, household
technology packages, and vaccination of chickens against Newcastle disease. In addition,
the project also would support the improvement of critical road sections, bridges and
culverts to improve communications between farms and markets. Finally, the project
would support as yet unidentified other development activities proposed by the local
communities. A summary of these activities, most of which have been well tested under
NTASP, is given below. Further details on some of the constraints encountered during
NTASP and proposed implementation arrangements for the proposed project, are
discussed in Annex 2.
3.12 Agricultural Development. This would include the following:
(a)   intensification of agricultural production systems in village irrigation
schemes where water control structures have been rehabilitated or
improved under NTASP, GOI's Village Irrigation Program (PID,
sometimes referred to as "crash program"), and the Asian Development
Bank financed Farmer-Managed Irrigation System Project (FMISP) in
NTB. The project would support the establishment of about 10
demonstration plots of about 0.5 ha each in some 265 schemes (165 in
NTB and 100 in NTT) to demonstrate the effects of improved crop
production technology;
(b)   a pilot program introducing improved dryland farming systems technology
and soil conservation techniques, including the provision of seedlings,
seeds, fertilizers, tools and equipment to about 16,800 farmers (9,200 in
NTB and 7,600 in NTT) covering some 12,600 ha;
(c)   introduction and demonstration of intensive smallholder livestock
management systems, integrated with dryland crop development, including
distribution of about 16,000 breeding cattle and 1,000 water buffaloes for
draft, and the development of forage crops;
(d)   vaccination of chickens in about 325 villages against Newcastle disease;
(e)   demonstrations of intensified house plot cultivation systems, including
provision of inputs, tools and equipment to about 2,800 households (1,200
in NTB and 1,600 in NTT); and
(f)   technical training for Dinas staff, extension workers, farmers and viliage
leaders on integrated animalcrop farming systems, post harvest
technology, village irrigation O&M, livestock feed and health, water supply
and sanitation, home gardens intensification, poultry vaccination, etc. and
also on the effective and gender-sensitive use of demonstrations of locally



- 19 -
adapted production technologies, in particular for integrated farming
systems, e.g. tree crops and livestock.
3.13  Lessons learned during NTASP (see para. 2.3) would be reflected in the
implementation arrangements for the present project. Special care would be taken to limit
the use of cash inputs for the crop/livestock farming systems for as long as the farmers'
capacity to pay or obtain credit is low. The farmers would be encouraged to organize
themselves in groups and to pool part of their savings for the joint procurement of inputs
(see also para. 4.6). More attention would also be given to the production of good quality
seedlings in Dinas Estates Tk. II operated nurseries and to the proper sequencing of
interventions to raise the survival prospects for tree crops and cattle. The bottom-up
planning process will be applied for all of Component B. Participation of women in
appropriate project activities would be encouraged. Training of Dinas staff and
participation of LCOs in the planning and implementation of activities will improve their
prospects for success.
3.14  Farm Access Roads. In order to reduce transportation bottlenecks the project
would support the construction of critical bridges, culverts, and road sections on farm-to-
market roads. Local government funding and community participation would be
mobilized to improve the surfacing for these access roads. Ideally, allocations for each
kabupaten and village should reflect their infrastructure needs. However, for simplicity
and transparency a maximum grant of US$250,000 equivalent per kecamatan is foreseen.
As there already exists a relatively dense road network in Lombok (NTB), no allocation
for farm access roads has been made for this island. Assurances have been obtained from
GOI during negotiations that: (a) allocations for road improvement would not exceed
US$250,000 equivalent for each kecamatan included in the project (except those on
Lombok); and (b) priority would be given to villages where needs are demonstrated to be
highest, the villagers are committed to actively contribute to the implementation of the
works, and local government has agreed to maintain the completed works.
3.15 Local Community Initiatives. The project would support local community
initiatives expected to result in direct benefits to the communities. During the first project
year local leaders and agency field staff would be trained in community based planning
methods. As part of the training program guidelines for selection and implementation of
schemes in Bahasa Indonesia would be prepared. Technically and economically feasible
initiatives considered to be a high priority by the local communities would be implemented
using discretionary supplemental project funding of Rp 50 million (about US$22,250)
annually for five years for each kecamatan. In addition, Rp 35 million (about US$15,500)
would be allocated annually for five years for each of the 14 targeted kabupaten to
support LCOs in developing community-based development initiatives.
3.16  Project supported local community initiatives are expected to include agriculture
based activities, such as post-harvest processing and storage facilities, domestic water
supply systems linked to the village irrigation schemes, goat or other small animal



- 20 -
distribution schemes, and replications for the core menu of activities proposed by
community groups in the target areas. Preference would be given to schemes that would
involve women and youth groups and those assisted by LCOs. Initiatives would only be
funded when the community is prepared to contribute locally available materials, unskilled
labor and land, if required. All proposals would be reviewed at the kabupaten level to
prioritize those with the greatest socio-economic impact, the lowest risk and the highest
proposed contribution by the local community. Initiatives would be selected in
accordance with criteria fully detailed in Annex 2, paras. 58 and 59. Assurances to this
effect have been obtained from GOI during negotiations.
Component C: Strengthening Agricultural Support Services and Project
Administration; Base Cost US$4.1 million (13 percent of total base cost).
3.17  Support services to crop cultivation, livestock keeping, project planning, financial
management, project coordination, and M&E at the provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan
level would be strengthened under the project.
3.18  Strengthening of Extension Facilities. The project would:
(a)   rehabilitate 18 rural extension centers (RECs) and 11 animal health centers
(Poskeswan), construct two new RECs and 11 new Poskeswan, and
improve 14 seed farms;
(b)   provide 46 vehicles and 256 motorcycles for field services of the Dinas;
and
(c)   provide 86 computers, furniture and equipment for the newly constructed,
rehabilitated and improved RECs, Poskeswan and seed farms.
Given the inadequate maintenance and utilization of facilities at present, project support
for rehabilitation, construction and improvement of RECs, Poskeswan and seed farms
would be dependent on the kabupaten level governments providing an integrated
management plan for each facility. Such a management plan would include: (a) staffing
levels; (b) estimates and sources of annual funding requirements to support successful
operation; (c) expected benefits to area farmers; and (d) planned types and levels of user
fees or other cost recovery systems, if applicable. An assurance to this effect has been
obtained from GOI during negotiations.
3.19 Training, Workshops and Seminars. The project would support: (a) project
orientation workshops and training of provincial, kabupaten and field level staff on
project management, M&E, financial management, and community-based development
planning and implementation; and (b) training of farmers and village leaders on
community-based development activities. The selection procedure should consider gender
perspectives to ensure participation of women in these programs.



- 21 -
3.20 Mapping. The project would support the production of base maps of the targeted
kecamatan to serve as a basis for improved planning, implementation, coordination, and
monitoring and evaluation of development activities.
3.21  Technical Assistance. The project would provide for:
(a)   about 212 staff-months of local consultancy support for various activities,
including: area development (42 staff-months), training (30 staff-months),
financial management/accountancy (108 staff-months), evaluation of
NTASP irrigation schemes (12 staff-months), and unspecified short-term
technical studies (20 staff-months); and
(b)   establishment of an M&E system, including an initial inventory of income
and production information, periodic reporting on financial and physical
progress, a mid-term review, and an evaluation of development impact at
project completion.
The reports' findings and recommendations should be issued in Bahasa Indonesia with a
summary in English. The consultants would be appointed by July 1, 1996.
3.22  Recurrent Costs. Incremental recurrent costs including honoraria, staff
alowances, operations and maintenance costs, project coordination and management, at
the provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan have been included in the cost of the project and
would be financed by the Bank on a declining scale.
Status of Preparation and Implementation Schedule
3.23  The project has been prepared by the Directorate General for Regional and Area
Development in the Department of Home Affairs with the assistance of consultants. The
preparation team interacted fully with the intended beneficiaries in all selected kabupaten.
A draft preparation report and Project Implementation Plan were issued in April 1995 and
formed the basis for the appraisal by the Bank. GOI submitted a revised Project
Implementation Plan in August 1995. The project implementation schedule is at Annex 7.

4. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Project Costs
4.1     Total project cost including contingencies is estimated at US$41.1 million of which
US$5.5 million would be foreign exchange and US$1.5 million duties and taxes. Base
costs are expressed in October 1995 values. Physical contingencies are estimated at 10
percent for civil works, equipment and vehicles and 5 percent for agricultural inputs,
breeding animals, mapping and research. Price contingencies are based on an estimated
annual local inflation rate of 6 percent and a foreign inflation rate of 2.6 percent from
FY96. Project costs are summarized in Table 4.1 below and detailed in Annex 4.

Financing Plan
4.2     The proposed Bank loan of US$27.0 million equivalent would finance about 66
percent of total project costs, or 72 percent of project cost exclusive of taxes, duties,
vehicles and fertilizers which would be purchased by GOI. The Government would
finance US$12.4 million equivalent (30 percent of project cost) and the balance of US$1.7
million equivalent (4 percent of project cost) would be financed by the beneficiaries
contributing their labor for tree crop planting and other community-based activities.

Financing of Proposed Development Activities
4.3    The project would help the farmers with the introduction of input packages for
food crops, tree crops and cattle keeping. Annual inputs for irrigated cropping
demonstrations, including farm tools, improved seeds and fertilizers, would be supplied for
one cropping cycle as grants to the participating farmers. This subsidy is justified as the
early adopters provide a demonstration effect for follower adopters. " The
demonstrations would cover about eight percent of the targeted area of selected village
irrigation schemes. The value of the input package would be about US$60 equivalent for
a 0.5 ha farm plot.
4.4   For dryland cropping the project would supply free-of-charge tree crop seedlings,
food crop seeds, farm tools, fertilizers and other required inputs to farmers participating in
the demonstration and replication programs. Demonstration program participants would
also be paid partially for their labor. Tree crops would be supported for two years under
both programs and annual crops for one year. The value of the support packages would
be about US$140 equivalent for dryland demonstrations on a plot of 0.75 ha, and US$90
equivalent for dryland replications. Given the higher risk of adopting new technology, and
the pilot nature of the dryland program, the subsidization of the present group of
beneficiaries is considered justified. For house plot cropping, arrangements would be
similar as for dryland cropping. The value of the support package would be about US$40
equivalent for a plot of 0.2 ha. The rationale for the subsidy is the sarne as for the
irrigated cropping technology packages.
1 In economic language: the early adopters confer an externality for follower adopters.



- 24 -
4.5   For cattle and buffalo raising the project would supply breeding stock to
successful participants of the irrigated and dryland crop improvement programs.
Participating farmers would promise to return within five years the second- and third-born
calves for redistribution among other interested farmers or for sale (usually the male
calves) to cover part of the operating cost of the livestock support services. An
assurance to this effect has been obtained from the Government during negotiations. The
estimated value of a heifer is about US$225.
4.6   Access to commercial credit for the purchase of farm inputs would not be open to
project farmers, especially not those located in the rainfed areas, in view of the early stage
of development of their small farms and the inherent risks of failure. Many farmers appear
to have access to informal credit from relatives, friends and traders, but often at
prohibitive costs. Promising experiments are currently underway under the Yogyakarta
Upland Area Development Project (Loan 3305-IND) and the Integrated Swamps
Development Project (Loan 3755-IND) with farmer-managed revolving fund schemes for
the joint purchase of inputs. Similar schemes would be tried out under the proposed
project. Community development facilitators would encourage the farmers to organize
themselves in informal groups before the project-financed input packages would be issued
to them. After the harvest they would deposit part of their cash income, in amounts at
least equal to the value of the inputs they received, into the group's revolving fund.
Authorized representatives of the gi oup would draw on the fund to pay for group
purchases of inputs for the following crop season. Each group would set its own rules of
operation. Over time, other farmers may either become members of already existing
groups, or, if the rules of the group do not permit adhesion of new members, form new
groups. As experience with grassroots credit schemes under this and other projects
evolves, the training of facilitators would be updated and new formats would be
introduced.
Procurement
4.7   General. Goods and works would be procured in accordance with the provisions
of the "Guidelines for the Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published by
the Bank in January 1995. Procurement under the project would be undertaken by the
respective implementing units under the guidance and control of provincial and/or national
parent agencies. Bulking and grouping of contracts across agencies or provinces would
not be practical and has therefore not been adopted. GOI would finance purchases of
vehicles and fertilizer (urea, TSP and KCL) from its own resources because under GOI
procurement rules these items are not open for international competitive bidding.
Procurement of vehicles would be in accordance with a schedule and timetable agreed
with the Bank. An assurance to this effect has been obtained from GOI during
negotiations.
4.8   Civil Works. Contracts for the construction and rehabilitation of agricultural
extension centers, seed farms and animal health posts (US$0.9 million), and agricultural



- 25 -
research facilities (US$0.4 million) are expected to be relatively small and would be widely
dispersed over the two provinces. They would therefore be procured by national
competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Roads, bridges and
culverts (US$8.0 million) would be constructed on force account with participation by the
villagers or by a procedure similar to national shopping for works costing less than
US$50,000 equivalent (para. 3.14). Under this procedure small works would be procured
under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from
three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation
would include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the
required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant
drawings, where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the
lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to
complete the contract successfully.
4.9   Equipment and Agricultural Inputs. Equipment, furniture and publications for
the new research, extension, seed production and animal health buildings and agricultural
equipment and tools (US$1.7 million) would be procured by NCB procedures acceptable
to the Bank, or by national shopping for packages costing less than US$50,000 equivalent
with an aggregate value not to exceed US$1.0 million. Agricultural inputs (US$1.8
rnillion) would be purchased by national shopping. Breeding animals (US$5.5 million)
would be procured by NCB procedures and using a model bid document acceptable to the
Bank.
4.10  Other Procurement. Consultant services (US$1.8 million) would be contracted
after inviting proposals from shortlisted firms acceptable to the Bank. Separate contracts
would be let by AARD and BANGDA, respectively, for consultants services for: (a)
establishment and operation of Naibonat AIAT; and (b) strengthening of agricultural
support services and project administration. All consultants would be selected in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines, and engaged according to the Bank's Standard
Form of Contract for Consultants' Services. Training, research, mapping, and survey and
design (US$2.8 million) would be procured in accordance with the above guidelines.
Procurement for activities listed under the "local community initiatives" sub-component
(US$7.4 million) would be in accordance with provisions of the above paragraphs.
4.11  Review of Procurement. The Bank would make a prior review of all documents
related to the award of: (a) all contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or more for civil
works, goods and breeding animals; (b) the first contract for civil works in NTB and in
NTT of less than US$100,000; (c) the first contract for goods in NTB and NTT of less
than US$100,000; and (d) all contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or more for
consultants' services by firms and all contracts of US$50,000 or more for consultants'
services by individuals. Due to the repetitive nature of small contracts, characteristic for
this type of project, prior review is expected to cover only about 50 percent by value of
all civil works construction, and supply of goods and breeding animals contracts. For
consultant contracts, the review would include terms of reference, shortlist, letter of



- 26 -
invitation, recommendation for award, and final contract. The exceptions to prior Bank
review of contracts for consultants' services would not apply to: (a) the terms of reference
for such contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a
critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the
employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or
more; or (e) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants raising
the contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or more. The Bank would review all other
procurement ex-post and at random.
4.12 The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3.
Disbursements
4.13  All activities under the project are expected to be completed by March 31, 2002,
and the Loan closing date would be September 30, 2002. Disbursements from the Loan
would be made for:
(a)   65 percent of expenditures on civil works;
(b)   100 percent of foreign expenditures (CIF) for directly imported equipment
and furniture, 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally
manufactured items, and 65 percent of expenditures on locally procured
items;
(c)   100 percent of expenditures for consultants' services and training;
(d)   90 percent of expenditures on agricultural inputs (except fertilizers),
breeding animals, labor for agricultural demonstrations, mapping, surveys
and designs, and research trials;
(e)   70 percent of expenditures for services, works, and equipment procured
under the "local community initiatives" sub-component; and
(f)   60 percent of incremental operating expenditures in FYI 996/97 and
FY1997/98, 50 percent in FY1998/99 and FY1999/2000, and 40 percent in
FY2000/01 and thereafter.
The proposed allocation of the loan is detailed in Annex 5, Table 2.
4.14  Disbursements under the project would be made against Statement of
Expenditures (SOE) for:

(a)   contracts for works, goods (including publications, agricultural inputs and
breeding animals) and consultant services by firms valued at less than
US$100,000;
(b)   contracts for consultant services by individuals of less than US$50,000; and
(c)   construction of roads, bridges and culverts, training, research, mapping,
survey and design, labor for crop demonstrations, other local community
initiatives, and incremental recurrent costs.
Disbursements from the Loan for the following contracts would be made against full
documentation: (a) works and goods contracts (including publications, agricultural inputs
and breeding animals) and consultant services by firms valued at or more than
US$100,000; and (b) consultant services contracts with individual consultants valued at
more than US$50,000. All other disbursements would be made against statements of
expenditures (SOE) for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible
project implementing agencies and the Directorate General of Budget (Ministry of
Finance) and be made available for inspection by Bank supervision mission.
Accounts and Audits
4.15 In order to facilitate disbursements, the Government would establish a Special
Account with an authorized allocation of US$1.5 million (equivalent to the average
disbursements during a four-month period) in Bank Indonesia, provided that the
authorized allocation would be limited to US$800,000 until the aggregate amount of
withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special
commitments would be equal to or exceed US$3.0 million. The Special Account would
be maintained by the Directorate General of Budget, MOF. All disbursements from the
Bank loan would be made through the Special Account. Replenishment applications to
the Special Account will be made on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the Special
Account balance has been used, whichever comes first.
4.16  Each project executing agency would establish and maintain adequate and separate
accounts from the beginning of project implementation, including accounts relating to the
cattle distribution program. To facilitate audit of project accounts, BANGDA (the project
lead agency) would collect and consolidate account records of all implementing agencies
into a single document. Assurances have been obtained from GOI during negotiations
that: (a) all project accounts, including schedules of expenditures claimed under SOE
procedures and usage of the Special Account, would be audited annually by the
Government Audit Agency (BPKP), or other suitably qualified auditors acceptable to the
Bank; and (b) audit reports of project accounts, SOE and Special Account would be
submitted to the Bank within nine months of the close of each Government fiscal year.

5. ORGANIZATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND
MONITORING
Organizational Structure
5.1   The proposed project would be implemented in a decentralized, multi-sectoral
approach with primary responsibility for project execution being placed at the kabupaten
and kecamatan levels. Organizational arrangements are shown in Chart 1. At the
national level, a Central Guidance Committee (CGC) would be established to provide
policy guidance and coordination, review project progress, and resolve issues on overall
loan administration. The CGC would be chaired by the Deputy V for Regional Affairs in
BAPPENAS and comprise, among others, the Director General Regional Development
(Ministry of Home Affairs), Director General of AARD, Heads of Bureaus for Agriculture
and Regional II (BAPPENAS), Director of Area Development (Ministry of Home
Affairs), and Director of Center for Agriculture Socio Economic Research (CASER) in
AARD. It would meet on a quarterly basis and invite representatives of other central
agencies and provincial authorities as appropriate. A National Project Secretariat would
be established in the Directorate of Area Development (PPW) of the MoHA with the
following mandate:
(a)   coordinate project planning and budgeting at the national and provincial
level;
(b)   review annual work plans and budgets and process the Decision Letter for
Budget Assistance (SPABP) for the provinces;
(c)   monitor and evaluate project implementation and impact;
(d)   prepare periodic project progress reports (annual/semi-annual);
(e)   implement national level activities such as project orientation workshops,
training for national staff on project management, recruitment of
consultants, etc.; and
(f)   liaise with the Bank, administer loan disbursements and consolidate project
accounts from the provinces.
5.2   At provincial level, a Provincial Coordination Committee (PCC) chaired by the
BAPPEDA I Chairman would be responsible for coordination, planning and M&E of
project activities. The PCC would be supported by a Provincial Project Secretariat (PPS)
headed by the Chief of the BAPPEDA Economic Division, which would perform similar
functions as the National Project Secretariat:



- 30 -
(a)   ensure province-wide coordination of all project activities;
(b)   review the kabupaten activities, annual work plans and budgets;
(c)   monitor and evaluate project implementation and prepare progress reports;
(d)   prepare loan disbursement applications for Components B and C;
(e)   carry out provincial level activities; and
(f)   liaise with central Government agencies, kabupaten, and the Bank.
Project Management Units would be established, and project managers (PIMPRO)
appointed, at the provincial level to manage: (a) planning, monitoring and evaluation;
(b) livestock distribution; and (c) training activities.
5.3   Consistent with arrangements adopted under the ARM HI project, the Naibonat
AIAT has established in each province a Regional Advisory Committee and a Regional
Technical Working Group to provide guidance for NAIAT during project implementation.
The Advisory Committee, chaired by the BAPPEDA Chairman and composed of the
KANWIL of the Ministry of Agriculture and representatives of the provincial Dinas,
universities, private sector and farmer groups, would review the annual R&D plan for the
province. The Technical Working Group is chaired by the NAIAT Director with
representation from various regional and provincial agencies. A Project Management Unit
(PMU) with a PIMPRO has been established at NAIAT, and a Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) with a Sub-project Manager (PIMBAGPRO) has been appointed at
Mataram/NTB. The PMU would be responsible for the implementation of all project
activities with oversight from the Director of CASER through the Director of NAIAT.
Officers would be designated at CASER and CARP (Center for Agricultural Research
Program) to liaise with the Project Secretariat and the Bank.
5.4   At kabupaten level, PMUs would be maintained at BAPPEDA II with a PIMPRO
to coordinate project planning/budgeting and implementation in the kabupaten. PIUs with
PIMPROs would be located at the respective Dinas Tk. II which would be responsible for
the implementation of the field activities. The PMUs would be responsible to the PPS
through the Bupati (head of kabupaten government). An assurance has been obtained
from Government at negotiations that a PMU with competent staff in adequate numbers
would be maintained in each participating kabupaten until completion of the project.
Implementation Arrangements
5.5   NAIAT would prepare the annual research plans and on-farm demonstration
prograns for Component A following internal AARD procedures. The plan would be



-31 -
reviewed by the Technical Working Groups. When approved by the Advisory
Committees, the work plan and budgets for the two provinces would be submitted to
CARP through CASER for DIP funding. The research results would be presented to the
Working Groups at seminars, also attended by other interested persons. The results of the
seminars would be used as feedback for the preparation of the next year's annual plan.
5.6   Trials and demonstrations would be carried out mostly in the farmers' fields.
NAIAT staff would design and select the sites for all trials and demonstrations and would
ensure adequate coverage of all project areas. Field staff of the respective Dinas Tk. II
and LCO staff on site would ensure the day-to-day management of the trials and
demonstrations.
5.7   In order to foster broad beneficiary participation, the project would use community
development facilitators (CDF) for Component B to motivate and assist the target groups.
The kabupaten level PMUs would encourage locally active LCOs to select CDFs for their
areas of operation. In areas without active LCOs existing Dinas staff would be assigned
for this purpose. The CDFs would help the target groups to:
(a)   identify their main constraints and priority needs;
(b)   select the most appropriate project intervention from the menu of choices;
(c)   prepare the project proposal for financing;
(d)   provide their equity contribution to the project;
(e)   decide on how best to implement the sub-project;
(f)   implement the sub-project; and
(g)   ensure monitoring, evaluation and mid-course correction of project
implementation, if necessary.
5.8   The community-based development approach would be adopted as much as
feasible and appropriate, in accordance with the "bottom-up" planning procedures
established by GOI since 1982, as follows:
(a)   the CDFs trained in community-based planning would inform the target
groups of beneficiaries on the menu of project activities;
(b)   the community groups, with the help of the CDFs, would determine their
priorities and prepare proposals for submission to the UDKP/kecamatan;



- 32 -
(c)   the UDKP/kecamatan would review the feasibility of the proposals, and
submit it to the PMU at kabupaten level for inclusion in the proposed
annual work plan and budget;
(d)   the groups' proposals would be evaluated based on soundness and other
criteria as agreed by PMU/kabupaten and the Dinas; preference would be
given to proposals involving women and youth groups and those assisted
by LCOs; the proposals would be ranked by priority if requests exceed the
funds available for the next fiscal year; and
(e)   upon approval, the group would implement the activities with the guidance
from the LCO and Dinas staff.
5.9   For Component C, training programs would be implemented by the National
Project Secretariat for the central level training, by the Provincial Project Secretariat at
BAPPEDA I for the training conducted at provincial level, and by PIUs at
PMU/BAPPEDA II for training to be conducted at kabupaten and field levels. The PlUs
will only manage the administration arrangements for the training, but the trainers would
come from the respective Technical Dinas Tk. I or II staff, existing training centers,
universities, research institutes/BPTP, and as appropriate, from the respective Unit, i.e.
Secretariat or PMU.
Budget Procedures
5.10 Project activities would be financed in accordance with existing GOI procedures
for financing Bank-assisted projects. Funds for project activities would be provided under
the budgets of the Ministries of Agriculture (Component A) and Home Affairs
(Components B and C) at the national level. Budget allocations for project activities
would be based on coordinated annual work programs agreed among project
implementation agencies and BAPPEDA at the provincial level. The budgeting process
under the proposed project would comprise the following steps:
(a)   the provincial BAPPEDAs would review the proposed work programs
proposed at local levels and referred to in para. 5.8 and prepare
coordinated provincial work plans and draft budgets;
(b)   the coordinated provincial work plans and draft budgets would be sent to
the National Project Secretariat for review and consolidation and thereafter
submitted to BAPPENAS, AARD and MoHA in August for incorporation
in their annual budget proposals;
(c)   the coordinated work plans and cost estimates would be forwarded to the
Bank by September 30 of each year for review; and



- 33 -
(d)   a coordinated budget proposal based on the agreed work plan would be
forwarded to the Bank before December 31 of each project year.
To ensure that adequate funds would be provided for planned project activities,
assurances have been obtained from GOI at negotiations that GOI would submit to the
Bank for its review and comments: (a) not later than September 30 each year, a
coordinated work program and cost estimates for the following fiscal year; and (b) by
December 31 each year, a coordinated budget proposal for the provincial work programs
agreed with the Bank.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.11   Given the scale of community-based activities and the decentralized structure and
system for managing the project, close monitoring of project activities is essential for
informing the higher management levels of any implementation problems and to permit
well-considered decisions on mid-course corrections. Evaluation of project impact is
equally important in order to learn lessons, positive and negative, for future projects.
5.12  The proposed M&E system would use different sets of instruments for the three
project components. In addition to the regular reports on financial and physical progress,
the proposed M&E system includes impact analysis for five project activities: village
irrigation, agricultural research, dryland farming, livestock distribution, and other local
community initiatives. .
5.13  The first level of monitoring reports would be from kabupaten level PIMPROs to
the Provincial Project Secretariat. These reports would be prepared monthly and used to
respond immediately to any problems encountered in implementing the project activity.
The second level of monitoring would be on the physical and financial progress of the
project through mandated reporting forms from the implementing agencies varying
according to the source of funding. The third level of monitoring would seek to provide
simple quantitative feedback on the performance of the five major activities of Component
B, listed in para. 5.12. Impact indicators would be included in the sub-project proposals
from the farmers or community groups, and updated yearly to provide a data base for
evaluating the financial, economic and social impact of project interventions on target
beneficiaries. The fourth and final method would be rapid appraisal monitoring. This
method is recommended as: (a) a means of direct interaction with the target population;
and (b) a useful management tool to achieve coordination among the implementing
agencies. Rapid appraisal should be conducted once a year at the kabupaten level with
representation from the kabupaten Dinas, kecamatan staff, and the provincial BAPPEDA
office.
5.14  The proposed evaluation system has been designed to evaluate project outcomes in
relation to the project objectives. A three tiered system would be used consisting of:



- 34 -
(a)   an initial inventory or data base on income and production information at
the provincial and kabupaten levels, building on the data gathered during
project preparation;
(b)   a mid-term review after two years of project life to review progress,
identify management and technical constraints, assess development impact
and recommend adjustments in project design, as appropriate; and
(c)   a final review at project completion to evaluate the direct impact of the
project on target groups and the effectiveness of the organizational
structure and management system used in the project, and to draw
conclusions for future projects.
5.15 Project performance would be measured by project component and activity and by
project objective. Performance indicators by project component and activity are given in
Table 5.1. Success indicators for achieving the project's main objectives are as follows:
(a)   raisefarmer incomes: estimates of farm incomes during the project
baseline year, after two years, and after five years;
(b)   strengthen local level institutions: aggregate numbers of facilities
improved or newly constructed and persons trained; and
(c)   foster broad- based participation at the grassroots: aggregate numbers of
LCOs and their members involved in planning and implementation of
project activities.
Bank Supervision
5.16 As the project is geographically dispersed and involves a number of components,
some of which are pilot in nature, the Bank should schedule supervision missions initially
twice a year, starting off with project launch workshops in the two provinces. A mid-term
review is planned for the fall of 1998. Assurances have been obtained from GOI during
negotiations that a mid-term report would be submitted to the Bank by September 30,
1998, for review and discussion with GOI by October 31, 1998 and that thereafter all
necessary measures would be taken to ensure the efficient completion of the project and
the achievements of its objectives based on the conclusions and recommendations of the
mid-term review report. If progress proves satisfactory, the frequency of supervision
missions may be reduced. The Bank would rely to the extent possible on the Bank's
Resident Mission staff (RSI) to provide continuous interaction with the central and local
project agencies. A supervision plan for the project is at Annex 7. It details the mix of
specialties and frequency and duration of missions needed to ensure adequate supervision
by the Bank. In addition, RSI would conduct ex-post reviews of works completed and
goods supplied at the rate of about two staff-weeks per year.

6. PROJECT BENEFITS, AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FARM INCOMES
Project Benefits
6.1   The project would raise smallholder incomes, promote equitable regional
development, encourage broad based participation in development, and strengthen local
level institutions in the two Nusa Tenggara provinces. The project, together with others,
would support and supplement GOI's ongoing efforts to improve the standards of living in
the country's eastern islands. The main benefits are categorized below (see Table 5.1 for
further details):
(a)   direct impact on target beneficiaies through increased agricultural
production and incomes and improved rural infrastructure, especially roads.
An estimated 75,000 households (or about 20 percent of the rural
households in the target areas) would directly benefit from participation in
some of the main interventions under Component B. After completion of
the project the number of beneficiaries would further increase due to
continued introduction of better production technology generated by
research (Component A), improvement of agricultural support services,
and redistribution of breeding cattle;
(b)   direct impact on local government institutions as some 1,000 civil
servants from the two provinces would receive short-term training and gain
practical experience from the project; and
(c)   improved capacity of local governments to plan and execute multi-
sectoral development programs using community-based planning systems.
This would allow local governments to plan better for future development,
improve future utilization of annual budget allocations and replicate the
experience of the project in other areas.
Agncultural Production
6.2   Farm Models. Estimates of incremental crop production have been based on two
farm models representing, respectively, (a) some 30,000 farms with an average size of 0.5
ha irrigated land served by a total of about 200 farmer-managed village irrigation systems,
and (b) about 17,600 farms with an average size of 0.75 ha rainfed land which are the
focus of the pilot component on dryland technology. It has further been assumed that
some 10 percent of the irrigated farms and 60 percent of the dryland farms would take up
livestock keeping under the project by acquiring breeding cattle. Also, some 2,800 farm
households are projected to increase the production from their home gardens. Obviously,



- 38 -
the selected farm models are simplifications of diverse situations existing in the field. Soil
and water conditions in the project areas and cultural preferences of the people are the
determinant factors in the choice of farming systems. The selected models obscure large
variations in climatic conditions and productive potentials in the two provinces and within
islands. Also, there will be large differences in the time periods farmers will need to adopt
improved cultivation practices, in some cases continuing beyond the project horizon and
necessitating the making of assumptions for the purpose of quantifying project benefits.
Any new option involving substantial cash outlays for inputs will require convincing
evidence of its attractiveness. Yet, the models capture the essentials of the prospects for
improving agriculture in Nusa Tenggara. Generally, a conservative stance has been
maintained for the projections of future production.
6.3   Improvements in Productivity. With regard to village imgaton the model
assumes that physical improvements to the schemes (diversion weirs, field canals, etc.)
already have been made, in particular under the recently completed NTASP, GOI's
ongoing Village Irrigation Improvement program, and the Asian Development Bank
supported Farmer-Managed Irrigation Sector project. As a result of those projects, water
supply in the affected schemes becomes more reliable and often more plentiful. This
would permit some increases in cropping intensity, on average from less than 100 percent
to 120 percent or more, through the introduction of a second irrigated rice crop in part of
the scheme areas, or the expansion of palawija crops such as soybeans. The present
project would follow up on the infrastructure improvements with field demonstrations and
extension of improved production practices (HYV seeds, fertilizers, etc). The
demonstrations are expected to result in modest additional increases of the crop yields for
paddy (from an estimated 3.5 ton to 4.0 ton/ha), soybeans (from 0.9 ton to 1.2 ton/ha),
and other palawija crops.
6.4   For d&yland crops the model assumes a cropping intensity of about 85 percent
without the project. The crops are mostly upland rice or maize, and beans (mungbeans,
soybeans, etc.). The project would give the farmers the means to diversify into
commercial tree crops (mainly cashew, cocoa and coffee), fodder/fuel trees, and grass.
They would also be encouraged to intensify food crop cultivation. The model assumes an
increase in cropping intensity to about 135 percent. This increase would occur gradually,
allowing sufficient time for the farmers to test the recommended new practices. Maize
yields would increase from 1.5 to about 2.5 ton/ha for farmers who would adopt the use
of hybrid seeds and application of basic fertilizer dosages (Model 2), but only about 1.6
ton/ha for those who would not (Model 1). Mungbean yields would increase by about 50
percent from 600 to 700 kg (Model 1) or 900 kg/ha (Model 2). Cashew trees would start
yielding 1 kg dry raw nuts/tree from year 6, increasing to about 7.5 kg nuts/tree by year 11
(Models I and 2); the average farmer would have about 25 trees.
6.5   The house plot crop model assumes a decrease in the cultivation of cassava and an
increase in the planting of mangoes, jackfruit, vanilla, ginger and lamtoro. Yields of food



- 39 -
crops (maize) are expected to increase by about 25 to 3 5 percent due to modest use of
cash inputs and better cultivation practices.
6.6   In livestock keeping, improved cattle feeding practices and better health care are
expected to (a) increase cattle birth rates from about 55 percent to 65 percent, and
(b) decrease mortality rates from 15 percent to 8 percent for animals under one year of
age and from 3 percent to 2 percent for animals over three years. Development of a
community based system to control Newcastle disease among village chickens would
reduce chicken mortality rates substantially. Water buffaloes distributed under the project
would help relieve draft power bottlenecks.
6.7   Incremental Production. The farm models referred to above indicate a direct
project induced incremental annual production at full development, equivalent to about
3,000 ton of paddy, 9,000 ton of maize, 4,500 ton of soybeans, 1,900 ton of mungbeans,
3,300 ton of raw cashew nuts, 140 ton of mangoes and jackfruits, 10 ton of vanilla, 35 ton
of ginger, and about 1,000 head of cattle (year 10). In reality the composition of the
incremental production is likely to be far more diverse. Part of the cashew nuts would be
substituted by cocoa or coffee, while some of the mungbeans and soybeans would be
replaced by other beans and groundnuts. The value of the incremental production at fiull
development would be equivalent to about US$6.0 million per year (for details see
Annex 1, Table 1).
Marketing
6.8   In the light of the experience under NTASP, marketing of the incremental
production generated by the proposed project is not expected to cause serious difficulties.
In the ICR for NTASP'2 no reference has been made to agricultural produce marketing
problems. Food crop markets are relatively free and competitive, except for rice sold at
government guaranteed prices. A large portion of the project induced food crop
production would be consumed by the producers themselves and other local people. The
prospects for selling tree crop products (cashews, cocoa, coffee, coconuts) are good.
Following the removal of a number of restrictions on exports of cocoa and coffee in 1990
and deregulation of copra marketing and processing, the markets for tree crops have
become very competitive, with farmers receiving remunerative prices and in the case of
export crops, a large share of FOB prices. The markets do not seem to be affected
significantly by local and provincial taxes on intra-regional movements of goods and
produce.
6.9    Cattle sales for slaughter and breeding are subject to quota for inter-island exports.
Although these and other restrictions depress the farmgate prices, cattle keeping still

appears to be viable both financially and economically (see para. 1.15 and Annex 8). A
study would be conducted during the first project year to examine the rationale and impact
of the current trade restrictions on farmers' incomes and to propose changes, where
appropriate. An assurance has been obtained from GOI during negotiations that by June
30, 1997 such study would be submitted to the Bank for review and comment.
6.10  The ICR for NTASP indicates that the full income potentials of the improvement
in irrigation facilities were not realized under NTASP in many instances, among others,
because of shortage and timely availability of good quality seeds. The proposed project
would support the production of quality seeds and seedlings by the Dinas seed farms and
nurseries, through civil works and equipment, as needed.
Farm Incomes
6.11  Net farm incomes are expected to increase as a result of improvements to the
irrigated and dryland cropping systems, cattle and poultry keeping, and intensified home
gardening - either separately or in combination with one and another. In general the core
project interventions would yield a substantial increase in net incomes when combined in a
whole farm approach.
6.12  Farm incomes for the two basic crop models are given in Table 6.1. The models
show, amongst others, that net income from 0.5 ha irrigated land would increase modestly
by about 15 percent to about US$530 equivalent when pre-project infrastructure
improvements are followed by better agricultural practices. Net incomes on 0.75 ha
dryland are expected to increase substantially from US$135 to about US$240 equivalent
at full development (year 10) with the recommended intensive cultivation of food and tree
crops, and to about US$290 equivalent if farmers would continue to use modest quantities
of fertilizers on their food crops. Net income per workday would increase modestly to
just over US$6 equivalent on irrigated land and to about US$3 on dryland farms. Further
details are given in Annex 1, Tables 2 and 3.

6.13  Farmers who keep cattle, in addition to practicing improved irrigated or dryland
cropping, would be able to supplement their net incomes. However, during the early years
cash returns from a project-supplied heifer would be irregular and far apart. Under GOI's
cattle distribution rules the farmers would be allowed to either keep or sell the first calf
(they probably would keep the females) but would have to return the second and third
calves. The first calf would be bom about two years after the arrival of the original heifer
and, if sold, be worth about US$150 equivalent one year later. Only from the sixth or
seventh year onwards would the cattle keepers be able to regularly sell (once per year with
some luck) descendants from the original heifer or her retained daughter(s). Animal
keepers other than those receiving breeding stock from the project also would benefit
because of the improvements to the animal health facilities, resulting in lower mortalities
and higher calving rates.
6.14 Net incomes from improved home gardening are expected to double from about
US$35 equivalent on a plot of 0.2 ha to about US$80 through the introduction of high
value crops such as fruit trees, vanilla and spices. The average number of work days in the
home garden would nearly double and the net income per day worked would increase
from about US$3 to nearly US$5 equivalent.

7. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND RISKS
Project Alternatives
7.1   Several design alternatives were considered during project preparation, as shown
below:
(a)   Project Scope. The original terms of reference for project preparation
covered five provinces in eastern Indonesia. Subsequently, the Bank and
GOI decided to design separate projects for two pairs of provinces, i.e. the
two Nusa Tenggaras and Central and S.E. Sulawesi, and drop the fifth
(Irian Jaya) in order to keep implementation and supervision arrangements
simple and manageable. For the same reason the project scope was
curtailed to agriculture and limited infrastructure development (roads),
excluding sectors such as health care and education;
(b)   Project Sub-components. Several proposed sub-components for
agricultural area development were dropped for various reasons. Land
titling was not included because on balance comprehensive national
coverage reflecting national priorities is preferred over fragmented regional
coverage. Goat distribution was dropped as a sub-component because
there already are a multitude of goat schemes proposed or under
implementation. Upgrading of village irrigation structures was deleted
after preappraisal because Government had just started a large-scale
Improvement of Village Irrigation Schemes Project (PID) and the Asian
Development Bank had agreed to finance a Farmer-Managed Irrigation
Sector Project. Fishponds were not included because they were not
successful under NTASP. Marine fisheries would have added complexity
while addressing only a restricted group of beneficiaries which would be
better served by a specialized project;
(c)   Planning Arrangements. The selected arrangements reflect current
insights and GOI policies on the roles of national, provincial and local
government entities. A perceptible shift is now underway from sector
operations, planned and implemented by central government agencies, to
more integrated development efforts planned and executed at the local
levels. The experience gained under NTASP and other recent projects
appears to confirm that chances of success for locally planned projects are
likely to be better; and



- 43 -
(d)   Implementation Arrangements. The NTASP experience confirmed the
importance of beneficiary participation in project implementation. Under
the proposed project the kabupaten Dinas would work closely together
with LCOs to further encourage beneficiary participation in the planning
and implementation of all area-based schemes.
Fiscal Implications and Cost Recovery
7.2   The proposed project's main component (B) would be implemented by the existing
provincial and kabupaten Dinas. The project would support the Dinas by training their
staff, procuring transport facilities and equipment, and paying staff honoraria and
allowances to facilitate effective implementation of all sub-components. None of these
support measures would have fiscal implications beyond the project implementation
period. Recruitment of new staff would be limited to a relatively small number of persons
to man the eleven newly constructed Poskeswan and two RECs. Construction would
proceed only after obtaining agreement from the kabupaten concerned to pay the O&M
costs of the facilities. In addition, assurances have been obtained from GOI during
negotiations that fees would be charged to the users of the Poskeswan (see para. 3.18).
The impact of the new facilities on the local governments' budgets is therefore expected to
be less than five percent of their total agriculture budgets.
7.3   Farmers would have some capacity to contribute to the implementation of sub-
components, such as roads and water infrastructure, usually in the form of labor. For the
irrigated cropping, dryland cropping and home plot improvements subcomponents, the
project would provide free inputs to early adopters. This subsidy would serve the purpose
of demonstrating the merits of the chosen technology to follower adopters who would
have to pay the full costs of the inputs. The research and extension components are by
and large public goods and are not practically amenable to direct cost recovery.
7.4   During the first few years after adopting improved crop production systems, the
emphasis would be on procurement of inputs required to sustain the adopted levels of
production. Farmers would be encouraged to join hands for the procurement and
financing of inputs by setting up informal revolving funds. Once such arrangements would
have been set up, more emphasis would be given to the recovery of all relevant production
costs from the farmers, either by imposing adequate user fees, or by turning over the
provision of services to the private sector. Progress should not be forced, however, and
sufficient time should be allowed for viable practices to develop.



- 44 -
Poverty Impact
7.5   The proposed project is targeted at the poorer sections of the Nusa Tenggara
provinces. Project activities would be planned on the basis of demands from, and in close
consultation with, the people. Estimates of the proposed project's quantifiable benefits
indicate substantial increases of incomes for dryland farmers from about US$135 to about
US$240 equivalent and a more modest 15 percent increase to about US$530 equivalent,
for irrigated farmers (for further details see Chapter 6 and Annex 2). In addition, the
project is likely to generate substantial, but as yet not quantifiable, benefits for the people
in the targeted areas, such as better road access and improved availability of farm produce
and farm inputs.
Economic Analysis
7.6   Treatment of Components. The project's Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was
estimated for Components B and C. For component A, agricultural research, the benefits
also would be significant but difficult to quantify. The impact of research would be long-
term in nature and would extend well beyond the project areas to the entire territories of
the two Nusa Tenggara provinces. Although calculating an ERR for the research
component would indeed be difficult, earlier analysts facing the same problem have found
it useful to relate research cost to the size of the agricultural sector in the concerned area.
For the two provinces the annual value of agricultural production, excluding forestry and
fisheries, is about US$800 million equivalent (1992). The project's research component
would cost about US$4.3 million over six years. This investment would generate an
economic rate of return of more than 50 percent if it were to prompt a one-time 0.25
percent increase in agricultural production (a conservative assumption) in the two
provinces from the third project year onwards.
7.7   No attempts were made to estimate separate ERRs for Components B and C or for
different productive sub-components because: (a) most components and sub-components
are complementary, for example cropping and cattle keeping; and (b) there are no clear-
cut ways to allocate the cost of supporting investments, e.g. road improvements, technical
assistance and training, among the separate productive activities. The cost of "other local
community initiatives" also have been excluded from the calculations because those
activities and their benefits have not been identified as yet. These costs represent about 30
percent of all area development investments, including road improvements, and about 40
percent excluding the roads. There is no reason to expect lower economic returns for
these activities than for the identified project components. Consequently, a conservative
25 percent of the overhead costs and supporting investments were excluded from the
calculations. A twenty-year time period has been assumed in the analysis.
7.8   Prices. In carrying out the analysis, the economic prices for rice, maize, soybeans,
and fertilizer were based on prices derived from World Bank international market



- 45 -
projections for these commodities, adjusted for east Indonesia transport costs. The
economic price of cashew was based on a recent FAO study which projected economic
farm gate prices for this commodity in the Nusa Tenggara provinces. The economic price
of mungbeans was equated with local market prices as production of this commodity in
the target areas is not import substituting. The economic price for cattle is not a
straightforward matter, as the preferred product in Indonesia is fresh meat, rather than
frozen, and thus imports cannot serve as an indicator. Local prices were used
conservatively, as these prices are lower than the (unknown) economic price. An
experiment with a 15 percent higher price had only a very small impact on the ERR. Most
project areas are not densely populated and economic wage levels are assumed to equal
the local market wage rates which are rather low. No discount factor for labor cost was
used in the base case. However, it was deemed useful to test the ERR's sensitivity to
changes in the wage rates (see para. 7.10). A list of financial and economic prices is at
Annex 6, Table 1.
7.9   Rate of Return. The ERR of the project has been estimated at 17 percent. A
summary of the cost and benefit streams is at Annex 6, Table 2.
7.10  Sensitivity Analysis. If some of the risks alluded to in para. 7.18 were to
materialize, the effect on the project's ERR would be as indicated below:
(a)   delay of benefits (but not of costs) due to institutional or technical
implementation problems:
(i)   by 1 year : ERR 13 percent; and
(ii)   by 2 years: ERR 10 percent
(b)   decrease in overall benefit levels due to overestimation of local
governments' capacity to provide adequate project follow-up support, or
because of climatic or other technical difficulties:
(i)   by 10 percent: ERR 13 percent; and
(ii)   by 20 percent: ERR 9 percent
(c)   decrease in benefit levels for the dryland crop component if a proportion of
the farmers would abandon the recommended new technology after two
years and revert to the traditional practices: percentage of dryland farmers
reverting:
(i)   fifty percent: ERR 13 percent; and
(ii)   seventy-five percent: ERR 11 percent



46 -
(d)    decrease in benefit levels for the livestock component resulting from a
slower reduction of mortality rates for 0-2 year old cattle due to climatic or
institutional constraints as follows:
(i)    0 - 1 year old calves mortality 11 percent instead of 8 percent; and
(ii)    1 - 2 year old heifers mortality 6 percent instead of 5 percent:
ERR 16 percent (slight decrease from 16.71 to 16.39 percent).
7.11   Another sensitivity test conducted concerns the price of labor. A case could
perhaps be made for lower than market opportunity costs for labor given the overall state
of poverty in the project areas and the lack of other productive opportunities. The effect
on the project's ERR would be relatively small: (a) a 1.4 percent increase if the
opportunity cost of labor were decreased from Rp 2,000 per day to Rp 1,500 per day; and
(b) a further 1.4 percent increase (to 19.5 percent) if the opportunity cost of labor would
be reduced to Rp 1,000 per day.
Environmental Impact Assessment
7.12   Environmental Screening. Proposed project interventions have been screened in
order to identify their impact on the environment. Main characteristics are summarized
below:
(a)    vilage irrigadon systems already have been physically upgraded before the
start of the proposed project, or are being improved simultaneously, under
separate arrangements outside the framework of the proposed project. Those
improvement works would entail construction of permanent weirs, intake
structures, and primary canals to improve the efficiency of water use by farrners
on existing paddy fields. As a result there would be a marginal expansion of
cultivated areas in some of the schemes. This would not involve land clearing
since, typically, land adjacent to the schemes already is used for rainfed
cropping. The proposed project's intervention in the schemes is limited to
demonstrations of improved cropping and livestock practices, including the use
of improved seeds, modest quantities of fertilizers, and small amounts of
pesticides;
(b)    drylandfarming actvities would be located in upland areas with slopes from 8
percent to 25 percent. Typically, these areas are used for shifting cultivation
and grazing, and, in the absence of conservation practices, may suffer from
surface erosion and deterioration of soil fertility through leaching of nutrients;



- 47 -
(c)   cattle ditibuon would be preceded by training of farmers on intensive
livestock management practices. The recipients would plant forage tree crops
and establish corrals;
(d) home garden improvements would be carried out within existing settlements;
(e)   farm to market roads would involve improvement of existing tracks, trails and
village roads. No new roads would be constructed; and
(f)    ullage water supply systems may be included under "other local community
initiatives" and would involve permanent spring captures, pipelines and public
hydrants to supply clean water to existing settlements.
7.13   The predicted environmental impact of the proposed project interventions on the
main components and sub-components of the environment has been classified into three
categories: (a) possible but minor, (b) minor to moderate, and (c) major. The impact
could be either negative or positive.
(a)   Impact on the Physical Environment
(i)    Soil and Land. Project activities involving the clearing of brush,
cultivation of grasslands, and improvement of farm access roads,
are potentially harmfuil, especially where slopes exceed 8 percent.
The negative impacts in the areas concerned are classified either as
"minor to moderate", or as "possible but minor". The project
would mitigate these negative impacts by provision of correct road
alignments, use of land preparation methods with minimum topsoil
disturbance, contour planting systems, and other conservation
farming methods. After following the directions outlined above, the
overall effect of the project would be positive as the land would be
stabilized following a period of degradation under the existing
farming systems;
(ii)    Hydrology. The establishment of conservation farming systems,
would reduce run-off and improve the soil: water regime. Water
would drain from the land more uniformly and stream levels should
become more stable. Land presently supporting Imperiata
Cylindrica or a mixture of low regrowth and shifting cultivation
would show the greatest benefits and minor positive impacts are
likely in the remaining areas. No dams or reservoirs would be
constructed. However, village irrigation improvements and village
water supply from spring capture systems may result in some
reductions in the flow of area streams due to increases in usage of
water for irrigation and domestic consumption; and



- 48 -
(iii)    Water Quality. The acidity, BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand),
COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and color of the stream waters
are unlikely to change significantly as a result of increased fertilizer
use or small scale processing activities for estate crops.
Conservation farming would lead to reduced run-off and lower
sediment levels. Raising of the levels of sanitation in rural
households and offices would have a positive environmental impact.
Therefore impacts on water quality are positive.
(b)   Impacts on the Biological Environment
(i)    Land Use. Typical land use in the project areas includes a mixture
of low brush regrowth, Imperiata Cylindrica grasslands, and
temporary arable plots as part of shifting cultivation systems. In
these circumstances land clearing at the scale envisaged is not
environmentally damaging. Heterogeneity of vegetation may be
reduced in some secondary growth areas, but the resultant negative
impact is classified only as "possible to minor",;
(ii)    Flora and Fauna. Animal and insect populations may be slightly
reduced in number and diversity. However, no rain forest would be
removed. The agricultural development areas no longer have their
original assembly of species and in some locations considerable
simplification already has occurred because of previous farming
activities. The overall environmental effect is considered to be
positive. The endangered flora and fauna in the targeted provinces
include:
Komodo (Veranus Komodoensis);
Duyung (Dugong-Dugong);
Kakatua (Cacatua Sulphurea Citrinocrictata);
Kuskus (Phaluger Sp.); and
Sandalwood (Santalum Album).
None of the project interventions are expected to have a negative impact on
these species directly or on their habitats, nor on existing mangrove, coral reef
or sea grass areas;
(c)   Impacts on the Social, Cultural and Economic Environment
(i)    Social Aspects. No serious social or cultural tensions have been
reported in the target areas. Project design provides for the direct
involvement of the local communities in planning and



- 49 -
implementation of project activities. It is not anticipated that any
induced socio-economic change would result in a significant
deterioration of current social values. Adoption of new technology
by the project participants would be on a voluntary basis; and
(ii)    Cultural Aspects. None of the target areas appear to include
locations of major monuments of archaeological significance.
Cultural habits and customs reflect a pattern of life that centers on
small scale farming activities. The project interventions would not
change this basic lifestyle, but aim to create a more sustainable
pattern of land use and provide technological options for
improvement of water supply, sanitation, grain storage, etc.
7.14 Environmental Mitigating Procedures. The environmental impact of the
project interventions is predominantly positive. Most negative impacts occur during the
physical construction period. The mitigating procedures recommended for potentially
environmentally negative project activities are summarized below:
(a)   Farm Road Construction. In steeply sloping areas roads would be
aligned so as to minimize erosion effects. Exposed land areas where heavy
run-off is expected, should be planted with cover crops;
(b)   Land Clearing. The scale of land clearing is small and would be carried
out only on individual farm plots where the existing vegetation is bush or
grass. Ground cover would be quickly re-established after clearing;
(c)   Tree Crop Planting. Low density tree plantings are recommended in all
areas in order to permit intercropping of food crops. The extension
services would encourage smallholders to intensify food crop cultivation in
areas which are best suited for sustained cropping;
(d)   Pest Control. Proposed pest control measures under the project are
consistent with the recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture. The
Government has agreed with the Bank to implement by August 1997 an
action plan for regulatory and environmental management of pesticides
(Integrated Pest Management Training Project, Loan 3586-IND).
Chemical control of wild pigs is not recommended as this may present a
threat to the people and other wildlife in the region;
(e)   Construction of Project Facilities. The facilities would only be constructed
on non-forest lands. Septic tanks would be constructed for all facilities to
dispose off waste water; and



- 50 -
(f)    Water Management. The potential impact of village irrigation and
potable water supply systems on surrounding areas would be examnined
carefully in consultation with all users to determine optimal levels of water
use and fair sharing arrangements in order to preclude potential conflicts.
7.15  Funding would be allocated for environmental monitoring for the duration of
project implementation. BAPPEDA Tk.I and Tk.II in each province would work closely
with the kabupaten Dinas concerned to monitor field activities posing potential risks to the
local environment.
Gender Aspects
7.16 Women in the rural areas of Nusa Tenggara play a central role in agricultural
activities, in addition to child rearing, cooking and other household tasks. Women also do
much of the work for food crop growing and in the family house plots. They are
frequently involved in harvesting, processing and marketing of estate crops. In addition,
women are normally responsible for small livestock (chickens and ducks), less involved
with goats and pigs (Nusa Tenggara Timur only) and not usually involved in the
husbandry of larger animals (cattle and water buffaloes). In all areas, women are reported
to be the treasurer of the household funds. Women play a significant role in agriculture
but have not received specialized training to enable them to work better and more
efficiently.
7.17 The characterization of Agro-ecological Zones to be conducted by NAIAT staff
during the first two project years (para. 3.8) would include investigations of gender
specific and non-gender specific activities. It would also include an analysis of priorities,
constraints, opportunities and potential for improving productivity of farming systems
within specific gender roles. Avoiding inequitable access to resources and preventing
inequitable transfers of labor are a special concern, particularly increases in the labor
burden of segments of the population that are already over-employed. On the other hand,
special efforts would be made to include women and other identified target groups in
mainstream activities through gender analysis training for research and extension staff and
the carrying out of gender analysis studies to identify technologies and agricultural
production systems targeted for women, involvement of women in on-farm trials, post-
harvest processing, technology testing, marketing studies, small enterprise development,
etc. Collaborative activities would be established with existing national and regional
women's organizations, including informal organizations, to identify opportunities for
increasing women's involvement in agricultural development activities consistent with
their active role in the agriculture sector. More opportunities to support and optimize
their important contribution and to enhance their economic status would be identified by
their increased involvement. Preference for selecting community development schemes
would be given to proposals involving women and youth groups. Participation of women
in the various project activities would be monitored in the M&E program.



- 51 -
Project Risks
7.18   Three risks have been identified and taken into consideration in project fornulation
and design:
(a)    Capacity of the Local Government Agencies. Sub-standard capabilities of
the local Dinas continues to be a risk, as under the previous project. According
to the ICR, NTASP strengthened the local, provincial and national level
institutions in their respective roles in planning, implementing, and coordinating
decentralized and multi-sectoral interventions. The ICR also noted that the
focus on implementation through the existing administration structure at the
provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan levels, and a systematic effort for using
the project area local community organizations, were important aspects of
project implernentation. Further strengthening of local institutions is needed
under the proposed project in order to avoid unnecessary implementation
delays and minimize the risk of poor performance. The project therefore
provides for training of agency staff and commnunity leaders, procurement of
field facilities, and employment of technical assistance for project
implementation. These support activities would be undertaken during the early
project years to provide a sound basis for planning and implementation of area
development activities. The volume, scale and complexity of project
interventions would be planned from year to year on the basis of a realistic
assessment of institutional capacities, both in the local Dinas and the
participating LCOs;
(b)    Organizational Structure. Institutional complexity of the proposed project
is another risk and may, together with weaknesses of local Dinas (referred to
above), cause implementation delays. This risk is reduced by assigning clear
responsibilites to the various agencies and by using the emisting organizational
structures, operational procedures (which may be improved under the project),
and coordination arrangements. Technical assistance would help improve the
project management during the early stages of implementation, and
(c)    Adverse Local Conditions. Extended seasonal droughts can cause severe
damage, imposing serious risks on project-supported crop and livestock
activities. Drought resistance would probably be the most important criterion
for successfully introducing improved crop husbandry practices. Proper
phasing of activities (emphasizing moisture retention) and providing good
planting materials and breeding stock, would be the key elements of farm
assistance packages geared to rinimizing the potential damage from droughts.
Related to the physical limitations is the occurrence of wide-spread poverty
among the rural population and their virtual inability to buy cash farm inputs.
A key lesson of NTASP, reflected in the design of the present project, is that



- 52 -
cash outlays for improved farning should be mnmized as much as possible,
especially in the early stages of development. Meanwhile, the project would
support the experimenting with revolving fund schemes, encouraging farmers
to jointly procure and finance farm inputs.



-53 -
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
Assurances
8.1   During negotiations assurances have been obtained from Government that:
(a)   for road improvement works:
(i)   allocations would not exceed US$250,000 equivalent for each
kecamatan included in the project (except those on Lombok), and
(ii)   priority would be given to villages where needs are demonstrated to
be highest, the villagers are committed to actively contribute to the
implementation of the works, and local government has agreed to
maintain the completed works (para. 3.14);
(b)   local community initiatives would be selected in accordance with criteria
detailed in Annex 2, paras. 58 and 59 (para. 3.16);
(c)   for rehabilitation, construction and improvement of RECs, Poskeswan and
seed farms, funding would be dependent on the kabupaten level
governments providing an integrated management plan for each facility.
Such a management plan would include:
(i)   staffing levels;
(ii)   estimates and sources of annual funding requirements to support
successful operation;
(ini)    expected benefits to area farmers; and
(iv)    planned types and levels of user fees or other cost recovery
systems, if applicable (para. 3.18);
(d)   beneficiaries of the cattle and buffalo distribution programs would return
the second and third born calves for redistribution among other interested
farmers or for sale to cover part of the operating costs of the livestock
support services (para. 4.5);
(e)   vehicles required for the project would be provided by GOI under a
schedule and timetable agreed with the Bank (para. 4.7);



- 54 -
(f)    Government and its agencies would comply with the reporting and auditing
requirements as specified in para. 4.16;
(g)   a PMU with competent staff in adequate numbers would be maintained in
each participating kabupaten until completion of the project (para. 5.4);
(h)   Government would submit to the Bank for its review and comments:
(i)   not later than September 30 each year, a coordinated work program
and cost estimates for the project for the following fiscal year; and
(ii)   by December 31 each year, a coordinated budget proposal for the
agreed provincial work programs (para. 5.10);
(i)    Government would submit to the Bank by September 30, 1998 a mid-term
review report for review and discussion with the Borrower by October 31,
1998, and thereafter take all necessary measures to ensure the efficient
completion of the project and the achievements of its objectives, based on
the conclusions and recommendations of the mid-term review report (para.
5.16); and
'i)    a study to examine the impact of current cattle trade restrictions on
farmers' incomes and to propose changes, where appropriate, would be
submitted to the Bank for review and comment by June 30, 1997 (para.
6.9).
Recommendation
8.2   Subject to the above agreements, the project would be suitable for a loan of
US$27.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia for 20 years, including a grace
period of five years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.

INDONESIA
NUSA TENGGARA AGRICULTURAL AREA
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agricultural Technology
Background
1.    The main body for agricultural research in Indonesia is the Agency for Agricultural
Research and Development (AARD) which was established by Presidential Decree in
1974. AARD is designated to coordinate, manage, and conduct agricultural research and
development throughout Indonesia through the direct management of sixteen research
institutes located throughout the country and through playing a coordinating role with a
further ten institutes conducting research on estate crops. To adapt to the changing
demands of the agricultural sector, AARD is being reorganized (1995 Ministerial
Decree). The objective is to: (a) improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of research
and development (R&D) through decentralization of services to the regions, and (b) focus
on specific agro-ecological zones (AEZ) and resource-based development generating
location-specific technologies. This also would help achieve a more balanced
development between regions. In addition, R&D activities would focus on market oriented
and demand driven technologies to serve the changing needs of both farmers and
consumers for higher quality and more diversified products.
2.    Within the regional framework, the strategy will aim to generate location specific
technologies using a farrning systems approach (FSR). This would be achieved by five
main related activities:
(a)   regional problem identification through better research-extension-farmer
linkages;
(b)   closer collaboration between research and extension to adapt, refine and
repackage technologies to meet local farmers needs;
(c)   technical demonstrations which would link researchers, extension workers
and farmers closer together;
(d)   organization of field days; and
(e)   production of materials and information which meet and recognize the
absorptive capacity and educational level of the farmers.



- 56 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 9
This departure from a previous strong sector based and centrally managed approach to
research would demand closer collaboration and coordination between research staff and
provincial government staff (particularly extension), members of the private sector
(including NGOs), as well as creating stronger links with regional universities (for specific
research topics and training).
3.    Action has been taken to reorient the mandates of 15 commodity research
institutes of which: five are involved with food crops; three in horticulture; three in
industrial crops; two in livestock; and three in fisheries. All of the substations of these
national research institutes will be fully integrated into the new Assessment Institutes for
Agricultural Technology (AIAT). At the regional level, 17 AIATs will be established
under the Center for Agricultural Socio-Economic Research (CASER). These AIATs will
be staffed by AARD research staff from existing research stations and substations already
deployed in the regions, existing personnel from the former Agricultural Information
Centers (which are all to be integrated in the AIATs) and AARD staff to be relocated to
the regions from the national research institutes. Each AIAT will have a Regional
Advisory Committee chaired by the head of MOA's regional coordinating office
(KANWIL) and co-chaired by the head of BAPPEDA with members drawn from various
Dinas, local universities, research institutes, farmer groups and the private sector. The
Regional Advisory Committee will guide the AIAT on the R&D program, priorities and
policies and will be assisted by Regional Technical Working Groups drawn from the
various agencies.
Bank Involvement in Agricultural Research
4.    Bank support to AARD began in 1975 with the Agricultural Research and
Extension Project (Loan 1179-IND) for US$21.5 million of which US$16.7 million was
for research. The project strengthened production oriented research programs for rice,
palawija crops, highland vegetables and rubber through provision of buildings, equipment,
training and technical assistance. Support to AARD continued with the National
Agricultural Research Project (Loan 1840/Cr. 1014-IND) for US$65.0 million which
placed more emphasis on crops other than rice (lowland vegetables, livestock, fisheries,
forestry and estate crops other than rubber). To address perceived deficiencies in
management and research planning, the Bank then supported the Agricultural Research
Management Project (ARM I, Loan 303 1-IND) for US$35.3 million which was designed
to strengthen research planning and management. In addition, AARD has received Bank
support for specific research components included in other projects (including NTASP),
particularly in transmigration, swamp and upland area development.
5.    In 1995 the Bank agreed to support the Second Agricultural Research
Management Project (ARM II, Loan 3886-IND), which has the overall objective of
strengthening regional research and development, ensuring location-specific technology,
emphasizing market oriented and client driven technology packages, and improving the
delivery of research recommendations to end users. The major focus will be on the phased
establishment and operation of a network of AIATs (in 12 provinces) in the new regional



- 57 -
ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 9
network of 17 AIATs. General support to cover all 17 AIATs will assist strengthening of
the regional management and planning capability and more specific program support will
be provided to eight individual AIATs. In addition, research management reforms will
continue to be implemented, a bottom-up planning and priority setting procedure will be
established, and Indonesian access to internationally generated technologies and germ
plasm would be strengthened through improved collaboration with national agencies and
international research centers. Total project cost is US$101.8 million of which the Bank
loan is US$63.0 million. The Project has commenced in June 1995 and will be
implemented over six years.
The NTASP Experience
6.    The research component of NTASP established a main research station at
Naibonat, close to Kupang on NTT, and two installations located at Maumere on Flores
and Sandubaya on Lombok. The program of work commenced with a study of farming
systems in NTT and NTB which was to provide the basis for applied farming systems
research and on-farm trials to define FSR technology packages. Subsequently, a program
of applied research was carried out and eight technology packages were defined. These
packages are: (a) technology package for rainfed paddy; (b) house plot technology; (c)
package for the critical land of Bobonaro clay; (d) dryland technology; (e) irrigated rice
production; (f) livestock improvement; (g) food crop technology; and (h) cotton based
technology.
7.    The establishment of the FSR base in NTT and NTB represented the first serious
attempt to develop a program of cross-sectoral farming systems research in the outer
islands of Indonesia. The program can claim success in identifying and, to a certain
extent, overcoming the considerable organization and management constraints associated
with this multi-disciplinary approach. This success is reflected in the ARM II project
which seeks to replicate the FSR methodology, pioneered under NTASP, in the 17 new
AIATs.
8.    Despite this qualified success, there were some serious weaknesses and limitations
in the FSR program completed under NTASP. These, and the lessons learned, can be
summarized as follows:
(a)   despite the setting of general objectives, there was from the outset a lack of
a clear definition of objectives, priorities and policies for research.
Constraints affecting low income farmer production in the region were not
fully identified and research programs failed to respond to these important
limiting factors. The establishment of linkages and the seeking of
assistance at an early stage of the project from an international body such
as ISNAR or an International Research Center (ICRISAT, CIMMYT,
IRRI, IITA) would have identified and reduced this risk;



- 58 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 9
(b)   comprehensive and representative baseline data were not collected prior to
commencement of the adaptive research activities and this prevented a
detailed analysis of existing farming systems. Although the low income
farmer was the target, the main factors limiting production at the
subsistence level were not responded to in a systematic manner. These
included farm inputs (tools, seeds, fertilizer and draft power),
environmental aspects (drought proneness, erratic rainfall and porous
soils), financial access (credit), and marketing outlets. In addition,
insufficient analysis was made of the social-anthropological factors which
limit the absorptive capacity and restrain the ability of low input farmers to
change farming practices throughout the eastern islands;
(c)   routine analysis of costs and benefits of existing farmer production systems
(particularly irrigation) was not carried out and a comparison with the
improved "with project" recommendations was not completed;
(d)   as a consequence of the lack of detailed definition of the agro-ecological
zones which characterize farming systems in the islands, suitable
technology packages which respond to these local differences were not
identified. The packages which were promoted were based on technology
developed elsewhere and imported to the eastern islands; the FSR therefore
acted more as a conduit for national research findings rather then
establishing its own technology. An example of this is the excessively high
average costs of inputs (Rp 1.17 million per hectare) for food crops in the
recommended packages. Given the low level of savings and incomes, the
absence of formal credit, the drought prone nature of the soils, and
dominance of food security as a prime objective of the subsistence farmers,
it is not surprising that the adoption rates were low and the packages
clearly were not sustainable. No attempt was made to start with low input-
low cost technology and build the confidence of the farmers on a step-by-
step basis;
(e)   although demonstrations were established in farmers fields, these were
implemented by research staff providing the high input packages on a grant
basis. There was little involvement of the extension (PPL) staff and
farmers. More impact would have been achieved if farmers and extension
staff were more involved in the planning and implementation of these
demonstrations and an element of cost recovery (such as provision of labor
by farmers) would have sharpened the impact. FSR activities cut across
four Dinas (food crops, estate crops, livestock and fisheries) and better
coordination and collaboration between FSR staff and Dinas staff would
have increased the relevance and impact of these demonstrations; and
(f)   the technical assistance support for the FSR of NTASP addressed mainly
sectoral issues (cotton, livestock and estate crops) and was not used



-  9-                           ANNEX 1
Page 5 of 9
effectively to assist FSR staff to define program priorities and develop
training schedules.
9.    The experience gained under the FSR program of NTASP will provide a good
starting point for further valuable adaptive research to be implemented by staff located at
the newly created Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agriculture Technology (NAIAT).
The problems and lessons learned from analysis of the NTASP experience will be
addressed in the proposed new project through a combination of the following:
(a)   the formulation of a regional research master plan (funded under ARM II)
and closer collaboration with national and international research bodies
would improve the definition of priorities and policies and ensure that
objectives are better met;
(b)   a more detailed definition of agro-ecological zones would aid the
identification of constraints facing regional farmers;
(c)   strengthening of social and economic inputs would improve quantification
of data and place more emphasis on the development of low input, location
specific technology; and
(d)   technical assistance would be focused to strengthen the management
capability of the FSR staff and to assist with local problem solving.
Proposed Developments
10.   The main objective of the research component would be to develop location-
specific technology in close participation with farmers and extension staff. The support by
the project would improve the capacity of the newly established NAIAT to carry out
applied farming systems research, it would strengthen management and planning
capability, facilitate technology transfer, and would strengthen R&D linkages with the
private sector, local government departments, local universities and, internationally, would
establish linkages with relevant international research centers. Agro-ecological zones
would be more closely defined and technology packages developed and refined to meet
the needs and aspirations of the low income farmers. Specifically, support would be
provided for: (a) establishment and operation of NAIAT; (b) definition of agro-ecological
zones; (c) staff resources development, technical assistance and R&D collaboration; and
(d) on-farm trials and demonstrations.
11.   Establishment and Operation of NAIAT. The ARM II project will provide
general support for all 17 of the AIATs and more specific support for eight of those (for
full details see the SAR for ARM II of April 1995). General support would include
common activities to: (a) develop a regional MIS network; (b) strengthen regional
research planning and management including priority setting, monitoring and evaluation,



- 60 -                           ANNEX 1
Page 6 of 9
and development of regional R&D master plans; (c) improve regional financial
management and administrative procedures, such as accounting, auditing and technical
audit; (d) improve research station management; and (e) provide support for the
implementation of the ARM II project. The eight AIATs receiving additional specific
support under ARM II do not include the Naibonat AIAT, as it would be supported under
the proposed project. Specific support would include construction of a new laison office
in Kupang on Timor (NTT) and a small laboratory at Mataram on Lombok (NTB). Also
at Mataram, part of the existing installation of NAIAT would be converted to a liaison
office. A seed cold storage unit and drying floor would be constructed at Naibonat (NTT)
and an irrigation system for about 50 ha installed at the Livestock Research Station
located at Lili (near Kupang) on NTT. New staff housing would be constructed at
Mataram. Basic furniture and laboratory equipment would be included for these new
installations. Computer systems would be located at Naibonat (Kupang), Maumere
(Flores), Sandubaya and Mataram (Lombok). Journals, periodicals and textbooks would
be updated at the libraries of the main station and installations. Likewise, vehicles would
be located at the main station and installations and, a boat at Maumere on Flores.
12.   Definition of Agro-Ecological Zones. The characterization of agro-ecological
zones has been identified as a priority research topic under the ARM II project for eight
selected AIATs. For NTT and NTB the proposed project would support the definition of
agro-ecological zones with the same objectives and procedures applied under the ARM II
project. This support would build on the existing data and knowledge of the two
provinces and would enable more detailed characteristics of the agro-ecological zones to
be prepared during the first three years of the project. Data already exist in the form of
reconnaissance soil surveys and climatic information but this needs to be defined in more
detail for activity zones and combined with information on the social, cultural and ethnical
characteristics of the zones. These studies would be implemented by research staff
working with local provincial government staff, members of local community
organizations (LCOs) and staff of local universities. The findings would form the basis of
the more location-specific definition of constraints and potential facing the farmers and
would assist in the formulation of low input technology packages.
13.   Staff Resources Development, Technical Assistance and R&D Coflaboration.
The new regional AIAT focus will require considerable reorientation and staff retraining
who, up to now, have been mainly working in commodity oriented component research.
Staff training would include training within Indonesia to masters, doctorate and short-
term non-degree or diploma training to strengthen staff capability in specific skills to
effectively implement the R&D. Technical assistance has been reduced from the level
proposed during preparation in recognition of the high level of qualified and experienced
staff available within AARD and the Naibonat AIAT. The technical assistance
component, comprising both international and local consultants, would assist in
strengthening the capability of NAIAT staff in technical and technology transfer fields.
Intemational consultants would be recruited for farming systems expertise (eight staff-
months) and for unallocated, short-term expertise (10 staff-months). Local consultants
would be FSR, agricultural economics, soil and water conservation, sociology, technology



61 -                          ANNEX 1
Page 7 of 9
diffusion, and laboratory training (66 staff-months). To ensure that the NAIAT research
staff form strong links with international research institutes, funds have been included for
R&D collaboration with bodies such as ICRISAT, CIMMYT, IRRI, and IITA. The
prospects would be explored for the establishment of a twinning arrangement between
NAIAT and one of these centers. Similarly, funds are included for collaboration with local
university staff to undertake specific topic surveys and field research.
14.   On-farm Trials and Demonstrations. This will cover all of the on-farm and
applied field trial and demonstrations to be implemented and/or supervised by staff of
NAIAT. In addition, the project would support the technology transfer of identified
packages and recommendations through organization of field days, leaflet and poster
production, slides and video processing (included in the functions of the former
Agricultural Information Centers), workshops and publication of research findings.
NAIAT staff field work would include experimental trials to test new technology under
farmer and field station conditions (component research). This would be followed by on-
farm demonstrations of new technology packages, implemented by NAIAT staff working
closely with PPLs (extension staff), LCOs and selected farmers. A program of 680 ha of
dryland farming demonstrations would be supported under the proposed project. The
third stage of general replication would be implemented by field extension staff of the
relevant Dinas working with farmers and, where available, LCO field staff.
Priority Research Programs
15.   Between 1987 and 1994, basic component technology and farming systems
research was supported by NTASP at Naibonat (NTT), Maumere (NTT), and Sandubaya
(NTB). The trials included:
(a)   food crop yield trials of groundnut, soybean, maize, mungbean, cassava
and pigeon pea;
(b)   fertilizer trials, plant spacing and population, weeding control on intercrops
of palawija crops;
(c)   food crop and coconut, food crop and other industrial crops (cashew,
cocoa, cotton, etc.);
(d)   rainfed rice variety and fertilizer trials;
(e)   alley cropping using forage grasses, fodder trees and industrial crops
(coffee, cocoa and cashew); and
(f)   various intercropping trials.
16.   From these multi-locationai trials executed mainly on farmers land close to the
research bases, eight packages or recommendations were released and demonstrated to

farmers in 10 kabupaten in NTT and NTB. Bank Supervision Mission Reports, the Final
Report of the Impact Evaluation Study, and the Implementation Completion Report all
found shortcomings in the packages recommended for adoption under NTASP and more
basic component research is required, particularly on fertilizer response and variety
selection of rice and palawija crops. A summary of priority research topics based on these
reports is given below:
(a)   more detailed AEZ studies to design the existing farming systems and, in
particular, to quantify existing crop inputs and labor;
(b)   development of low and intermediate input-technology packages for
irrigation and dryland as first-step adoptions for low income, risk-prone
farmers;
(c)   continued emphasis on soil and water conservation practices which are
tailored to suit both different agro-ecological zones and land availability of
individual farmers;
(d)   development of drought tolerant upland crop varieties and farming systems
designed to mitigate food security worries of farmers;
(e)   selection and testing of locally adapted varieties of crops (for example,
sorghum and maize varieties from Sumba Island) leading to improved seed
lines of these popular strains;
(f)    quantification of village irrigation benefits and optimization of irrigated
cropping systems with realistic farmer input levels;
(g)   integration of livestock feed resources, particularly dry season fodder,
within the food crop based farming system;
(h)   identification and alleviation of post-harvest crop loss factors affecting rice
and palawija crop storage;
(i)    development of simple, integrated pest management models for adoption
by farmers;
(j)   selection and testing of locally available fodder trees and grasses for
inclusion in alley cropping, fencing and contour bunds;
(k)   identification and selection of suitable cover crops for use during the dry
season on annually cropped land and as a fallow crop on shifting cultivation
lands;

(1)   identification and testing of high value crops which show local comparative
advantage on the different islands' soils and micro-climates; and
(m)   development of marine fish, prawn, clam, and seaweed production systems.
17.   The AARD already has identified six priority topics for research to be carried out
at NAIAT during 1995/96. These include livestock feed resources, low input lowland rice
research, alley cropping, low income dryland crop research, socio-economic studies, and
marine fish culture studies. Although these general topics would address some of the
more specific research recommerndations given above, more detailed incorporation into
annual work plans and programs would be required under the proposed project.
Implementation Arrangements
18.   The proposed project would support agricultural research over a six-year period.
The NAIAT would be staffed by the existing personnel from the former NTASP research
institute, complemented by staff from the former Agricultural Information Centers.
Additional expertise not available within the existing staff would be provided from other
AARD national centers. An overall regional development master plan and a detailed
program of work for the first project year would be prepared by the Naibonat AIAT and
submitted, through AARD, prior to commencement of the proposed project. The overall
development plan would include the priority research topics and participatory research
management mechanisms (similar to those proposed under the ARM II project) to ensure
high quality and relevance of technology to local conditions and to strengthen the linkages
of the NAIAT to farmers, local govemments, universities, the private sector and LCOs.
19.   A Regional Advisory Committee, supported by a Technical Working Group,
would assist the R&D on programming, technology dissemination and training. Farmers,
provincial govemment and other participants or end users would be well represented on
these two bodies. Proposed functions of the committee, AIAT and associated agencies
are given in Attachment 1 (copied from Annex I of the SAR for ARM II). A Project
Management Unit (PMU) with a PIMPRO has been established at the AIAT at Naibonat,
and a PIU with a PIMBAGPRO at Sandubaya to implement the NTB portion of the
program. The PIMPRO is responsible to the Director of NAIAT for the implementation
of project activities.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Implementation of Agricultural Area Development
A. Village Irrigation
Background
1.    Irrigated agriculture covers over five million ha in Indonesia, of which about four million ha are
under Government control and about one million ha served by farmer managed systems. Public Works
Department data of 1992 on the coverage of Desa Irigasi (village irrigation) schemes show 810
schemes with 43,000 ha in NTB and 960 schemes with 124,000 ha in NTT. The inventories are
subject to verification and updating. Information collected by the Bank's preappraisal mission for the
proposed project on the island of Sumbawa suggests that coverage of village irrigation schemes in
NTB has been underestimated in the 1992 inventory. For NTT, on the other hand, the estimates are
probably too high.
2.    Traditional village irrigation schemes usually consist of makeshift, temporary structures and
earthen canals to divert water from rivers or streams to the fields. The size of the schemes depends on
the volume of water in the streams and may vary from less than 20 ha to more than 300 ha. Some of
the schemes have water all year-around but most are seasonal, limiting irrigation to the wet season
only. Often the structures are damaged or destroyed during floods, resulting in crop losses if the wash-
out happens early in the season. In many schemes farners are forced to rebuild the structures every
year. Leakage is another problem, reducing the effectiveness of the schemes. Typically, farmers
organize themselves into infonnal groups for repair, maintenance and water management of the
schemes. Especially in NTB, the traditional irrigation organizations tend to function effictively.
The NTASP Experience
3.    Assistance for village irrigation was introduced as an NTASP activity in 1989. Responding to
requests by farrmers in NTB, project management agreed to include construction work in village
irrigation schemes in the project's Provincial Agricultural Support component. The executing agency
was the Dinas Food Crops at the kabupaten level. Schemes were selected for assistance through a
bottom-up planning process with agricultural extension workers acting as motivators and facilitators.
4.    The project supported construction of perrnanent diversion structures (weirs) through: (a)
preparation of designs, (b) supply of cement, wire and gates, and (c) assistance by skilled workmen.



- 67 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 19
The farmers contributed all locally available materials (sand, stone, bamboo) and their labor. The
contribution by the project was limited to Rp. 5 million (about US$2,500) for each scheme. The value
of the farmers' contributions varied considerably from scheme to scheme; on average project and
farmer contributions were about equal.
5.    Some 150 schemes were improved under NTASP, all located in NTB except for one scheme
on Sumba in NTT. The area covered by those schemes exceeds 12,000 ha. In addition to the NTASP
supported schemes, at least as many were improved using local finds, either from the provincial or
kabupaten budgets. In Kabupaten Sumbawa, for example, a total of 92 schemes were improved
between 1989 and 1993, of which 37 were financed under NTASP and 55 with local funds. Another
19 schemes were being improved during 1995, all with local finds. In all cases the local government
contribution was limited to materials and supplies which were not locally available and skilled labor.
The farmers always had full control over the planning and execution of the works - a key element of
the approach to increase the effectiveness of village irrigation schemes.
6.    As NTASP and other Government-supported improvement works have started only relafively
recently, little information has been collected as yet on the performance and benefits of the upgraded
schemes. The mid-term review team for NTASP surveyed seven schemes and found that the nature of
the benefits varied substantially between schemes, and also within schemes, depending on location. For
about one third of the surveyed farms the main benefit was a reduced risk of failure of the weir, and
hence a smaller risk of crop failure. About 40 percent of the farmers increased their cropping intensity
by taking up the cultivation of a second irrigated paddy crop. Also, in most schemes the command
area could be expanded, sometimes by up to 25 percent, allowing farmers to switch from rainfed to
irrigated paddy. However, according to the ICR, the fill potential of the improvements in the
irrigation facilities were not realized in many instances because of shortage and lack of timely
availability of good quality seeds, poor water distribution and on-farm water management due to
rudimentary secondary and tertiary channels, and in some cases due to poor access roads.
Recent Developments
7.    Under REPELITA VI the Government launched in January 1995 an ambitious three-year
program to upgrade village irrigation schemes covering some 900,000 ha, or about 90 percent of all
schemes believed to exist in the country. The program is known as Improvement of VIllage Irrigation
Schemes (PID), and sometimes also referred to as Village Irrigation Crash Program. The objective of
the program is to quickly improve diversion structures and canals in the majority of the country's
village irrigation systems (including those located in the two Nusa Tenggara provinces) and thereby
increase Indonesia's paddy production by about one million ton. The works are designed and executed
by the Public Works Department, either under contract or force account. Simukaneously, Govemnment
started in mid-1995 a Farmer-Managed Irrigation Sector Project (FEMS) with financing from the Asian
Development Bank. This six-year project covers 90,000 ha in six provinces, including Nusa Tenggara
Barat. The PID program is limited to improvement of physical infiastructure in the village schemes
while the FMIS also supports water users associations and water management activities. The PID and



- 68 -
ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 19
FMIS programs do not include follow-up agricultural support activities to transfer improved
production technology to the farmers.
Proposed Developments
8.    Survey. In order to gain better insight in the functioning of the recently improved village
irrigation schemes, a survey of a representative sample of about 25 schemes completed under NTASP
would be undertaken during the first project year. The purpose would be to collect data on the
condition of the schemes and to determine what further support would be needed to improve their
effectiveness, both technical and agricultural. The results of the survey would be discussed with the
farmers and other interested persons and followed by the preparation of an action plan.
9.    The survey would be implemented by a two-person team consisting of an agricultural
economist and an engineer. The team would:
(a)   examine all relevant information available at the kabupaten and provincial offices on the
village irrigation schemes improved under NTASP and local government funded
programs;
(b)   select at random 25 schemes improved in NTB under NTASP, ensuing geographical
spread in the sample, and reflecting differences in sources of water, command areas,
and cropping patterns, intensities and yields; and
(c)   visit all selected schemes in order to:
(i)   assess the technical condition of all scheme facilities and determine what further
improvements, if any, are required to the headworks or the canal systems; and
(ii)   collect information from the farmers on cropping patterns and production
before and after the improvement works were performed and determine what
agricultural support services are needed in order to take full advantage of the
physical improvements.
10.   Agricultural Support Services. The project would provide follow-up agricultural support to
rehabilitated village irrigation schemes. These could include schemes improved under NTASP or one
of the programs financed with Government's own funds or by the Asian Development Bank. The
support envisaged would help realize the full potential of the physical improvements, as recommended
in the ICR for NTASP. Cropping potentials are likely to vary substantially between and within
schemes. Some schemes will allow only wet season cropping. Others, with ample water resources
throughout the year (e.g. springs), already may have two or three crops per year. In all cases the goal
would be to intensify crop cultivation by:



- 69 -
ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 19
(a)   expanding i*igated cropping during the dry season;
(b)   enlarging the command area and irigated cropping during the wet season and improve
on-farm water management;
(c)   adopting appropriate crop technologies including the use of good quality seeds, as the
risk of crop failure diminishes due to the improved facilities; and
(d)   diversifying into other crops if feasible.
The findings of the survey referred to in para 9 would be used to help improve the quality of the
agricultural support services.
11.   The Dinas Food Crops at the kabupaten level, with technical backing from the Naibonat AIAT
and the provincial agricultural services and in close consultation with the farmers, would be responsible
for implementation. Over the six project years a series of on-farm irrigated crop demonsutaions,
totaling about 5 ha per scheme would be established in about 265 village irrigation schemes. Typically
some 2.5 ha demonstrations would be established in about five 0.5 ha farm plots in each scheme during
the first year, followed by another 2.5 ha demonstrations during the second year. Dinas staff working
together with local community organizations (LCOs) operating in the project area, would identify the
irrigation schemes and select the sites for the demonstrations. They would then assist the farmer
groups with the preparation of detailed plans for implementation of the demonstrations and train the
farmer leaders in the proposed new technologies. The Dinas would arrange for the provision to the
farmers of seeds, fertilizer, tools and equipment for one cropping cycle of paddy and a palawija crop
(or a second paddy crop where water supply is adequate). Dinas and LCO staff also would encourage
the participating farmers to form groups and to set up revolving fimds for the purchase of farm inputs.
After the harvest the fund would be replenished by the participants from the sales proceeds. Each
group would set its own rules of operation. Over time, other farmers may either seek admission to an
already existing group or form new groups.
12.   Dinas and LCO staff would also assist the farmers with the preparation of proposals for
complementary interventions, including provision of cattle, assistance for seed growers, improvement
of home plots, construction of access roads, farmer training, etc. Priority would be given to
implementation of interventions in areas where village irrigation schemes have been successfally
improved.
13.   Expected Results. Paddy production is estimated to increase by about 500 kg per ha, and
soybeans by about 300 kg per ha, as a result of improved agricultural practices supported by the
project. Estimates of incremental production are in Table 1 of this Annex. A summary farm budget for
a typical 0.5 ha plot of irrigated land is given in Table 2.

B. Dryland Farming System Development
Background
14.   The two provinces NTB and NTT are among the lowest rainfall areas in Indonesia. High
precipitations of up to 3,000 mm per year have been recorded at the highest elevations but in the
coastal areas rainfall may be as low as 500 mm per year. Also, rainfall distribution over the year is
uneven. Typically, over one half of the annual rainfall occurs during the three months December -
February, and over 85 percent during the six months November - April. It hardly rains at all between
May and October and crop cultivation in the non-irigated areas is not possible during that period.
Finally, there are large year-to-year variations and drought conditions frequently prevail during
extended periods, often leading to crop losses and food shortages.
15.   Productivity and farm incomes of traditional agriculture in the dryland areas of NTB and NTT
are very low as a result of the adverse climatic conditions. Shifting cultivation in some areas is leading
to degradation of land resources. Moisture retention and soil conservation are the key requirements for
increasing agricultural productivity and preserving the resource base of the drought prone areas in
eastern Indonesia. Alley cropping, contour ridge terracing, and planting of cover crops and living
fences are forms of dryland farming techniques that have been tested and can be promoted in the target
areas. These types of interventions received much emphasis under the recently completed NTASP.
The NTASP Expenence.
16.   Approach. Under the Farming Systems Research (FSR) component of NTASP several
agricultural technology packages have been developed and are now recommended to area farmers.
These include, amongst others, packages for: (a) rain-fed paddy (ocally known as gogorancah); (b)
irrigated paddy; (c) other food crops; (d) mixed cropping for dryland; (e) house plots; and (e) livestock
keeping. Under the Land Conservation component of the project the Dinas Food Crops in seven
kabupaten established demonstrations of various conservation farming practices through the provision
of extension services, planting materials, fertilizers, hand sprayers, agro-chemicals and farm tools.
17.   Work on the development of the technology packages was started in 1986 with a base-line
survey of existing farming systems. The survey covered the three kabupaten were the research sub-
bases had been established, i.e. East Lombok (Lombok), Sikka (Flores) and Kupang (West Timor).
Up to ten main agro-ecosystems were identified during the surveys. Supplemental surveys were
conducted in 1990/91 in five additional kabupaten to complete the original project target. The
technology packages developed earlier for East Lombok, Sikka and Kupang were adjusted to render
them suitable to the conditions in the five supplemental kabupaten.
18.   During the early project years research focused on testing of component technology (especially
crop varieties and fertilizer) for food crops which was the farmers' overwhelming priority. In later



- 71 -
ANNEX 2
Page 6 of 19
years more emphasis was given to applications of component technology in various cropping patterns
and the integration of tree legumes and tree crops. Livestock was also integrated in some of the trials.
19.   Well over 2,000 farmers were irvolved in various aspects of dryland farming improvements
through their participation in on-farm research trials and demonstrations. The land conservation
technology applied was in all cases terracing and bunding with contour planting of tree legumes, fruit
trees and other tree crops with intercropping of food crops (alley cropping). The approach has been
strengthened in the later years as specific research results became available and the resulting
recommendations of FSR have been applied in the field. After the completion of NTASP in 1994, the
Dinas Food Crops in several kabupaten, jointly with the Dinas Livestock and Dinas Estate Crops, have
continued the demonstration and extension program with local funds. Through their activities, and with
assistance from the proposed project, the benefits of research and demonstrations are expected to have
a broader impact on rural households in the two provinces.
20.   Lessons. The ICR for NTASP commented that the sustainability of the farming system
development program could be threatened unless the technology packages were further streamlined to
achieve possible cost reductions, viable arrangements for short-term financing of input costs were
made, and the institutional and infrastructural constraints to input supply and produce marketing had
been addressed. Three specific lessons have been learned from the NTASP experience. The first
lesson concems the cost of the technology packages. There is much evidence of farmers adopting only
part of the recommendations made by the researchers. The findings include:
(a)   since all farmers like to own cattle, most are willing to plant leguminous trees or fodder
plants;
(b)   where growing conditions are favorable, farmers will respond positively to the planting
of tree crops (cashews, cocoa, coffee); and
(c)   farrners either do not have the funds, or are very reluctant to spend money, on HYV
seeds, fertilizers and agro-chemicals for their food crops.
In the project trials and demonstrations the inputs were given for free to the farmers, often for up to
four or five successive years. However, it is unrealistic to expect large scale adoption of high cost
input packages, recommended by the researchers, because the farmers have very low incomes and little
savings. Indeed, there is strong evidence of farmers stopping to use high cost inputs once the trials and
demonstrations have ended. The technology packages should therefore be reviewed carefully to
detemnine whether they are suitable to the local conditions and meet the needs of the lowest income
farmers.
21.   The second lesson concerns the sequencing of various interventions, the need to fully involve
all support services and the farmers in the planning process, and the need to supply high quality seeds
and planting material, as pointed out in the ICR There have been cases were farmers were encouraged



- 72 -
ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 19
to plant fodder crops on the promise that cattle would be distributed soon thereafter, while in reality
cattle were delivered too late or not at all. Lower levels of tree losses could have been achieved if the
bunded terraces had first been planted with tree legumes and vetiver in order to improve soil moisture,
instead of planting all seedlings in the same year. Preferably, farmers should first demonstrate progress
in land conservation activities. Only thereafter should the agricultural support services supply inputs
which are difficult for the farmers to obtain, such as good quality tree crop seedlings, cattle and vetiver
grass (if not locally available).
22.   A third lesson concerns the respective role of researchers and extension workers. Under
NTASP the on-farm demonstrations were managed and staffed by AARD. There only were a
relatively small number of demonstrations and all were located in the immediate vicinity of the three
research stations in Naibonat, Maumere and Sandubaya, respectively. Extension staff were not
involved in the demonstrations, other than as mere spectators. A better approach would be for
researchers to design the demonstrations and provide overall guidance while the Dinas Food Crops Tk.
II, assisted by Livestock and Estate Crops, would take care of the day-to-day management of the
demonstrations.
Proposed Developments
23.   The project would continue to support improved dryland farning practices in the project target
areas as an expanded pilot activity. The main vehicles for promoting adoption of the improved
practices would be on-farm demonstrations, conducted under the responsibility of NAIAT, and
replications by the farmers under guidance from the local agricultural support services and LCOs. For
the proposed program to be successful and sustainable, three important conditions would have to be
met. First, staff of the research and extension agencies should be well trained and motivated for their
assignments and should closely coordinate their activities amongst themselves and with the farmers.
Second, the cash input content of the recommended packages should be as small as possible since most
farmers would not be able to pay for improved seeds and fertilizers. And third, every effort should be
made to ensure that only good quality seeds, seedlings and breeding cattle are being distributed in a
timely manner to the farmers. Details on the implementation arrangements follow below.
24.   Demonstrations. The suitability of the technology packages would be tried out and
demonstrated in field demonstrations which would be established in each target area. For planning
purposes it has been assumed that about 68 on-farm demonstrations, covering a total area of about 680
ha, spread over 14 kabupaten would be established over a period of about five years. There would be
some four to five demonstrations of about 10 ha, involving about 13-14 farmers with an average 0.75
ha each, in each kabupaten over a two-year period. The NAIAT would design the demonstrations and
supervise their execution, while the Dinas Food Crops, Livestock and Estate Crops Tk. II would
manage the demonstrations on a day-to-day basis. The cost of the demonstrations would be financed
under NAIAT's annual budgets. Participating farmers would be paid up to a maximum of 50 work
days equivalent for terracing and bunding of the fields and planting of the tree crop seedlings. In
addition they would receive and initial package of improved seeds, fertilizer, agro-chemicals and tools.



- 73 -
ANNEX 2
Page 8 of 19
25.   Replications. The on-farm demonstrations would be replicated throughout the target areas.
The kabupaten agricultural support services, the NAIAT researchers and representatives of the farmers
in the target area (usually a kecamatan) would meet at least once per year to discuss and agree on best
practices and to draw up annual programs of replications. For planning purposes it has been assumed
that the replication program would cover on average about 400 farmers cultivating about 300 ha (0.75
ha per farmer) in each kecamatan. About 12,600 ha would be supported under this program during the
life of the project. It is expected that successful demonstrations and replications will eventually
encourage other farmers in the area to adopt at least part of the improved practices.
26.   During the first year of the replication program, the Dinas Food Crops Tk. II would provide a
tool set to selected farmers. Under the guidance of the Dinas staff they would start with the terncing
(where needed) and bunding of their fields. Once this work has been completed to the agreed
specifications, the farmers would qualify for a support package similar to that used in the
demonstrations (para 24), except that no payments would be made for the farmers' own labor. The
package would include seedlings for the tree crop considered suitable for the area, improved food crop
seeds, and a minimum supply of fertilizers and agro-chemicals for the tree crop seedlings and food
crops. High yielding varieties food crop seeds would be procured from government seed farms or
contract growers. Seedlings for the tree crops would be raised in Dinas Estate Crops Tk. II operated
nurseries in each of the targeted kabupaten. During the second year the Dinas Estate Crops Tk. II
would provide tree crop seedlings needed for filling-in the initial plantation and the frntlizer and
chemicals needed for the new seedlings. Except for guidance by the extension stafl no further support
for food crop cultivation would be given to the farmers after the initial year. However, farmers would
be encouraged to organize themselves into farmer associations and to establish revolving funds for the
purchase of seasonal cash inputs from cooperatives or private traders.
Expected Results
27.   The selected drylandfarin model includes cashew as the tree crop of choice since cashew is:
(a) expected to be suitable to many of the areas, (b) popular among the farmers, and (c) representative
for the costs and benefits of other tree crops. Cocoa and coffee (arabica and robusta) are viable
alternatives in some of the target areas. With regard to the food crop model, only moderate fertilizer
applications and use of hybrid maize seeds have been assumed in the "with project 2" case and no
fertilizer with local maize seeds in the "with project 1" model. It is quite probable, as observed under
NTASP, that farmers will initially adopt the second model but eventually revert to the first model after
the free distribution of inputs has ended.
28.   Table 1 shows the project's estimated incrementalproduciion, under the assumption that 50
percent of the participating farmers would stay with model 2 and the remainder revert to model 1.
Farm budgets for the dryland models are in Table 3.

C. House Plot Development
Background
29.   Almost all rural households have house plots of 0.1 to 0.2 ha. However, the productivity of
these house plots tends to be low. There is significant potential to intensify the production of fruits,
vegetables, fuel wood, and forage crops in these areas.
Proposed Developments
30.   Home garden cultivation would be improved under the project in order to improve family
nutrition and raise incomes. Intensification of cultivation would be canied out through training of
community leaders and demonstrations. Project assistance would be provided in the form of extension
advice, seedlings, seeds, inputs, and smrall tools. Emphasis would be given to the cultivation of fruit
trees.
31.   The Dinas Food Crops Tk. II would implement this activity. The extension workers would
cooperate closely with the PKK in each location. The following activities would be undertaken: (a)
design of location specific technology packages in consultation with the villagers, especially the
women; (b) training of community leaders (in particular PKK) in upgrading of home plots and
sanitation; (c) provision of inputs for demonstrations; and (d) assistance for villagers who also wish to
upgrade their house plots.
Expected Results
32.   It is expected that 2,800 households would participate in the demonstrations and directly
benefit. Estimates of incremental production are in Table 1 and a typical budget in Table 4.

D. Livestock Development
Background
33.   As of 1993 there were about 400,000 head of cattle and 200,000 buffaloes in Nusa Tenggara
Barat and about 750,000 cattle and 175,000 buffaloes in Nusa Tenggara Tinmr. Of these about one
third are in the proposed project areas. The existing herds are managed extensively, calving rates are
low and use of improved forages still is limited. The buffaloes are generally used for draft in the
sawahs. Some of the cattle also are used for draft but most are kept for savings and eventally sold for
slaughter. The island of Timor has nearly 90 percent of all cattle in NTT.
34.   Cattle was introduced in Timor only in 1912. Since then the cattle population has been
increasing rapidly - reportedly by more than 50 percent in Timor over the last 25 years. Cattle are the
only significant export from NTT. Annual numbers exported increased from about 20,000 head in
1978 to about 70,000 head in 1994, but numbers and also the weights are highly dependent on climatic
and other conditions. Cattle are largey raised in uncontrolled, open-range, communal grazing systems
on natuml pastures. The pastures are often overgrazed, especially near vilages and watering points,
and frequent fires during the dry season often exacerbate the situation. However, increasingly livestock
are tethered or kept in barns and fed larntoro (Leucaena) through the cut-and-cany feeding system.
Almost all farmers in the project areas want to own cattle, but not many have enough fiuds to buy
breeding stock. The predecessor NTASP supported the farmers with the acquisition of breeding
stock.
The NTASP Experience
35.   Some 20,750 head of cattle were distriluted by NTASP (92 percent of target) under the
guidance of 41 livestock field extension teams (SATGAS) established under the project. The project
was successful in most of its development activities, except for cattle fattening as only 500 head of
cattle were distributed out of 6,000 envisaged at appraisal. Cattle distribution, using the in-kind
revolving credit system, and the establishment of SATGAS field teams, were successfully initiated
during previous Bank and EFAD financed cattle development projects in Sumatra and Sulawesi. The
earlier projects showed the importance of careful selection of beneficiary households: unless the new
cattle keepers provide for the necessary fodder and take proper care of the animals, they won't be able
to repay their debts on time.
36.   In accordance with national policy, recipients of breeding stock have to return two off-spring
within six years to the Dinas Livestock. As of mid-1994 NTASP project staffhad redistributed 2,450
and sold 3,700 of the off-springs collected as repayment. The demand from smallholders for cattle
remains strong. In NTT the large majority of farmers want to keep cattle for saving. In NTB most
farmers want cattle for land preparation, for the manure they produce, or for other agricultural
purposes. One of the key conditions for receiving cattle is that farmers do not yet own any cattle. This



- 76 -
ANNEX 2
Page 11 of 19
eligibility condition has provided a major challenge to livestock extension staff as they had to impart
over a short period basic husbandry skills upon the farmers. The mixed results are reflected in two key
coefficients: calving rates under NTASP were 52 percent compared to the 78 percent target, and calf
mortality rates were 9.5 percent compared to the 5 percent target. More focused attention should be
paid to animal production issues, such as improved nutrition (especially during the dry season), better
bull managernent, and more effective disease management.
Proposed Developments
37.   The project would provide support for distribution of breeding cattle and water buffaloes,
promotion of intensive management systems, and establishment of community-based revolving systems
for redistribution of cattle and buffaloes in support of future farming systems development activities. A
key lesson of the NTASP experience is the need to link conservation farming practices and livestock
distribution into one farnning system. An increase in the livestock numbers, clearly desired by the
majority of the farmers, would need to be accompanied by an increase in the feed base in order to avoid
greater dry season stress and mortality. The most common forms of conservation farming techniques,
producing high protein animal feed year round, are alley cropping, contour ridge terraces, cover crops,
lving fences, and bench terraces.
38.   Distribution of cattle and buffaloes under the proposed project would be restricted to farmers
who:
(a)    have successfully participated in project activities for improvement of village irrigation
systems or dryland farming system development but who do not yet own cattle or
buffaloes;
(b)    are members of a farmers group and have successfully participated in training sessions
on animal husbandry management systems;
(c)    have built an animal shed and established at least 250 meters of forage trees and grasses
in hedge rows; and
(d)    have farm incomes below the district average.
39.   The cattle and buffalo distribution component would be inplemented under the responsibility
of the Dinas Livestock Tk. I of the two provinces. At the local levels (kabupaten and kecamatan) the
Dinas Livestock Tk. II would organize working groups for livestock distribution. In addition to local
livestock extension and animal health services staff, LCOs operating in the project areas would be
represented on the working groups. Under the supervision of the Dinas Tk. II the working groups
would be responsible for: (a) final selection and training of farmer groups to receive cattle; (b)
distribution of cattle to farmer groups; (c) monitoring of the health of the cattle distributed; (d)
provision of livestock and forage extension services and veterinary services; (e) maintenance of records

on the performance (calving rates and deaths); and (f) supervision of the redistribution of cattle. In the
course of the project an assessment would be made of the practicality of tuning over responsibility for
adninistering the livestock program to the community after the initial distribution has been made.
40.   Some 7,780 cattle (females) and 600 water buffaloes would be distributed in NTB, and about
7,020 cattle and 400 water buffaloes in NTT. In addition, bulls would be distributed (for cattle only) at
the ratio of one bull for every ten heifers. The animals would be procured by the Dinas Livestock Tk. I
from areas within each province, as close as possible to the distribution areas. For Lombok, Sumba
and Timor the animals would be procured within each island; for Sumbawa and Flores the aninals
would come from Lombok and Timor, respectively.
41.   The distribution of animals would start during the second project year, which would allow
sufficient time for selection and training of the beneficiaries and the planting of fodder trees and grass.
The project would establish a revolving system to redistribute cattle to disadvantaged area farmers.
Each recipient would be allowed to keep the first off-spring but would have to return the second and
third off-springs. Farmers receiving a bull in addition to a heifer would return three calves. Priority for
receiving redistnibuted aimals would be given to other low income farmers among the participating
farmer groups. Future redistribution would be used to support future fanming systems development
effbrts in the targeted kecamatans.
Expected Results
42.   Cattle and bufidlo distnbution would provide a source of direct income to the participants
through the sale of off-spring, as well as through their use for draft and transport purposes and the
production of manure. Fodder production would be an integral part of the conservation fanning
system promoted under the project. The herd projections and the annual animal sales quantities and
values, without and with the project, are in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

E. Vaccination of Chickens Against Newcastle Disease
Background
43.   There are some 4.5 million chickens in each of the two provinces, of which just over one
quarter is in the project areas. A typical rural household has between 5 and 15 birds. There are only a
few commercial poultry farms in NTB and NTT. Newcastle disease is a common disease of chickens
in the target areas and causes death losses of smailholder chickens estimated to average about 25
percent annually (but may reach as much as 80 percent). Control of the disease is a high priority, but
access to vaccines and local knowledge of their use is limited.
Proposed Developments
44.   The project would provide support for training of area farmers and women in the techniques of
vaccination of chickens against Newcastle disease. The Dinas Livestock Tk. II would inmpemet this
activity through animal health clinics (Poskeswan). The vaccinations would be undertaken by women
through the PKK (Family Welfare Organization). Training would be provided in two stages: veterinary
staff would train the PPLs who would then train two women per participating village. The training
would be repeated during the second year. Two vaccinations per year are needed. Vaccines, syringes
and other materials would be provided for two years as a grant to each village requesting assistance.
Thereafter the Poskeswan would continue to supply vaccines and syringes but the villagers would be
expected to pay for the vaccinations.
Expected Results
45.   The vaccination program would be implemented in about 325 villages in the targeted
kecamatan and benefit an estimated 50,000 households. Losses from Newcastle disease would be
minimized and a capacity would be established to continue with the vaccination program after the
project is closed.

F. Farm Access Roads
Background
46.   Poor road access and lack of fresh water are major constraints for the development of much of
the eastem islands, including the two Nusa Tenggara provinces. Many villages still are not connected
by all-weather roads to the provincial and kabupaten road network. Also, existing roads often are
damaged by rain causing transportation breakdowns between villages and markets. Lack of reliable
sources of water supply imposes big burdens, particularly on the women and children who have to do
the hauling from distant sources. Unless communities are connected to all-weather roads and safe
water supply systems, people will keep on missing out on opportunities for a more productive and
rewarding village life.
47.   In the face of those needs, the Government has been allocating large proportions of its
development budgets to the upgrading of public infrastructure. Improvement of transportation alone
represented nearly 60 percent of regional development expenditures in 1990/91 in NTB and over 40
percent in NTT. A recent OECF-financed study, entitled "Rural Areas nfastructure Development"
(March 1994), includes cost estimates for the upgrading of village roads and bridges in the "Desa
Tertinggal" (IDT) villages.' For those villages the cost of upgrading village roads and bridges was
estimated at about US$4 million and US$26 million in NTB and NTT, respectively. Observations by
the Bank's preappraisal mission for the present project during the 1995 rainy season in Kecamatan
Lunyuk in Kabupaten Sumbawabesar (NTB) suggest that these estimates are rather conservative.
48.   Following the completion of the study referred to above, OECF has agreed to allocate about
US$200 million equivalent for the upgrading over two years (1 995/96 and 1996/97) of rural
infrastructure in over 3,000 villages in 21 provinces, including the two Nusa Tenggara provinces.2
Villages are being selected in clusters of five of which at least three should be IDT villages. An amount
of US$65,000 equivalent is made available to each selected village for the construction of roads and
bridges, water supply and sanitation systems, and jetties. The 1995/96 program for NTB and NTT
covers 40 villages with a total allocation of about US$2.6 million. The program for 1996/97 is
expected to be about the same size. In NTT most of the funds available under the OECF financed
project will be used for the construction of embungs (water storage reservoirs). Existing Government
procedures will be followed for approval, financing and implementation of the program. A special
INPRES3 will be allocated to the kabupaten and the works will be executed by contractors.
Consultants/supervising engineers employed under the OECF financed project will assist the Dinas
Public Works Tk. II with the preparation of proposals and the design and supervision of the works.
' About one fifth of the villages in the NTB project areas, and one quarter in NTT, are listed as IDT villages.

The NTASP Experience
49.   Under NTASP some 144 km of national and provincial roads in Flores have been improved,
against 190 km planned originally. The balance portion of the roads program was financed under an
Asian Development Bank loan. Subsequently, the road sustained serious damage during the 1993
earthquake. Recent data show that traffic volumes in most sections have increased close to the
predicted levels. Routine road maintenance in the two NTASP financed integrated area development
schemes of Lombok Tengah and Lembor appears to be less than adequate. Local governments already
have taken some action to improve maintenance. However, more resources should be allocated to
maintain the roads.
Proposed Devdopments
50.   Project interventions intended to directly raise agricultural productivity would be supported by
improvements of physical access, where necessary. The program would cover all eight project
kabupaten in NTT and the three kabupaten on Sumbawa island in NTB. The three kabupaten of
Lombok would not be included in the road improvement program because a relatively good road
network already exists in Lombok. Priority would be given to villages where needs are demonstrated
to be highest and the villagers are committed to actively contributed to the implementation of the
works. It is expected that a substantial part of the budget allocation will be used for the design and
construction of bridges and culverts on existing rural roads and tracks which are critically in need of
improvement. Farm access roads would be upgraded to compacted aggregate surface roads for use by
motorcycles, animal drawn carts and four wheel vehicles.
51.   The Dinas Public Works Tk. II in the targeted kabupaten would design and inpkment the
road improvement program under force account or by direct contracting for works costing less than
US$50,000 equivalent. Approval of proposals would be dependent on a commitment by the local
governments to assure future maintenance of the works. The local PMD staff would provide
assistance to engage the local community in field construction activities. Alignments would be made
on existing foot paths to avoid the need for land acquisition. Construction costs are expected to vary
depending on the existing condition of the targeted roads and trails.
Expected Results
52.   About Rp 12.7 billion (US$5.6 million) would be allocated under the project. The maximum
allocation for each participating kecamatan (11 in NTB and 19 in NTT) would be about US$250,000
equivalent. It is estimated that a total of about 525 km of farm access roads would be upgraded under
the project, or on average about 17.5 km per participating kecamatan. Substantial variations around
these averages are likely. Some kecamatan and villages may wish to upgrade one or two key access
roads, while others would give priority to improvement, or new construction, of bridges and culverts.

G. Local Community Initiatives and Assistance for Local Community Organizations
Background
53.   The bottom-up planning system, as specified in Ministry of Home Affairs Regulation Number 9
of 1982, provides for the preparation of proposals for development activities from the village level with
screening at the higher levels. The system has the potential to improve planning of project activities in
order to respond more directly to the needs of the local people. The main constraints of this planning
system are: (a) insufficient capacity at the village and kecamatan level to prepare proposals which are in
line with the felt needs of the rural groups; and (b) insufficient discretionary funding at the kabupaten
level to respond to these proposals.
The NTASP Experience
54.   The NTASP comprised an experimental component for provincially implemented development
activities. The purpose of the experiment was to test the hypothesis that local governments could
effectively plan and execute agricultural and integrated area development activities in accordance with
the needs of the local people. Two approaches were followed:
(a)   the Agricultural Support Services approach which sought to:
(i)   strengthen the capacity of local government agencies within the agricultural
sector (i.e. Dinas Livestock, Food Crops, Estate Crops and Fisheries); and
(ii)   support a range of field activities in 46 kecamatan to directly increase the
productivity of low-income farmers (a ceiling of Rp 200 million per year was
given to each of the nine targeted kabupaten in NTB and NTT to supplement
development funding available for the agricultural sector); and
(b)   the Integrated Area Development (IAD) approach which involved some ten sector
agencies in two targeted areas in Lombok (dryland) and one in Flores (irrigated
settlement scheme).
55.   Coordination of annual planning and implementation has been carried out by the BAPPEDAs
Tk. I and Tk. II. The project structure paralleled the existing structure of local government with
project management units being established within the BAPPEDAs at the provincial and kabupaten
levels. Actions supported under this component included land conservation (with disappointing
results), seed multiplication (promising), village irrigation (excellent), tree crops (disappointing), and
livestock support (good). The results of the IAD activities in Lombok and Flores were generally
positive. The experience showed that significant benefits can be achieved from this approach. The



- 83 -
ANNEX 2
Page 18 of 19
ICR for NTASP4 observed that the overall development impact and sustainability of this component
would have been enhanced if program development had applied more rigorous criteria to define
priority rankings for interventions.
Proposed Developments
56.   Approach and Scope. The proposed project would support local community initiatives which
are expected to result in direct benefits to the communities. Local leaders would be trained in
community-based planning methods. The project would provide discretionary funding to support
implementation of initiatives which are considered to be a high priority by the local community and are
technically and economically feasible. During project years 2 through 6 supplemental funding of Rp 50
million (about US$22,250) per kecamatan would be provided to support high priority initiatives. Local
communication organizations (LCOs) in the target areas would be encouraged to participate in the
preparation of proposals for high priority agriculture-based area development initiatives. The
kabupaten office of PMD (BANGDES) would take the lead role at the local level in coordinating the
formulation of requests for assistance through the bottom-up planning system. Extension workers and
LCO staff in each area would act as facilitators in assisting local communities to identify priorities and
formulate realistic proposals. Implementation of development initiatives would be in cooperation with
the Dinas Tk. II with the technical capacity to best provide support for each activity.
57.   Generally it is expected that a range of initiatives would be proposed in line with local
conditions and community preferences. Priority would be given to proposals for initiatives to promote
farmiing systems development which might include, but would not be limited to: revolving credit
systems for cattle, water buffaloes, goats and pigs; introduction of new agricultural technology; post-
harvest processing and storage for food and estate crops; initiatives to control wild pigs; home
industries; and community managed infrastructure development activities (mostly water supply and
roads). Guidelines for selection of initiatives for funding would be established so as not to delete the
intent of eliciting priorities as identified by the community. A guide in Bahasa Indonesia would be
prepared as part of the training program for Community Development Facilitators. The proposals
would be reviewed and prioritized at the kabupaten level. Technical agencies (or where necessary
consultants) would assist with the implementation of initiatives where technical challenges are beyond
local capabilities.
58.   To be selected for support by the project the proposed initiatives should meet the following
criteria:
(a)   technically feasible and economically justified productive activities;
(b)   maximum amount per initiative: Rp 10 million;
4 Implementation Completion Report for NTASP, June 1995.



- 84 -
ANNEX 2
Page 19 of 19
(c)   maximum amount per beneficiary: Rp 250,000;
(d)   minimum number of beneficiaries per initiative: 10; and
(e)   beneficiaries should contribute locally available materials, unskilled labor and land
where required.
59.   Preference would be given to proposals which:
(a)   benefit the poorest segment of the community;
(b)   involve women and youth groups;
(c)   are assisted by LCOs;
(d)   have the lowest risk of failure; and
(e)   have the greatest socio-economic impact.
60.   Expected Results. The selected initiatives would measurably increase the incomes and
levels of welfare among the low income groups in the target areas. It is expected that some
25,000 rural households would benefit from this activity.
Assistance for Local Community Organizations
61.   Background. Large numbers of LCOs are active in NTB and NTT. Usually, the LCOs
are organized by the community and religious leaders based at the kabupaten and kecamatan
levels and with memberships at the local level. The experience under NTASP and other projects
has shown that local LCOs have the potential to increase the participation of the community in the
development activities. There is significant potential to expand local government cooperation
with local LCOs to develop income generating activities for poverty groups in the rural areas.
62.   Scope and Approach. The proposed project would support local LCOs in developing
community-based initiatives in the targeted kecamatan. The amount of support would be Rp 35
million (about US$15,500) per year for each of the 14 targeted kabupaten during project years 2
through 6. The executing agency for this activity would be the office of PMD in each of the
targeted kabupaten. Local LCOs in each kabupaten would be requested to prepare proposals for
community-based activities in the targeted kecamatan..

PROJECT SUPERVISION PLAN
The mix of specialties and frequency and duration of missions likely to be needed
to ensure adequate project supervision is listed below. In addition, the Bank's Resident
Mission would conduct ex-post reviews of works completed and goods supplied at the
rate of about two staff-weeks per year. The fall supervision missions would concentrate
on the review of the proposed work programs and budgets for the following years. The
spring missions would focus on the results achieved in the field during the preceding rainy
season. The mid-term review mission, tentatively scheduled for September 1998, would
focus on project impact and institutional development.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Input Supply and Marketing System:
Institutional and Policy Aspects
Farm Inputs
1.    Seeds. The supply of sufficient quantities of good quality seeds for rice and other food
crops has been a problem during the implementation of NTASP. Some relief was provided
through the rehabilitation and upgrading of a number of provincial seed farms. There were some
improvements in the availability of quality seeds, particularly for paddy, in the immediate vicinity
of the project-improved seed farms . The proposed project would support the production of
quality seeds by the Dinas seed farms through civil works and supply of equipment, as needed.
2.    Tree Crop Seedlings. In the two Nusa Tenggara provinces there are no private growers
of seedlings for commercial trees, such as coconut, cocoa, coffee and cashew, and fruit trees.
Professor Yujiro Hayamil observed that private nurseries have not sufficiently developed in
Indonesia to meet farmers' demands because of market failures (moral hazard). Public-supported
nurseries are therefore called for to cure this market failure. Accordingly, the Dinas Estate Crops
Tk. II raise seedlings in their own nurseries or, in case of strong demand, they may let contracts
with private growers.
3.    Fertilizers and Pesticides. Government-owned enterprises control the wholesale of
fertilizers and other agro-chemicals, while cooperatives and private traders are the retailers.
These arrangements appear to work reasonably.2 It is expected that the increased demand for
fertilizers due to the diffusion of improved technology will be met by the existing retail system.
1 In Search of Modem Sustainable Agriculture: A View from Upland Indonesia, Yujiro Hayamni, 1995.
2 The Bank has in recent years declined to finance the cost of fertilizers due to Government procurement
restrictions.

Fann Outputs
4.    Food Crops. All food crops produced in the Nusa Tenggara provinces are consumed by
the farmers and their families, or sold locally. Other than local government levies that may be
imposed on local sales (see para. 8), there are no restrictions on the trade in food crops.
5.    Tree Crops. The available evidence indicates the existence of competitive markets and
prices. A recent case study for one kabupaten in NTT reported on the failure of an attempt by
four traders to control the market for tree crop products through a cartel arrangement, and the
resulting increase in farmgate prices. In the same kabupaten the local government tried to set
minimum commodity prices with the apparent intention to protect farmers from exploitation.
However, there are no effective means of enforcement and it is therefore unlikely that such
attempts have a significant impact on the market.
6.    Livestock. The main issue in the livestock subsector concerns the central Govermnent's
determination to control the inter-island trade of both slaughter animals and breeding cattle. For
the cattle producing islands, quota are being established annually for the export of slaughter
animals to the importing islands (mostly Java). Furthermore, local officials occasionally impose
additional restrictions on trade. Such restrictions have the potential to limit the volume of sales,
and thereby to suppress the farmgate price, while on the other hand raising the meat price for the
consumers in other provinces. However, the indications are that inspite of these distortions, cattle
raising is financially profitable, given the interest and extent of the business in NTT (750,000
heads of cattle being raised and over 50,000 exported for slaughter). A cattle marketing study
would be carried out during the first project year in order to review the impact of existing
restrictions on farmers' incomes and recommend changes where appropriate. The study would be
followed by the preparation of an action plan taking into account the recommendations of the
study and the Bank's comments..
Other Issues
7.    Trading Restrictions. There is some anecdotal information from one kabupaten in NTT
where local authorities are reported to have attempted limiting marketing of agricultural surpluses
through cooperatives only. Such measures are difficult to enforce and therefore do not
significantly affect the market.
8.    Fees and Levies. Local governments routinely impose fees and levies on the trade and/or
transport of primary commodities. There are considerable differences in the levels of the fees and



- 117 -
ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 3
levies among the different local governments. However, generally the fees/levies represent only a
small proportion of the price of the commodities and do not normally act as a significant deterrent
for production (much like a sales tax in the West). For example, in Kabupaten Ende (NTT), the
levies on paddy and maize vary between 4 and 5 percent of the average farmgate price and that
for cashew nuts about 9 percent.
