MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A NUSA TENGGARA AGRICULTURAL AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$27.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for twenty years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, and would help finance a Nusa Tenggara Agricultural Area
Development Project in Indonesia.
2.    Country/Sector Background. For reasons of social equity and regional balance,
the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has highlighted development in the eastern islands in
the Second Long Term Development Plan and in REPELITA VI. The Government
strategy for the east emphasizes hunian resource development through education and
training, improving accessibility through development of transportation and
communication systems, and integrated area development. Poverty alleviation through
low-income group targeting and improved distribution of income are stressed. The
Second Long Term Development Plan features a 7.8 percent growth rate for Nusa
Tenggara Barat (West Nusa Tenggara - NTB) and 6.1 percent for Nusa Tenggara Timur
(East Nusa Tenggara - NTT)
3.    Among the twenty-seven provinces in Indonesia, NTT has the lowest GRDP per
capita while NTB ranks third lowest. About 24 percent of the population of the two
provinces is below the poverty line compared to 15 percent for the whole country.
Illiteracy rates in rural areas, where most of the people live, are significantly higher than in
urban areas and the average for all of Indonesia. Although GRDP of both provinces has
grown steadily over the last decade (6.8 percent in NTB and 5.2 percent in NTT),
development has lagged behind the western provinces of Indonesia. The economy is
dependent on agriculture which contributes 48 peicent of GRDP in NTB and 50 percent in
NTT, and employs 59 percent and 81 percent of the workforce in NTB and NTT,
respectively. However, the conditions for developing agriculture are harsh. Only 20
percent of the land area in NTB and 16 percent in NTT is cultivated, mainly through
upland and shifting cultivation. Typically, over one half of the annual rainfall occurs
within a three-month period and extended periods of drought are common. Levels of
agricultural productivity and incomes in Nusa Tenggara are among the lowest in Indonesia
as almost all production is by smallholders relying on traditional technologies to cultivate
food crops for food security. Cattle is the most economically important large livestock in
the two provinces and is universally highly valued.



- 2 -
4.    In the foreseeable future agriculture will remain the engine of growth for NTB and
NTT, driven not by any special comparative advantage but by default. Development
prospects in other sectors are presently more limited than agriculture, inspite of the harsh
agro-climatic conditions. Broad-based income generation will therefore need to begin
with agriculture but will inherently be limited by the natural environmental factors.
Constraints such as low investments and poor access to public services, technological
advances, and efficient markets need to be redressed. The challenge is to raise
subsistence production and generate a marketable surplus in a more diversified and
sustainable drylandfarming environment which precludes the high degree of crop
specialization, multiple cropping, and purchased inputs which have been so successful
on Java
5.    Past Experience and Lessons Learned. From 1986 the Bank has supported the
Nusa Tenggara Agricultural Support Project (NTASP, Loan 2638-IND), covering the
same two provinces as the proposed project. The Implementation Completion Report
(June 1995) rated the overall outcome and achievements of the project as satisfactory,
particularly when judged from the perspective of the operation being the first-phase of a
long-term program for the development of an area where a poor natural resource base,
harsh agro-ecological conditions, and deficient institutions and infrastructure act as major
constraints to agricultural development. Instituting a process of addressing these
constraints in a systematic way was perhaps the most important overall outcome of the
project. The NTASP, along with several other projects financed by the Bank and other
donors, have demonstrated the importance of: (a) decentralized and flexible planning and
control; (b) timely input delivery; (c) opportunistic water resources development for crops
and livestock; (d) complementary inputs and adoption packages; (e) research in dryland
farming systems; and (f) revolving credit/repayment-in-kind approaches to adoption of
improved farm practices. The Operations Evaluation Department's main findings on
successful area development projects which the Bank has financed worldwide were:
(a) clear government commitment to rural development objectives; (b) beneficiary
participation in identification, planning and implementation; (c) realistic and flexible
project design; and (d) proven technology and support services.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for
Indonesia, discussed in the meeting of Executive Directors held on March 21, 1995,
supports the Government in the following key areas: (a) maintaining growth with macro-
economic stability; (b) enhancing competitiveness; (c) reducing poverty; (d) enhancing
human resource development; and (e) managing resources sustainably. The proposed
project reflects the more decentralized region-specific approach that is now emerging and
is consistent with the Bank assistance strategy's basic approaches for poverty alleviation
and decentralization of development activities. The project has a poverty-reduction
emphasis and promotes sustainable food security while seeking out cash earning
opportunities. This strategy is consistent with GOI's approach to agricultural



development. The Bank's broad experience in the agriculture sector in Indonesia, its
projects in the eastern islands, in particular the recently completed NTASP, its sector
work (Eastern Island Rural Sector Strategy Study of 1994), and its complementary
lending program in eastern Indonesia, emphasizing rural infrastructure and community
health and nutrition, justify continued involvement in the Nusa Tenggara agricultural
development effort.
7.    Project Objectives. The proposed project's objectives are to raise smallholder
incomes, strengthen local level institutions and foster broad-based participation at the
grassroots level.
8.    Project Description. The proposed project would be implemented over six years
(1996-2002) and have three main components:
(a)   establishment of the Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agricultural
Technology (NAIAT) to carry out resource-based, farmer-participatory,
location specific, farming systems oriented, adaptive research and
technology transfer with emphasis on decentralized planning, management
and decision making;
(b)   agriculture-based area development involving intensification of
agricultural production systems in village irrigation schemes, a pilot scheme
promoting improved dryland crop/animal farm system technology,
livestock distribution on credit, forage crop development, poultry
vaccination, house plot cropping intensification, farm access roads, and
local community initiatives; and
(c)   strengthening agricultural support services and project
administration at the provincial, district and sub-district levels through
rehabilitation and improvement of agricultural support services facilities,
staff training, workshops and seminars, and technical assistance.
9.    Total project costs are estimated at US$41.1 million. The proposed loan of
US$27.0 million equivalent would finance 72 percent of the total costs, exclusive of taxes
(US$1.5 million equivalent) and vehicles and fertilizers (US$2.2 million) which GOI will
finance. GOI would provide US$12.4 million and the beneficiaries US$1.7 million. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are presented in Schedule A, and the
amounts and methods of procurement in Schedule B. A timetable for key project
processing events is in Schedule C, and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia
is given in Schedule D. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 15043-
IND, dated January 30, 1996 is being distributed separately.



-; -
10.   Project Implementation and Sustainability. Primary responsibility for
implementation of the proposed project would be at the district level. Project
interventions would be consistent with local requirements, capabilities, and stage of
development, and would be integrated with other local government activities to strengthen
regional and local development initiatives and impact. Policy guidance, coordination,
progress review and overall loan administration would be provided at the national level
through a Central Guidance Committee composed of BAPPENAS (National Development
Planning Agency), MoHA (Ministry of Home Affairs), and AARD, assisted by a Central
Project Secretariat. In the two provinces these functions would be performed by a
Provincial Coordination Committee chaired by BAPPEDA I (Provincial Development
Planning Agency) and supported by a Provincial Project Secretariat. An Advisory
Committee and Technical Working Committee, composed of representatives of the
provincial technical agencies, universities, private sector and farmer groups, has been
established in each province to guide NAIAT during project implementation. Project
management and implementation units at district level, utilizing existing structures and
procedures of the various agencies, would carry out project operations, including fund
releases, accounting, and auditing. To ensure broad beneficiary participation and
sustainability of the investments, the project would use development facilitators from
Government, private sector and local community organizations to assist the target groups
in identifying their primary constraints and priority needs, and preparing project proposals
for financing. Both the provincial and local governments would provide counterpart funds
from their budget demonstrating their strong commitment to the projects.
11.   Agreed Actions. Government's agreement to the following key actions has been
obtained during negotiations: (a) allocations for road improvement works would not
exceed predetermined limits and priority would be given to villages where needs are
demonstrated to be highest, the villagers are committed to actively contribute to the
implementation of the works, and local government agrees to maintain the completed
works; (b) all proposals for local community initiatives would be selected in accordance
with agreed criteria; (c) funding for rehabilitation, construction and improvement of RECs,
seed farms and animal health centers would be dependent on the district level governments
providing an integrated management plan for each facility; (d) beneficiaries of the cattle
and buffalo distribution programs would return two offspring for redistribution among
other interested farmers or for sale to cover part of the operating costs of the livestock
support services; (e) Government would submit to the Bank for its review and comments
not later than September 30 each year, a coordinated work program and cost estimates for
the project for the following fiscal year, and by December 31 each year, a coordinated
budget proposal for the agreed provincial work programs; and (f) a study of the impact of
current cattle trade restrictions on farmers' incomes would be submitted to the Bank by
June 30, 1997.



12.   Poverty Category. The project's main purpose is targeted poverty alleviation in
two of the poorest provinces in Indonesia. Within these provinces, income levels and
welfare standards are lowest in the farming areas where access to public services is limited
and village infrastructure is not well developed. The project would directly improve
incomes of about 75,000 households and indirectly many other households who would
have access to improved farm systems research and agricultural support services, and
enhanced local government capacity to plan and implement community development
activities.
13.   Environmental Aspects. The project is rated as a Category B project from the
standpoint of environmental impact. The environmental impact of the proposed project
interventions was found to be predominantly positive. Land use in the target areas
includes a mixture of low brush regrowth, Imperata Cylindria, and temporary arable plots
as part of shifting cultivation systems. In these circumstances, land clearing is not usually
environmentally damaging at the scale of operations anticipated. No secondary or primary
rainforest removal would occur. None of the project interventions are expected to have a
negative impact on the endangered flora and fauna in the targeted provinces, or on
existing mangrove, coral reef, or sea grass areas. The main hydrological impact would be
on surface runoff and drainage, but the establishment of conservation farming systems
would reduce runoff and improve the soil-water regime. There will be no resettlement
under the project.
14.   Gender Issues. Women in the rural areas of Nusa Tenggara play a central role in
agricultural activities, in addition to child rearing, cooking and other household tasks.
Women also do much of the work for food crop growing and in the family houseplots.
They are frequently involved in harvesting, processing and marketing of estate crops. In
addition, women are normally responsible for smaller livestock. In all areas, women are
reported to be the treasurer of the household funds. Under the project, preference would
be given to local community initiatives involving women and youth groups. Also, women
would be targeted for special training and agricultural extension services.
15.   Project Benefits. It is estimated that the project would directly benefit about
75,000 households through their participation in intensified wetland and dryland farming,
livestock, house plot intensification, and poultry vaccination. Average incomes from
wetland farming would increase by about 15 percent and from dryland farming by nearly
100 percent. Indirectly, about 40 percent of the rural community of the provinces, or
about 500,000 households, would benefit from improved farming systems research,
technology transfer, rural infrastructure and agricultural support services. Specialized
training for farmers and women would provide them with skills on improved farm and



-6-
home garden technology, livestock husbandry, forage development, soil conservation, etc.
Local government personnel would benefit from short-term training and practical
experience gained from the implementation of the proposed project as it would improve
their capacity to plan, implement and execute multi-sectoral, community-based
development programs.
16.   Economic Rate of Return. The economic benefits of project investments would
result from increased food crops, tree crops and livestock production. The ERR for the
agriculture-based area development and strengthening of agricultural support services
components (about 85 percent of total project cost) is estimated at about 17 percent.
17.   Risks. There are three major project risks. The first relates to the institutional
capabilities of the executing agencies of the local governments and possible delays in
achieving implementation targets. To minimize this risk, emphasis has been given in the
project design to training of agency staff and community leaders, concentrating these
activities in the early project years. The volume, scale and complexity of project
interventions would be planned from year to year on the basis of a realistic assessment of
institutional capacities. A second and related risk concerns the institutional complexity of
the proposed project which may cause implementation delays. This risk is being reduced
by assigning clear responsibilities to the various agencies and by using the existing
organizational structures and coordination arrangements. A third risk relates to extended
seasonal droughts which can cause severe damage and may badly impact upon project-
supported crop and livestock activities. Proper phasing of activities, emphasizing moisture
retention and providing good planting materials and breeding stock, would be the key
elements of farm assistance packages geared to minimizing the potential damage from
droughts.
18.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
