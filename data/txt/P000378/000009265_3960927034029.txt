MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A SECOND URBAN PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Cameroon for US$146.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years'
maturity, Including 5 years of grace and would assist in financing a Second
Urban Project, including improvement of urban resource mobilization, invest-
ments in priority infrastructure and a sectorwide institutional and policy
reform program.  Part of the proceeds of the loan would be channelled to the
Credit Foncier du Cameroun (CFC) at least on the same terms as the Bank loan.
The foreign exchange risk would be borne by CFC.
2.        Background and Strategy.  Urban-based activities account for over
two thirds of non-oil GDP in Cameroon.  In the country's maturing economic
structure, cities have an increasingly important role to play in national
development.  This is the case, in particular, of Douala, the main port and
economic center of the country, and Yaounde, the capital city.  The annual
non-oil GDP growth of over 6% that Cameroon has experienced between 1973 and
1984 results, to a large extent, from the steady rate of urbanization which
has allowed for a population distribution well suited to the economic poten-
tials of the country. Urban population now represents close to 40% of the
total population. By the year 2000, the city of Douala is expected to exceed
2 million inhabitants, Yaounde, 1.7 million, and several of the provincial
cities are expected to exceed 300,000 to 400,000 inhabitants. A substantial
share of the employment creation to meet the 3.2% annual population growth
will be urban-based and private-sector driven. Improving the urban centers'
economic efficiency is, therefore, one of Cameroon's key development priori-
ties.  Improved urban services and better access to urban markets play a
central role in the demand for increased agricultural production. The Govern-
ment's strategy is to establish institutions and priority urban infrastructure
to allow cities to fulfill more efficiently their commercial, administrative
and financial functions, strengthen municipalities, and improve resource
mobilization and cost recovery, to ensure maintenance of urban infrastructure
and financial sustainability of the sector.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project is the result
of a continuous sector dialogue between the Government and the Bank since
1977.  A First Urban Development Project (Ln. 2244-CM), approved in 1983, is
about to be fully disbursed. After initial difficulties, this project proved
instrumental in developing and implementing appropriate urban management
mechanisms which would be continued and strengthened under the proposed
project. Because of declining oil revenues and agricultural export earnings
in CFA terms, the country's continued capacity to support urban development is
at risk. Reduced availability of financial resources is causing the Govern-
ment to delav investments in urban infrastructure needed to preserve
urban-based economic growth and alleviate urban poverty. The proposed project
has a national scope and fully reflects the sectoral strategy which has
resulted from the dialogue between the Government and the Bank. Through the
proposed project, the Bank will support the Government's strategy in the urban
sector during the difficult period of limited financial resources and enable



-2-
the Government and the municipalities to develop alternative means of financ-
ing urban investments.
4.        Objectives.  The proposed project's main objective is to consolidate
the basis for sustainable and replicable urban development operations initiat-
ed under the First Urban Development Project. Improvement of infrastructure
and better access to urban services, especially In the least developed areas
of urban centers where the poorer segment of population settled, would greatly
contribute to economic and social growth in the urban setting.  A better
distribution of responsibility between the central Government and the munici-
palities and between public and private providers of urban services would
improve urban living and working conditions. The project will also strengthen
management capabilities of all urban agencies and prepare replicable urban
upgrading programs financed through improved cost recovery and local resource
mobilization mechanisms.
5.        Project Description.  The project would have three major complemen-
tary components to ensure the success of  .he sector strategy.  The urban
resources mobilization component (72 of project expenditures) provides for
(a) improved cost recovery through the implementation of a fiscal cadastre,
and better management of state-owned lands; and (b) financial assistance to
municipalities for on-lending to income-generating projects. The priority
infrastructure component (86x) includes (a) traffic, roads and drainage
improvements in Douala; (b) traffic management and road rehabilitation in
Yaounde; and (c) road and drainage improvements in secondary cities. Institu-
tional development (71) would allow for (a) sector policy reforms through the
implementation of an urban policy action plan; (b) the strengthening of
project management and planning capabilities of the Ministry of Town Planning
and dousing and of selected municipalities; and (c) the preparation and
implementation of an action plan to rehabilitate parapublic enterprises in the
urban and housing sectors and to stimulate the shift from public to private
sector for the provision of housing and urban services. The project also
includes studies and pilot operations to improve urban services such as waste
management and latrines. Financing for parts of related programs not included
in the proposed project is already provided by FAC, CIDA and DDA. Several
NGOs are also active in the urban sector and would participate in project
implementation.
6.        Agreed Actions.   These actions fall into two broad categories:
policy and management.   At negotiations,  agreement was reached with the
Government on:
(a) an urban policy action plan which would be Implemented under the
supervision of an urban development steering committee consisting of
representatives of the various Ministries and institutions involved
in the sector;
(b) a three-year rolling urban investment and expenditure program which
would be annually updated, reviewed, and agreed upon with the lank;
(c) an action plan to resettle the displaced households and regularize
their land rights;



-3-
(d) the preparation of an action plan, with an agreed implementation
schedule, for the rehabilitation of urban and housing sector para-
statals, with the ultimate aim of transferring responsibility for
land development to the municipalities and the private sector;
(e) the annual review by the Bank of munlcipalities' operating and
investment budgets; and
(f) the establishment of an appropriate institutional structure for the
project and the sector.
7.        Justification  and Benefits.   The  project  is expected  to yield
lasting benefits to Cameroon:  first, by its three-pronged approach of re-
source mobilization, infrastructure improvement and institutional strengthen-
ing, the project will consolidate the basis for sustainable urban development
operations already initiated under the First Urban Development Project;
secondly, through the combined action of upgrading of squatter settlements and
resettlement in the least-developed areas of the cities, the poorer segments
of the population will benefit proportionately more than other segments of the
urban population; and thirdly, by adjusting urban and housing policies under
the policy action plan, the project will enable the Government to transfer a
substantial share of responsibility for urban development to the private
sector, thereby freeing government resources for other sectors of the economy.
Building upon past involvement in the sector, the project would be a stepping
stone towards a broad base sectoral approach in future lending.
8.        Risks.  The Government's continued financial difficulties might put
the project as well as sector development at risk. This risk is being mini-
mized through:   (a) annual reviews by the Bank of the Government's urban
investment programs started, de facto, in July 1988 as part of the Public
Expenditure Review in preparation of the proposed SAL; and (b) the resource
mobilization components of the project which will improve the municipal
revenue base and help project financing in the later years. Another risk
would be the Government's slow implementation of policy reforms. This risk is
addressed through the policy action plan by clearly defining the combination
of studies and actions required to bring about policy changes. Both these
risks will also be minimized by the close monitoring through the project of
the policy action plan and the annual reviews of operating and investment
budgets of the institutions benefitting from the project.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
