  No end of project targets was established in the original Project Appraisal Document (PAD). As explained in
the PAD, the areas of intervention were to be based on the specific health service demand of the provinces and
the end target would be based on a starting point of each province. Annex 2 shows the initial implementation
targets that were identified during the development of the first Annual Workplan in 2008.

3
  Targets for the core health packages were established in 2009 in communication between the Bank and
the Ministry of Health on the Annual Workplan following a decision to concentrate the health service
packages in a few core areas. Still targets were not established for the project area; therefore, the progress
and achievement of each indicator is shown by province. Although already agreed, the targets were not
explicitly included in the formally revised Results Framework which reformulated the definitions of certain
indicators for better measurability. The ICR considers the targets set in 2009 as the end of project targets
for the purposes of evaluation and assesses the accomplishment by Province, but with some reservation
because they were not formally established as part of the Grant Agreement.

  The source of information is the end of Project report to the Bank from the Ministry of Health using the
project monitoring system. The project supported a collection of information from the official registrars of
the individual health facilities from a more limited set of communes. The numbers were similar and,
therefore, the project monitoring system data are used.

H. Restructuring (if any)

The Project was restructured (second order) three times. It was first restructured in
October of 2009 to extend the original closing date (December 31, 2010) by two years
(December 31, 2012). The Project had only begun in June 2008 after a two year design
process. The second restructuring occurred in March 2010, before the mid-term review,
streamlining and ensuring the measurability of the key performance indicators. The third
and final restructuring occurred in May 2012 allocating the unallocated portion of the
Grant in accordance with the final activity plan.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      By 2008, Vietnam had made considerable progress in improving the health status
of its population, through the improvements achieved in health indicators, greater
resource allocations for health, expanded essential services, and commitment to
increasing health insurance coverage, particularly for the poor and other vulnerable
groups. Vietnam still faced many health challenges including vulnerability to infectious
diseases, and a disease burden shifting to non-communicable diseases, injuries, and
accidents. Disparities were evident including greater severity of illness and worse health
indicators reported among the poor and those living in remote areas pointing to
continuing differences in levels and quality of health care. The Northwest and Central
Highlands regions of the country lagged behind other regions, with higher poverty and
infant and maternal mortality rates, and particular challenges for health policy
interventions in these regions. Accessibility and quality of health services was lower, and
these regions had the highest proportions of ethnic minorities, ranging from 44 percent in
Gia Lai province to 83 percent in Lai Chau and Son La. In 2004, the poverty rates among
ethnic minority groups in the Northern Mountains and Central Highlands regions were
57.4 percent and 74.4 percent, respectively, and these groups reside in areas which are
more remote and inaccessible from health services, encounter language and cultural
barriers to access, and sometimes have norms and practices that do not encourage optimal
use of health services, such as home deliveries and low utilization of family planning
services. The Project was one intervention in a series of Government efforts to reduce
disparities in health outcomes and implement the national strategy for health care for the
poor as captured in key health sector policies. The project aimed to improve access to
quality health services among the poor and disadvantaged population especially at the
commune and village level.
Rationale for World Bank engagement
2.      The project was consistent with the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) and support program for Vietnam valid during the period 2007-2011. The second
pillar of the CPS called for “strengthening social inclusion? to ensure that growth is
equitable and pro-poor, and the CPS recognized the need to support marginalized groups
through improved social services delivery.

3.      The project was financed by a Trust Fund provided by the European Commission
(EC), administered by the World Bank, granted to Vietnam and executed by the Ministry
of Health (MOH). At the time when the Project objectives and main activities were being
identified by the EC, the Bank was supporting the MOH in preparing a separate but
related Northern Uplands Region Health Support Project (NUP), which aimed to improve
the availability and utilization of health services in the underserved areas of the Northern
Uplands region and among ethnic minorities through strengthening of district health
services (hospitals and prevention centers) and reducing financial constraints to accessing
health services. The EC was becoming a more active development partner in the health
sector and had identified a health program scope that included supporting the delivery of
essential health services in the poor areas of the country targeted to the most vulnerable
population, but focused more at the commune and village level. Because the two
approaches covered three of the same provinces and had complementary objectives, joint


                                             2
implementation between the Bank and EC supported activities, where feasible, was
proposed. The EC had also requested World Bank involvement to help ensure strong
coordination in terms of the policy directions as well as harmonization and coordination
in implementation coupled by a strong fiduciary approach. The MoH saw the Bank as a
partner with strong implementation support which made the MoH want the Bank to get
involved. Although the role of the World Bank in administering the funds of another
Development Partner which also had its own direct support to the sector was debated at
the time, eventually it was agreed that the Bank had a strategic role to play in
administering and supervising the Trust Fund for the EC and supporting the MOH in
achieving its objectives.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
4.      The overall objective of the proposed project is to improve the health status of the
poor and ethnic minorities in the Northern Uplands and Central Highlands regions. The
specific project development objectives are: (i) increased coverage of essential health
services especially at the commune level; and (ii) improved health service planning5 at
the district level.

5.      The achievement of these development objectives was to be monitored through
the following key outcome indicators:
    (a) Proportion of children under age one effectively immunized with Measles and
        DTP vaccines (average level and inequality);
    (b) Proportion of women of reproductive age who have received a full range of
        standard antenatal care package during their last pregnancy (average level and
        inequality);
    (c) Proportion of community health facilities with improved availability of medical
        supplies and essential pharmaceuticals; and
    (d) Proportion of districts who meet at least 50 percent of their targets.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
6.      The PDO remained relevant and was not revised during the course of the project.
The Results Framework was revised through a Level 2 Project Restructuring in March of
2010 after a year and half of implementation demonstrated some of the deficiencies of the
original results framework. The restructuring entailed minor changes in the formulation
of the key performance indicators as well as the data collection arrangements. The
revised formulation sought to make them more specific, measurable, comparable, and
better aligned to local health information systems and with international indicators. The
specific reasoning for the modifications to each indicator is included in Annex 2.
7.      According to the restructured Results Framework, the achievement of the
development objectives was to be monitored through the following key outcome
indicators:


5
  Health service planning entails: (i) measuring health needs, (b) services (type and quantity)
needed to address those needs, (c) inputs needed to produce services, and (d) mechanisms
required to deliver them.



                                              3
           (a) Percentage of children under age one fully vaccinated against DPT and
               Measles (average level and inequality);
           (b) Percentage of delivered women who have received a minimum of 3
               prenatal visits (average level and inequality);
           (c) Percentage of delivered women having received two shots of tetanus
               vaccination and more (average level and inequality);
           (d) Proportion of commune health stations with improved availability of
               medical equipment; and
           (e) Proportion of districts who meet more than 50% of the annual target.

8.      Despite the targets for each Province having been discussed and communicated
between the World Bank and the MOH in 2009 as part of the official approval process of
the 2009 Annual Work Plan, the end of Project targets were not included in the
amendment letter of March 29, 2010. This appears to be because the end of Project target
depended on each individual starting point of the Provinces and no targets were set for the
project area as a whole. The targets discussed and agreed in 2009 as part of the Annual
Workplan Discussion and which were maintained thereafter are used as the basis of
evaluation in this ICR.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.      The project was implemented in selected districts of the provinces of Lai Chau,
Dien Bien, Son La, Kon Tum, and Gia Lai, of which the first three provinces are also be
receiving IDA support under the NUP. Therefore, these Provinces were divided into
“HEMA-districts? and “NUP-districts? for the majority of the Project implementation
period. In the end, the Project covered about 62% of Provincial territories, covering the
more rural and remote districts. The five provinces were selected by the Government of
Vietnam (GOV) and the EC based on the criteria of poverty, health need, other indicators
of vulnerability (i.e. ethnicity), and readiness of the Provincial governments. The overall
project was expected to benefit around three million people in the selected provinces (the
total population of the five provinces), while the direct beneficiaries were the recipients of
the health services offered by the Project.

10.    Specifically, the beneficiaries were as follows:
       (a) Population living in the five project provinces, including pregnant women,
           women in reproductive ages and mothers; children under 5 years old; primary
           and secondary school students; poor patients, ethnic minority patients having
           out-patient and in-patient treatment; and patients with cataracts (in 2009 only).
       (b) Health staff, including those of the communal health stations and village
           health workers, Provincial Departments of Health and other agencies such as
           reproductive health centers and Information Education and Communication
           centers, district preventive health centers and district hospitals, staff of the
           Provincial social security agency,

11.    The Project’s implementation was phased in over time as shown in the following

1.5 Original Components

12.      Component One: Scaling up Essential Health Services (€9,210,000 including
contingencies): This component intended to support provinces in scaling up delivery of
essential health services aimed at improving the health status of the population especially
at the commune level through priority cost-effective health service packages meeting the
local disease burden. The original list of interventions included: maternal health care,
community-based malnutrition prevention and treatment, integrated management of
childhood illnesses, child immunization, management of acute respiratory infection, and
reproductive health. Additionally, provinces and districts could include in the plans
creating the necessary conditions for the implementation of the service packages,
ensuring their quality and the uptake of those services by the population. This included
minor medical equipment, repair of the communal health station, medical training in
service delivery, as well as information, education and communication activities. Each
district was to be allocated a budget through a “block grant? and be expected to develop
annual plans, according to common project guidelines, that would (i) measure the health
needs, (b) define the services (type and quantity) needed to address those needs, (c) inputs
needed to produce services, and (d) mechanisms required to deliver them. The individual
plans were to be defined based on the specific needs and priorities of the individual
districts. A performance element was to be implemented with the following year’s block
grant allocation to be increased upon satisfactory achievement of targets. The commune
health level was to be the focus of 60% of expenditure, with supporting roles for districts
and provinces.

13.    Component Two: Capacity Building, Monitoring, Implementation, and
Project Management (€2,242,770 including contingencies): The second component
was to cover project management, coordination, planning and fiduciary activities through
the activities of a project management structure from the Ministry of Health, to the
Provinces, and down to the district level.



1.6 Revised Components


                                             5
14.      The project components were not revised or restructured during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes
15.     There were two significant changes to highlight during Project implementation
which were reflected in the Operational Manual of the Project. There was no need to
revise the Grant Agreement to reflect these strategic changes.

16.    First, the Project approach was simplified for the purposes of implementation as
well as to improve the measurability of the results. Instead of a menu of health service
packages from which the Provinces could pick and choose, between 2010 and 2012 a core
group of four health care packages was implemented in all 5 Provinces. These were:
      1. Community-based safe motherhood practices (antenatal care at home, tetanus
         vaccination of missing cases, home delivery by trained staff, postnatal care,
         micronutrient supplementation);
      2. Community-based prevention and treatment of malnutrition of children under 5
         years old (home monitoring, nutritional supplementation);
      3. Immunization outreach services (new Extended Program of Immunization (EPI)
         sites established to identify missing cases, missing cases immunized); and
      4. Improved access to diagnostic and curative health services provided by the
         Insurance System through the (i) provision of food and transport allowance, and
         (ii) financing of the co-payments of the poor and ethnic minorities in need of
         accessing hospital services at the district or provincial level.
17.   Additionally, following the request of the MoH, three pilot activities were
conducted in selected communes. These were:
      1. A capitation pilot of the communes “budget? (largely in drug supplies) allocated
         to the CHS from the district hospital for the provision of curative services was
         implemented in K’Bang District of Gia Lai Province (establishing a transparent
         budget to the CHS for curative services under the insurance system, provision of a
         computer, software for drug management, training and support);
      2. Hypertension monitoring and treatment pilot in selected communes of Lai Chau
         and Kon Tum Provinces (screening and management including drug supply); and
      3. Community-asthma management pilot in selected communes of Lai Chau and
         Kon Tum Provinces (screening and management including drug supply).
18.    Second, the original component design envisaged that the value of the block grant
would in part reflect the performance of the Province in meeting its targets the previous
year. This performance element for determining the budgetary allocation was never
implemented

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
19.      Project Preparation. The EC’s original “Overall Workplan?, including the
activities under the “Health Care Support for the Poor in the Northern Uplands and
Central Highlands Project? (or HEMA) related objectives and strategies, was identified in
November 2006 as essentially a results based financing (RBF) approach to delivering a
package of essential health services. The approach was not fully understood or accepted
by the Ministry of Health and it ran into early implementation difficulties. The Bank,
which originally had discussions with the EC about co-financing its operation in the
Northern Uplands, was brought back into the discussion on HEMA to help the MOH and
the EC in making the project more operational in the context of Vietnam and there was
discussion on a re-design of the Project through September 2008 during which there were
many difficulties in harmonizing the approaches and the procedures of all three parties,
but particularly the two development partners. There was a debate at the time about the
Bank’s involvement, but eventually it was agreed that the Bank would be involved in
administering and supervising part of the EC’s resources for HEMA’s as a stand-alone
trust fund in order to be of support to the Ministry, a key development partner and to learn
from the HEMA experience for the purposes of health policy.

20.     Project Design. The EC’s Overall Workplan for HEMA was a significantly
larger program of which the World Bank-administered Trust Fund was only one mode of
assistance. Components excluded from the World Bank supported Project and, therefore,
remaining for EC direct funding included: (a) strengthening advocacy and patient
feedback, (b) quality assurance mechanisms, and (c) piloting a link between the health
management information system of the Provincial Department of Health and the
Provincial level Vietnam Social Security Agency (VSS). These other activity areas were
originally meant as a complement to an RBF project design. Based on the early
experience of the EC support and even the readiness of Vietnam now, it is clear that the
Vietnam context and readiness for an RBF approach was premature at the time. The
world experience in RBF was in its early phase; the context of Vietnam with its
traditional, fairly well developed, but inflexible public finance procedures was not
conducive to such an approach; and the understanding and readiness of the Ministry of
Health and the Provincial authorities for such a different approach to the usual procedures
was just not developed. To achieve the ultimate objective, it was appropriate for the
Bank-administered Trust Fund in support of the HEMA Project to refocus the operational
approach to delivering a package of essential health services to the most vulnerable
population by financing all of the necessary inputs (including fairly direct incentives for
outreach services) given the context at the time. It was also appropriate for the Trust
Fund to focus on the core objectives of the service delivery and planning for the service
delivery, as opposed to encompassing the additional components that were part of the
original Overall Workplan which were less essential once an RBF approach was not taken.

21.     While the project design presented a realistic and selective approach, there were a
number of key technical analyses not described in the PAD. This is probably attributable
to the fact that the project is a small Trust Fund and the PAD appears to be a simplified
version of the standard documentation. Nevertheless, the limitations in the analysis
which appeared to having some bearing on the design were:


                                             7
   (a) Results framework: The targets for the end of project results were not clearly
       established during project design. Additionally, the range and nature of changes
       to some indicators during implementation -- to improve the measurability and
       comparability with the information produced from records furnished by health
       providers -- indicate deficiencies with the original Results Framework;
   (b) Sustainability: The project design delivered health services and developed a
       planning approach by financing the needed medical supplies, paying for outreach
       services and salary supplements to village health workers (from EC direct
       financing). Capacity and planning for service delivery was supported with a
       significant amount of technical assistance from the center and supervision support
       from Provincial authorities through a dedicated team and provision of travel
       allowances. It was not clear from the PAD if the goal of any or all of these
       approaches was to be sustained or absorbed in Government systems, although the
       focus on capacity development would imply that there was some objective for
       sustainability.
   (c) Technical background and justification: There was a lack of key background
       information for sound project design or the rationale behind project design and
       these include an economic or cost-effectiveness analysis, although cost-
       effectiveness was clearly a priority in identifying the essential health service
       packages; gender analysis (though there was an explicit focus on women under
       project activities); and health seeking behavior analysis, although the project drew
       on the social assessment of the Northern provinces (see section 2.4 regarding
       Safeguards).
22.   The project initially had only a 2.5 year implementation period (June 2008 to
December 2010) which is quite short and for which there was no parallel in the
Vietnam portfolio. It was clear early on that the project would require a longer
implementation period and, therefore, the project was extended once for a period of
two years (until December 31, 2012).

23.     The PAD identified the risks that interventions might not address the most
pressing health needs; that barriers to health care for the poor and ethnic minorities would
persist; that capacity at commune to plan and implement was weak; and that lack of
coordination among donors would slow project implementation. Satisfactory mitigating
approaches were included, although not all were satisfactorily realized (such as joint
donor collaboration). Other project risks existed and could have been foreseen at project
preparation – in particular, the risk of burdensome project management and ambitious
project approach being too great for provincial and district-level capacity.

24.     Although not specified in the PAD, lessons from the Bank’s earlier and on-going
portfolio had largely been reflected in project design. These included the concentration of
intervention sites within a limited number and homogenous group of provinces for
improved project design, increased manageability of the project, and focus of the Bank’s
implementation support. The project did not try to be overly ambitious, concentrating on
service delivery, capacity building and improved planning for service delivery. Finally,
the project design was adapted to the implementation environment of Vietnam. It was
first conceived that the project would use a results-based financing approach for the


                                             8
delivery of the health services. Only now is Vietnam starting to explore with results
based financing, although a dedicated operation using this modality in the health sector
has yet to be developed. The Bank team recognized this and correctly found an
alternative modality whereby the Provincial health service plans were translated into
inputs for results and the Bank then financed the block grant needed to finance the inputs.
This approach was maybe not as results-oriented as a more ideal design, but it worked for
Vietnam at the time.

25.      Quality at Entry. There was no Quality at Entry assessment undertaken by the
Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG). As discussed above, the rationale of the project
was clear. The Government, in particular the Provinces, was committed to the operation.
The design was fairly simple, although during implementation it was simplified further in
part because of the capacity constraints, but more importantly to ensure the measurability
of results. The key technical assistance to provide the capacity development support –
directly financed from the EC – was mobilized and in place before the project started, but
there were some turnover in key team members of the contractor early on during
implementation. It was planned as part of project design that the first year of
implementation would focus on capacity building of the Provinces which did in fact
prove to be necessary. Having a clear established framework for measuring results,
including targets, was not in place because the project design left the choice of health services
to be implemented on the ground open to the Provinces. Initial targets were established in the
first annual workplan (AWP), but then were later modified in 2009 and prior to the midterm
review to be more realistic and to concentrate on a few core service areas.
2.2 Implementation
26.      The Project implementation arrangements were quite challenging. As already
described in the discussion on project beneficiaries, the project by design was
implementing in some of the most difficult areas of the country and with hard to reach
target groups. Complex implementation arrangements and a low capacity environment
inevitably caused certain delays. By the midterm review in December 2010, the project
had disbursed a little more than 38% of the Trust Fund. By the end of the project
disbursement period (October 31, 2012), the Trust Fund was fully disbursed at more than
99% with less than US$100,000 equivalent (less than Euro 64,000) undisbursed. The
midterm disbursement was, by Vietnam portfolio standards, marginally satisfactory. The
project extension in 2009 did not record a revised disbursement schedule and, therefore, it
is difficult to assess whether it was disbursing below or above projections.

27.     As mentioned earlier, the project was beset by challenges in responding to and
coordinating among two development partners and in the context of the Vietnam’s own
complex administrative and health system. The Trust Fund was administered by the
World Bank, but additional technical support was provided by the EC through direct
financing. On the positive side, the project had technical support from both the EC and
the World Bank. On the negative side, the project had two reporting and approval
authorities with differing requirements. Implementation experience demonstrated several
disadvantages of the model: (a) continued difficulty in appropriately defining the roles in
implementation arrangements between key parties; (b) a ‘double burden’ of World Bank
and direct EC project supervision, including separate midterm reviews and sometimes
separate financial controls; and (c) the complexity of project management arrangements


                                               9
slowing implementation progress as the midterm review pointed out. Both World Bank
and EC project members had the right intention in adding value to project
implementation, but differences in approaches were sometimes challenging to breach.

28.     There was an almost two-year period between the finalization of the Overall
Workplan in December 2006 and finally the Grant Agreement effectiveness in September
2008, during which time a large contract for the EC-funded technical assistance was
mobilized. The technical assistance, as originally envisaged by the EC, was to be based
in the Provinces, working on a day-to-day basis with the Provinces in monitoring the
health needs of the population and providing support in the design of health service
delivery plans. This was not feasible for practical reasons (ability to retain highly
qualified staff in remote regions of the country), in addition to the country’s sensitivity in
placing international staff in the border areas of Vietnam. The team that was originally
contracted was also recruited on the basis of implementing an RBF model and the
operational approach was significantly changed. Consequently, there was a turnover in
key EC-financed consultants supporting implementation and the technical support
became centralized, although with regular supporting visits from the Central Project
Management Unit (CPMU) in Hanoi. The EC rules did not allow for any modification of
the contract with the consultants three years after the initial contracting, causing some
constraints in the final years of the project implementation (since the HEMA Project
supported by the Trust Fund started about 2 years after the technical assistance contract
started).

29.     Procurement began in 2008, but critical delays were noted in the approval of the
2009 annual work plan. The slow pace of implementation became a major concern.
Causes included lack of qualified staff at provincial and district levels to implement the
complex project management model of HEMA. There was a high turn-over of available
staff, part-time availability of staff, and an understandable lack of experience with World
Bank and EC procedural requirements at the local level. This affected project
management including procurement, financial management and annual work planning. It
also affected monitoring and evaluation; arrangements which were not yet fully
appropriate and were too complex.

30.     By late 2010, implementation progress was rated as moderately unsatisfactory due
to a low project disbursement rate (given the amount of time for implementation) and
poor financial management due to the lack of capacity to manage rapidly increasing
demands for disbursement. Key mid-term review recommendations included: (a) CPMU
improvement of project management and supervision performance; (b) 2011 and 2012
plans to focus more on easily-implementable activities to improve disbursement rates; (c)
resolution to the nutritional supplement procurement problem; (d) planning and initiation
of pilot activities; and (e) action on financial management concerns (see 2.4). The EC
held a separate midterm review and stressed the need to improve the supervision to ensure
that services were not only being delivered, but also the services were being provided
with quality. The Bank and EC teams were unable to coordinate the midterm review
missions because of scheduling conflicts, but as a result came out with two separate
reports and findings. The 2011 AWP focused on both ramping up services as well as
increasing the attention to the quality of those services and increased capacity building in


                                             10
response to the midterm recommendations. The concerted joint actions by Government
and technical advisors to respond to most of the concerns raised by the midterm review
recommendations resulted in a significant improvement in implementation progress.
Likely contributors to improved implementation by 2012 (during which the Project
reached 99% disbursement) included revisions to the project and results framework;
staffing efforts to fill all project vacancies including training coordinator positions and
additional Trust Fund-supported accountants in each PPMU; significant capacity building
and management inputs leading to greater familiarity and capacity at local levels, and
planning process improvements.

31.     The lack of a sustainability/mainstreaming plan or exit strategy was not addressed
until 2011, when the project launched significant efforts to develop exit strategies and
advocacy of project approaches, with encouragement from the development partners and
the Government. Dissemination and advocacy were major approaches to the exit
strategy. There was strong commitment from Provincial and District levels to
sustainability planning, but constrained by those activities requiring additional resources.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.      Design. Project design choices made monitoring and evaluation (M&E) difficult.
The priority of demand-driven, bottom-up planning approach, the original ‘open menu’
approach of nine health care packages, and continual expansion of project target areas
made comparison in measurement challenging, and prevented the possibility of setting
project targets before the project implementation arrangements were simplified. It was
proposed that targets were to vary depending on the local context and ‘starting point’ and
would be updated in each planning cycle. The phased implementation, adding new
districts from year to year, also made it difficult to analyze trends in performance
indicators for the overall project area. End of project targets were established once the
design of the Project was simplified; however, the end of project targets were not
included in the Results Framework description which was part of the side letter to the
Grant Agreement. Instead they were only confirmed between the parties as part of the
AWP approval process. This puts a limit on the accountability for the final results.

33.      There was no control group established for the purposes of establishing a
reasonable “counterfactual? against which to evaluate the results of the Project. The
monitoring of project indicators did not extend to the districts where the project was
planning to be implemented, but had not yet started. Some of the indicators were already
being collected from the regular reporting system or registrars, but some were project
specific and only collected once the project started to work in that district. Retroactively
looking at the data in the registrars of the districts that was phased into the project at a
later stage (for a possible control group and a difference-in-difference evaluation design)
did not appear to be an option because experience showed that the registrar data quality
quite often was not very good and over-reported results which was only corrected after
the project team started to work with the communes on their data reporting quality.

34.     The choice of project indicators assisted a realistic and achievable project focus
aligned to the project’s activities. This contributed to a demonstration of project results
directly attributable to project intervention though this may come at a cost of measuring



                                            11
broader (intermediate) health outcomes. However, the indicators measured include those
interventions (immunization, safe delivery practices) which have been proven
internationally to result in improved health outcomes.

35.     The calibration of the original results indicators with local data collection practice
and standard indicators was addressed during early project restructuring. The scope of
changes suggests some deficiency of the results framework at the design stage. The
restructured Results Framework significantly improved the alignment and appropriateness
of monitoring indicators.

36.     Results were not disaggregated by ethnic minority groups nor by income level,
which reduced the reporting burden, but also the ability to measure impact on target
groups and to demonstrate the improved equity of the indicators which was to be
monitored as part of the Results Framework. The approach to targeting implementation
in the location of the most poor and ethnic minority communities gives some reasonable
assurance of the project’s pro-poor and vulnerable group focus. Quality of service
delivery was not explicitly measured in the results framework. HEMA’s criteria and tools
to evaluate the quality of implementation were based on the regulations and guidelines of
the national target programs.

37.   Implementation. Significant challenges were experienced in implementing
monitoring and evaluation:
   •   The need to revise the Results Framework fairly shortly after the project become
       effective saw intensive work undertaken by the team in 2009 with the Results
       Framework legally amended in March 2010.
   •   The lack of adequate, qualified human resources for monitoring and evaluation at
       the local level and the need for significant technical support to meet project
       requirements in this area. This was a significant concern particularly for the
       District level, as there was insufficient qualified and available staff at the
       provincial levels to support all Districts;
   •   The misalignment of quarterly monitoring and evaluation reporting with EC/Bank
       supervision mission reporting period requirements meant additional reporting;
   •   The Results Framework called for an assessment of the “inequality? of the results.
       Project indicators do not capture “income? or similar information either through
       the project’s direct monitoring system or through the routine health information
       system. In the end, the MoH CPMU utilized a comparison between the relative
       improvements in the richer project communes as opposed to the poorer project
       communes, but this was a comparison between one project intervention area to
       another intervention area.
   •   Several remedial measures used to try to balance M&E system limitations
       included a survey to collect administrative data from providers for comparison to
       separately reported project data to ensure that the data was not being mis-reported.
   •   Indicators which were captured by the routine health information system were
       collected from non-HEMA communes in project provinces as a poor


                                             12
       counterfactual. This was not optimal as some spillover effect would be
       anticipated and the non-HEMA communes were, by design, more urban and,
       therefore, probably had more Kinh majority living in them as well. These
       attempts to complement the project’s monitoring system were quite heavy in
       terms of administration and did not yield much in terms of new information for
       moving beyond monitoring of results to evaluation.
38.     Utilization. After the correction of the Results Framework through project
restructuring in March 2010, there was an intensive monitoring of the project results
which were used to assess progress and to plan for the next year’s activities, from the
commune health station up to the Ministry of Health project management team. This was
very much built into the project design of planning health services from the bottom up. As
discussed, the project design did not lend itself to very effective evaluation. The EC-
supported technical assistance tried to make up for this later in the project with evaluations
of the individual supported health care packages, but the framework and rigor of these
analyses were limited.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard compliance
39.     The Bank’s safeguard policy on Indigenous People (OP4.10) was triggered.
Rather than any adverse impacts, objectives of the project included improvements of
access to and utilization of quality health care services among ethnic minority groups and
better health outcomes. As the entire project was considered as an ethnic minority
development plan, no freestanding plan or framework was required. A baseline
Household Survey of the five project provinces was conducted to study dimensions of
ethnic minority culture that would have a bearing on project design with regard to both
improved health service delivery and knowledge and access by ethnic minority groups. A
Social Impact Assessment was conducted for the NUP project, covering three of the same
project provinces, identifying issues in approaching diverse ethnic minority groups in
Vietnam, therefore bearing some relevance to all project areas. Key safeguards
approaches employed, and assessment of their application by the project, are as follows:
       (a) A basic selection criterion was percentage of ethnic minorities. This was
           calculated on a provincial basis, but faced limitations as detailed below in 3.5
           (a).
       (b) Commune level focus: Sixty percent of the trust fund financing was
           satisfactorily allocated for health care packages at the commune level where
           the majority of ethnic minorities in the five provinces were identified as
           seeking health care;
       (c) IEC for minority groups: The project was to support health advocacy and
           promotion activities that would be tailored specifically to ethnic minority
           groups to encourage utilization of health services. IEC materials demonstrated
           some limited tailoring to ethnic minority needs, recognizing issues such as
           reliance on village health workers to translate into ethnic languages, and
           gender challenges as male village health workers faced reluctance from the
           women from Dien Bien as they did not want to be exposed to males who were
           not their husbands; and



                                             13
       (d) Monitoring and evaluation activities were to focus on the impact of the
           project on ethnic minorities, particularly in terms of their access to and use
           of health services as well as the responsiveness of health services and
           advocacy activities to the needs of ethnic minority groups. As detailed in 3.5
           (a), this was not satisfactorily integrated in the design as there was no
           measurement proposed in the initial results framework; it was not integrated in
           the restructured results indicators; and so was not implemented as there was no
           measurement disaggregated to ethnic minority status.
Fiduciary Compliance
    - Financial Management
40.     Initial financial management performance was moderately satisfactory, with
adequate project financial management system in place that could provide, with
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information that Bank loan proceeds were used
for the intended purposes. Financial management faced increasing deficiencies to the
mid-term review point, when a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating was recorded. Specific
problems noted were:
    (a) the shortage of qualified staff at the District and Provincial levels in 2009 and
        2010 impacted negatively on financial management performance by 2010. This
        included the part-time nature of project management roles and high turnover of
        staff;
   (b) interruption to interim financial reporting when the CPMU could not reconcile
       fund balance and total expenditures from PPMUs;
   (c) some gaps in supporting documents from local levels;
   (d) weaknesses in internal controls noted at Central and Provincial level related to
       authorized signatories, VAT refund, provision of guarantees and segregation of
       duties in the cash payment process;
   (e) increased magnitude of the problem of delay in verification of expenditures by
       State Treasury; with large amounts outstanding, raising questions about eligibility
       of expenditures and adequacy of supporting documents. This also caused a
       shortage of available funds in the Designated Account;
   (f) problems in managing fund flow including not advancing funds to pay for value
       added tax;
   (g) lack of efficiency causing the tranche transfer mechanism between CPMU and
       PPMUs to not be maintained, transferring instead on a reimbursement basis
       causing PPMU fund shortages; and
   (h) the practice of temporarily borrowing Trust Fund monies to pay for expenditures
       under EU direct funding or counterpart funding.
41.     Most of these problems were addressed by 2011-2012 with a significant
improvement in financial management practices, with an upgrading to satisfactory by the
end of the Project.

42.    Better project design supporting provincial level financial management
responsibility may have improved performance. In a local-level service-delivery project


                                           14
such as HEMA, financial management performance could have been improved with
greater training and detailed reporting requirements in the operations manual to build
capacity for provincial level, closer to where actual transactions and supporting
documents are generated. The disadvantage of such an approach would have been to
further add to the significant project management burden at provincial levels which had
limited capacity.

   -   Disbursement
43.     Up to November 2009, the project had disbursed only 20%, although half of the
project period had elapsed up to the original closing date. The main reasons were slow
implementation of project activities and slow process of State Treasury expenditure
verification. The CPMU and PPMU committed to improve disbursements through the
procurement and disbursement plans for 2010.

44.    There was significant technical support to provincial and district levels to improve
implementation and also disbursement. The threshold of the designated account was
increased from 2.5 million USD to 5.0 million USD, and tranche sizes were adjusted from
50-25-25% of the annual budget to 70-30%.

45.     With strong improvements to project management and implementation, the
disbursement rate had much improved to 59% overall by May 2011, 92% overall by Q1
2012 and 99.97% disbursed by Q4 2012. A slow-disbursing project had thus significantly
improved and was able to fully disburse by the extended closing date. This achievement
had been supported by close monitoring of project disbursement at CPMU and PPMU
levels, and close supervision of disbursement rate by the Bank particularly at the mid-
term review stage. Some PPMUs allocated budgets to district levels based partly on
budget and partly on implementation progress and supporting document submission. This
practice was well-received and acted as a motivation for lower levels to speed up their
activities and complete financial management transactions.

   -   Procurement
46.     Project procurement is rated satisfactory overall. While procurement was
continuously rated ‘moderately satisfactory’ until project closure, overall there were no
significant shortcomings in procurement approach beyond some isolated problems and
some early slowness due to unfamiliarity with Bank procedures. Key procurement
categories included operating costs, training, consulting services, refurbishment of
Community Health Stations, office and IEC equipment, medical equipment and supplies
for health care packages. Most packages were procured under Shopping.

47.     The project management structure also assisted the satisfactory implementation of
procurement arrangements, but these were also negatively affected by human resource
capacity constraints at local levels, including the part-time nature of project officer roles.
Challenges which negatively affected activity implementation included the geography of
project areas making transport difficult, delays to contract execution, and late delivery of
goods to districts and communes. Two specific procurement problems included:




                                             15
           (a) An important delay in one child nutritional supplementation package,
               which was a significant concern during supervision given the risk for
               harmful impacts on child health outcomes; and
           (b) One contract awarded was not strictly in accordance with Bank Guidelines
               due to inappropriately timed negotiations on the price of goods between
               the PPMU and the contractor. Payment of the contract was unreasonably
               delayed after delivery of goods. Exceptional no objection was issued on
               the basis that no precedent would be set.
48.     In total the project completed 370 out of 415 procurement packages; the annual
rates of completion of the procurement plan improved each year (97% for the year 2011
and 100% for the year 2012). The cancelled packages are mainly consulting services and
these cancellations did not affect the project implementation as they were either no longer
necessary or combined with other activities.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
49.    The Ministry of Health continues to have a priority of addressing the priority
health needs of the poor and ethnic minority population and is reviewing the HEMA
experience for lessons learned. A number of Project dissemination and discussion events
have been held including the attention of senior MoH management.

50.      State financing is available to continue some of the Project activities, including
the existing national targeted programs (Safe Motherhood, EPI, and Nutrition) and
Government Decision 14 amending Decision 139 which will establish a mechanism to
support the transport and meal allowance for the poor and ethnic minority living in
difficult communes. It is not likely that the same level of support under these programs
will be provided. For instance, the coverage scope of the EPI National Targeted Program
is almost universal. However, the Project demonstrated that missing immunization cases
can be identified and effectively addressed at the village level. This takes the outreach
services and organization to address these gaps in coverage. Generally, the following
support is seen at risk: covering the co-payments for hospital based treatment; the travel
allowances for all of the outreach activities by the provincial, district and communal
health authorities; multi-nutrient fortification as opposed to iron fortification for new
mothers; other inputs such as safe-delivery kits and the medicine needed to manage
asthma; and information education activities focused on specific target groups with
incentives for attending such as refreshments. The capacity building of provincial and
district health staff in support of improved health planning should yield some but limited
benefits for their own planning of NTP and related activities.

51.    A number of on-going and planned projects have been identified as future sources
of support to sustain the positive outcomes engendered under HEMA. These include:

   (a) The broader EU Health Sector Capacity Support Project (HSCSP) strengthens
       MoH capacity in designing, piloting, testing and replicating reform tools in policy
       planning and budgeting, management and regulation, inter-agency coordination,
       and delivery of quality health services focusing on primary and preventive health.
       The EU Health Sector Capacity Support Project has been cited as a lever for



                                            16
       disseminating HEMA strategies on capitation, community-based management of
       chronic diseases and planning and M&E.
   (b) The EU Delegation is currently discussing further performance-based budget
       support to the health sector which may provide both incentives as well as
       resources to continue some of the delivery and supervision of essential health
       services in the provinces, districts, communes and ultimately the villages.
   (c) The World Bank Northern Uplands Project (NUP) partners with HEMA in the
       three Northern provinces. It mainly supports district hospitals and planning is
       underway to continue HEMA support in the HEMA-districts for reducing the
       financial burden to seeking hospital care by providing a meal and transport
       allowance.
   (d) The ADB/SIDA regional support operation in the Central Highlands aims to
       improve accessibility and support quality health services to the poor in five
       provinces including Gia Lai and Kontum. It remains to be seen if that project will
       continue the meals and transport allowance to the poor and ethnic minority
       population seeking hospital care.
   (e) The World Bank is discussing with the Ministry of Health a Results Based Financing
       approach to improve the supply and quality of primary health care services.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
52.      The project is assessed as highly relevant to the development priorities of the
Government of Viet Nam both at outset and at completion. These priorities include
improving health outcomes among ethnic minority groups, particularly through improved
utilization of health services and expanded delivery of essential services in the areas of
maternal and child health, nutrition, and reproductive health. The project is also relevant
to the development priorities supported by the Bank and the EC. The initial design
approach to tailor selection of packages for Provinces was not implemented, with the
same four packages provided in all provinces. This made the project more implementable
but also reduced the direct tailored relevance to each Province.

53.     The new World Bank Country Partnership Strategy for Vietnam 2012-2016 notes
factors that make the project again highly relevant to Vietnam’s development priorities:
    (a) In 2010 ethnic minorities made up 65% of the poorest quintile group in Vietnam,
        up from 63% in 2006;
   (b) The World Bank is supporting the Government of Vietnam in its efforts to
       reframe its strategy to reduce poverty, vulnerability and inequality with the aim of
       ensuring more rapid progress for those left behind, with particular focus on ethnic
       minority households;
   (c) World Bank-supported sector interventions which would target the poor and
       regions with high ethnic minority poverty;
   (d) Regional Health projects will continue to subsidize access to health insurance for
       the near-poor and thus address one of the major shocks that risk pushing
       vulnerable households back into poverty. This includes achieving the CPS


                                            17
       outcome of the percentage of health insurance coverage among the poor and near
       poor in targeted regions.


Impact of HEMA: Relevance to National Policies and Programs
54.     The Ministry of Health has noted the significance of HEMA project contributions
to build the capacity for planning and activity management of health professionals at
different levels, extend the effect of the National Targeted Programs and contribute to
major policy decisions on health care in Vietnam, particularly on Decision 14 amending
Decision 139 re-launching the Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFP) providing
subsidized access to health services for the poor including reducing the out-of-pocket
costs of seeking care (meals, transport).
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
55.     The project has been marginally satisfactory in achieving its project
development objectives of (a) increasing population coverage with essential health
interventions, and (b) improving health service planning at the district level. A
direct interpretation of the achievement of the project indicators shows solid achievement.
As shown below, the project met or surpassed the objective-level targets for all indicators
except for one which was largely met with 3 provinces shy of their targets.

56.      Health Service Delivery. The continuous improvement in the range of health
indicators included across the project period and in particular in the last 1-2 years of
implementation is a significant achievement (see Annex 2 for detailed outputs). There was
significant improvement in all health service delivery indicators 3 years after the start of
project implementation, with several exceeding targets. The percentage of children under age
one fully vaccinated against DPT and Measles? had clearly progressed (increasing 28.6%).
The proportion of delivered women provided with enough multi-nutrient supplement tablets
experienced the highest rise (90.7%) as the multi-nutrient supplement was supported by the
Project and the NTP provides a limited supply of iron supplements. Although the increase of
three other indicators of pregnancy care and safe motherhood was lower (23.9% to 42.7%),
the reported change in behaviors related to care before and during delivery among pregnant
women, especially ethnic minority ones living in remote, as well as economically and
geographically underprivileged areas, was quite positive. The indicators regarding the use of
curative care services among local people (inpatient consultations at district hospital;
outpatient consultations at CHS) had increased significantly, but did not reach the targets set
out by the project with respect to outpatient services The health system is still not set up to
put primary health care services at the forefront of the service delivery network, with some
drug stock-outs, short prescription dispensing periods, and a draw to seek more quality care at
the hospital level for any simple curative services. Despite this, the fact that outpatient
consultations increased is seen as an accomplishment. It is clear that the pattern of accessing
health services and inpatient/outpatient health services among local people at CHSs and
district hospitals changed.

57.     Limitations in interpretation of the results: First, it unknown what would have
been the natural improvement in the indicators without the Project. The review of results
draws on the indicator survey of 2011 and the Project monitoring system, which included
200 of the project communes which joined the project early on. A quasi-control group of
30 non-project communes were selected but they were still within project districts,
therefore likely generating several confounders in the analysis that might under-estimate
the impacts of the project (spill-over effects and observable/non-observable differences in
commune characteristics). Also, without a real control group it is difficult to differentiate
the impact of the project interventions from the possible effects of regular national
programs and from the socio-economic development in the country. The quasi-control
group did show a significant and positive difference for the important service delivery
indicators of children immunized, women having received at least 3 prenatal checkups,
and a woman who has delivered receiving at least two tetanus shots and micronutrient
supplementation. The project also monitored the rate of underweight children (under 5
years old). The project area saw a 1.9% decline, but less than that in the quasi-control
group. This is most likely due to the differences in the commune types. Those
communes in the project districts were likely to be relatively more urban and with more
Kinh majority inhabitants both characteristics likely to be associated with less
malnutrition.

58.     Second, as discussed earlier, the end of Project targets were not formally
established as part of the Results Framework legally agreed between the Bank and the



                                              20
Grantee. This puts a limitation on the use of the end of Project targets used as part of the
Annual Work Plan process.

59.     Finally, the revised Results Framework set out the indicators should improve on
average and in terms of improving the distribution of the services across different groups
(equity is mentioned but it does not mention on the basis of what, i.e. income or
ethnicity). The targeting of the project activities was on the poor and ethnic minorities
and, therefore, there is assurance that the Project benefitted the intended groups to
improve equity. However, there was no real quantifiable measurement of the
improvement between different groups.

60.     Health Service Planning Capacity. Improvement in Health Service Planning at
the District Level has also been significant – but with uncertainty over sustainability of
benefits and impact on broader government processes. There has been significantly
expanded capacity of Districts and Provinces to plan, monitor and report using bottom-up
processes, supported by significant training activities through the project, strong
ownership of Provincial and District counterparts of these processes, and significant
technical support from the central and provincial levels. Stakeholders point to the
capacity development being the single most valuable project contribution. The indicators
show that the provinces have been successful in developing timely plans that have met
their health service delivery targets. The indicators to measure improved capacity were
rather limited and directly related to the project planning process. The project was
nonetheless satisfactory in achieving this result. However, the project counterparts have
indicated concern that strengthening district and provincial planning capacity with a
bottom-up planning orientation will not be sustained within a top-down planning system
as is currently the case within the Government’s administration. Implementation of the
project sought only to improve planning capacity at district level related to the planning
of HEMA interventions and not to entire District or Provincial Health Plans. There has
been no agreed approach to adopt bottom-up project planning as an approach relevant to
broader participatory planning of the Government’s own budgets at District and
Provincial level. The HEMA project model placed significant project planning and
management burden on planning officers in PPMUs, who did frequent travel and direct
capacity building support to District levels. Without HEMA allowances and capacity
building support this function and level of support will likely reduce.
3.3 Efficiency
61.      The Project Appraisal Document set out no financial or economic analysis upon
which to compare the final costs and benefits. It should be noted that the project
successfully supported effective health service delivery through primary health care and
commune-level community-based approaches, increased commune-level service
utilization and reduced referral to higher levels of treatment. The project also produced
helpful evidence on these efforts to guide national policy. The hypertension and asthma
pilots further demonstrated community-based approaches to non-communicable diseases
which were also helpful in reducing costs of treatment through prevention as opposed to
more expensive inpatient treatment. Satisfactory focus of expenditure at the commune
level (60%), supplemented by support to district (20%) and province (20%) costs,
contributed to a strong efficiency outcome of project expenditures on health service
delivery.


                                            21
62.      There is reason to assert that the cost of individual activities were reasonable as
they were based on finely reviewed cost norms as per Government of Vietnam
regulations and EU Guidelines. Since the Project paid based on inputs, including travel
and per diem for supervision and outreach services, there is also reason to believe that
there was incentive to use these expenditures as incentives for staff and were therefore
maximized not necessarily for what was necessary to deliver the services. The
assessments that were undertaken by the project of the health care packages during the
last several months intended to consider elements of cost-effectiveness of the project
activities, but did not present this in the report, instead confusing efficiency with
effectiveness.

63.     Evidence indicates that similar project results could have been achieved at lower
management cost. The Capacity Building Component of the Project, which included
project management, monitoring and evaluation, technical support, as well as training and
workshops accounted for close to 24% of the total Trust Fund value. Additionally, the
EC provided a parallel grant close to Euro 6.3 million that provided technical assistance
that was both technical in nature (advising on the health care package implementation), as
well as for coordination and management support, incremental operating costs and
monitoring and evaluation. Stakeholders involved in the process noted concerns at this
cost which is significant compared to the Trust Fund value of Euro 11.4 million (more
than 50%). On the one hand, the technical support from the consultants contracted by the
EU was invaluable in providing the providing the provinces and districts with training
and support. On the other hand, this accounted for unsustainable project management and
technical model that very reasonably cannot be sustained by the national and local
governments. The double oversight model constituted an unsatisfactory compromise
between the two donors and Government and presented a ‘double burden’ of supervision
by EU and the World Bank. It was inefficient and imposed a greater burden than was
necessary to achieve project development objectives. The EU midterm review found that
disproportional time and effort investment was required in HEMA management systems,
and that it would have benefited HEMA technically and programmatically if a simpler
approach had been selected at design phase. This view was shared by all partners.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
64.     The project was highly relevant to development priorities in Vietnam both at
outset and at completion. It successfully contributed to national policy reform and
programs benefiting the poor, introducing highly useful evidence from experience and
outcomes. The project was satisfactory in achieving the indicators used to directly
measure project outcome. The project increased population covered with essential health
interventions through scaled-up health services at the commune level. The project also
significantly improved health services planning at the district level.

65.     In spite of the achievements reached under the project, the Overall Outcome Rating
is conservatively put as moderately satisfactory, for the following reasons: even after the
restructuring there were limitations still in using the Results Framework to conclude
information on the Project’s outcomes because of the end of project targets not being


                                            22
established in the Grant Agreement, lack of control group, and lack of consistent
measurement of improved equity; there are significant concerns as to the efficiency with
which these results were achieved due to the significant project oversight and management
arrangements; and the sustainability of the Project outcomes is at significant risk.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
66.     The project has been highly relevant in its focus on expanding the scale of health
services for the poor and ethnic minorities in project-participating provinces, with
appropriate health packages to tackle the burden of disease in those areas. Further
analysis is warranted on whether the poor and ethnic minorities fully benefited from the
project. Ethnic minority populations range from 44% to 83% within project provinces.
The HEMA project assumes a strong link between ethnic minority status and poverty
because of the strong correlation of data. According to a 2009 World Bank report based
on the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) 2006 data, the general
poverty rate for ethnic minority groups was 52.3%, of which 54% were living in rural
areas. This is significantly higher than the poverty rate for the ethnic majority, which was
13.5% overall in 2006, and only 3.2% in urban areas. The project included criteria for
project participation including poverty rates and ethnic minority participation. Another
criterion was for basic capacity and accessibility for service delivery, which likely
excluded perhaps the most remote and vulnerable districts in which the poor and ethnic
minorities resided. As the poor were the main target of HEMA interventions, HEMA
focused less on characteristics related to ethnic minorities. Considering the approaches
undertaken under the project such as outreach, it is reasonable to assume that the project
provided significant improvement in health for ethnic minority people. However, the lack
of specific breakdown of measurement by income group or by ethnic minority status
reduces the ability to categorically state the adequacy of pro-poor and pro-ethnic minority
focus.

67.     Behavior change among ethnic minorities was implicitly targeted in the project
approach as it focused on reaching ethnic minority communities through their communal
members, in particular the village health worker. A social assessment was drawn from
the NUP project, presenting several cultural and behavioral factors for consideration, but
only for ethnic minorities in three of the five provinces HEMA targeted. The assessment
of IEC strategy also noted a range of contextual cultural issues of ethnic minority groups,
assessing the project’s approach and suggestions for integrating cultural factors into better
access to quality service delivery. The wide range of ethnic groups benefiting from the
project made a specific behavior change strategy more difficult, requiring generic
approaches. The variety of languages and orientations to literacy in each language (or
presence of a written form) encouraged the IEC strategy to focus on visual formats
accompanied with Vietnamese language text, for oral presentation by Village Health
Workers tailored to audience. From available evidence the project is believed to have had
a positive effect on health seeking behavior of ethnic minority groups, the sustainability
of which is subject to resourcing constraints of commune-level service delivery and
outreach. There was no gender analysis conducted of the original project design, which is
noted as a deficiency considering the significant focus on women’s health. Nevertheless,



                                             23
the evaluation finds it highly reasonable to conclude that women significantly benefited
from the project activities.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
68.      The project included capacity-building activities to both project and government
staff, including short training courses, on-the-job support, workshops, and study tours.
Training was particularly intense during the first years of the project. Capacity-building
was supported by dedicated training coordinators at provincial level and a CPMU training
coordinator. Standard training manuals were developed for all health care packages.
Topics of training included health care packages, project management, data collection,
and training methodologies.

69.     The project has probably contributed satisfactorily to institutional strengthening to
the extent that essential health services have been expanded and capacity at local levels of
Government strengthened. This finding is based on reports of project progress, the results
achieved, the commitment demonstrated by counterparts at commune, district, and
provincial levels, and the improvement in capacity for service delivery, planning and
project management demonstrated at these levels and in the CPMU. Again, despite
evidence of ownership and commitment by key counterparts, sustainability concerns -
including those raised by Government counterparts at provincial and district levels –
remain. It is not clear in what ways the counterparts will be able to use their planning
skills in the Government’s own planning process. The design of the training materials
was done in consultation with the National Targeted Program (NTP) experts and the MoH
has signaled that in the future the training materials will be used or adapted for training
activities to the village health worker under different NTPs. Trainers and Master Trainers
trained under the project would be available for Government activities as a potential
resource. Specific plans of the Ministry of Health to use the training materials as part of
public health curriculum are still to be determined. It is expected that the cessation of the
support directly incentivizing the outreach services and supervision support will have an
effect on the way in which the institutions arrange themselves in support of the continued
delivery of essential health services.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
70.     Positive outcomes and benefits of project have been demonstrated through
reporting, evaluation, and direct discussions with counterparts and beneficiaries at
local level. Anecdotal feedback from community members and stakeholders provides
further evidence of the wide range of project benefits (see Annex 5: Beneficiary
Survey/Stakeholder Consultation). Innovation in the approach to deliver immunization
through village health workers, as an exception to general Government policy for delivery
through Commune Health Stations, was identified as successful in improving
immunization rates by 20-30%. Provincial counterparts indicated appreciation of HEMA
and the positive feedback from beneficiaries – with the hope to have more projects like
this one. They also noted the unique focus of HEMA reaching the grassroots level.
Counterparts noted that the most positive project outcomes were capacity building and
training activities including in information, education and communication (IEC)
approaches, bottom-up planning, community monitoring and outreach and project
management. Further positive outcomes were experienced due to spillover effects to
neighboring communes.

71.     Quality Assurance: A systematic Quality Assurance System approach was
excluded from the TF and was replaced by several strategies within and outside WB
supervision. The key approach to assuring quality was to support implementation of
National Targeted Program regulations and guidelines. This constituted a well-aligned
approach. Beyond improvement of health indicators and utilization, assurance of the
quality of service delivery was in fact not a primary project objective. While several
approaches were applied, the absence of an explicit and holistic approach for both
assurance and measurement of quality of services delivered, and limited consideration of
service quality by the contracted assessments, raises the potential for quality gaps in the
Health Care Packages provided.

72.     Ethical considerations of temporary support for chronic conditions: The
assessments of community-based non-communicable disease management pilots (asthma
and hypertension) did not consider the potential ethical risk of diagnosing patients and
temporarily supporting free drug supply. In the case of hypertension, the drugs are
available under the insurance system and the patients included in the pilot should all be
insured. Given that the poor and the ethnic minority in disadvantaged communes are, for
the most part, covered under the social insurance system, access to the hypertension
medication should remain available. It depends on the Province and particularly the
provincial health insurance agency to keep them available at the commune level. The
asthma medication on the other hand is quite expensive and not covered under the
insurance system. The decision to include this as a pilot raises a concern about a reduced
wellbeing for the patients included in this pilot after the project as compared to before the
project. The patients were identified as needing routine management of their chronic
health condition, were provided with medication improving their health and then, after the
Project, could their access to medication could be limited because it is too expensive or
just not available. There has been some discussion about the inclusion of the asthma
medication on the health insurance lists, but the likelihood of this is still uncertain and the
budgetary impact may be substantial if such a decision were to be taken.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:
73.     No formal survey was conducted in support of the ICR process to evaluate
beneficiary perspectives and impacts. The following information is provided as isolated
qualitative reports based on the ICR task team’s field trip to Gia Lai and Kon Tum
provinces. For more information, see Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Index/ Stakeholder
Report.

74.      While of course not a representative sample, highlight observations from the field
visit include:




                                              25
   (a) A pregnant mother had good knowledge of safe motherhood practices and
       services and will give birth at a District Health Centre;
   (b) There are multiple factors in child malnutrition (e.g. female-headed households
       labor demand), and project activities were helpful in increasing the weight of one
       child by 3kg;
   (c) Health Insurance package was helpful to poor people and beneficiaries shared
       their positive experience with their peers;
   (d) Community-based hypertension and asthma management helped one beneficiary
       more sustainably manage his illness without referring to a District Health Centre;
   (e) IEC materials provided important project inputs and their delivery was expanded
       to women;
   (f) There are concerns about sustainability of some project expenses (refreshments at
       IEC, 5% co-payment, sufficient drug coverage under HI law) but also confidence
       about continuation of some activities;
   (g) CHS refurbishment made a difference to utilization and confidence in the service;
       and
   (h) While guidelines were clear, financial management responsibilities were new and
       challenging for CHS staff and required frequent visits by Provincial Planning
       Officers.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
75.     The Rating of the Risk to sustaining the Development Objective is
Substantial. There is concern that the results will not be maintained and continued in the
future. It is likely that the project has created the knowledge for scaled up health outreach
services to maintain health indicators. Additionally, it is not likely that the Provinces will
want to show any reduction in the system level indicators measured by the routine health
management information system. However, to the extent that result indicators and health
seeking behaviors are dependent on the quantity of supplies supported by the project
(micronutrient supplements, safe delivery kits), motivation payments to health staff
(village health workers and travel allowances for other health staff), and continuation of
the 5% co-payment support as well as transport and food allowance to Health Insurance
Card-holders, there is likely to be some reduction in the health result indicators achieved
in project areas following project completion in June 2012. This is expected in particular
to affect rates of utilization, immunization, and micronutrient supplementation for
women. The likelihood of this reduction in indicators is suggested by recent project
experience (HEMA and ADB) with effects on patient utilization rates when there has
been uncertainty or interruption in project support to certain activities. The lack of a
project strategy on how to sustain health seeking behaviors beyond delivery of project
inputs contributes to this risk.

76.     Similarly, there are clear limitations to the sustainability of capacity-building for
bottom-up planning. There are two main factors to this:
    (a) Provincial, District and Commune being able to sustain bottom-up reporting,
        monitoring and planning, as well as for delivery of services, is subject to



                                             26
       constraints on government resources – or availability of follow-up projects
       supported by other donors (see 2.5 Post-Completion Operation); and
   (b) The focus of the technical support was to reinforce bottom-up planning of project
       Annual Workplans, without a strategy for contributing to broader District and
       Provincial Health planning. A comprehensive strategy is therefore missing.
       Project staff expect to see stronger demand and capacity from lower levels
       (districts, provinces) for input into top-down planning processes, a stronger
       evidence base and demonstrated stronger capacity to manage resources at lower
       levels, which will encourage confidence in decentralized management and
       planning.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
77.     The strengths of the Bank approach in the design of the project includes: (1)
adequate project documentation to provide the basis for successful achievement of the
project development objectives and consistency with Bank fiduciary role; (2)
development of a design to make an over-ambitious and unworkable original design into
a realistic design which effectively supported satisfactory achievement of project
development objectives; (3) limited and realistic indicators (though with some problems);
(4) a good balance of support to reform and innovation with a realistic approach with
adequate emphasis on capacity building to support implementation; and (5) transferred
project detail to the Operations Manual providing needed guidance but enabling project
flexibility with a lighter design.

78.     Some weaknesses in the preparation which negatively impacted quality at entry:
(1) the lengthy and difficult project preparation process with the EC; (2) a compromise on
the project management model agreed by the two donor agencies and Government, which
was overall unsatisfactory. While it supported strong project development achievement,
it did so with implementation problems (duplication of effort, parallel reporting systems,
high management costs and weak role definition); (3) there were omissions from the
project preparation documentation which negatively impacted on project implementation,
including lack of a sustainability strategy; (4) no strategy for integrating planning process
improvements into local practice outside of project activities although considerable
amount of resources were devoted to capacity development; (5) lack of a social
assessment for ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands; and (6) limitations in the
monitoring and evaluation approach as noted above, which required modifications to the
indicators during restructuring. As mentioned, there was no QAG assessment of the
quality of preparation.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
79.     Frequent and technically sound supervision missions were conducted by the
project team and with participation by the EC Delegation when possible. The task team
should be commended for their flexibility and proactivity in addressing the many


                                             27
implementation challenges faced by the client, including those related to the cumbersome
project oversight structure by the two Development Partners. While not able to address
this problem structurally because of the inherent nature of the project design, by the last
year of the Project the EC and Bank teams had developed a pattern for working that was
more efficient and responsive to the Ministry. This was accomplished by frequent and
joint meetings and setting up clear deadlines for responding to the Ministry taking into
account the comments and concerns of both partners. There were three task team leaders
over the implementation period and continuity in local operations officer and the
fiduciary team, which provided an acceptable level of continuity.

80.     Given the complexity of the Project management arrangements and the
challenging context, the location of the Task Team Leader (based in the Bank’s
Headquarter) was likely a factor in being able to address all of the implementation
difficulties faced early on. However, it was anticipated as part of Project design that there
would be technical team financed directly by EC to provide technical support (three
international and three local consultants) to the CPMU. Therefore, the Bank paid more
attention to the project activity outputs. Day-to-day supervision focused on fiduciary and
implementation progress on account of the slow start-up, short implementation period and
the understanding that the development objectives would not be met without
implementation on the ground. It does not appear that the project suffered technically as
a result, but the real cost may have been in finding a more reasonable approach to project
oversight together with the EC sooner.

81.     While some of the four project ISRs were noted as incomplete at time of
submission, they were rated adequately and Aide Memoires were prepared for each
supervision mission noting issues to be addressed. Issues were mostly satisfactorily and
promptly acted upon. Action was taken to improve monitoring indicators to better
support measurement and project development objective achievement. A Hanoi-based
fiduciary and procurement team provided routine supervision and implementation
support, particularly in correcting deficiencies noted at the time of the midterm review
and ensuring compliance with financial management and procurement requirements.

82.     A targeted mid-term review addressed major project design and implementation
concerns and provided an effective basis for the project to significantly improve
implementation and performance and satisfactorily achieve its project development
objectives. Weaknesses in the midterm review included the lack of a robust
documentation to highlight the issues and remedial actions, the differences with the EC
midterm review approach, and the exclusion of an explicit discussion on what were the
expectations of the different agencies, including the Ministry of Health, on what should
be sustained, used for demonstration purposes, or stopped at the Project completion.
Unfortunately, the EC and Bank teams were not able to coordinate their midterm reviews
due to timing and so both agencies conducted their own reviews as another example of
the onerous project oversight arrangements.

83.     Placement of a task team leader in Hanoi in the final year of the project was a
positive contribution and led to improved technical and policy dialogue engagement,




                                             28
timely feedback on the final two Annual Workplans, project evaluations, and the
dissemination and advocacy strategy of the project.

84.  There was no assessment of the quality of supervision undertaken by the Bank’s
QAG unit.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
85.     As discussed, the project was satisfactory in achieving its project development
objectives of scaling up essential health services to the vulnerable population in the five
provinces and in supporting planning at the district level. Implementation and fiduciary
performance improved over time, finally resulting in a timely completion (one reasonable
extension) and a nearly full disbursement of the Trust Fund. Both achievements could
not have been possible without the above stated strengths in Bank performance in
preparation and supervision. The Bank team supported the Ministry in developing a
reasonable project design to achieve the desired objective, was flexible and responsive in
helping address implementation problems and effectively integrated fiduciary review and
support to address issues as they occurred. The more modest rating of moderately
satisfactory is suggested because of the noted limitations in the quality at entry and
supervision including (1) deficiencies in management model selected, project
documentation and monitoring and evaluation approach at entry, and (2) limitations in the
remote task management to address the working relationship with the EC early on, the
limited and uncoordinated midterm review with the EC, and not including the end of
Project targets as part of the official project restructuring.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
86.     The government demonstrated commitment towards achieving the objectives of
the project and the level of dialogue and engagement were encouraging. The fact that a
Deputy Minister was assigned as chairperson of project steering committee which was
comprised of managers from different ministries, departments and that the director of
MOH planning and finance department served as director of the Central Project
Management Unit (CPMU), underscored the level of importance accorded to the project.
The Minister was often involved in the larger stakeholder consultation and results
discussions. A CPMU was established with a technical team of a good number of health
specialists and Provincial Project Management Units with full time consultants and
secondments from Departments of Health. In a context of administrative delays and
preparation problems between the World Bank and European Union during project
preparation, there are concerns with level of involvement of the Ministry of Health in
determining the original scope of work identified by the EC (i.e. results based financing
approach), which was partly addressed through the reworking of the Project design as part
of the Government implemented grant under the Trust Fund. The management model
selected was a compromise not fully satisfactory to either the Government nor the two
donor agencies and created challenges for all partners in implementation.



                                            29
87.     Government procedures and required approvals, particularly at Provincial level,
added to donor-related delays to annual work planning processes, which caused
implementation problems in the first years of the project as discussed in this report. While
the Ministry of Health at national level had gained familiarity with Bank processes to
support satisfactory implementation, there was no such prior familiarity at the provincial or
at district levels. Together with human resource constraints, this contributed to slow
disbursement and implementation progress prior to mid-term review. This was subject to
significant capacity building attention and responsive approaches to address identified
problems. In particular, concerted efforts by Government with partners following the
problems identified at mid-term review contributed to much stronger implementation
performance and achievement of project development objectives overall. Further strengths
of Government performance included its increasing ownership of project approaches, use of
evidence from project activities in policy decisions, and efforts to support sustainability and
replication of project approaches benefiting access of the poor to quality health services.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
88.     In the initial project period, implementation and disbursement were slow. Since
Government policy requires public servants to hold key positions within the CPMU,
project members were burdened with other job responsibilities and found it difficult to
devote sufficient time to project implementation. At midterm review, significant
shortcomings to CPMU project management had been noted. CPMU recruitment of
additional staff and consultants contributed to significantly improved project
implementation performance. Performance of both the CPMU and of the supplementary
technical advisors directly funded by the EC was stifled by the deficiencies in the
management model reported above. The management burden on provincial and district
levels was also significant but with significant capacity building through the project
period, by the end of implementation these levels were operating effectively to achieve
project results, with strengthened capacity to benefit broader Government programming.
There were short-comings in fiduciary oversight as noted in the post-review and financial
management reports requiring corrective action.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
89.      The overall rating is moderately satisfactory because of the reasons given above.
The Government showed commitment throughout project implementation and managed
to implement the project despite lower levels lacking familiarity with the World Bank’s
procedures. The contributions of project activities to significant Government policy
decisions relevant to provision of access to quality health services for the poor
demonstrate the strong engagement in the project and the value and relevance of project
activities. Some constraints remained such as availability of qualified full time staff to
work for the project, and slow implementation and disbursement in the initial project
period. Over the longer term, Government and implementing agencies were responsive to
implementation challenges and ultimately successful in delivering achievement of project
development objectives. At project closure, concerns remain about the depth of
alignment of project activities including health service packages, training and IEC


                                              30
activities with broader National Targeted Programs and Continuing Medical Education.
Concerns are also discussed in this report about the replicability of bottom-up planning
processes in nationally-defined planning processes.
6. Lessons Learned
90.     It is possible to deliver on needed health results to the hard to reach and
vulnerable population groups with different approaches: HEMA provides a
demonstration in the ability to use local and village health workers to deliver heath
services hard to reach population groups through technical and material support,
incentives, and results monitoring. This was done on an input basis, paying for material
support, incentives through paying per diem and travel allowances, providing supervision
and monitoring of results. This was appropriate for the context of Vietnam, its public
administration and organization of the health system. It will be a lesson for Vietnam and
its development partners to consider how to continue and scale up similar support with
the Governments own resources as well as the support from Development Partners in the
most appropriate manner which today may be more ready paying based on results.

91.     Impact on national programs and systems would be enhanced with clear
expectations and appropriate integration into the health administration rather than
as a separate project: It is possible to contribute to national programs and policy
decisions with evidence drawn from implementing at the grassroots level. This impact,
however, could have much greater if the project support were more integrated with the
Government’s own programs and systems as opposed to an isolated donor-funded project.
At times, the Project was implemented almost like an NGO external to the Ministry, such
as in the sustainability plan prioritizing disseminating and advocacy for its activities. The
communal level capitation pilot had limitations in thinking about its implementation as a
national system.       The policy relevance and lessons learned from the project
implementation feedback into national programs could be more effective with the more
routine involvement of the stakeholders.

92.     The World Bank administering the funds of another donor should be done
only when it does not add a double burden of project supervision and reporting and
provides leverage for greater impact: It is clearly understandable why the Bank
provided support to the Ministry of Health and the EC in operationalizing the project
concept and delivering these important project results to the needed population. There are
definitely models of multiple donor support to a single Government project or program.
As internationally accepted, the development partners need to provide this support in
harmonized way (single monitoring and results framework, reporting system, unified
procedures) and aligned with the Government’s systems as much as possible. HEMA had
two channels of support and had to report at the same time and in separate circumstances
to both the Bank and the EC. The ICR shows that the project’s ultimate outcomes were
diminished due, in part, to inefficiencies that the project oversight arrangements caused.
The World Bank should reconsider being responsible for such a burden in any future
arrangement with development partners. Additionally, such arrangements should be used
to achieve greater leverage of the Bank’s program and large financial support to the sector
rather than as a stand-alone discreet small project with the opportunity costs associated
with the time and effort for its surpervision.



                                             31
93.     Pilots providing temporary relief to a chronic health condition should
consider the ethical implications and Governments should not exempt such activities
from its own human experiment review procedures: As mentioned, there were some
small pilots providing support to patients with chronic conditions of hypertension and
asthma. The pilots screened, diagnosed, treated and managed the conditions at the
community level which is very necessary for considering how to treat these conditions
more cost effectively in the future. In one case – asthma – the continued access by the
patients to the needed medication is highly in doubt. With such a risk, the pilot should
not have been selected. Additionally, any such intervention should go through a proper
review as an experiment with human subjects.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors
(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies
94.    The summary assessment of the Project prepared by the Ministry of Health’s
Central Project Management Unit and as delivered by the Project Director and
Director of Planning and Finance is consistent with the findings of the
Implementation Completion Report. The ICR authors would only suggest to the
Development Partner team working with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of
Health itself to further assess and try different modifications to the small pilots supported
by HEMA before committing to implementation at any significant scale.
(b) Donor
95.     The EU Delegation’s previous and on-going support to the health sector and, in
particular, the essential health needs of the poor and vulnerable ethnic minority
population is noted. It is important for the Bank and EU to continue its active
collaboration in this area, even more so now that the HEMA modality of bringing the two
development partners together has completed.
(c) Other partners and stakeholders
Not applicable.

The original project analysis did not include an economic and financial analysis. The
health interventions supported by the Project – essential health services for children and
mothers health -- have been shown to be economic best buys with very high rates of
return. The Project also supported interventions at the commune and district level which
are more cost effective than alternative service providers at the provincial or even central
level hospitals which may have been necessary if the essential health services had not
been available. The project supported limited investments such as very basic equipment
and facility report that will have a future fiscal impact for basic operation and
maintenance.

        Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results/ Stakeholder Report and Results
No formal survey was conducted in support of the ICR process to evaluate beneficiary
perspectives and impacts. The following information is provided as isolated qualitative
reports based on the ICR task team’s field trip to Gia Lai and Kon Tum provinces.
Kong Long Khong Commune, K’Bang district, Gia Lai province
1.     Community-based safe motherhood services

The team interviewed a pregnant woman who was bearing her second child. Her
household was categorized as poor. She told us that after knowing her pregnancy status,
she reported to a village health worker. Then the village health worker registered for her
into the Safe Motherhood program. Thereafter, she was provided micronutrient tablets
(including iron and folate supplementation) and consulted monthly by a village health
worker. The village health worker also checked her drugs to make sure she strictly
followed the prescription, and reminded her to go to see a doctor at a district hospital.
She chose to give birth at the district hospital. She knew that she should go to see a
doctor at least three times, and that she needed to get anti-tetanus vaccine to protect her
child from tetanus. She planned to deliver at the district hospital.

2.    Community-based prevention and treatment of malnutrition of children
under 5 years old

The team interviewed a woman who had a three year old daughter that benefited from the
nutrition package. She was categorized as poor. Her husband had died two years before,
so she was the main labor force in her household. She had to work as a hired worker for
other people in her village. She did not have time to prepare meals for her children.
When the second child was two years old, a village health worker went to her house to
weigh her child, and detected that her child was malnourished (weighing 6-7kg at the age
of two). Her child was registered into the package program to receive milk and to be
weighed monthly. She said that the village health worker performed very well in terms of
weighing her child and reminding her to go to CHS to collect milk. She felt very
comfortable with CHS staff when she came to collect milk. Although she received advice
from the CHS staff, she did not have time to prepare food to her child. Still, after 1 year
getting benefit from the project, her child’s weight increased by 3 kg.

3.     Improve Health Insurance services

The team interviewed two people who benefited from the health insurance package. They
were referred by CHS to a district hospital. They were admitted to a district hospital.
During their treatment, they received oral medicines and intravenous injections. They also
were provided lunch and dinner all the time they were in hospital. They reported that
they did not have to pay anything on their discharge day. They also received some
money for transportation back to their home. They felt that the package was very
convenient to them. They said that they shared their experiences with other people in
their village, and that they hoped that this approach would be maintained because it was
helpful for people like them.

   4. Hypertension & Asthma Pilot
The Commune Health Station Director discussed the implementation of the asthma and
hypertension and we met a patient. The patient was a man in his 40’s with Asthma who
had previously visited the District Hospital up to 2-3 times a month and sometimes
staying for weeks. He had previously had to buy drugs but these were now provided by
the project. The Commune Health Station Director said that project-supported activities
had included:
   (a) Initial word-of-mouth identification and screening of patients for asthmas and
       hypertension
   (b) Project provision of a blood pressure measuring machine and computer
   (c) Support for CHS monthly measurement and consultation
   (d) National expert from the project having provided a training course
A positive impact was that patients use drugs more regularly through the Community-
Based Management approach. A remaining difficulty is CHS monitoring patients who
are able to go directly to District Health Centres for treatment. The CHS staff were
confident that they could continue activities because drugs would be included in the
Health Insurance law, provided they could get sufficient quantities.

   5. Commune Health Station
Project activities and benefits: The Commune Health Station Director stated that the
most implemented project activities were the IEC materials, but that all project activities
had been beneficial, including training. Previously only husbands accessed IEC materials
as they “had less work and had time to participate?. With the implementation of the
project women are now accessing the materials. Before, IEC was mentioned briefly at the
end of community meetings. Distribution of powdered milk was particularly beneficial to
mothers care of children. Additional EPI sites supported by the project helped expand
immunization coverage. The refurbishment of the CHS made a big difference to
utilization and confidence in the service.


A lesson for other CHS regarding management was that they needed strong
commitment and comprehensive understanding of all activities. Some of the biggest
changes were in the CHS management responsibilities and village health worker data
collection responsibilities – both were new and challenging, and at first the CHS staff
were very worried about being punished for mis-expenditure by needing to return funds.
The guidelines were clear but the financial management responsibility was burdensome.
The provincial planning officer visits each District at least once or possible twice each
quarter.

Regarding sustainability, it has been good that the project subsidizes poor patients, but
there is now concern that patients will have to pay the 5% co-payment with project
closure – this causes more concern than the food subsidy. A risk to sustained
participation in IEC presentations was that the project will no longer be present to fund
refreshments, which help keep babies quiet. With project closure the CHS may not be
able to conduct regular supervision as before. Targeted populations will be well managed
by CHS services but visits will need to be integrated (ie fewer and less stakeholder
specific).

1. Review of Capitation Pilot
Communal health stations are becoming more involved in the delivery health services
covered under the health insurance system. Progressively, their inclusion in the system is
being rolled out throughout the country. Currently, the amount of money that they are
supposed to receive for these services is vague. According to the managing Circular,
Communal Health Stations are supposed to receive at least 10% of the funds received by
the District Hospital. They receive these funds usually in the form of drug supplies for
basic curative services. Additionally, for the population registered at the CHS for their
basic primary health care, there is a small (i.e. 2000 VND) fee for each initial consultation.
However, the amount of funds actually allocated is usually unknown to the CHS,
depending on the costs of the drugs, etc… The result is that CHS’s receive the drugs,
small amount of money in cash for the fees, and there is no ability to manage their budget
for a package of services.
Following an earlier pilot supported by the Belgian government, HEMA piloted a
capitation system that set a flat amount 60,000 VND per insuree registered at the CHS for
drugs. It also set an incentive for increasing utilization by allowing more money for
utilization within a small range and by indicating that less money would be allocated if
the utilization were significantly below a target value. The pilot also provided training in
sound antibiotic use, a computer and software for better drug management, and
supervision support. In principle, the pilot also included a motivation that if the actual
drug expenditure was less than 60,000 VND then the remaining funds could be
distributed for the CHS staff improvement and motivation.
The objectives of the HEMA Capitation Pilot included to:
   (a) Provide evidence information national dialogue and approaches to expand reform
       of payment mechanisms for health facilities balancing careful resource
       management and patient needs;
   (b) Provide evidence informing national dialogue on the extent to which primary
       health care can be improved through incentives to health care providers;
   (c) Improve the quality of health care services provision at CHSs and empowering
       patients’ satisfaction
   (d) Increasing patients’ use of services at the Commune level;
   (e) Improving health care services management and financial management by PSSs,
       DHCs, and CHSs; and
   (f) Supporting control of health care costs covered by health insurance.
The capitation pilot was also developed as part of an alternative to originally intended
HEMA project strategies of performance-based contracting and quality assurance. As
such it was also designed to include elements of incentivizing rational management and
quality service delivery.
A number of positive outcomes of the Capitation Pilot were achieved:
   (a) Predictability of drug supplies to Commune level assisted Commune
       management;
   (b) Improved quality of service delivery as measured by fewer antibiotic use;


                                             48
   (c) Utilization by Health Insurance Card holders increased;
   (d) Cost containment of Commune Drug supply budgets was achieved, with costs per
       card holder stable even when utilization rates increased;
   (e) Drug supply budget management software assisted Communes meet their
       management responsibilities; and
   (f) In general, user and staff were more satisfied with the services as a result of a
       combination of motivation payments, financing of drug supplies, and significant
       training.

The Ministry of Health is seeking a new policy on capitation payment systems, more
broadly. Capitation is used to finance all curative services and is now targeted to district
hospitals. The capitation pilot has many positive attributes particularly: (i) a clear and
known budget for the supply of drugs to the CHS; and (ii) improved training and
resources for better drug management. The Ministry of Health should carefully analyze
the pilot design according to international practice. For instance, we would advise that a
flat amount per insuree is acceptable as a starting point. Instead of factoring in a
complicated methodology of varying the amount according to utilization targets, most
countries estimate utilization by demographics of the population (young children and
older people use health services more, women of child bearing age use more health
services) and build in this expectation into the capitation amount. These risk factors are
not automatically the same as the different insurance groups defined for the purposes
contribution classifications and the Ministry should consider breaking the cycle of last
year’s budget spent per insurance group is equal to next year’s capitation amount. As
well, one would not expect that the budget would still be transferred to the CHS in the
form of drugs, the cost of which would be determined by provincial level procurement.
Instead, the capitation would be used to finance a defined list of health services including
the exams and tests to be performed at the CHS. Outpatient drugs on prescription would
be financed separately. Much more careful examination is required, including really
understanding international experience with capitation payment of primary health care
services, before assuming that the HEMA model should be scaled up.


2. Review of the Community-based Chronic Disease Management Pilots
Hypertension pilot
The pilot took place in Binh Lu, Tam Duong district, Lai Chau province and in Dak Rve
township, Kon Ray district, Kon Tum province, under the responsibility of a cardiologist
of the Bach Mai Hospital in Ha Noi.
In Vietnam at the moment the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension mostly takes place
in hospitals. Communal Health Stations do not have MD staff that are properly trained to
do case management. This makes treatment of these cases more expensive than necessary
and the burden of chronic disease in Vietnam is only growing. The innovative aspect of
this hypertension pilot was its community-based nature. VHWs were trained to do a first
screening using a BP meter and refer people with a BP over 140/90 to the CHS, where
further diagnostic work-up was done and if indicated patients were put on treatment or
given IEC on lifestyle changes. The pilot was successful in that it showed that it is
feasible to involve CHC staff and VHWs in screening, managing and monitoring


                                            49
hypertensive patients. However, the methodology and rigor for evaluating the results of
the pilots either in terms of the costs, the effects and the qualitative impact on the
stakeholders had several limitations questioning what impact, if any, these pilot
demonstrations will have.
Long term hypertension drugs are also not included in the HI package at CHC level.
Although drug costs for hypertension are lower, many hypertensive patients in the poor
areas, where the pilot was conducted, cannot afford to buy them in the market. In order to
scale up community-based hypertension prevention and management, the VSS needs to
change the status of hypertension to that of a chronic disease (rather than a common
disease). This will allow CHCs to prescribe drugs for longer periods (instead of only once
for 5-7 days, which is completely useless).
Asthma pilot
The asthma pilot took place in the same locations and was set up in a similar way,
supported by an immunologist of the Bach Mai hospital. In this pilot the initial selection
was based on a questionnaire administered by trained VHWs, after which suspected cases
were seen by an MD at the CHC and if indicated put on treatment and given advice/IEC.
The VHWs were provided with peak flow measuring devices to monitor patients. The
prevalence of asthma in the pilot areas was 2%.
The MoH decided to not scale up the asthma pilot, as the costs of asthma treatment are
quite high. This could have been determined before the pilot intervention which indicates
that this was not the right choice for a pilot.
Another issue is of an ethical nature as discussed earlier in the report. Because the pilots
were seen as interventions rather than studies the proposals were not submitted to the
ethical committee for health studies. This is now posing problems in particular for the
asthma patients that were put on treatment during the pilot. Many of them have gone back
to suffer from their complaints, now with the knowledge that treatment is available and
relieves their symptoms, but they cannot afford the high costs as asthma drugs are only
available at the central level.


3. Review of the Annual Planning Process - Improving Health Service Planning in
Districts
The Annual Workplan process has been a core element of HEMA. The second project
development objective was to “improve health service planning at the district level?.
Relevant core project approaches included a bottom-up planning process to support
commune-level implementation of community-based primary health care packages,
building capacity at lower levels of government with limited previous experience in
project management and participatory planning.
According to the project design, each district would be allocated a budget and be
expected to develop annual plans consisting of (i) services to be delivered, (ii) inputs
needed, (iii) demand side interventions required, and (iv) training and other capacity
building activities necessary for delivering the services. The Operations Manual
contained the necessary principles, required and eligible contents of annual workplans,
and process for developing and approving the plans. A key principle of the planning
process was that prioritized activities would be selected based on the real situation of each


                                             50
province regarding the disease burden of the poor, and cost-effective and feasible health
interventions. Overlaps with other activities would be avoided, and local human and
material resources would be considered. In the first year, budget would be based on
population, local needs, capacities and resources; in subsequent years it would be based
on performance of the districts, with good performers receiving larger budgets, and poor
performers receiving technical support for improved capacity. The process would
implement the project approach of 60% of budget for service delivery at commune level,
20% at district level and 20% at provincial level for coordination of planning, training
and supervision.
The eligible contents of work plans included:
   (a) Health care packages (9 were selected for 2008-09, 6 were selected for 2010, and
       4 were selected in 2011 – with joint agreement each year to narrow the list further
       as project implementation progressed); and
   (b) Activities aimed at creating necessary conditions for implementing service
       packages, ensuring their quality and uptake of services by the targeted population.
The planning process consisted of eight steps of:
   (a) Informing project provinces of annual budget allocated
   (b) Development of Annual Work Plans and Budgets by PPMU and DPMU
   (c) Comments and technical review by the PPMU/CPMU
   (d) Review and comments by World Bank and EC
   (e) Issue of “No Objection Letter? by the World Bank
   (f) Endorsement by the Ministry of Health and DEU for the entire project
   (g) Review and approval by the Provincial People’s Committee
   (h) Receiving budget and implementing activities.


Several challenges were experienced in the planning process:
   (a) The major challenge was the limited experience, capacity and availability of
       qualified staff at lower levels of government for planning process management;
       particularly at project start.
   (b) Another constraint was the need to integrate with government systems at multiple
       levels, ensure adequate provincial government agreement to workplans, and to
       meet requirements of two donors.
   (c) In line with the burden caused for project management generally, the requirement
       to align to the systems of three entities (Government of Vietnam across levels and
       Ministries, the EU, and the World Bank), in contexts with limited capacity,
       increased the delays to work planning and the need for significant technical
       support.
The major timing challenge for the annual planning approval process was the delays to
Provincial approval of workplans. The process of PPC review was lengthy and




                                            51
cumbersome in the early stages of the project, but improved significantly in 2010.
Negative impacts of delayed workplans included:
   (a) Reduced implementation period – less than 8 months in 2009, reducing the
       achievement of activities and results;
   (b) Poor funds practices - The need for Provinces to ‘borrow funds’ for
       implementing some early activities, thus encouraging poor fund flow practices;
   (c) Harmful interruptions to service delivery – perhaps the most harmful being the
       interruption to Health Insurance package co-payments, which led to lower
       utilization rates as patients could not afford 5% co-payments and food and
       transport costs, and likely delay before patients had confidence the co-payments
       and allowances would again be covered.
The World Bank midterm review raised concern that the initially agreed process of the
EC and World Bank separately reviewing activities within their sphere of management
was not adhered to in practice, with the EC also reviewing Trust Fund plans after World
Bank review. This was not in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative
Agreement, the PAD and agreement in a formal meeting between the EC and World Bank
in December 2009. While the World Bank had approved the Annual Workplan for 2009
in December 2008, activity implementation start was delayed by three to four months to
March/April 2009 because it was further reviewed and revised by EC, requiring repeated
review and revision by the Ministry of Health and the World Bank. As a result, less than
8 months implementation remained for project activities. Joint donor workplan
agreement, to avoid delays from consecutive approval, was also suggested from initiation
but variably applied.
By project completion there had been significant improvements to the timing of the
planning process, with all provinces successfully completing the 2012 annual planning
process and reaching activity implementation start stage by January 2012. Annual
planning had improved annually to the point where the 2012 workplan was the most
timely and the ambitious, even though having only 6 months for implementation.

A major concern is the likely sustainability of the planning process supported, and
the broader development impact of the project relating to the intended scope of
planning improvement. The project design did not include a sustainability strategy, nor
did it include a clear definition of the intended impact of significant capacity building
inputs to improve planning. In implementation, the project sought only to improve
planning capacity at district level related to the planning of HEMA interventions –
approved by the EU and World Bank - and not to entire District or Province Health Plans.
As a result indicators related only to the meeting of annual plan targets under the project;
there was no clear approach or incentives for the benefits of improved planning to be
sustained, nor to influence broader planning processes.

The Government Planning Process
The development of entire health plans for districts and provinces is much more complex
and does not use the tools and templates applied for the planning of HEMA but follows
forms and guidelines of the Ministry of Planning and Investment and Ministry of Health.
It is a more top-down process with higher levels assigning targets to lower levels. In a


                                            52
2012 workshop discussion no HEMA-participating provinces considered that there would
be any immediate change in the way the full provincial and district health plans were
developed, although all recognized the benefits of the bottom-up planning and expected
that with the improved planning skills at district (and lower) level the provincial and
district health planning process would be more participatory than in the past. The
methods introduced by HEMA for setting targets based on indicators would probably
continue to be applied for safe motherhood, immunization and nutrition. Considering
financial constraints, Provinces also expected that there would not be as many planning
workshops as in HEMA, nor workshops in all districts, but possibly only one peer review
workshop at provincial level with stakeholders at districts and provincial agencies.
In the ICR evaluation visit, the PPMU Director in Gia Lai province, identified the most
important experience gained from the project is the planning process developed from the
needs of local levels. The Director stated that “With good and close planning, the process
from the bottom up helps effective implementation?. While she identified that the full
bottom-up planning process would not be implemented following the project, the
Province considered the stronger base of bottom-up information, such as on patient
numbers, would provide a better basis for broader planning. This will include the ability
of Provinces and Districts to better guide the development and implementation of broad
district and provincial plans including use of national resources, and drawing on locally
available evidence.
The extent to which Provinces, Districts and Communes can sustain their significantly
expanded capacity for bottom-up reporting, monitoring and planning, as well as for
delivery of services, is subject to the degree to which there is constraint on government
resources – or availability of follow-up projects supported by other donors. The HEMA
project model placed significant project planning and management burden on planning
officers in PPMUs, who did frequent travel and direct capacity building support to
District levels. Without HEMA allowances and capacity building support this function
and level of support will likely reduce.

                          Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR


The following is a summary from the Ministry of Health’s final project evaluation as
represented by Dr. Tuan, Director of the Planning and Finance Department as well as
HEMA Project Director, Ministry of Health.
Summary Assessment
The project has improved the capacity of health staff for planning, expertise, as well as
management, monitoring and evaluation;
The Annual Work Plans that were developed were based on actual capacity of each unit
and were derived from the communes to the provincial level, thus high practical and close
to local actual situation;
The monitoring system was designed and developed for each activity and health care
program, enabling to get required information and data for monitoring, analyzing and
reporting;
Health services were provided in the villages to increase people's access to health care.
Indicators of key health services necessary for improved health, as monitored by the
delivery of the Health Care packages, improved over the years;
Support was provided directly to poor and ethnic minority people through the health
insurance support, including food, transportation allowance, support in emergency
transportation, and 5% co-payment. This enabled patients to get access to quality
services;
Appropriate strategies and training approaches were developed for each level and targeted
specific staff, e.g.: training-of-trainers training for provincial level, capacity building and
training in medical expertise for in-charge staff at provincial and district levels, seminars
for communal health station staff on different expertise topics, contests of "good
communicators" for village health workers (VHW), domestic and overseas study tours for
health staff;
The project updated the knowledge and skills, compiled and developed training manuals
and printed and distributed to health agencies/facilities for training or for reference;
Technical support was provided for implementing some community-based health care
models: hypertension and asthma models as well as for implementing a capitation pilot
for commune level;
The project improved the working condition for 253 Communal Health Stations by
refurbishment and provision of essential equipment for service delivery to local people;
and
A communication strategy was developed to suit target populations and for each health
care package, information ane education communication (IEC) materials deliver concise
and comprehensible messages, appropriate staff for IEC (VHWs), different forms of IEC
such as direct communication by groups, by target populations, or via local mass
media/community speakers, etc.

The Project’s Advantages and Disadvantages:
Advantages:
The interest and concern, as well as support and collaboration from MOH leaders, heads
of Ministry of Health departments, individuals and teams from relevant sectors and
stakeholders, national and international consultants, support from the donors regarding
management, efforts of both managers and staff of project management units at all levels
(local to central), all became a determinant factor toward the success of the project.
Regular supervision missions and even on-the-job coaching supervision conducted by the
donors, MOH leaders, CPMU, PPMUs, DPMUs, helped to address the issues timely
enough so that the project objectives were achieved with effectiveness.
Disadvantages:
The implementation phase came up against a number of bottlenecks, including:
      As part of the grant was administered by the WB, the project had to follow and
       had also to harmonize many different regulations and management procedures
       (WB, EU and govt.)
      There was limited capacity of staff for implementing the project, many staff
       turnovers; and
      The approval process of plans was sometimes delayed, from central to local levels.
Lessons Learned
The project should be sufficiently recognized for its far ranging technical scope and
implementation mechanisms that required many different activities need be done within
different policies and regulations. This asked for close collaboration with many agencies,
individuals within and out of MOH, from central to local levels. Meanwhile, the project
staff were insufficient, both quantity and quality, for carrying out an adequate approach of
partnering/collaboration, like a coordinating unit, in order to link relevant areas to the
implementation of the project to accomplish tasks and objectives for an optimized result.
Legal framework and documents of the government must be well established; the same
applies to the guidelines from the World Bank and the European Union during the
implementation of project activities, especially cost-norms, elible expenditures and
administrative procedures.
All activities of the project were directly related to the provinces, especially interventions
in the community. Decentralization for the levels to take their own responsibility for
implementation ensured that the units had their active role to assure progress as well as
quality which was most visibly through the improved capacity of staff at commune,
district and provincial levels for planning, monitoring, supervision and evaluation.
The Project Steering Committee assured a close collaboration between central and local
levels. The role of the provinces/local levels was appreciated and promoted during the
implementation phase, from provincial to district, commune and village levels, which
gave a chance for effective health care and health protection for local people in project
provinces, as well as an improvement of management and implementation capacity of
health staff at all levels.

Recommendations
Provinces should continue focusing on quality assurance of activities through supervision
visits, on-the-job coaching, and closely monitoring through integrating with supervision
visits under National Targeted Programs.
The provinces should plan for continuous training for health staff at local levels to ensure
adequate quantity and quality of staff, combining with using the master trainers trained by
the project and materials developed, for updating information and knowledge.
In the five project provinces which have a high percentage of poor and ethnic minority
communities compared to other areas and which have large vulnerable populations (due
to cultural, religious and immigration factors, etc.), it is recommended that the
government, MOH, donors and other NGOs should continue harmonized investments for
local health system in these areas (for facility, equipment, training for staff, supporting
poor communities, etc.) to meet the increasing needs for health care and protection of the
people.
Results of HEMA activities should be used and integrated within the budget support by
the EU in order to be sustained in the project districts and communes as well as expanded
to other non-project districts and communes in the provinces.
The pilot models were evaluated for positive results, yet they will need to be further
tested in different settings.
According to the current road map for capitation, the method will be applied by at least
30% health facilities by 2011, at least 60% by 2013 and 100% by 2015. With technical
support from the EU-funded Health Sector Capacity Support Project combined with
experiences from HEMA model, the provinces should soon make plans for expanding and
applying this model.
The donors and other stakeholders should pay more attention and conduct more regular
training courses for managerial and implementing staff, from central to local levels,
ensuring systematic and fundamental organization for effective project implementation.

               Annex 8. Comments of EU Delegation (Project Financier)


The following represents a summary of the comments on the Project prepared by the
European Delegation at the Project closure:

The EU Delegation considers HEMA as a project that has achieved very good results.

The health sector in Vietnam is particularly important for the EU as, for the period 2007-
201, the EU Delegation in Vietnam has allocated 40% of its bilateral grant resources, for
an amount of over 150 million, to the sector.

The EU recognizes the remarkable achievements made in Vietnam by the health sector,
and towards achieving the MDGs. However, the country still faces significant disparities
in key maternal and children health indicators in particular in the poorest regions of the
Northwest and Central Highlands.

In this context, Hema had a focus on specific provinces (Lai Chau, Dien Bien, Son La,
Kon Tum, Gia Lai) and on immunization, nutrition and reproductive health, including
ante- and post-natal care as well as assistance for delivery at home.

The project has demonstrated that, while a number of services generally do not reach the
poor as much as they should, they could reach them if specific measures are taken to
ensure an adequate outreach to remote areas and ethnic minority communities. The EU
Delegation is aware that this outreach approach implemented by HEMA implied specific
efforts in terms of costs for to staff, transport, food allowances, as well as additional skills.
Skills are now available in the areas where HEMA worked. Yet, there is a need for
continued engagement from the concerned provinces and their health services to sustain
and expand the benefits of this outreach approach. The EU Delegation is reassured by the
commitment of the 5 Provinces who will sign a letter of commitment with the Ministry of
Health to continue the project activities to the extent possible.

The project has also experimented different ways of reducing the financial barrier for the
poor in accessing health services. Food and transport allowances were introduced, as well
paying for the compulsory co-payment. The EU Delegation is pleased that the
government, based on this experiment, decided to mainstream part of this benefit package
through Decision 14 of the Prime Minister.
