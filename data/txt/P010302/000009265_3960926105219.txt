SRI LANKA
Third Small and Medium Industries Project (SMI III)
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower                : Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
Beneficiaries           : Eligible Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) includ-
ing public and private sector commercial banks and
development financing institutions. As Under SMI I and
II, these would include: Bank of Ceylon (BOC), Commer-
cial Bank of Ceylon (CBOC), Development Finance Corpora-
tion of Ceylon (DPCC), Hatton National Bank (HNB), and
the Peoples Bank (PB). Technical assistance would be
provided to the Export Development Board (EDB) and NDB to
improve SMI operations, and to the BOC and PB to improve
their overall operations.
Amount                     SDRs 15.7 million (US$ 20.0 million equivalent)
Terms                      Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity.
Co-Financing            : The Asian Development Bank (ADB) proposes to provide
US$15.0 million through a parallel line of credit on
terms and conditions similar to those of the proposed
Project.
Project Description    : The objectives of the proposed project, which complement
previous and ongoing industrial sector operations, are to
(i) provide credit through the banking system to small
and medium scale private manufacturing enterprises, and
(ii) make a further contribution to po'icy reform and
institutional strengthening in the areas of tariff
administration, export promotion and financial sector
operations.
Major components of the proposed IDA SMI Project would be
a credit component for refinancing term subloans, through
the SMI Fund, to private sector SMIs; and a technical
assistance component to help GOSL and relevant agencies
(i) improve the efficiency of the financial sector
through continued training for the PCIs; and technical
assistance to the BOC and PB to develop action programs
to improve their overall operating and financial
efficiency, (ii) improve the access of indirect exporters
to duty drawback and export credit facilities,



-2-
(iii) improve the efficiency of public manufacturing
enterprises (PMEs) through the implementation of action
programs developed under ongoiag industrial development
projects, and (iv) establish an SMI technical assistance
facility.
The benefits arising from the project would be more
effective investment in the industrial sector; improved
PCI performance; and increased employment opportunities.
Direct benefits of the lending component would include
US$35-US$40 million in incremental output per annum.
Through the financing of about 3,650 subprojects, about
31,400 additional jobs are expected to be created at a
job/cost ratio of US$1,750; in addition, productivity in
existing units would be improved through BMR investment.
Although a risk exists that an adequate number of
eligible subprojects will not materialize, the project
pipeline and projections indicate a credit demand well in
excess of 'he amount to be provided by the proposed
credit. Collection rates could also deteriorate, but the
project provides for strengthening PCI appraisal and
supervision capabilities, particularly of the two largest
commercial banks, to help minimize this risk. The final
risk is that the Government may not proceed with policy
reform in the area of duty drawbacks and export financing
as rapidly as expected; IDA will continue to monitor
developments closely in its economic and sector work and
project supervision.
Relending Tersis        : GOSL would onlend the project proceeds to NDB for 18
years, including a five year grace period, at an initial
rate equivalent to seven percentage points below the
Average Weighted Prime Rate (AWPR) for the Commercial
Banks for short term (i.e. 12 months or less) lending
operations. In turn, NDB would refinance PCI operations
at the AWPR, less six percentage points. The PCIs woulc
relend the proceeds at a rate, fixed or variable, suffi-
cient to cover their costs of operation and the project
risk. Given the spread between the IDA and GOSL onlend-
ing rates, GOSL will bear the foreign exchange risk. On
the basis of the present AWPR and spread requirements,
the relending rate would be between 13X-16X which com-
pares favourably with current Commercial Bank funding of
14Z-22X. The mechanism for establishing interest rates
and spreads would be reviewed semi annually and, if
necessary, adjusted based on procedures agreed between
GOSL and IDA. The actual rate charged to NDB and sub-
sequently to the PCIs shall be amended on January 1 and



-3-
July 1 to (i) reflect any significant movement in the
market reference rate, and (ii) remain positive in real
terms vis-a-vis inflation as reflected by the Colombo
Price Index. The maximum subproject repayment period
would be ten years including a two year grace period.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A THIRD SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the
equivalent of US$20.0 million on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40
years to fund investment for a wide range of industries under the Third Small
and Medium Industries Project (SM III).
2.      Background.  For a number of years IDA has worked closely with the
Government of Sri Lanka (GOSI-) to develop and implement a program of trade
and industrial policy reform which would create an environment conducive to
industrial development. IDA has provided assistance on industrial policy
reform and financing through the banking s-,stem for smal1, medium and large
scale private sector investment. Since 1979 IDA has provided Sri Lanka with
two SMI credits for US$46 million to fund enterprises with total fixed assets
at book value (excluding land and buildings) of less than Rs 4.0 million
(US$140,000), before loan approvals, which constitute the bulk of Sri Lanka's
industrial units. Under SMI I and II about 3,700 subprojects have resulted
in investment of about U$100 million and the creation of about 36,000 jobs at
a job/cost ratio of US$1,600. The first SMI project is fully disbursed; full
disbursement of the second project is expected by December 31, 1987.
Analysis of a random sample of subprojects indicates that subproject perfor-
mance is satisfactory, with most projects operating without notable technical
difficulties. The cumulati7e collection performance of the Participating
Credit Institutions (PCIs) at 70Z under both projects, has been satisfactory.
In its recently published Industrial Policy Statement, the Government has
attached high priority to the development of the SMI sector because of its
role as an employment generator and ancilliary support for the development of
non traditional export-oriented industrieb. The proposed Project would
reinforce this priority through provision of investment support and technical
assistance for programs focusing on technology transfer, productivity
improvement and financial sectcr efficiency.
3.      Project Objectives.  The proposed project would complement previous
industrial sector operations, particularly the ongoing SMI II project, by
providing credit through the banking system to small and medium scale private
manufacturing enterprises. It would also contribute to policy reform and
institutional strengthening in tariff administration, export promotion and
financial sector operations. The Project objectives are to: (i) provide
needed foreign exchange for viable SMI projects, with increased emphasis on
export-oriented ventures and balancing, modernization and rehabilitation
(BMR) of existing enterprises; (ii) continue the PCIs' overall institutional
development and deepen IDA's dialogue with GOSL on issues affecting the
efficiency of the financial sector for industrial financing through an in



-2-
depth analysis of the operational and financial viability of the two
predominant state owned commercial banks; this dialogue and the supporting
analysis should provide the basis for an agenda if actions that couLd be
supported by future IDA financial sector operations; (iii) address trade and
industrial policy issues, particularly the need to improve the Tariff Commis-
sion's oDerational capabilities and to remove constraints on export financing
and duty drawbacks for indirect exporters in the SMI sector; (iv) assist SMIs
upgrade their technology and product quality; and (v) improve industrial
efficiency, particularly of the Public Manufacturing Enterprises,
4.      Project Description.  The project, wh:ch is expected to be fully
implemented within six years, would include: (a) a US$15.0 million credit
component for term loans to SMIs from PCIs with subproject review and partial
refinance by the SMI Fund, and (b) a US$5.0 million technical assistance
component for PCI staff training, the review of NCB operations to develop
programs to improve their operating efficiency, support for SMI export promo-
tion and supply development programs, the establishment of an SMI technical
assistance facility to make greater use of private sector knowhow and
institutions in the expansion of productivity service facilities, and con-
tinued assistance irh trade and industrial policy reform. A US$15.0 million
parallel line of credit from the ADB will be used to cofinance the proposed
project; U$500,000 of the credit would be for technical assistance sup-
plementing IDA's US45.0 million technical assistan, ? component. The ADB loan
would be processed on similar terms and conditions Lo the IDA project. The
total costs involved in the project are about US$55 milliun, with a foreign
exchange component of about 63.5% (US$35.0 million). A breakdown of the
costs and financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events
is shown in Schedule C and the status of Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka
is shown in Schedule D. The Staff Appraisal Report is No. 6823-CE dated
November 2, 1987.
5.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.   The proposed project would a sow IDA
to continue to play a significant role in strengthening further the ongoing
SMI programs in the area of institutional development and the provision of
technical assistance. In the area of policy dialogue, the Project would
expand the role of IDA in the financial sector through support for interest
rate reform, implementation of recommendations of the Committee on the Law
and Practice relating to Debt Recovery and technical assistance to the Bank
of Ceylon (BOC) and the People's Bank (PB) to implement action programs to
improve their overall operating/financ.ial efficiency.  It would assist COSL
to (i) continue tariff reform, (ii) provide support for indirect exporters
through duty drawbacks and export credit, and (iii) create a technical assis-
tance facility (TAF) to assist SMI operations.   The project thus supports
the longer term objectives of developing more ambitious trade, industrial and
financial sector reform programs which would be taken up under future
industrial lending operations.



-3-
6.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached between
IDA, GOSL and NDB on: (i) conditions of PCI participation including collec-
tion ratios for FY88-FY90, portfolio infection levels, and staffing;
(ii) timing and substance of action programs and the annual review of the
technical service components; (iii) detailed policies and procedures of the
proposed Export Marketing and SMI technical assistance facilities; (iv) the
initial use of the AWPR as the market reference rate for setting term lending
rates; (v) semi-annual review on January 1 and July 1 of the mechanism for
determining interest rates and spreads and appropriate adjustment ad neces-
sary to (a) reflect any significant movement in the market reference rate,
and (b) remain positive in real terms vis-a-vis inflation rates as reflected
by the Colombo Price Index; (vi) onlending terms and conditions, margins,
subproject eligibility criteria; (vii) GOSL's budgetary allocations for the
project, and NDB's commitment to provide additional finance for operating
costs of the SMI Fund, if needed; and (viii) procedures for procurement,
disbursement, subproject review, periodic reporting, accounting and auditing.
7.      The following would be conditions for credit effectiveness:
(i) signing of a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to IDA, between GOSL
and NDB; and (ii) signing of participation agreements, satisfactory to IDA,
between NDB and two eligible PCIs.
8.      Justification.  The proposed project would address key constraints to
more rapid development of SMIs. Term loans would be provided to about 3.650
new and exisLirg enterprises meeting a portion of the financing gap for this
sector and further strengthening the PCIs' SMI term lending operations. The
subprojects financed are expected to result in about 31,400 new jobs, with
incremental fixed investments (including buildings and equipment but exclud-
ing land) per job of about US$1,75J. The average subloan size is expected to
be about Rs 450,000 (US$15,000). About 60% of the credit is expected to be
channelled to subloans of below Rs 1 million (US$34,000); about 20X for
subloans of Rs 1-2 million (US$34,000-US$70,000); and 20X for subloans from
Rs 2-4 million (US$70,000-US$140,000). Major areas of SMI investment are
expected to be: agro-industries; metal products; building materials and
construction contractors. Promotional and technical services provided under
SMI I and II also should result in increased financing of export-oriented
SMIs in rubber products, handloom textiles, gem cutting and polishing and
engineering subcontractors linked to larger public and private industries.
9.      Benefits from the technical assistance (TA) components are more
difficult to quantify. The project would provide support for ongoing finan-
cial sector reform through the improvement of the procedures and practices in
the country's two largest Commercial Banks. The project would help
strengthen the institutional support for trade reform and export promotion
through imp.-oved staffing of the Tariff Commission and extension of export
credit and duty drawback facilities to indirect exporters. An Export Market-
ing component, funded oy ADB, would build on the SMI II export development
programs and is expected to result in increased, diversified exports and



-4-
value-added among key light industrial products. Action to adapt products,
upgrade skills, increase quality control, and promote exports should result
in short- and medium-term increases in exports, employment and earnings.
With the creation of the SMI technical assistance facility (TAF), local
private sector know how would be tapped in addressing the technical problems
of 400 to 5o0 SmIs, in areas which require specialized skills. Also, th? TAF
would further encourage establishment of private sector firms specializing in
SMI consultancy; increase appreciation by SMI entrepreneurs of the benefit of
technology transfer; and enable the SMIs to tap needed skills not readily
available within their own operations.
10.     Risks.  The main risks to the success of the project are associated
with the overall climate for investment in Sri Lanka. However, notwithstand-
ing the drawn out etbnic disturbances which have afflicted Sri Lanka, commit-
ment rates and subproject performance under existing projects are satisfac-
tory. With the implementation of the recent Indian-Sri Lankan peace accord,
the level of investment needs is expected to increase significantly par-
ticularly in the construction relate. industries.  While the rate of reform
of industrial policy remains slow, the distortions affecting the private
sector are only moderate and past experience, plus the subproject financial
and economic rate of return requirements, indicate that the project will have
an overall satisfactory rate of rettirn. At the project level the success of
the lending component would depend on the continued effective administration
of SMI operations by NDB. Satisfactory policies, procedures and standards
have been established on the basis of past experience; the key will be NDB's
ability to retain qualified staff and provide training to enable expanded
refinance operations, while increasing attention to monitoring and supervi-
sion of PCIs' SMI operations. A further risk is that individual PCIs, par-
ticularly the BOC and PB, may be unable to meet their staffing commitments,
reducing their capabilities to process the large volume of applications
expected and to devote sufficient attention to subproject supervision. Under
the proposed Project, the presence of minimum trained staff at the branch
level would be a condition of participation in the pro4ect; also, PCIs' Board
would be required to reaffirm its commitment to allocate additional trained
SMI staff as required. With strong senior management commitment, adequate
staffing can be pro ided through active deployment and training. Another
risk associated wit., the demand for SMI credit is that PCIs may continue to
impose high collateral requirements, thereby excluding some borrowers with
viable SMI projects. This problem should be addressed by the proposed
increase in Credit Guarantee coverage and by requiring a clear statement of
collateral policy by each PCI, with close monitoring by NDB.



-5-
11.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
