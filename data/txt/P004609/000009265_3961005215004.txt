MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
SUBIC BAY METROPOLITAN AUTHORITY
WITH rHE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A SUBIC BAY FREEPORT PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA)
with the guarantee of the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of US$40
million to help finance a Subic Bay Freeport Project. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years: including
five years of grace. The Government of the Philippines would guarantee the Bank
loan.
Background
2.          The Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines was the largest US
military facility outside the United States. Following the expiration of the
1947 Military Base Agreement between the Philippines and the United States, the
US Navy evacuated the premises in November 1992.  The Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority (SBMA) was established in March 1992 to take over the Subic baselands,
which would be converted to the Subic Bay Freeport (SBF). The site presents a
unique opportunity for industrial, commercial and tourism development, and the
base possesses assets which cannot easily be replicated, and whose replacement
value runs into several billion US dollars. In addition, the site is located
amid virgin forest of significant ecological value (this forest is included in
the Global Environment Facility Conservation of Priority Protected Areas
project).
3.          A conversion strategy for the baselands has been defined with
technical assistance provided through a Bank-executed grant from the PHRD fund.
This assistance has also resulted in the formulation of implementing rules and
regulations for the freeport regime; an assessment of the existing facilities and
the development of a land use plan for the SBF; and the development of a
privatization strategy for the disposition of the assets.   The substantial
analyses undertaken to date point to critical needs for further technical
assistance in certain areas, as well as financial assistance to enable SBMA to
undertake infrastructural improvements that are urgently required to jump-start
the freeport and attract private investors. One such improvement is the need to
reconfigure the facilities for the SBF's future industrial, commercial and
tourism activities.   Another urgently needed action  is the environmental
management of the site, ranging from establishing a baseline of information on
present ecological conditions to establishing sound environmental management
practices  at  the  SBMA  to  guide  future  SBF  development.    Institutional
strengthening is required at the SBMA to improve its overall management of the
SBF. The Government has requested Bank support in these areas.
4.          Export processing zones (EPZ) have had considerable success in the
Philippines in recent years.  Approximately 20% of foreign investments in the
country in the past five years has taken place in these zones. Two of the most
notable successes have been the Cavite and Mactan EPZs (in Calabarzon and Cebu,
respectively), which are in their last phases of expansion, and are running out



-2-
of space to accomodate new investment. Freeports typically go beyond the limited
tax and trade incentives offered in EPZ regimes, cover larger geographic areas,
and are not limited to export manufacturing activities.   Freeport registered
enterprises and individuals can freely import all types of merchandise and are
not restricted to those used directly in the manufacturing process. Finally,
freeport enterprises are not required to export a certain percentage of their
production, and are free to sell to the local market upon payment of any
applicable duties and taxes.   The SBF has generated considerable investor
interest, and some US$350 million in investment commitments have been obtained
to date.
Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement
5.          The Bank has played a major role in the Philippines through a lending
program involving some 140 operations, but has no direct experience in EPZ
development  in the country.   Experience from Bank involvement in similar
activities in other countries indicates that EPZs are most successful when they
are part of a coherent incentives and trade policy regime.   Key factors for
success include appropriate location, the availability of suitable physical trade
infrastructure, site development consistent with investor demand, and a policy
environment that fosters private sector development.   The country's trade,
investment and foreign exchange regimes are now at par with those of its more
dynamic East Asian neighbors. The SBF's regulatory framework, its location and
physical infrastructure are consistent with the success factors commonly cited
for EPZs. The project is designed to fill the gaps in the implementation of the
regulatory framework, particularly with respect to the environment, and to ensure
a phased development of the SBF.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.          The Country Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Executive
Directors on February 3, 1994, and this project is consistent with the strategy.
The Philippines is at a critical juncture in its economic history, and needs to
seize the opportunity to break out of its low economic growth cycle. Foreign
direct investment will be very important if the Philippines is to catch up with
its more affluent neighbors.   The SBF has the potential to kick-start this
process. Improving the business environment for private enterprises is a key
element of the GOP development agenda. The SBF provides a model base for the
implementation of concerted and sound business-friendly policies. The SBF has
already attracted considerable invesuor interest; however, certain institutional
and infrastructural bottlenecks prevent the SBMA from realizing the full
potential of the SBF's considerable asset base.
7.          The Bank can play a catalytic role in helping the GOP and the SBMA
effect an orderly conversion of the facility, and its presence provides a measure
of comfort to private investors. The proposed project touches on a multiplicity
of sectors. The Bank has considerable experience in and is well-equipped to deal
with the issues related to all these sectors. The bulk of the proposed financing
concerns infrastructure, for which the terms of Bank ft'nds are more appropriate
than the shorter maturity finance that would be available commercially.   The
overall financial needs of the SBF are large, and the available commercial



-3-
funding would be more effectively channeled if it supports commercial ventures.
Finally, the Bank has already been involved in the provision of technical
assistance to the SBMA to help strengthen the policy, regulatory and
institutional framework and define a conversion strategy for the baselands. The
Bank's continued involvement will help implement this conversion strategy, and,
in particular, ensure that the emphasis on environmental protection and
institutional strengthening is maintained.
Project Objectives
8.          The objective of the project is to attract private investors to the
Subic Bay Freeport (SBF). This will be achieved by: (a) improving infrastructure
and access to the area for industrial, commercial and passenger traffic; (b)
maintaining the SBF asset base, including protection of the environment; and (c)
strengthening the capacity of the SBMA to manage and administer the facility.
roject Description
9.          The project consists of three components.   The first  is site
improvement, which includes improv3ment of land access (road, bridge and entry
gates); airport improvements (runway repair, strengthening of aprons and taxiway,
airport communicati3ns and navigation equipment, and conversion of an existing
building into a passenger terminal); port repairs; a pilot standard factory
building development (6 buildings); and the provision of miscellaneous equipment
for security and maintenance purposes. The second component is institutional
support to strengthen the institutional capacity of the SBMA and to pro-tde
appropriate systems for the implementation of freeport policies. The third is
environmental protection, which includes the carrying out of an environmental
baseline survey, the provision of monitoring equipment and institutional support
to establish a scund environmental infrastructure at the SBF.
Project Implementation
10.         The project will be implemented by the SBMA, which is the sole
governmental authority charged with developing and operating the SBF.   Its
authorized capital of P20 billion, paid up tLrough lands and other transferred
assets, includes a GOP budgetary transfer of P300 million per year for three
years to meet initial working capital requirements. The legislative basis for
the SBF regime (Republic Act 7227) has been further clarified through the
adoption of its Implementing Rules and Regulations, and through the signing of
several Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with concerned GOP entities.
11.         The project cost is estimated at US$52.0 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$39.1 million (75% of total).   The total
financing required, including interest during construction, is US$54.1 million,
of which the Bank would finance US$40 million.   Retroactive financing not
exceeding US$4 million equivalent is recommended for expenditures inLurre,1 after
December 6, 1993.  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of pracurement and disburseme--s,  and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in



-4-
Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 12773-PH dated May 10, 1994, is being distributed separately.
Project Sustainability
12.         The project has been designed to undertake the bare minimum of
facilities improvements in order to increase the SBF's marketability to potential
investors. The bulk of SBF development will be undertaken by the private sector.
Over 500 expressions of interest from prospective investors had been received as
of end-1993. Thirty-two proposals have been accepted and are currently being
implemented; investment commitments of these firms amount to US$350 million, and
employment projections  stand at 12,800 over the next 1-2 years.   Private
i.nvestment in the SBF will provide a source of income to the SBMA, and
ultimately, to the GOP. The multi-sectoral private investment that is targeted
will create a diversified employment base, leading to stability and growth in a
region that has suffered the consequences of an abrupt cessation of its only
economic activity.   By 2003, it is estimated that the SBF will provide over
80,000 jobs, and generate export revenues of the order of US$750 million.
Institutional support of the SBMA foreseen in the project is designed to improve
its managerial and administrative capabilities, in order to create a viable and
sustainable  institutional  structure.    The protection  of  the  environment,
necessary for the physically sustainable development of the SBF, has been a key
concern of the SBMA, as can be seen from the SBF's land use plan, and the
proposed project interventions.
Agreed Actions
13.         Actions required prior to effectiveness are the publication of an
agreed Environmental Management Plan and of an agreed land use plan. Agreements
reached at negotiations with the Republic of the Philippines and the SBMA
include: (a) a prior consultation process with the Bank on any policy
modifications with regard to the SBF's freeport regime; (b) the implementation
of the agreed land use plan, the agreed Environmental Management Plan, and the
Environment Procedures Manual; (c) a joint review of the SBMA's policy and
organizational effectiveness to take place by July 31, 1995; (d) certain
financial covenants, including an annual, joint review of SBMA's rolling, five-
year investment plan and the revaluation of SBMA assets in a manner acceptable
to the Bank by December 31, 1995; (e) the adequate provision of water and
sewerage and solid waste management services in the SBF according to an agreed
action plan; and (f) the carrying out of the TA activities financed by the
proposed loan and the implementation of agreed recommendations according to an
agreed action plan.
Environmental Aspects
14.         An Environmental Analysis related to project-specific impacts has
been prepared by the SBMA and has been reviewed by the Bank. No resettlement of
persons is required and there are no land acquisition issues.   Environmental
conditions in the SBF are good at the present time, but sound environmental
management will be required to maintain environmental quality as the SBF develops
in the future.   A thorough analysis of the environmental management issues



-5-
related to the future development of the SBF has been undertaken as part cf the
SBMA's Environment Management Plan, which also provides a blueprint for the
organization of the SBMA's environmental management unit. This plan is being
reviewed by the Bank and its adoption will be required prior to effectiveness.
The project will finance an Environmental Baseline Survey to establish the basic
environmental conditions in the SBF, including the forest and bay areas, and
locate areas of possible contamination in view of the site's past military use.
Second, an Environment Procedures Manual establishing environmental policies and
procedures for the SBF has been adopted. Third, actions to improve environmental
administration and enforcement by the SBMA will be undertaken through, inter
alia, the hiring of staff and the provision of technical assistance and
monitoring equipment.
Project Benefits
15.         The major project benefits are: (a) economic benefits arising from
increased economic activity and employment in the region; (b) environmental
benefits arising from increased protection of the forest lands and the bay; (c)
financial benefits to the SBMA arising from increased rental and other income
from the SBF. In addition, institutional strengthening at the SBMA will result
in significant human capital development.   Given the nature of the proposed
project investments, economic rates of re-urn were estimated for individual
project components. These range from 12% to 37%, depending on the component.
Project Risks
16.         The major risks are political in nature. A policy reversal regarding
the SBF's freeport status would nullify its competitive advantages, and inflows
of foreign investment would likely diminish. To mitigate this risk, agreement
has been reached on a prior consultation process on any policy modifications with
regard to the SBF's freeport regime, and appropriate remedies against a potential
policy reversal have been included in the proposed loan. Another risk relates
to the relative lack of experience in freeport management at the SBMA.   To
address this concern, the project will provide long-term technical assistance to
provide the expertise required while training SBMA personnel on-the-job so that
they gain the necessary experience. The risk of delays in project implementation
has been minimized through intensive project preparation activity.   Another
potential risk is a delay in investor activity and occupancy of the SBF. This
risk is minimized by the nature of the incentive regime and the ready
availability of world class infrastructure, as evidenced by the actual investment
and expressions of interest received to date. The project itself is not expected
to have adverse environmental impacts. There is a risk of future environmental
degradation if satisfactory maintenance practices are not followed. The project
will address this concern.

Recommendation
18.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
