REPUBLIC OF PERU
PROGRAMMATIC SOCLIL REFORM LOAN II
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:            Republic of Peru.
Amount:              US$100 million.
Terms:               Single currency loan (SCL) in US Dollars with 17 years maturity including a
5 year grace period with Libor-based variable interest rate.
Commitment Fee:      Three-fourths of one percent per annum.
Obiectives and Descriition:
The proposed Programmatic Social Reform Loan (PSRL II) is the second phase
of a programmatic structural adjustment loan in support of the medium-term
social reform program of the Government of Peru (GOP). This loan builds on the
policy decisions and actions under PSLR I and is a critical element of Bank's
assistance to the GOP medium-term development strategy. Specific objectives of
PSRL II will be to help: (i) establish a pro-poor social expenditure regime and an
adequate social protection mechanism for the poor; (ii) improve access of the
poor to critical social programs, through better targeting, improved efficiency and
rationalization of expenditures; and (iii) improve transparency in social programs
and expenditures, as well as empower beneficiaries to participate in the policy and
budget process. While a continuation of the previous operation, PSRL II differs
in a major way at three levels: (i) it attempts to link structural adjustment actions
with medium-term results indicators (many related to the Millennium
Development Goals); (ii) it facilitates transition from short-term budget protection
during a prolonged economic slowdown to a medium-term shift in public
expenditure to benefit the poor; and (iii) it supports a consistent program of social
reforms with a series of one-tranche adjustment loans complemented closely by
technical assistance and programmatic investment loans in health and education.
The Bank would provide a total of US$300 million financing for the whole
reform program, with the first US$100 million already disbursed under PSRL I.
The triggers for proceeding with the current US$100 million loan, PSRL II, have
been met satisfactorily.
Benefits:            The immediate major benefit of the PSRL program      continues to be its
contribution to Peru's maintenance of social stability during a difficult period of
adjustment towards economic recovery. The PSRL II loan will not only continue
to protect critical social programs for the poor but will also help increase the
Substantial background work by the Govemment of Peru made this operation possible. On the Bank side, the core task
team included: Evangeline Javier (Task Team Leader, LCSHD); Keisgner Alfaro (LCOPR); Katherine Bain (LCRVP);
Livia Benavides (LCSHD); Sara Calvo (LCSPE); Daniel Cotlear (LCSHD); Elizabeth Dasso (LCCPE); Gillette Hall
(LCSHS); Jose Roberrto L6pez-Calix (LCSPE); Elizabeth Monosowski (LCSEN); Norbert Schady'(LCSPP); Paul Sisk
(LCOAA); and Laura Altobelli (Consultant). Important contributions were received from: Ana-Maria Arriagada, Theresa
Jones, Karla McEvoy, Truman Packard (LCSHD); Keta Ruiz (LCCPE); Elaine Tinsley (LCSPE); Veena Siddharth
(OPCPD), Maria Claudia Vasquez and Sixto Requena (Consultants). The peer reviewers were: Norman Hicks (LCSPP);
Michael Walton (LCRCE); John Newman (LCCBO) and Fred Levy (Consultant). Ana Maria Arteaga, Christina
Alquinta and Patricia Bemedo (LCSHD) provided excellent processing assistance.

quality and efficiency of social expenditures. The social reforms supported by the
PSRL operations are designed to help produce a shift in 14 of the 20 medium-
term development results indicators set by the GOP. The ultimate success of the
programmatic operation will be measured by the extent to which public
expenditures have actually reached the poor in Peru. The innovative mechanism
for public oversight and citizen input to social policy being supported by the
operation will enhance the influence and voice of the poor over the use of scarce
fiscal resources. The programmatic approach has also helped build consensus
among the finance ministry, the office of the Chief of Cabinet (through the CIAS)
and the social ministries on important sequential policy actions addressing key
social issues in Peru. The policy matrix has served as a convening factor for these
agencies to come together and decide how and when the GOP should act on the
social reform issues covered by this operation.
Risks:              Peru's medium-term prospects are uncertain. The country faces a number of risks
that may pose a threat to the continuation of the social reform program. These
risks include: (a) vulnerability to external shocks such as severe slowdown of
global economic conditions and recurrence of the "El Niflo" phenomenon and
their effects on growth; (b) lack of unified vision between the Executive Office
and Congress on a strategy to restore growth; (c) "wait and see" attitude of
investors leading to weak tax revenues, compounded by the political difficulty of
raising tax rates; and (d) partial reversal of some policy decisions due to
continued weak coordination and implementation capacity of social agencies. In
the context of Peru's high foreign currency debt, the extemal shocks will put
pressure on public finances and threaten the sustainability of the GOP's medium-
term pro-poor growth strategy. At the same time, political obstacles to raise tax
revenues, an incomplete privatization program and the initiation of a
decentralization program could lead to fiscal imbalances and reduce financing for
social expenditures.
To mitigate these risks, the Peruvian Govemment embarked on a four-month
National Dialogue involving the participation of political parties, academic
institutions, grassroots organization, labor unions and the private sector. The
Dialogue yielded a National Accord (Acuerdo Nacional) signed in July 2002
which reflects an agreed fiamework for a growth strategy, safety nets for the poor
and measures to address macroeconomic imbalances under an IMF-supported
program. The Govemment is also building a contingent financing plan,
combining efforts to increase extemal donor financing, access of intemational
capital markets by placing sovereign bonds and gradually proceeding with
privatization plans. These efforts are complemented by structural reforms
directed to achieve the Govermment's medium-term results targets. Key elements
of the medium-term reforms include rationalization of public expenditures,
overhaul of the tax and pension system, increasing competitiveness, further
strengthening the financial sector, and modernization of public institutions. To
minimize the possibility of reversal of the social reforms supported by the PSRL,
CIAS will be strengthened, supported by Bank-financed technical assistance, to
continue exercising its role of coordinating and influencing social policies in
Peru.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED PROGRAMMATIC SOCIAL REFORM LOAN II
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed Programmatic
Social Reform Loan II (PSRL II) to the Republic of Peru for US$100 million to continue Bank support to
the Government's medium-term social reform program. The loan will be a single currency loan (SCL) in
US Dollars with 17 years maturity including 5 years of grace with Libor-based variable interest rate.
2. The PSRL II will be the second of three loans using a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan
(PSAL) instrument supporting Peru's social reformn program. The first phase, PSRL I, was approved by
the Board on June 19, 2001 and US$100 million was fully disbursed on July 9, 2001. PSRL I initiated a
medium-term reform program aiming to improve social expenditure transparency and rationalization,
increase the poor's access to social services as well as protect them especially during crisis. President
Toledo's Government, which assumed office in late July 2001, has indicated its commitment to continue,
and in some areas, even further the reforms initiated by the Transition Government.
3. While a continuation of the previous operation, PSRL II differs from the PSRL I at three levels: (a)
it attempts to establish a link between structural adjustment actions and measurable medium-term results
indicators (many related to the Millennium Development Goals); (b) it facilitates transition from short-
term budget protection during prolonged economic slowdown to a medium-term shift in public
expenditure to benefit the poor; and (c) it supports a program of social reforms with a series of one-tranche
adjustment loans complemented closely by technical assistance and programmatic investment loans in
health and education.
I. The Economic and Social Setting
A. Peru: A Country Consolidating Democracy
4. President Alejandro Toledo's administration is consolidating democracy following President
Fujimori's sudden desertion of the presidency after a decade in power. In July 2001, President Toledo, the
first Peruvian  indigenous president, took office as Peru's 57 ' president for a 5 year term.  His
government's major agenda is to re-instate economic recovery and growth and rebuild institutions in order
to consolidate Peru's democracy and ensure social stability. He has to bring back investors' confidence,
strengthen Peru's governance and ensure stable macroeconomic policies and structural reforrns.
5. Soon after taking office President Toledo has gained fast support on the international front. In
October 2001, the Government announced economic measures which received strong international support
in the Madrid Consultative Group Meeting. By February 2002 the Government signed a new two-year
Stand-by Agreement with the IMF for US$316 million covering 2002-03. This agreement is seen as a
stamp of approval for the economic policies of President Toledo's Government. Peru also received a
strong sign of international investors' confidence through its first global bonds placement since 1928. The
Government sold US$500 million in new global ten-year bonds and issued an additional US$930 million
to retire the Brady bonds, successfully lowering debt- servicing costs. In early August the US approved the
Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) which allows a range of products from Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and
Colombia into the US at zero tariffs.
8



6. In the domestic front, however, the Toledo Administration took sometime to announce the details of
its economic policies. This created discontent especially among the population most affected by the
lingering economic slowdown, largely due to external shocks and weak private investment. Poverty and
unemployment had risen substantially. Violent protests over the privatization of two electric companies
have set back the Government's strategy, lowering the estimates of privatization revenues. President
Toledo's approval rate quickly declined. Moreover, the Peruvians have had a political "honeymoon" with
President Toledo's predecessorl and have been quick to protest now that freedom of expression has been
recovered.
7. President Toledo's government is indeed fighting to preserve a fragile democracy as the open political
environment has brought out clearly the social problems in Peru. To complicate matters, the new
congress, with a significant representation from the provinces, does not always agree with the executive's
reform initiatives. To confront this situation, the Government carried out an unprecedented organized
dialogue, convening different political parties and civil society, to reach a shared vision on Peru's growth
strategy. This shared vision is laid out in a National Accord that was signed in July 2002. Related to this,
and linked to the PSRL program, the Government is defining specific targets for a set of 20 results
indicators to measure progress in implementing its development strategy.
B. Macroeconomic Conditions and Outlook
8.  Peru's macroeconomic conditions have remained stable, but uncertainty for the medium-term
remains. Peru's inflation is single-digit (Figure 1), international reserves are adequate,2 and growth has
resumed driven by construction and mining. But recovery in employment is weak and vulnerabilities
remain. Adequate government financing is not certain after the recent privatization suspension, bank credit
to the private sector continues to fall, foreign currency debt is high, fiscal revenue and exports should be
much larger, and fiscal adjustment is lagging. A new Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF aimed at
closing macroeconomic imbalances has been in place since January 2002. While revenues are anticipated
to rise with a tax reform already underway, delays in the implementation of both the tax reform and
privatization agenda may result in a need to contract public expenditures in order to maintain fiscal
stability. Two major challenges of the Gvernment are to: (i) maintain and build stable economic policies
that will engender investors' confidence for growth, and (ii) build effective public institutions.
9.   Growth has been volatile in Peru. During the capital inflow-surge episode of the 1990s, and until the
emerging market crises of 1997-1998, real GDP growth in Latin America averaged around 4 percent a
year. Peru was no exception. During 1991-1997, Peru's average annual real GDP growth rate was over 5
percent, reaching 7 percent during 1993-1997. Since 1998, however, and with the exception of 2000,
economic growth in Peru has been meager (Figure 1). In urban areas this has led to an increase of 2
percentage point in unemployment to 11 percent (April 2002), and loss of the poverty reduction gains of
the mid 90s, like in the rest of the Latin America region.
10.    While structural reforms in the nineties put Peru amongst the top performers among Latin
American countries (second only to Bolivia),3 the combination of external shocks and a political crisis
during 2000-2001 explain Peru's faltering growth in the last few years. The high cost and scarcity of
external financing, deterioration of terms of trade, and the El Nino weather phenomenon were the main
shocks hitting Peru in the late 1990s. And the large drop of the current account deficit to 2.1 percent of
GDP in 1999 from 6.4 percent of GDP in 1998 is a reflection of the deep adjustment that took place in
response to external shocks in Peru (Figure 2).

11. Peru's fiscal stance is fragile, but present reforms are addressing vulnerabilities. The shocks of
the late 1990s led to a deterioration of public finances. The revenue increase of the boom period was
accompanied by an increase in expenditures that were not cut when the shocks hit Peru. This led to a
primary and overall budget deficit to surface, reaching 1.0 percent and 3.1 percent in 1999, respectively.
Poor policy decisions such as a new tax exemptions in the previous Administration and wage increases in
recent years have contributed to sustain these deficits. The 2001 overall fiscal deficit has been estimated
at 2.4 percent of GDP. This deficit is 0.8 percentage point lower than last year's, but higher than the 2
percent of GDP target required by the Fiscal Responsibility Law approved in 2000. Peru's new Stand-by
Arrangement with the IMF envisages a overall budget deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2002 and 1.4
percent in 2003. The Arrangement supports structural reforms including a tax reform, revamping of the
Fiscal Responsibility law and tax collection agency (SUNAT), and pension system reform aimed at
addressing fiscal imbalances. Also, the Government has already implemented the first phase of a phased
reform of the public and private pension systems that have become a source of contingent liabilities of
around 0.3 percent of GDP. The second phase will focus on lowering operating costs of private pension
administrators and expanding their investment options.4

12. While bank deposit and lending rates have come down substantially,5 deposit-lending interest rate
spreads remain high. This reflects risks in the banking system in view of slow growth, levels of incomes
required to fund provisions and inefficiencies in the sector. Today, non performing loans stand at 11
percent of total loans, but there has been no further deterioration in the performance of bank portfolios
since mid-2000 (Annex 3). Furthermore, loan-loss provisions in terms of non performing loans increased
to 98.1 percent in 2001 from 78.5 in 2000. Efforts to strengthen further the banking supervisory
framework are underway. Non performing loans, together with pension system and local government debt,
remain a threat to sustainable budget deficit in Peru. Although registered municipal debt is small, non-
registered debt could be significant for some local govermnents.
13. Peru's debt is high. In 2001, Peru's debt was estimated at 3.2 times exports of goods and services. Of
this amount, private external debt accounts for about 30 percent ($8.1billion), of which nearly 40 percent
is short term and mostly linked to foreign trade transactions. Public external debt represents around 70
percent of Peru's total external debt, and virtually all is long term. Total public debt, both domestic and
external, is about $25 billion,, or 2.6 times general government current revenue. Over three-quarters of the
total debt is external, and around 60 percent of the public debt is with multilateral and bilateral creditors
(Figure 3-5). Growing debt service, which increased from 3 percent of GDP in 1998 to 3.8 percent of
GDP in 2002, has contributed to tighten already scarce resources in a shrinking and rigid budget.

' These are 16.3 and 8.4 percentage points in domestic and foreign currency, respectively. Spreads between average domestic and lending rates in
domestic currency (TAMN and TIPMN) and the same in foreign currency (TAMEX and TIPMEX).
6 These ratios amount to 1.8 and 2; and 0.9 and 2.5, respectively.

14. This debt profile makes Peru less vulnerable to sudden changes in investor sentimnent compared to
other Latin America emerging markets. Peru had boffowed in international markets until Febnuiry 2002,
when it placed a US$500 million tenyear global bond and, to reduce debt servicing costs, issued an
additional $930 million to retire the Brady bonds. This was a successful operation since the spread
obtained was lower than that of Colombia, which had placed an international bond only a few months
earlier. Since then, international bond spreads have increased due to increased domestic and regional
uncertainty. In an effort to develop the capital market, the Government issued domestic currency debt, but
at current stock levels (US$340 million in 2001 and US$570 million targeted for 2002), it does not imply
a significant additional vulnerability risk in Peru.
15. Debt sustainability is a challenge for the Peruvian  Fige 5 Public ExemI DOM Conotla by
Government.    The Government's recent success in                or - De 200
placing a global bond is an indication of willingness of  a   5       %            e   xb
the international financial markets to lend to Peru. a  .1ib
However, in light of current economic and political
uncertainties, it may be difficult for the Government to
borrow internationally in the future. Bank debt
sustainability analysis suggests that Peru needs to achieve
growth rates of 3-4 percent and a small fiscal surplus in
the medium term to continue servicing its debt (Annex 3).
Under this scenario, the public external debt/GDP is expected to improve from 2002 on. Lower than
expected privatizations and realization of contingent liabilities will certainly demand higher growth rates
and fiscal surplus to prevent solvency problems.
16. Because of Peru's high degree of dollarization, it does not have much freedom in monetary and
exchange rate policies. Increased liquidity through a reduction in bank reserve requirements will quickly
translate into inflation or intemational reserve losses, if the Central Bank attempts to keep the exchange
rate stable.' Fast exchange rate depreciation will lead to deeper bank balance sheet problems. In the
context of high debt, these policy constraints make Peru vulnerable and highlight the need to addressing
fiscal imbalances and increase exports. Peru's exports have grown in recent years, however they are still
low, at 16 percent of GDP (2001). Larger exports will prevent large adjustments of relative prices, and in
turn, pressure in the fiscal accounts, if faced with negative shocks.
' Peru has a flexible exchange rate regimes, but at times, intervention through open market operations has been use to keep the exchange rate from
high volatility.



17. Uncertainty remains about Peru's medium term outlook. Bank projections for 2002 onwards
point to a moderate recovery in real growth of about 3-4 percent a year and low inflation within the 1.5-2.5
percent range a year (Annex 3). This is consistent with an average GDP growth rate of 3.0 percent
achieved in the first quarter of 2002.8 Sustained growth will be achieved on the basis of credible
macroeconomic policies, booming of the mining sector (in part due to the first-full year operation of the
Antamina project), enhanced competitiveness and productivity derived from continuous implementation of
planned structural reforms, and availability of domestic and external financing. Structural reforms in the
macro-finance area include strengthening of the banking sector and public sector institutions, a complete
pension system reform, and a tax reform.
18. Peru's major vulnerabilities are its foreign currency debt, as discussed, and instability in the political
arena that makes it difficult to achieve a unified voice regarding a strategy to restore growth. Success of
the complex reforms requires strong institutional leadership, as well as improved implementation capacity
of social agencies. Uncertainty about the ability of the Government to carry out its strategy and sustain a
credible economic program will lead to a wait-and-see attitude from investors. This in turn will hinder
growth in sectors other than the primary sector, leaving the economy vulnerable to the vagaries of
international investors and commodity price volatility. The support of civil society institutions are
instrumental in mitigating these risks, so as to promote, through concerted mechanisms, a common-shared
vision in the mediun-term.
19. In this context, and after several years of slowdown in economic activity, it is crucial to continue
protecting the social programs under the proposed PSRL II and to design programs that would protect the
poor in case of further slowdown but also to rationalize the use of fiscal resources in these programs. At
the same time,  PSRL II also supports the improvement of the quality and efficiency of public
expenditures such as a shift towards pro-poor social programs; increased access of the poor to health,
nutrition, education, and culture; improved transparency of informnation, and citizens' participation in
program oversight. Thus, financing under the proposed PSRL II will support Peru's economic and
social stability during a difficult economic recovery period.
C. Poverty and Social Conditions
20. Since the approval of PSRL I, more accurate estimates of poverty rates in Peru have been published.9
These revised estimates confirmed that poverty reduction gains during the first half of the decade have
been partially reversed in recent years. The poverty situation has worsened as the economy registered the
impact of the Russian and Brazilian crisis in the late 90s, and of the regional slowdown of 2001. Between
1997 and 2001, the national poverty rate increased from 42.7 percent to 49.8 percent of the population.
The increase in the poverty rate affected both urban areas (where poverty went up from 29.7 percent to
35.7 percent) and rural areas (where poverty went up from 66.3 percent to 75.9 percent). Like the poverty
rate, the extreme poverty rate increased from 18.2 percent in 1997 to 19.5 percent in 2001. Most of this
increase was concentrated in rural areas, where the bulk of the extreme poor in Peru live: between 1997
and 2001 the extreme poverty rate went up from 41.5 percent to 45.2 percent in rural areas, and from 5.3
percent to 5.7 percent in urban areas.
21. While these estimates provide the most accurate picture of the evolution of poverty and extreme
poverty in Peru between 1997 and 2001, they do not provide the most accurate snapshot of poverty and
extreme poverty conditions in Peru in 2001. As part of the preparatory activities for the 2003 census, the
national statistical institute (INEI) updated the sample framework for the ENAHO household surveys, and
hData soure: INE

collected additional data to more accurately estimate prices in different geographic regions in Peru. As a
result of these improvements, .lNEI estimates that the poverty rate in 2001 is 54.8 .percent, and the
extreme poverty rate.is 24.4 percent. Because they use more accurate data on prices, and include
samples of new communities formed between 1993 and 2001 (and which were formerly excluded from
the household surveys), these are the best estimates of poverty and extreme poverty in 2001. They are
therefore used throughout the document, as well as in the setting of the GOP 2001 baselines and 2006
targets. However, they cannot be used for comparisons between 2001 and any earlier year: To make these
comparisons, the methodology for setting prices and for sampling households has to be kept constant.
This explains the differences between the 2001 estimates which can be compared to earlier years, and the
more accurate estimates in the GOP baseline and targets.
22. Poverty and extreme poverty are much more pronounced in rural areas than in:urban areas in Peru.
Other measures of well-being, including measures of health status and educational attainment, show a
similar pattern. Chronic malnutrition is three times as high in rural areas (40 percent) as in urban areas (13
percent), while infaut mortality is about twice as high in rural areas (45 per thousand) as in urban areas (24
per thousand in Peru). Finally, rural areas also have much worse education outcomes than urban areas:
The fraction of children of secondary-school age attending secondary school is substantially higher in
urban areas (74 percent) than in rural areas (44 percent) while adult illiteracy is five times as high in rura
areas (26 percent) as in urban areas in Peru (5.3 percent). Further, it is estimated that majority of the
indigenous population - located mainly in the Amazon area and the high Andes - live in extreme poverty
with very limited access to basic services, justice and land titles.
23. Poverty reduction strategies of recent govermments have emphasized an increase in social
expenditures. The share of social expenditures to GDP evolved from 3.9 percent in 1990 to 7.0 percent in
1999, and this share has remained steady up to 2002. The fact that the share of social expenditures to
GDP has not declined is a particularly positive phenomenon in an environment of fiscal
retrenchment, where total public expenditures decreased from 18.9 percent of GDP to 17.8 percent
of GDP in the period 1999-2002 (Figure 6).

24. Significant inter- and intra-sectoral pro-poor spending reallocation began to take place between 2000
and 2002. On the one hand, budgets for defense and national security decreased from 2.9 to 2.1 percent of
GDP. On the other hand, budgets fo: education, health spending and social assistance increased from 5.3

to 5.6 percent of GDP. Complementary to these shifts, ESSALUD expenditure (non-targeted public health
insurance administration) decreased from 1.5 to 1.3 percent of GDP (Table 1). In a similar vein, the share
of poverty reduction programs (consisting of programs with universal coverage-education and health) to
total social expenditure increased from 57 percent in 2000 to 60 percent in 2002 (Table 1).

25;  While government social programs may have alleviated the full impact of economic recession on the
poor, the lack and/or recent loss of full-time employment opportunities has surfaced as a primary problem
expressed by majority of the Peruvian population. Labor statistics show that only about one half of the
labor force are adequately employed (i.e. the other half being underemployed) and that unemployment
increased from 7.5 percent in December of 1977 to 9.7 percent in _eptember 2001. Thus, a stated priority
of the new Government is the promotion of adequate employment. To this end, several programs are being
launched to respond to short-term job needs - notably the emergency social productive program "A
Trabajar" (see section III.C- while a medium-term strategy for more stable employment creation is being
developed.

II. The Government's Medium-Term Development Strategy
26. During the Transition Government of President Paniagua, Peru experienced the rebirth of an open
political environment. The Transition team initiated reformns to establish a solid basis for growth and
carried out initiatives to improve consensus-building and instituted transparency in public management.
Building on this momentum, President Toledo and his key cabinet ministers announced a strategy that
focuses on the reduction of poverty and the consolidation of democratic and transparent institutions
in Peru. This strategy seeks to:
a. Adopt short and medium-term   macroeconomic measures to foster economic recovery,
sustained growth and stable employment and income;
b. Ensure that all Peruvians have full access to health, education, culture and basic services; and
c. Create a state that serves the people. In practical tenns, this implies giving voice to the people,
transparent management of state resources, decentralization of services to local governments,
and respect for the independence of judiciary and all autonomous institutions, among others.
27. The GOP classifies this strategy into three pillars - Dignity, Equity and Institutionality. The sectors
or themes covered by each pillar and corresponding 20 results indicators to measure implementation
progress are presented in Table 2. The results indicators reflect to a large extent the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) adapted to priorities in Peru. It is important to note that the GOP is still in
the process of refining this list and changes may be introduced in some of the indicators. The Bank,
through the supervision of PSRL II and preparation of PSRL III, will continue to assist the GOP in the
refining these indicators and defining their targets.
28. The President's Council of Ministers (PCM) with the Technical Secretariat of CIAS (Inter-Ministerial
Social Policy Committee) presented preliminary targets for some of the indicators based on available
baseline information. However, the definition of these targets is very much work-in-progress. Baseline
information, especially for the indicators under the Institutionality Pillar, will require special effort to be
gathered or constructed. CIAS is in the midst of working with the different sectors to define the
intermediate outcomes, as well as the conditions, programs, and constraints for setting definitive targets up
to 2006. The technical and political processes being carried out in this respect are shown in Annex 6. The
Bank will continue to assist CIAS in these processes through a separate Technical Assistance Loan, which
will also finance the implementation of critical actions under PSRL II and the preparation of benchmarks
for PSRL HI. The GOP's medium-term strategy and its results indicators will similarly serve as the
roadmap for the definition of Bank's future assistance strategy in Peru.1'
"A new CAS for FY03-07 is being prepared and will be presented to the Board in FY03.

29. The Transition Government of President Paniagua initiated a reform program consolidating the
positive shifts of past social expenditures but markedly de-politicizing resource allocation. It also began
to rebuild institutions, systems, and capacities in the social areas, as well as initiated a methodology for an
objective allocation of budget resources and their perforrnance-based tracking. Social institutions that
were weakened in the past decades have begun to be reconstructed with the hope that they would
withstand future government changes and political whims. Technical tools to facilitate this process of
institutional strengthening are now continuously being developed or improved under the reform program.
In addition to initiating systemic changes, the Transition Government committed to protect the US$1.0
billion budget of a critical set of social programs in 2001 to cushion the effects of the deepening economic
crisis on the poor.
A. Social Reform Objectives
30. The Toledo Government confirmed the continuation of the reforms initiated by the Transition
Government. Furthermore, while building on past progress, it will now emphasize actions that directly
support medium-term social development targets while maintaining the stability of a fagile economy that
is still suffering from the effects of external shocks and low investor confidence. The priority will be to
ensure that resources are being allocated for, and in fact getting to, the poor population. The social reform
agenda of the Toledo Government is laid out in a Social Development Policy Letter sent to the Bank on
May 17, 2002. Among its social reform priorities, the current operation will especially support the
following medium-term objectives, essentially continuing those pursued under PSRL I:
(i)  Establishing a pro-poor social expenditure regime and an adequate social protection mechanism
for the poor.
(ii) Improving access of the poor to critical social programs, through better targeting, improved
efficiency and rationalization of expenditures; and
(iii) Improving transparency in social programs and expenditures and empowering beneficiaries to
participate in the policy and budget process
31. The roadmap for these objectives, including the principal reform areas and the related medium-term
outcomes indicators of the reform process, is laid out in Table 3. The subsequent sections of the MOP and
Annex 2 (the Policy Matrix) will elaborate on the specific actions being taken under each of these reform
areas. Specific actions in these reform areas (i.e. the benchmarks for this adjustment operation), are
anticipated to affect 14 of the 20 medium-tem results indicators set out by the GOP. Note that these
reform areas build clearly upon those initiated during the Transition Government, under PSRL 1.

B. Programmatic Assistance to GOP Social Reforms
32. The programmatic structural adjustment loan (PSAL instrument) supported the initial set of reforms
introduced by the Transition Government, and extends that support to their continuation by the new
Government. This programmatic approach has proven useful as the Bank was able to assist the reforms of
an outgoing government and at the same time prepare the framework and path for negotiations with the
incoming Toledo Administration. The specific actions taken by the Transition Government which formed
the benchmarks of the first loan (Programmatic Social Reform Loan I, PSRL I) are summarized in Annex
4.
33. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) highlighted the following findings and lessons
learned from the first loan:
Positive aspects
(i) The overall objectives of the PSRL were important and appropriate - a conclusion supported by
the operation's immediate objective to contribute to a stable economic transition in a period of
political uncertainty, the consistency of the reform objectives with the CAS and the clearly
enunciated national priorities, and the risk-mitigating factors taken before proceeding with the first
loan.
(ii) Achievement of the reform objectives was correctly foreseen to require several years of step-by-
step progress in adjusting policies and building institutional capacities. This progress will likely
require continuing external support and advice. These were precisely the objectives and
institution-building context for which the PSAL instrument was designed.
(iii) A substantial volume of economic and sector work, supported by the Bank and others, as well as
consultation with civil society groups which had been carried out over several years, provided a
solid knowledge base upon which to design the program.
(iv) Notwithstanding the weaknesses of the protected social expenditures (e.g. too broad and
indiscriminate), a new consciousness has been created of the need for social protection measures
and these initiatives appear unlikely to be reversed.
(v) Considerable progress has been made in setting up mechanisms that give greater transparency to
governance in the social sectors. Although these mechanisms can be expected to evolve and
change with time and experience, this breakthrough to more open government appears unlikely to
be reversed.
Areas for Improvement
(vi) The operation might have benefited from a more concentrated emphasis on four or five key
elements of the reform program.
(vii) Underplaying the political economy of some of the reforms may have given an unduly optimistic
impression of the feasible speed with which the program's objectives could be realized. Rather
than confronting directly the elimination of programs, it may be more feasible to define a clear set
of budgetary priorities-e.g., nutritional programs that serve children under five years of age-
assuring their adequate funding, while gradually reducing allocations to other programs. Giving
positive publicity to the priority programs could help to support such an approach.
19



(viii) It will take time for the transparency and social control institutional framework to evolve and
function as both government and civil society discover the advantages of openness and how to use
the growing interchange of information. The same is true for achieving greater coordination of
social policies and programs within the public sector. Start-up costs are likely to be especially
high and may involve some wasteful wheel spinning in the transition period. These costs should
be viewed as an investment, and the governments and international donors that support their
undertaking must be prepared for a lengthy gestation period and must be willing to accept the
uncertainties involved. The PSAL appears to be an instrument well adapted to this situation.
34. On the process side, some front-loaded decisions or actions initiated under the PSRL would have
benefited from continued technical assistance even after the first Loan was fully disbursed. The Japanese
PHRD Grant which financed the preparation of PSRL I closed after Board. The absence of technical
assistance financing required some actions to be re-started (with new people) to be able to prepare for the
benchmarks of the second operation.
35. Taking into account the above lessons, the second loan (PSRL I) in the programmatic series will
focus on key actions that, together, would help produce a shift in 14 of the 20 medium-term targets of the
Government. To show this linkage, the medium-term reform areas summarized in Table 3 have been
mapped according to the three pillars of the GOP strategy. It also shows the results indicators that would
be affected by the reforms. It must be noted, however, that a straight causality between the reforms and
the medium-term results indicators is hard to establish. Nonetheless, where it is possible, intermediate
outputs/outcomes linked to the results indicators were defined as benchmarks for some of the reform
actions (see policy matrix). In some areas, e.g. transparency and participation, the balance is tilted
towards process - type actions in PSRL II and would change to more output/intermediate outcome
indicators in PSRL III.
36. The Government needs assistance in order to carry out the complicated political and technical
processes of implementing critical actions of the second loan, as well as to meet the triggers for the third
loan. During appraisal, the Ministry of Finance requested the Bank for a Technical Assistance Loan
(TAL, US$5.0 - US$8 million) and a PPF advance of US$ 1.5 million to accompany the PSRL. The TAL
is expected to be presented to the Board in FY03.
37. As noted in the ICR, the PSRL I President's Report elaborated on the long trajectory of development
of the reform actions contemplated under this programmatic operation.  Said President's Report
established that policy dialogue based on a number of pieces of economic and sector work, three poverty
fora, and various other stakeholder consultations all contributed to the definition of the reform decisions
and actions supported by the PSRL. The stakeholder consultations are summarized in Annex 5.
38. One major piece of sector work currently contributing to the refinement of PSRL H benchmarks is
the ongoing Public Expenditure Review (PER). One of the goals of the PER is to assess the efficacy and
efficiency of social spending. Supported by a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS), the PER will
identify critical bottlenecks in the flow of public funds and quality of service delivery at the local level,
particularly in municipalities and schools located outside Lima. The PETS are covering the main transfers
from the Central Government to municipalities (Vaso de Leche and the Mining Canon) and from the
Ministries of Education and Presidency to teacher's payroll and food programs (school breakfast).
Emerging recommendations, such as the refinement of the Protected Social Programs, have now
influenced the preparation of PSRL H. As the PER is finalized, results and action plans will be taken into
account in PSRL HI.
20



C. Social Reform Areas
39. The detailed social reforrns that the GOP is carrying out under each of the three pillars (see Table 3)
are described in this Section. The most critical of the reform decisions or actions are included as
benchmarks for PSRL H and PSRL m (see policy matrix in Annex 2). In contrast to the state of
uncertainty under the first loan, the reforms can now be mapped - and their results evaluated - under the
three major pillars of the new GOP medium-term strategy. The change in presentation between PSRL I
and II , however, does not nullify the continuation of the underlying principles of the reform program:
transparent and participatory resource allocation, rationalization of expenditures, better access to services
and improved protection of the poor against a variety of risks.
C.A Dignity Pillar
40. The GOP has established the mean monthly income of workers in the lowest income quintile, the
proportion of population in poverty and extreme poverty, and the unemployment rate as the medium-term
development indicators for the Dignity Pillar of its development strategy, the goals of which include
poverty reduction and the creation of "dignified" and productive employment. Meeting the targets for
these indicators will require high aggregate growth rates as well as a reasonable distribution of the benefits
of growth.
41. Social programs play a critical role in ensuring that growth benefits the poor. In this context, there
are three general areas in the social sectors, broadly defined, in which the PSRL operation will support
important reforms:
a. First, the PSRL will support a re-orientation of the budget towards programs which benefit
the poor. Under the Toledo administration, the budget has shifted towards expenditures in
education, health, social protection, and the generation of productive infrastructure in rural areas,
and away from spending on defense and security.
b. Second, the PSRL will support initiatives which ensure that there is an appropriate safety net
for the poor, and for those who have suffered from idiosyncratic or systemic shocks.
Reforms in this area involve the protection of critical social expenditures in the event of an
economic slowdown, the creation of a counter-cyclical workfare program ("A Trabajar"), the
rationalization of expenditures on feeding programs, and improved pension coverage and equity.
c. Third, the PSRL will support reforms to unify scattered programs and improve targeting of
resources for these programs.
C1.1 Shifting to Pro-Poor Expenditure
42. As a central part of the on-going design of its poverty reduction strategy, the GOP aims to shift
public expenditure towards the priority social needs of the poor. Along this line, the GOP will: (i)
increasingly reorient expenditure towards social and productive rural infrastructure programs; (ii) within
the social programs, gradually reallocate resources from inefficient (e.g. some food supplements) to better-
designed programs (A Trabajar); and (iii) improve the targeting of social and rural infrastructure programs
to ensure that resources are directed towards the poor. The first of these actions is discussed below. The
second and third are discussed in subsequent sections of the MOP.
21



43. In the last two years the GOP has shifted to Multi-Annual Budgeting (MAB)14, a useful framework
in which to plan and carry out the intended pro-poor shifts in expenditure policy. MABs establish 5-year
budget priorities and allocations for each sector, which are then used as references for setting spending
priorities for annual budgets. Disaggregated inter- and intra-sectoral ministerial allocations are made
consistent with overall fiscal targets. MABs are intended to be living documents, subject to yearly
revisions.
44. Changes in the 2002-06 MAB reflect a strong shift to finance pro-poor social policies. Major
changes in multi-annual budget allocations include: (i) an increased budget share of education and health,
from 21 percent of total budget in 1997-2001 to 30 percent in 2002-06; (ii) a significantly reduced
allocation for defense and national security, from 24 percent to 20 percent of total budget during the same
period; and (iii) a significant decrease in the allocation to poorly performing social assistance programs,
some of them grouped under the Presidency, which suggests the present Administration's intention to
rationalize and decentralize them. Confirmation that the priority in the 2002 budget is in line with (i) and
(ii) above was a benchmark for PSRL II and its execution for PSRL m. In addition, for PSRL m, the
aim is for the 2003 budget allocations to social sectors not to be lower than their agreed 2002 executed
levels in real terms, in line with the poverty reduction agenda under the MAB 2002-07.
45. GOP expects to carry out certain improvements in the MABs: (i) Actual expenditure allocations will
be reviewed twice a year to correct for deviations; (ii) MABs will be revised annually and adjusted to new
priorities; (iii) their link to the annual budget will be improved and prepared in a timely manner; (iv) from
2003 onwards, supported by a participatory process, MABs will take into consideration regional and local
poverty priorities in a major geographic reorientation of public investment; (v) SIAF will include budget
performance monitoring indicators, and the Ministries' execution will be regularly monitored against their
benchmarks; and (vi) as MABs get mainstreamed and regularly published in the web, Congress and civil
society will have increasing oversight over their correspondence with annual-programmed and
executed-budget expenditures.
46. Consistent with the MAB, the Government had set an aggregate budget allocation for three priority
social sectors-education, health and social assistance - that increased from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2001
to 5.6 percent of GDP. Such allocation, according to PSRL I commitments, was also positive in real terms
with respect to 2001. This measure was complemented by the restructuring of the Priority Social
Programs (PSPs) under PSRL 11 and their new role as a critical element in the poverty reduction strategy.
47. In January 2002, Congress approved the Framework Law for the Modernization of the State. This
Law allows the Executive to gradually set management contracts with public sector institutions. The GOP
plans to shift to a performance-based budget by 2003, possibly starting with selected pilot social
ministries, programs and/or projects. The GOP is also expected to implement the PER recommendations
to strengthen the functioning of the multi-annual and annual budgeting framework with the support of
PSRL III.
C1.2 SocialProtection
48. Social expenditures in Peru are mostly pro-cyclical, such that their spending rises during periods of
economic growth, but falls during economic downturns when such interventions are most needed. Even
when aggregate social spending increases, there is no reason to believe that non-wage spending-capital
investment and outlays whose minimum budget allocation should be protected to guarantee achievement
of selected medium-term expenditure goals-would receive their budgeted amount. Programs that are
widely considered to be key components of a basic social safety net (e.g. workfare and conditional cash
" MAB is a summary budget consolidating individual PESEMs (Planes Esitrdegicos Sectoriales Multianuales).
22



transfers) were non-existent until recently. Moreover, social insurance programs (public pensions) are
costly (18 percent of central government expenditures in 2002) and inefficient: they represent the bulk of
government spending on subsidized income transfers yet are directed mostly to non-poor households,
while those employed in the infornal sector are excluded from opportunities to obtain basic social
insurance (old-age pensions, health insurance, etc.), a key mechanism for reducing vulnerability.
49. Since 2001 the GOP has initiated actions that, given time, could develop into an effective social
protection strategy. These actions include: (a) budget protection for a series of selected social programs;
(b) introduction of a workfare program; (c) unification/targeting improvement, and where applicable,
budget reduction in food/nutrition programs; and (d) reduction of the public pension system deficit,
while exploring options for expanding basic social insurance options for the poor and redirecting subsidies
to poor households. The strategy and implementation progress of each of these components are discussed
below.
(a)     Protected Social Programs
50. Under PSRL I, the Government established a budget mechanism to assure adequate financing for a
series of Protected Social Programs (PSPs) during periods of recession. This approach consisted of
assigning a global budget allocation to non-salary current and capital spending for 11 selected
programs, distributed among eight sectors (functions): education, health, transport, justice and peace,
social and community assistance, sanitation, agriculture and energy. In 2001, the government protected a
minimum aggregate budget allocation of about US$1.0 billion, (or 12.7 percent of the ordinary budget
and 1.9 percent of GDP) for these programs, despite predictable fluctuations in revenues (Table 4).

51. The end-2001 budget execution showed that the GOP complied with their commitment by
transferring an aggregate amount of US$1.1 billion - 13.1 percent of ordinary budget or 1.9 percent of
GDP - slightly above its target despite recessionary trends in 2001. Such anti-cyclical behavior in social
expenditures was atypical in Peru, particularly in light of the significant economic slowdown all year due
to unfavorable external and internal events. Moreover, in 2002, the GOP increased the broad aggregate
allocation to the original list of PSPs to an amount equivalent to 2.0 percent of GDP.
52. Compliance with the PSPs' spending floors deserves, however, a few clarifications relevant to the
need for their restructuring under PSRL II. First, protecting agreed expenditure levels did not contribute
to the 2001 fiscal expansion. Given the highly rigid budget structure, in which less than 14 percent of total
resources are available for non-wage recurrent and investment needs, the protected budgets of the PSPs
complicated the flexibility needed to finance the fiscal deficit. Second, a few individual programs
exhibited significant variations between target and actual expenditures, e.g. under-execution in education
and over-execution in health, social and community assistance, and agriculture. Over-execution was
mainly due to a moderate expansion of rural health and school breakfast programs, as well as unexpected
expenses associated with natural disasters like the Arequipa earthquake and preventive works for possible
effects of an anticipated recurrence of and El Nino. Under-execution in education programs resulted as
funds were reallocated to the hiring of new teachers (salary expenses) planned to be regularized during the
Transition Government. Third, the definition of the set of protected programs was too broad, protecting
some programs of limited efficiency.
53. Fine-tuning the PSPs. For PSRL , and supported by the ongoing PER, the Government and the
Bank fine-tuned the PSPs. The refinements will improve the focus, efficiency, monitoring mechanisms
and transparency of PSP management, including:
(i) Budget protection has now been introduced at the level of aggregate expenditure on the PSPs,
not only as a budget protection tool when a downturn occurs, but as a minimum expenditure
'floor' required to make progress towards medium-term development goals;
(ii) The number of PSPs has been reduced from twelve to six (see column 5 of Table 4),
narrowing the focus to those programs with more efficient and pro-poor expenditure
patterns, under three sector functions: education (pre-primary, primary and secondary),
health (collective and individual) and social assistance. The amount of earmarked
expenditure to the PSPs is thus reduced to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2002, down from 1.9
percent of GDP in 2001. This reduction allows for increased budget flexibility, an important
priority in a rigid budget management framework. It is important to note, however, that
budgets allocated to these six programs (the reduced set of PSPs) have been increased from
1 percent of GDP in 2001 to 1.2 percent in 2002;
(iii) At the project level, selected health, education and social assistance projects have introduced
monitoring indicators, and in some cases, performance management contracts (e.g. the
Mother and Child Health Insurance (SIS-MI));
(iv) Compliance by the GOP will be evaluated according to both approved and executed
spending, and at three levels-sector functions, program and project. In addition, budget
flexibility will be introduced by reducing execution floors in the case of a major shortfall of
budgetary resources, and by setting ceilings for budget reassignment from under-
performing to over-performing programs;
(v) Detailed and user-friendly SIAF-supported monitoring and evaluation tools for the PSPs will
be designed and developed.
24



54. Complementary to the above refinements, more frequent reviews of project implementation problems
will now be carried out. More specific recommendations related to PSPs are expected to come out from
the PER and will be taken into account in future refinements of the protected social programs policy under
PSRL III. Likewise, under PSRL Im, the GOP will show evidence of compliance with 2002 aggregate
expenditure targets for the three social sectors, as well as with the floors assigned to each of the ievised set
of PSPs and selected health and education projects. For 2003, the GOP would have at least similar
spending floors, in real terms, in the approved Budget Law.
(b)    A Trabajar Workfare Program
55. International evidence from LAC and elsewhere suggests that workfare programs can be an
important component of a well-functioning safety net. These programs are appealing because, if the
wages they pay are below market, they tend to be self-targeted to the poor and, if budgetary resources are
made available, they can expand naturally during economic contractions (when demand for the
employment they offer is high) and contract during periods of economic growth (when demand for low-
wage employment is low), providing an effective temporary income cushion for the poor unemployed.
56. As a response to the anemic economy it inherited, and in an attempt to fashion a more comprehensive
safety net for the poor, the Toledo administration has launched the "Emergency Social Productive
Program" (PESP), better known as "A Trabajr". Implementation of the A Trabajar program is a critical
policy component of the government's dignity pillar, aimed at reducing the rate of open unemployment
and raising the average monthly income of the workforce in the poorest income quintile. Since many
other factors will influence these outcomes, the success of the program cannot be directly linked to these
indicators. However, the success of the program can be directly measured via intermediate indicators
including the share of beneficiaries in the poorest income quintiles, the income gains received as a result
of participating in the program, the coverage of the program (what proportion of the unemployed poor
have had access to the program), and the efficiency with which it operates (share of program budget going
to wages for beneficiaries, as opposed to administrative costs and material inputs).
57. A Trabayar is implemented in rural areas by FONCODES, the Peruvian Social Fund, where it began
operating in September, 2001. The urban component of the program is being implemented by the
Ministry of Labor and has just begun operation, with the first set of projects having just been approved. A
Trabajar is designed to provide temporary employment for poor, unemployed heads of households for a
maximum of six months. In urban areas, where only heads of households with a child under the age of 18
are eligible, A Trabajar will rely on sub-contracting of labor-intensive micro projects to NGO's, local
governments, or others. In rural areas, FONCODES rehabilitates infrastructure built by itself, by other
central government programs, or by local governments. The budgets allocated to A Trabajar in 2002 are
S/. 320 million (about US$90 million) - almost equally distributed between urban areas and rural areas --
showing that this is an important new, pro-poor initiative of the Toledo administration.
58. One important distinction between urban and rural A Trabajar is the relative weight these
components put on employment generation through workfare, as opposed to the construction of high-
quality infrastructure. In general, the urban A Trabajar can best be thought of as a "pure" workfare
scheme: the wage rate is very low in relation to the comparable wages for unskilled labor in urban areas,
and the fraction of total project costs which are devoted to unskilled labor are high (see paragraph 58
below). The infrastructure which is constructed or renovated is a secondary consideration in urban A
Trabajar. By contrast, in rural areas, A Trabajar is much less of a "pure" workfare scheme: the project
cycle has more steps, all of which are meant to increase project quality but also tend to raise administrative
costs, and the fraction of total costs which are devoted to inputs other than unskilled labor, including
equipment and material, is higher than in urban areas. Renovating infrastructure is itself an important goal
of the rural component of A Trabajar.
25



(c)    Expenditures on Feeding Programs
60. Peru has a plethora of programs with an annual budget of about US$350 million, which transfer food
to municipalities, schools, and households: The lion's share (more than 80 percent of total expenditures on
food) are made up by four programs:
(i)    The Glass of Milk (Vaso de Leche -accounting for 36 percent of all social spending on
food and nutrition), whereby the central government transfers milk to municipalities;
(ii)   Two school feeding programs run by the INS in MINSA and PRONAA in PROMUDEH
(jointly accounting for about 30 percent of expenditures); and,
(iii)  The soup kitchen (Comedores Populares) program, which receives support from
PRONAA (12 percent of total expenditures).
61. A number ot smaller programs focused on specific vulnerable groups also exist (e.g. PROMARN,
PANFAR, PACFO, PANTBC, and food supplementation components of Wawa Wasi, a child development
program). A number of these programs do not have explicit nutritional criteria, and are poorly linked to
interventions in health, education, and provision of clean water and sanitation. Indeed, given the structure
of the four main programs, the use of food can best be thought as an inefficient means of transferring
income to municipalities, schools, and (ultimately) households.
62. Food distribution programs may have a role to play in a functioning safety net in a middle-income
country like Peru. In general, however, food is an inefficient means of transferring income. Results from
the PROGRESA program in Mexico and other conditional cash transfer schemes suggest that there are
better vehicles to transfer resources than food. Large-scale food distribution programs can also have
perverse effects on prices and, as a result, on supply and demand of basic food commodities. Moreover,
food programs in Peru have been plagued by a number of problems, including poor geographic and
household level targeting; inadequate evaluation (none of the main feeding programs in Peru have been
credibly evaluated to assess their impact on household welfare); and frequent charges of corruption and
political misuse, especially in the run-up to elections under the Fujimori administrations.
63. Despite these shortcomings, reform of the main feeding programs has been a politically daunting
task. Producers of milk and other foodstuffs have lobbied hard to maintain them; so have municipal
mayors and, in particular, the members of the committees of the Vaso de Leche and Comedores Populares
programs. Faced with these obstacles, the new Administration has decided to pursue a combination of
program unification/re-engineering and gradual budget reduction for selected programs. This approach is
elaborated below.
64. After a series of institutional negotiations which began under PSRL I, the GOP recently issued
Supreme Decree No. 034-2002-PCM (published on May 14, 2002) which went beyond the original
benchmark set under PSRL II (unification of the school breakfast programs). The GOP decided to unify
under PRONAA not only the school feeding programs, but also PROMARN, PANFAR, PACFO,
PANTBC and the food supplementation component of Wawa Wasi. This unification should
significantly reduce administrative costs, and set the stage for reforms designed to improve targeting, and
eliminate gaps and overlaps in coverage. The Supreme Decree also established institutional changes
virtually making PRONAA the main agency for coordinating and implementing nutrition and food
supplementation programs; set expectations on targeting the programs to the poorest groups; and
confirmed the normative and supervisory role of MINSA for all nutrition matters. The GOP has requested
Bank assistance under the TAL for the implementation and re-engineering of the unified programs. In
addition, the GOP will conduct a pilot program to distribute cash instead of food in no fewer than 5
districts. This pilot will be carefully evaluated to assess the extent to which conditional cash transfers are
more effective than feeding programs. Completion and evaluation of this pilot is a trigger for PSRL III.
28



65. The Vaso de Leche program, executed by the municipalities, is also meant to provide food to the
children and mothers. How best to coordinate the Vaso de Leche program with the unified programs will
be defined as clarity is gained on the responsibilities of the central, regional, and local levels of
government in the context of decentralization. In addition to unification of the central government
programs, the GOP has complied with the PSRL II benchmark of improving these programs' geographic
targeting, i.e. the share of total expenditures on Vaso de Leche, Comedores Populares, Alimentaci6n
Infantil y Desayunos Escolares and PACFO between July 2001 and April 2002 in districts in the first
(poorest) income quintile was not less than 30 percent, and share of expenditures in the first and second
income quintiles was not less than 55 percent.
66. For PSRL m, the benchmarks call for continued improvement in the abovementioned targeting of
the unified programs. Likewise, evidence will be shown that 20-percent of total expenditures made by
Vaso de Leche, Comedores Populares, Alimentacion Infantil y Desayunos Escolares and PA CFO in 2002
has been spent on complementary interventions such as nutrition education, health and community
participation and not on food or administrative costs. In most of these programs, the current share of
expenditure on food is well above 95 percent.
67. The Programa de Comedores Populares and other smaller programs which distribute food to adults
(for example, in exchange for work) will be phased out gradually, and the resources freed up by these
programs will be reallocated to more efficient means of targeted income transfers, such as the A Trabajar
workfare schemes (or, depending on the results of the evaluation of the pilot, to conditional cash transfer
programs). For PSRL II, the budget for the Programa de Comedores Populares was reduced from S/. 133
million in 2000 to S/. 90 million in 2001 and the budget allocation has been further reduced to S/. 66
million in 2002.
68. Finally, because most of the programs which distribute food in Peru have not been systematically
evaluated, it is difficult to assess which (if any) have important effects on household income, poverty, or
nutritional status. This is particularly true of the largest of the feeding programs, the Vaso de Leche.
Completion of an ex-post impact evaluation of the Vaso de Leche, and baseline surveys for the main
feeding programs in PRONAA are benchmarks for PSRL ][U.
(d)    Social Insurance: Retirement Pensions
69. Peru has had separate public retirement security systems for workers in the private sector, civil
servants and the military since the early 1970s. In the face of unsustainable fiscal costs, in December
1992 the Peruvian Government legislated structural reforms to the retirement security plans for workers in
the private sector, financed on a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) basis, and administered by the Instituto Peruano
de Seguridad Social (IPSS). The reforms allowed private sector workers to redirect their social security
contributions into privately managed individual retirement accounts. The Oficina de Normalizaci6n
Previsional (ONP) - a new public institution created by the 1992 reforms to replace IPSS - issued bonds
to workers who opted for private accounts to recognize their past contributions to the public system. Every
new cohort of entrants to the labor market in Peru is allowed to choose between a down-sized PAYGO
regime administered by ONP (the Sistema Nacional de Pensiones, SNP, "PAYGO 19"), or the system of
individual accounts, the Adminstradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs). The public pension regimes for
the civil service ("PAYGO 20" which also covers workers in public enterprises, such as PETROPERU)
and the military were not affected by the 1992 reforms.
70. The Government of Peru still faces enormous pension liabilities arising from its publicly
administered retirement security regimes, that cover only 11.5 percent of the population. In 2000, the
treasury paid US$1.4 billion to cover the deficit of PAYGO 20 for retired civil servants, and US$333
29



million to cover the deficits of PAYGO 19 for those retired from the private sector. These transfers are
equivalent to 69 percent of the amount set aside in 2002 to service Peru's extemal debt; 63 percent of
public spending on education; 1.8 times the government's expenditure on healthcare; and 1.4 times the
amount set aside to alleviate poverty.20 While entry into PAYGO 20 has nominally been closed since
1974, since its inception the generous benefits attract rent-seekers among groups of workers able to
exercise influence and make a case in Peru's courts for inclusion under the regime.
71. An additional weakness in the system is that there is currently no social assistance (i.e. non-
contributory) benefit paid to the elderly indigent in Peru (although the govemment does subsidize health
care to the elderly poor). Not only does this increase the incentives for workers to stay or join PAYGO 19,
but also makes the need for minimum guarantee provisions for all workers in the AFP system even more
pressing. Additionally, since PAYGO 19 and the AFP system only cover 3.7 million people, this leaves
8.9 million relatively exposed to the risk of falling into poverty in old age, without even a minimal safety
net in place to break their fall. The result is a highly inequitable public social security system, in which
roughly 50 percent of all benefits accrue to households in the wealthiest income quintile, while less than 2
percent of benefits go to families in the poorest quintile.2'
72. The Government's latest round of reforms, set forth in the Law No.'21617 of January 1, 2002, and
recognized as benchmarks under PSRL II, are designed to slow the growth of public pension liabilities,
while encouraging a greater number of workers to open individual retirement accounts in the private AFP
system. To do this the Government seeks to: (i) effectively close entry of new cohorts into PAYGO 20;
(ii) bring greater parity between the parameters of the two PAYGO regimes; (iii) make the AFP system a
more attractive option for both workers who remained in PAYGO 19 since 1992 as well as new entrants to
the labor force. The specific reforms to each public regime, and to the private system introduced in Law
No. 21617, are detailed in Annex 7.
73. To summarize these reform efforts, the Government has passed legislation that allows for: (i)
substantially lowered survivor benefits paid by PAYGO 20 to the spouses and orphans of affiliates, while
introducing a floor on survivor benefits equal to the minimum wage; (ii) lowered retirement pensions in
PAYGO 19 through changes to the benefit formula, while increasing the minimum pension slightly higher
than the minimum wage, and financing this increase by absorbing FONAHPU to finance the increase; and
(iii) made it easier for workers to switch to the AFP system, and especially attractive to workers 55 and
older. The Government estimates that these measures will lead to an annual fiscal savings of US$340
million and a total savings of US$4 billion in present value terms (using a 4 percent rate of discount). It
bears mentioning that the fiscal savings from these reforms will arise only in the middle and long-term,
while in the short-run another wave of switchers from PAYGO 19 to the AFP system will imply slightly
higher fiscal costs (in the first five years after the reform). Under a parallel operation, the IDB is working
with the government to design the implementing regulations for law 21617, particularly with regard to
determining the appropriate (lower) replacement rates and base salaries for PAYGO 19 participants who
are covered under the new law, as well as perform an actuarial audit of military pensions (Caja Militar).
74. The Government's strategy for the next reform phase, supported by both the Bank and IDB, is to (i)
continue enhancing the fiscal position of the two PAYGO regimes, by lowering and standardizing benefit
levels; (ii) broaden basic social insurance coverage; and, (iii) redirect subsidies in the public system to the
more poor and vulnerable segments of the population. The government is currently working on
identifying options for legalizing reforms that will achieve these three policy goals. But while the
20 Data on the size of transfers to the public pension regimes, and equivalent expenditure in the 2002 budget, were provided by MEF and ONP.
Data are not available on the size of transfers from general revenues required to pay the pensions of retired military, implying additional
unquantified transfers from public revenues. Neither PAYGO 20 nor PAYGO 19 has been subject to an independent actuarial audit by the World
BankL IADB has conducted its own analysis.

direction of reforn is agreed upon, consensus on the specific measures to be implemented and their time-
framne has yet to be worked out among the wide range of political actors and stake-holders, and the process
is slowed both by the political sensitive nature of some reform elements, and by the lack of reliable,
publicly-available actuarial audits, subsidy-incidence analyses, and deficit forecasts of the public pension
system. PRSL III monitoring indicators (that include reducing the current and projected deficit of the
public pension system while redirecting subsidies to the poor and improving access to basic social
insurance among the current workforce) signal the government's desired direction of reform, while
specific actions include conducting and disseminating a series of actuarial analyses to raise public
awareness of the current fiscal position, inequities and lack of coverage among the poor of the existing
system, in order to garner consensus for reform and secure a solid analytical foundation for decisions on
specific reform measures. To facilitate this analytical process, the Bank and IDB will jointly support
training ONP in the use of PROST (Pension Reform Options Simulation Tool) in 2002, which will greatly
increase the government's capacity to rigorously assess the fiscal and distributional impact of alternative
reform options to both PAYGO 19 and PAYGO 20.
75. Bank support in the medium-term is likely to focus on reform efforts aimed at raising social equity
and the poverty reduction impact of public pension expenditures - specifically, via continued reduction in
subsidized benefits to the non-poor (particularly in PAYGO 20), a minimum pension guarantee and the
introduction of a targeted income transfer to the elderly poor. In parallel, future IDB operations are likely
to focus on supporting actual reforms to military pensions, as well as working with the newly-formed
Comisi6n Especial to ensure that any future reform proposals to systems 19 and 20 be guided by the
principle of actuarial self-sufficiency except for the minimum pension subsidy. Finally, ONP itself is
taking strides to address the highly-publicized back-log in tending to incoming pension applications and
public complaints in an effort to streamline performance and raise transparency in public access to ONP
services.
C.].3 Targeting of Productive Infrastructure in Poor rural areas
76. To reduce poverty and extreme poverty, the GOP will have to ensure that there are high growth rates
of per capita income and per capita consumption in rural areas. Poverty in rural areas is related to a
multitude of factors, including low human capital, limited physical capital, low productivity in the
agricultural sector, and limited access to markets for production from off-farm employment. Access to
economic infrastructure-roads, irrigation, electricity-can directly help rural households increase their
incomes.
77. In Peru, the programs which build small-scale infrastructure in rural areas include: Caminos Rurales
(Rural Roads); Electrificaci6n Rural (a rural electricity program); PRONAMACHCS (a Bank- and JBIC -
financed program which builds small-scale irrigation, and finances soil conservation); the social fund
FONCODES; and smaller programs such as the Programa de Apoyo al Repoblamiento, or PAR, which
builds infrastructure to encourage resettlement of rural areas abandoned in the struggle against terrorism;
COOPOP; INADE; and the "Unidad Ejecutora del PL 480", which monetizes USAID food donations,
and uses the proceeds to construct infrastructure.
78. While many of these interventions have important benefits for the ability of poor households to raise
their incomes, some of them have had shortcomings related to the lack of coordination among programs,
especially with regard to their targeting criteria. Some programs have used poverty maps to allocate
expenditures to districts, but have not always agreed on the "appropriate" poverty map, while other
programs have not formally used any map at all to direct their investments. Programs have also differed in
the extent to which they pay wages for unskilled labor, and in the extent to which they attempt to set these
wages at a low level to encourage self-targeting of investments. To some extent, these differences reflect
31



legitimate differences in program objectives and in the kind of infrastructure they build. Thus, rural roads
can only be built or renovated where they connect with larger trunk roads, and may only be economically
viable in areas where there is potential for economic growth. Arguably, electricity should only be
provided where there is capacity for households to pay the associated recurrent costs. In both cases, the
communities that are selected may not be the poorest of the poor. Still, there are a number of programs,
including FONCODES, PRONAMACHS, PAR, COOPOP, and the Unidad Ejecutora del PL 480, with
very similar characteristics which should better coordinate their interventions to improve their targeting,
avoid duplication, and reduce administrative costs.
79.    To reduce administrative costs and limit the duplication of efforts the GOP under PSRL H
decided to launch the unification under FONCODES of the rural infrastructure projects of INADE (
specifically those whose total costs are below S/. 300,000 each - Proyecto Alto Huallaga, Proyecto
Huallaga Central-Bajo Mayo, Proyecto Pichis Palcazu Proyecto Binacional Rio Putumayo y Proyecto
Madre de Dios; and Sierra Centro Sur) and PRONAMACHCS. Commissions have been set up to design
and carry out the transfer details. In addition, the GOP presented evidence on the geogra hic targeting of
rural infrastructure investments. These targets, calculated on the basis of the same formula combining
information on population with the district-level FGT 2 poverty measure as in the rural component of A
Trabajar, showed that no less than 25 percent of expenditures by all rural infrastructure programs were
allocated to districts in the first rural income quintile, and no less than 50 percent to the first and second
rural income quintiles . Note that these targeting outcomes consider all of the rural infrastructure
programs jointly. This allows some programs to have looser targeting criteria than others (for example,
those programs which depend on repayment capacity).
C2 Equity Pillar
80. Under the Equity pillar, the GOP has set itself the challenge of guaranteeing that all Peruvians have
full access to health, education and culture. The following sections explain the GOP's major reforms to
overcome the barriers to access for these services by poor households, and to improve service efficiency
and quality. These reforms will help contribute to achieving the targets of seven of the medium-term
indicators under the Equity Pillar (see Table 2). Complementary investment and technical assistance
financing are available under the Bank and other donors' ongoing programs to help implement these
reforms.
C.2. 1 Access of the Poor to Health Services
81. The access of the poor to better health care depends not only on the supply of services, but also on
their demand for services. There exist two barriers to demand: an economic barrier created by the
prohibitive cost of services to many poor families, and a cultural barrier created by the disenfranchisement
of the poor and of indigenous people from existing health services. Even during the relatively prosperous
years of the mid-1990s, the cost of medical attention constituted a deterrent for the poor to be able to
exercise effectively this demand. Public clinics and public hospitals charge users for drugs, diagnostic and
medical services. Most of the Ministry of Health (MINSA) facilities attempts to partially compensate for
these charges by reducing prices or by fee exemptions. However, the existing system of exceptions is
poorly targeted and partial (e.g. it does not cover drugs or medical inputs). Worse, as the subsidy is
provided by the health establishment from its own revenues, funding for the subsidy declines just as the
need rises in times of recession.
82. The GOP began to confront the economic barrier to demand by creating two "public insurance
schemes", one which pays health providers for high priority interventions for school children attending
public schools (Seguro Escolar created in 1997) and the other for mothers and children (Seguro Materno
32



Infantil - SM - created in 1999). These schemes eliminate the cost to the user, but maintain the incentive
to supply the service for the provider by making available a fee per service provided.
83. In the last few years, there has been an attempt to overcome the cultural barrier by empowering
local communities to manage their own clinics using local health plans agreed with MINSA (the CLAS -
Comunidades Locales de Administracion de Servicios de Salud). In the three years after 1994, 611 public
clinics were transferred to the communities to form CLAS. There are indications that these clinics have
numerous advantages in relation to the traditional clinics including better planning, improved incentives
for productivity and accountability, flexibility in the management of budgets and staff hiring, and
enhanced quality of care. Despite these advantages, from 1997 until mid-1999 the rate of creation of new
CLAS slowed considerably despite the existence of numerous requests by communities to take charge of
their clinics. This resistance was mainly due to concerns of regional health officials over the loss of direct
control over health facilities and staff. Public sector unions have also viewed the system as a threat.
84. The new Administration has developed a set of strategic principles for the health sector. In relation
to the expansion of coverage for the poor, the new strategy:
(i) continues to emphasize the use of "public insurance schemes" to overcome the economic
barrier. In the short run, these schemes would consist of third-party reimbursements for a selected
number of priority interventions chosen to have an impact over infant mortality and the morbidity
of the poor. As financing will be limited, some form of targeting will be required and these
schemes may continue to be restricted to a defined population (e.g. young children, mothers and
school children). In the longer run, these schemes should: (a) develop income-based targeting
methods, (b) establish a system of insurance premiums and co-payments linked to household
income, and (c) become linked to the social security system which today covers only (a fraction of
) formal sector workers;
(ii) continues to emphasize community participation to overcome the cultural barriers to health
services. In the short run, this would involve a greater expansion of the CLAS system by
converting a greater number of primary care clinics into CLAS, and by increasing community
participation in the design and execution of primary care and public health programs. In the
longer run the new strategy would involve the community in implementing public insurance
schemes (e.g. by having mothers audit the performance and quality of mother and child services)
and by developing new schemes of community participation in hospitals and Regional Health
Departments (DISAS);
(iii) Includes budget protection for the financing of the key programs that provide basic health
services to the poor in the event of a fiscal contraction.
85. The reforms outlined above are designed to lead to a greater use of basic health services by the poor
for priority interventions chosen because of their proven impact over the reduction of infant and maternal
mortality. Services for young children include a substantial effort directed at the most frequent causes of
infant death (such as pneumonia and diarrhea disease). Services for mothers and pregnant women include
an effort to universalize the coverage of births by trained health personnel. All the PSRL I benchmarks for
the expansion of the SIS-MI and CLAS programs were satisfactorily met (see Annex 4).
86. Maternal and Child Insurance (SIS-MI). The original benchmark agreed for PSRL II (when
PSRL I was being prepared) was to extend SIS-MI implementation from 18 to 22 health departments
(DISAs) by end-2001. Formally, the original benchmark has been met - SIS-MI operates today in all
DISAS. Further, in an effort to institutionalize the "seguros", in January 2002, Congress approved a Law
creating the Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS) as an autonomous agency. Once implemented, this agency
33



may become a useful tool to focus the efforts of the government in serving the health needs of the poor,
by isolating it from the day to day concerns of agencies charged with managing health providers.
87. However, there remain significant shortcomings in SIS-MI implementation. The expansion of the
SIS-MI to additional DISAS does not guarantee that the number of poor mothers and children benefiting
from the scheme will grow. The budget assigned to SIS-MI for 2001 was too small for its geographic
coverage. While the SIS-MI operates in all of Peru, its actual coverage in each of the DISA is very thin
(e.g. less than a fourth of the births that take place in MINSA centers are covered by the SIS-MI and three
fourths are paid by the mothers). To overcome this problem, additional benchmarks were agreed under
PSRL II: (i) defined target in terms of number of beneficiaries (339,000 mothers and 823,000 children in
2002), the attainment of this coverage target will be monitored for PSRLIII; (ii) Supreme Decree No. 003-
2002-SA of May 25, 2002 made official a defined benefit package establishing what services the
beneficiaries are entitled to receive; and (iii) evidence was presented that a budget of S./ 116 million
sufficient to reach the agreed number of beneficiaries with the defned benefit package, will be allocated to
SIS-MI durirg 2002.
88. CLAS. The PSRL HI benchmark for the expansion of CLAS (25 percent of primary care clinics
converted to CLAS) has been met. In addition, a number of activities have been carried out to strengthen
the CLAS in recent months, including the implementation of the first regional and national meetings of
CLAS. These meetinigs recommended an action plan for strengthening community participation in the
health sector. MINSA has initiated the implementation of these recommendations, including; the
development of participatory mechanisms to provide social control over the SIS, and the systematic
review of the local health plans produced by CLAS.
C2.2 Reduction of Inefficiencies: Duplication of Health Programs
89. Public health services spend around US$1.2 billion per year and are characterized by striking
inefficiencies and duplication. The main public programs are the Ministry of Health (financed by general
revenues) and the Social Security Institute (ESSALUD - financed by payroll taxes). There are two
different levels at which duplications arise. The first is within the primary care services of MNINSA
(fragmentation of, mother and child programs and some duplication of efforts between the mother and
child programs and the SIS-MI). The second and largest level of duplication is between ESSALUJD and
MINSA.
90. Mother and Child Health (MCH) Programs. In the 1990s, MINSA introduced a number of new
programs to improve primary care. While these programs brought significant improvements in some areas,
they also brought fragmentation and some duplication. In. an effort to rationalize these programs MINSA
developed a plan to streamline eight national programs related to mother and child health (immunizations,
child growth and development, diarrhea and cholera, acute respiratory infections, maternal-perinatal
health, family planning, school-age/adolescent health and micronutrient deficiency prevention). The
elaboration of this plan was carried out during the preparation of the Health Reform Program in
1999/2000.
91. The unification of the MCH programs - a PSRL I benchmark - has been substantially achieved. The
functional organigram of MINSA has now been changed, organizing the MCH programs in three groups
(mother, child and adolescent) to provide a unified management of the programs, and a single operation
plan exists. While some barriers to the practical implementation of this unification persist, there has been
a huge change of emphasis from micromanaging inputs to emphasizing results on the ground. The GOP
strategy is shifting away from micro-managing fragmented budgets (based on inputs used by the staff of
each individual program), and instead emphasizes management by results. MINSA has inaugurated a
34



system of Performance Agreements that establishes targets for health care coverage for each region and
holds regional authorities accountable for reaching these targets, while giving these authorities greater
flexibility in managing their budgets. Under PSRL II all DISAs signed Performance Agreements with
MINSA by January 2002 making regional authorities accountable for reaching specific targets in health
care coverage. In April, the first quarterly institutional review of the progress of such agreements was
carried out.
92. MINSA and ESSALUD. Each of these institutions spends about a US$500 million per year, and
each of them owns and runs its own hospitals and clinics. MINSA produces 65 percent of hospital and 44
percent of ambulatory services, while ESSALUD produces 23 percent of hospital services and less than 20
percent of ambulatory services. MINSA's underutilized hospitals stand side by side with ESSALUD's
underutilized hospitals in 20 departmental capitals; 11 of these also have a military or police hospital.
During the months leading to the 2000 elections, and despite the existing underutilization of many of its
services, ESSALUD had an active program of construction of new hospitals and clinics. In 2001; MEF
forced ESSALUD to postpone its plans to use its reserves to purchase an estimated $400-$500 million of
new equipment.
93. For PSRL II ESSALUD (i) approved an action plan for reforms up to 2004; and (ii) initiated the
implementation of reforms to improve transparency and efficiency, as well as to establish a system of
purchase and sale of services with MINSA. Evidence that these reforms were initiated include:
ESSALUD (a) signed management agreements with two regions, (b) produced an analysis of the
efficiency of its hospitals based on production value and executed budget of each ESSALUD hospital, (c)
has made official the tariffs and procedures approved for the purchase/sale of 20 services between
ESSALUD and MINSA in two regions; (d) has made official the procedures to develop MINSA-
ESSALUD investment plans in two regions; and (e) initiated implementation of a transparency plan for
ESSALUD. An agreement was signed between ESSALUD and MINSA establishing principles to
coordinate investments and to initiate the purchase of services for 20 health care interventions in two
regions of the country.
94. A new Board of Directors was appointed to ESSALUD in March 2002. This new Board has
developed a diagnostic of the key problems of the institution and adopted general guidelines for a reform
of the institution. These guidelines include three key strategies: (i) a clear separation of the functions of
financing and provision within the institution, (ii) freedom of choice of provider for the insured
population, and (iii) a decentralization of management decisions to semi-autonomous networks of
providers that will be paid on a per-capita basis with clearly define efficiency and quality targets. By
negotiations, this strategy will be made official. During the next twelve months, the first steps will be
taken towards the implementation of this strategy. These steps include: (i) the implementation of the
purchase of services between M1NSA and ESSALUD and of the coordinated investment plans, (ii) a
significant step will be taken towards the separation of financing and provision functions for the institution
as a whole, (iii) the implementation of a pilot in two regions to test the decentralized model based on per
capita payments - these regions will also test new measures to provide freedom of choice of provider to
the users; and (iv) a recently launched Transparency Plan for ESSALUD will be fully implemented.
Progress of implementation of these reforms will be monitored as benchmarks for PSRL m.
C2.3 Access of the Poor to Nutrition Services
95. Both the 1996 and 2000 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) estimated that about 25 percent of
children under the age of 5 in Peru suffer from chronic malnutrition (low height for age, also known as
stunting). In the past decade, prevalence of chronic malnutrition declined proportionally more in urban
than in rural areas. Urban prevalence declined from 26 percent (1991-92) to 16 percent (1996) to 13.5
35



percent (2000), while the respective rural prevalence rates were 53, 40, and 40 percent. A simple linear
regression of chronic malnutrition levels on per capita income levels for countries in Latin America
suggests that Peru is an under-achiever on nutrition: like Ecuador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico,
Peru has malnutrition levels that are "too high" for its income level (and unlike Nicaragua, Guyana,
Jamaica, Panama, and Chile, all of whom have comparatively low malnutrition levels). Put differently, in
Bolivia, a country with one-half of Peru's per capita income, the proportion of children stunted is almost
the same as in Peru, while the stunting rates in Jamaica, a country with lower per capita income than Peru,
are less than one-quarter those found in Peru. Preven.ion of this type of malnutrition in the first months
and years of life is of great importance to improvement of social capital, given its high prevalence and the
irreversibility of the physical and cognitive damage in stunted children.
96. Adequate growth in young children depends on a combination of food consumption, frequency of
illness, and child-rearing practices. These are disaggregated into a multitude of factors, beginning with
good prenatal nutrition and prior general nutritional and health status of the mother. After birth, factors
include breastfeeding and weaning practices; prevention of infections through proper water use, sanitation,
and hygiene behaviors; early diagnosis and home treatment of illness when it occurs; opportune health-
seeking behavior for child illness; and adequate response of health services to the demand for care. Many
of these determinants, in turn, are a function of educational levels (in particular, education of the mother),
the availability of local health services, water and sanitation infrastructure, and above all, the information
and education received by mothers to improve their health, nutrition and hygiene behaviors. The
programs most successful in reducing chronic malnutrition are also those which achieve improvements in
mothers' self-esteem, which helps them to apply knowledge gained on good child-rearing practices.
97. Other nutritional problems include deficiencies of micronutrients such as iron, iodine, vitamin A, and
others. Iron deficiency, affecting 70 percent of all children under age two, has severe negative effects on
neurological and cognitive development. Anemia is present in at least 35 percent of all women of fertile
age in Peru, and is worsened in pregnancy due to physiologic hemodilution. Severe iron deficiency causes
as many as one in five maternal deaths.22  Gestational anemia also increases iron deficiency in infants due
to poor iron storage in the fetal liver.
98. Though Peru is considered a middle-income country, the distribution ot its income is highly skewed.
There is evidence that, especially in the sierra and jungle regions, a high proportion (80% or more) of
children are deficient in their consumption of energy, fat, and high quality protein.23  Poor diet quality is
due to short duration of exclusive breastfeeding and inadequate complementary feeding practices for
infants in terms of consistency (too watery) and frequency (too few times per day).   Despite a major
reduction in infant deaths due to diarrhea in the past two decades, high levels of diarrhea morbidity
remain: a baseline 15-day diarrhea prevalence was found to be 41 percent among children 0-23 months of
age in poor and extremely poor communities.24    In the past decade in Peru, US$2.4 billion have been
invested in water and sanitation programs.25  However, it is estimated that less than 2 percent of this
investment is dedicated to education or hygiene promotion. A study of families in 80 rural communities
with water installation projects showed that none of the families disinfected their water, and less than half
had hand-washing habits.2i

99. By and large, Peru has attempted to combat malnutrition with the distribution of food.
Approximately 64 percent of all investment directed to children under age five that could potentially
prevent chronic malnutrition is spent on supplementary food. Of that amount, an estimated 5 percent is
spent on education and promotion. Evidence showing that food distribution programs improve nutritional
status is scant at best, unless the food is accompanied by a series of other interventions in health, water,
sanitation, and information for behavioral change in the home. There is a growing body of literature
which suggests that information and education programs, and programs which supply clean water and
sanitation services (but only when accompanied by interventions to change health and hygiene
behaviors) are more cost-effective ways of preventing chronic malnutrition in a sustainable manner.
100.  Evaluation of integrated field interventions in Peru that have been successful in reducing chronic
malnutrition validate the findings in the world literature.  Most of these are community-based
interventions implemented by NGOs under the USAID PL-480 program that prioritize mothers and
children, covering approximately 120,000 children under age five (mostly under age three) with strong
educational interventions in health, nutrition, and hygiene for about 60,000 mothers. In the health sector,
one feeding program, PACFO, is aimed at children 6 to 36 months of age with distribution of a balanced
fortified instant weaning food targeted to six departments of the sierra. The program also includes an
educational component for mothers, signifying it as a model program with more potential than other
feeding programs to prevent chronic malnutrition.  PACFO needs first to strengthen its educational
component, and secondly, to consider the inclusion of pregnant women at nutritional risk as program
beneficiaries for the prevention of chronic fetal malnutrition.
101.  The GOP has established the reduction in chronic malnutrition as one of its key medium-term
development indicators under the Equity Pillar. Along this line, PSRL II and PSRL HII seek to improve
the nutritional status of children in a number of ways.
(i)    First, both loans support reforms of the feeding programs which will ensure that food
expenditures for children under the age of 5 are better targeted and incorporate an
educational component (see Section C.1.2). Although lack of food is unlikely to be the
main reason for poor nutritional status in Peru, the distribution of food is even less likely
to have an effect on nutritional outcomes if it is not directed at poor families who are more
likely to have malnourished children and if there is no accompanying education for
behavioral change in health and nutrition practices.
(ii)   Second, reforms of interventions in basic health. in particular for decreasing economic
barriers to maternal and child health services. should help achieve better nutritional status
of children (see Section C.2.1).
(iii)  Third, for PSRL m  the GOP and the Bank have agreed to increase the coverage of
nutrition promotion/monitoring and iron-supplementation, with quantitative targets
determined by baseline analyses (see Annex 2 - Policy Matrix). As a first step towards
meeting these targets, for PSRL II the GOP provided evidence that the benefit plan of the
SIS-MIl includes counseling in health, nutrition, and hygiene as well as iron
supplementation for pregnant women and children under 4 years of age.
(iv)   Fourth, for PSRL m  the GOP has agreed to improve the delivery of information and
education in health, nutrition, and hygiene into homes through community-based
strategies. This will be initiated by the GOP through issuance of a Ministerial Resolution
establishing a strategy for community-based health that promotes home-based educational
interventions for mothers and families in maternal-child health. This strategy is essential
37



to complement the water supply and sanitation programs being financed by the Bank and
other donors in Peru.
C2.4 Access of the Poor to Education Services
102.   Although Peru has done an impressive job over the last two decades towards achieving universal
access to primary schooling, average schooling attainment and student learning are relatively low, as
compared to other Latin American countries, and sharply lower in rural areas than in urban areas. While
gross enrollment rates are similar between urban and rural areas, net enrollment rates in rural primary
schools are 65 as compared to 71 urban schools. A 1996 national learning assessment found that only 38
percent of rural school children mastered at least 9 out of 14 basic competencies, compared with 63
percent of urban school children.
103.   Underlying reasons for this disparity in school performance include: grossly lower time on task
(rural schools only function an estimated 200-250 hours per year, compared with the nationally mandated
900 hours); poor teacher quality and motivation; inadequate learning materials; lack of focus on the
school; and, a poor accountability system at the local community level. A detailed explanation of these
education issues is presented in Annex 8.
104.   Based on the results of the National Consultation on Education (Consulta Nacional por la
Educacidn and on the Dakhar International Forum on Education), the GOP has developed an education
strategy focusing on: (a) teacher policy reform, (b) expansion and improvement of the quality of the
education services in priority areas, (c) strengthening school councils with community participation, and
(d) establishing a more democratic and accountable education management system.
105.  Issues and key PSRL actions identified in line with above strategy are:
(a) Teacher policy reform. Approximately 95 percent of the teaching force in Peru holds tertiary
education degrees. However, the average quality of Peruvian teachers is quite low and motivation
and performance are poor particularly in rural areas. Despite the unattractive pay scale (average
salaries are about US$ 200 per month), there is massive oversupply of teachers, partly due to the
rigid stability attached to tenure status. About 15,000-20,000 teachers graduate from teacher
training institutions each year while only about 4,000 are needed. Teacher reform is of paramount
importance to the new Administration. These reforms will include: redesigning the teacher career,
implementing a continuous teacher training system, designing a transparent salary policy and
implementing an accreditation system of teacher training institutions. Under PSRL I, the new
payroll system was installed, rendering the payment process more transparent, in seven additional
Regional Offices of the Ministry of Education and teacher file maintenance in a live electronic
database. Under PSRL II, the GOP passed the Teacher Law (Ley de Nombramiento de Maestros)
on which basis the following actions have been taken:
(i)   implementation of the teacher policy reform through the introduction of a merit-based test
for entry into the system. MOE successfully implemented the first testing process where
teachers were evaluated based on an interview with school and parent representatives and
a, knowledge and abilities test. Of the 30,000 positions available, approximately 22,000
have been filled. The remainder will be opened for competition in the future through a
similar testing process; and,
(ii)  the first step in addressing the oversupply of low quality teachers, by reducing enrollment
targets by 30 percent for teacher training institutions.
38



The benchmark for PSRL III includes other key areas to be reformed based on the new Teachers
Law: setting teacher standards or profiles, establishing a career structure based on teacher standards
(and not time of service); implementation of a teacher evaluation system and sanctions for
misconduct.
(b) Expand and improve the quality of the education services in priority areas, particularly in rural
areas. Even though significant efforts have been made in improving the quality of education in
Peru, especially at the primary level, there has been little impact in rural areas, where children
whose mother tongue is not Spanish have been particularly excluded. A major reason for this is the
low quality of teachers especially in the rural areas. Under PSRL II, MOE has initiated a pilot
program to provide incentives to teachers in rural areas with the specific objective of ensuring
quality teachers in rural schools. A study carried under PSRL I identified that the following
incentives were necessary to ensure teacher quality in rural areas: (i) financial incentives scaled to
the distance between the school and the provincial capital, (ii) financial incentives for teacher's
ability to speak fluently the local tongue; (iii) living facilities, and (iv) appropriate training for
multigrade environment. Approximately US$ 6.5 million have been committed in the 2002 budget
for this pilot, where more than 400 teachers will benefit with the financial incentives and 600 more
will benefit with the specialized training. This budget, together with other budgets financing these
targeted areas, is protected under PSRL H. In addition, the Bank is currently preparing the Rural
Education and Teacher Development Project which will address key issues under this strategic
objective. Under PSRL Im the coverage of incentives is expected to grow to 3,000 teachers in
rural areas. In addition, the GOP has committed to increasing the quality of education for 75,000
rural indigenous children (15 percent of the total population) through the provision of bilingual
materials and teacher training.
(c) Strengthening School Councils. MOE is committed to the reorganization of schools through the
creation of strong school councils in order to promote dialogue between the school and the
community and to promote accountability at the local level. School councils are expected to
participate in the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the Institutional Education Plan,
evaluate the use of school and Parent Association funds and link the community to school activities.
The following are members of the school council: the school director (who presides it), deputy-
director (if the position exists in the school), two teachers, two students, two representatives of the
parents. Under PSRL I, the GOP issued a Supreme Decree instituting voluntary school councils.
Under PSRL II, MOE issued a Ministerial decree which makes school councils compulsory. The
benchmark for PSRL m sets a goal of 5,000 school councils established and fully operating.
(d) A more democratic and accountable education management system. MOE is aware of the need to
make the education system accountable through sharing of information and opening up lines of
communication to consult with the community and receive complaints. Under PSRL I, MOE
published all the results for the 1998 student assessment data and the comparative analysis of the
1996 and 1998 data. Under PSRL H, in November 2001, MOE carried out the student performance
assessment, including, for the first time, children in rural multigrade schools and Quechua and
Aymara speakers. Preliminary results have been published also, under PSRL HI, the final report of
the Commission for National Consensus on Education was published as inserts in newspapers with
national distribution - "Propuesta de Acuerdo Nacional por la Educaci6n" and "Las Voces del
Pais". Finally, under PSRL II, MOE has installed a new complaints hotline and center and is going
to launch a promotion program once the school year starts in April. For PSRL Im, it is expected
that the complaint system will be operating efficiently, i.e., all complaints should be addressed
within 30 days with feedback to the person who raised the complaint in the first instance.
39



106.  The GOP has identified three medium term development targets for education: (a) by 2006, 55
percent of children in sixth grade have the normative age for this level (compared to 51 percent in 2000),
(b) the proportion of children that complete primary and secondary education at age 11 will increase to 25
percent in 2006 from 20 percent in 2000, and (c) by 2006 the proportion of children passing the standard
performance evaluation would reach 102 percent for urban areas and 101 percent for rural areas (base of
100 percent in 2001). Each of the PSRL II and III benchmarks will contribute to the achievement of these
indicators, by ensuring that children attend schools and that their education is more relevant to their needs,
making schools more accountable for their performance, ensuring targeted interventions to previously
excluded areas in terms of coverage and quality of education, and improving the quality of teachers, a key
and previously unattended input to the quality of education.
C.3 Institutionality Pillar
107. The Government's new strategic vision presents Institutionality, or "a country that serves its
people," as one of its three pillars. Under this pillar, the GOP identifies several components where reforrns
are needed, including transparency, participation, justice, decentralization, and public service reform.
Under Transparency and Participation, actions aim to (i) provide access to information for all citizens, de-
politicizing the use of public information and restoring its credibility, (ii) provide citizens with the means
to plan, budget and oversee the services which are provided to them and thereby ensure that their "voice"
is heard and reflected accurately in government actions, (iii) provide an institutional framework and
recourse mechanisms for citizens to seek resolution in the case of abuse of public roles or funds. These
actions build on initial efforts supported under the PRSL I to depoliticize institutions, improve the
financial administration and procurement system and make social programs more transparent and
accountable.
108. Reform actions can be broadly divided into three components. The first component includes
actions that the Government must take to make information more available, accessible and credible.
These are organized under the area of Transparency and Access to Information. The second
component includes actions that citizens themselves must assume either by using this information to
monitor and hold the Government accountable or to proactively engage with the different levels of
government around the planning, budgeting and tracking of social services to make them more effective.
These later actions have been organized under the area of Participation and Partnerships in Public
Policy. The third component, Transparency of Financial and Procurement Administration, includes
actions that would improve national procurement rules/procedures and financial accountability in Peru.
C3.1 Transparency andAccess to Information
109.  In an initiative which was started during the PSRL I, the Defensoria del Pueblo (Public
Ombudsman's Office) launched a high-profile campaign during the 2001 election to ensure that social
programs were not used in a political fashion in the run up to the election. More recently, tremendous
progress has been made towards making social programs more transparent and more accountable to their
beneficiaries. The reforms agreed upon in PSRL I ensured that district-by-district expenditures made by a
number of social programs, including the Vaso de Leche, PRONAA, FONCODES, and PRONAMACHS,
in the year 2000 were published on the web.27 In addition, PRONAA published the transfers made to every
one of the more than 15,000 comedores populares in 2000. The expenditures of Caminos Rurales and
Rural Electrification were published on the web at a more aggregate level taking into account the specific
areas defined for each of these programs. In February, MEF launched the Economic Transparency
2'Tlere are more than 1800 districts in Peru, so most ofthese districts tend to be reasonably small (between 10,000 and 20,000 inhabitants).
40



Website (Portal: Transparencia Econ6mica) where monthly information on budget transfers to the
programs mentioned above, among others, is made available. This website also includes infornation on
the social programs of the Ministries of Defense and the Interior. All of this information is beginning to
provide citizens and civil society organizations with the necessary tools to exercise control over social
programs by allowing them to verify whether programs are actually spending resources in those areas
where they claim to be, whether geographic targeting is appropriate, and whether there appears to be any
politically-motivated use of social expenditures.
110.  For PSRL , the focus has been on ensuring that this information is actually made accessible and
useful to citizens so that it can ultimately be used as a tracking and planning tool. Reforms focus on five
types of information: (i) financial and budget, (ii) social programs, (iii) statistical information, (iv)
administrative, and (v) contracts and procurement. The primary aim is to ensure that this information
provides an input to the collaborative planning and budgeting processes which are now taking place
around the country and that citizens are able to discuss priorities and needs based on reliable information.
111.  To make financial and budget information more accessible and useful to citizens as a source for
influencing and monitoring local and national public action, the Bank is working with the Ministry of
Finance to make the vastly improved Integrated Financial Management System more accessible to citizens
and users of services. The Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) has the potential to provide to
citizens financial and budget data by program and sector at the municipal, provincial and national level. At
present, information is not as accessible as it might be due to the way it is presented, the lack of computer
infrastructure below the provincial level and the length of time it takes to log onto the central system. In
addition, the Bank is supporting a local consortia of think tanks and academics to undertake periodic
analysis of the composition of the national budget - both proposed and spent - in order to provide an
independent analysis of budget information to interested stakeholders such as congressmen, civil society
activists, etc.
112. For the PSRL II, the actions completed include the preparation of a strategy which addresses the:
(a) poor access due to the complicated presentation of information and the slow speed of the system, and
(b) type of information presented. The strategy outlines the basis for an intemet based system, known as a
ventana amigable, which will provide regularly up-dated budget information (already available through
the SIAF from the MEF) with sectoral project information on the specific goals, activities and options for
each program. By doing so, it will enable citizens in any community to access information on the projects
planned for their area and the assigned budget and will thus serve as both a tracking tool, to ensure that
activities and budgets are adhered to, as well as a planning tool whereby citizens can participate in
collaborative planning activities with their local governments, drawing on reliable budget and program
information. It is hoped that, in the medium term, this will contribute to a perception of greater
transparency among citizens and between citizens and the GOP and a culture of informed participation.
This strategy includes plans to combine this budget and sectoral information for the following six selected
protected programs: Educacidn Inicial, Educaci6n Secundaria, Salud Individual, Salud Colectiva,
Promoci6n y Asistencia Social Comtuitaria, as well as the following five specific activities and/ or
programs: A Trabajar, Desayunos Escolares, Comedores Populares, Vaso de Leche, SIS- MZ Information
on transfers to districts - both the amounts and the timing - for the following programs is also being
initiated through the SLAF: Vaso de Leche, FONCOMUN and the Mining Canon.
113.  Under PSRL II, the Bank has been working with the GOP in other ways to strengthen the
transparency of social programs. It has supported the Ministries of Health, Education and FONCODES
to inform potential users of their services - planned activities, their goals, the expected impact and their
costs, via web pages and face to face meetings in communities. In addition, Comites de Transparencia are
being established around the six priority programs and five specific activities to provide an internal
accountability check within ministries. Finally, for PSRL II, a draft supreme decree has been prepared to
41



ensure that all ministries begin to use the geographic information system (GIS, or SIG in Spanish) so that
comparable and high quality information can be provided through the National Statistical Agency (INEI).
By PSRL III, 50 percent of ministries are expected to be using the system.
114.  The GOP also plans to provide easy access to general administrative information such as birth
certificates, electoral identification cards etc. There are challenges in both the supply and demand side for
access to administrative information. On the supply side, there is a weak regulatory framework for access
to information under Peruvian law and officials are often not aware of their existing obligations in
providing citizens with infornation that is determined to be "public." At the same time, demand for
information is weak as citizens are not aware of their rights, do not want to be singled out and are
therefore unaccustomed to asking for information and pursuing public servants when this is not granted.
For PSRL II, the GOP has initiated an information campaign around a number of important programs,
including the new workfare program A Trabajar in 530 districts to ensure that citizens understand the
goals and criteria of the program.
115.  Finally, to ensure that statistical information is timely, of high quality and credible, the GOP is
developing an institutional framework that will help ensure the financial and political autonomy of the
National Statistics Agency, INEI. A draft law which guarantees the organizational and financial autonomy
of the agency has been drafted and is to be presented to Congress during the implementation period of
PSRL II. This, together with other measures being discussed for PSRL III, should help to protect the INEI
from political interference, and reinforce its roles as a technical agency.
116.  In order to measure the impact of the above efforts, the GOP is proposing to establish a baseline
of perceptions on transparency and openness of society. In order to gather this information a new
module will be incorporated into the national survey - the ENAHO. For PSRL II, the GOP assured the
availability of the budget for the implementation of ENAHO IV and the inclusion of this module on
transparency and openness of society. The World Bank is providing technical assistance in the design of
the module.
117.  In addition, the GOP will be implementing improvements to its financial administration and
procurement system based on the action plans agreed with the Bank under the CFAA and the CPAR.
These are discussed in Section C.3.3 below.
C3.2 Participation and Partnerships in Public Policy
.118.  There are numerous processes under way which seek to give citizens greater input into policy
priorities and decisions and to enable them to hold public functionaries accountable for their actions. In
January 2001, the Paniagua Administration established a Round Table for Attacking Poverty (Mesa de
Concertacidn para la Lucha Contra la Pobreza) whose mandate -is to ensure that social policies and
actions would be transparent, efficient and have effective impact on poverty. This Round Table has been
working to institutionalize the participation of civil society in the design, decision-making and control of
poverty-related programs. Creation of the national Round Table has been followed with the creation of
numerous departmental and provincial level Round Tables, which gather the views of local government
representatives, civil society, and grass-roots organizations in the annual planning and budgeting process.
In addition, PSRL I supported the development of social accountability mechanism - "Sistema de
Vigilancia Social>'-SIVISO, which provides information to citizens and possible recourse mechanisms
(see Annex 9 for detailed description of SIVISO) . This system has now been piloted in 3 areas, and
evaluated. The Bank has continued to support both mechanisms for social accountability and the
institutionalization of spaces for participatory approaches to the formulation and monitoring of public
policy in the context of the PSRL II, many of which were initiated under the PSRL I. The GOP will

continue to draw on the main conclusions of a World Bank-sponsored international conference on
"Empowerment, Transparency and Inclusive Development" held in Lima in July 2001, which presented
international best practice on specific mechanisms for social accountability and participatory formulation
of public policy.
119.  Under PSRL H in social accountability, the SMISO initiative has been extended to 10 districts
and 3 regional departments. In addition, it will be complemented and strengthened by a new initiative to
engage users in the evaluation of public services. Users will thus provide valuable feedback on the quality
of services in a scorecard-type scheme which will provide an incentive for programs to be responsive to
user needs as well as an important information source for improving service delivery to users. It is
anticipated that a pilot evaluation system allowing citizen's evaluation of government services will have
been launched by PSRL m.
120.  Two actions have also being taken under PSRL H to strengthen the input of citizens into the
social policy process in Peru. First, at least six regional development plans have been agreed to by the
Mesas de Concertaci6n; these plans will be a basis for formulating regional budget proposals to be
submitted to MEF for the next budget year . Second, a. directive has been issued to the regional
departments on the use of participatory process in the budget preparation process for the 2003. While there
is still some confusion regarding the specific role, composition and responsibilities of the Mesas de
Concertaci6n, it has been agreed that this is likely to be resolved locally over the next year and thus, PSRL
Im will focus on the institutionalization of collaborative planning and budgeting fora between citizens and
government.
121.  To strengthen the social accountability and collaborative planning processes already underway in
Peru, the World Bank is providing technical assistance in three areas: (i) user evaluation of public
services, (ii) participatory planning and budgeting techniques, and (iii) independent budget analysis by
civil society. In May 2002 a technical assistance mission was sent to Peru including international experts
in these 3 areas from India, South Africa and Brazil to work with the GOP and civil society in the design
of similar pilots. Boosting these efforts, a grant was approved by the Japan Social Development Fund to
help pilot and implement the project "Giving Voice to the Poor in Influencing, Planning and
Evaluating Service Delivery in Peru". Attached to PSRL II reforms, this grant will finance activities
related to (i) engaging poor people's voice in local planning processes; (ii) providing information to
citizens and local communities on public expenditures; and (iii) empowering communities to monitor
public services and expenditures.
C3.3 Transparency of Financial and Procurement Administration
122.  The GOP has shown a serious commitment to improve procurement procedures and financial
accountability in Peru. The GOP and the Bank have engaged in various dialogues in this respect through
normal Bank operations, CAS preparation and special country reviews. Of the latter, the most recent ones
were the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) carried out in June 2000 and a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) jointly carried out with IDB in February 2001.
Procurement
123. In September 2001 the new Govermment administration and the Bank prepared jointly a Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) update and agreed to an Action Plan for improving Public
Contracting System in Peru. Most recommendations included in the Action Plan aim to provide increased
transparency and efficiency of procurement while strengthening the CGR's and CONSUCODE's control
and supervision roles over Government agencies responsible for managing public procurement.
43



124.  To strengthen oversight and efficiency in the national system of contracting, under PSRL II, the
CGR and CONSUCODE signed an Institutional Agreement on December 13, 2001 for the implementation
of control and supervision of procurement procedures and contracting established in the local procurement
legislation. Preparation of the guidelines and control procedures, as well as the issuance of an
administrative decree to put into effect such regulations are benchmarks for PSRL m.
125.  In line with the Peru CPAR's Action Plan, the GOP has also agreed to the development and
implementation of an e-purchase system for procurement of minor goods and services in public sector
together with the use of a Web Page for advertisement of bid opportunities, bidding documents, contract
award and appeal resolutions. The system will be developed by the MEF's team responsible for SIAF.
The system will be later integrated with the SLAF through a system inter-phase. Upon successful
completion of system development and start-up stages, the system will be transferred to CONSUCODE
for administration. A Policy Guide (Guia de Politica) for the implementation of the e-purchase system
was issued through Supreme Decree No 031-2002-PCM for PSRL HI. Gradual incorporation of a total of
100 government agencies as users of the e-purchase system and 600 agencies to the official Web Page for
bid advertisement, on a pilot a basis, is a benchmark for PSRL m. The Policy Guide should set forth
specific guidelines for a progressive migration from one system to the other as well as the agency's
responsibility for development and administration, including training to public procurement agencies, and
any other aspects relevant to ensure a successful completion of objectives. Implementation of both tools
on a pilot basis, the Web Page and e-purchase system, will be extended progressively to complete the total
indicated above, as technology conditions and institutional capacity are gradually improved.
Financial Administration
126.  The CFAA concluded, among others things, that the financial management tools at the disposal of
Congress and the Executive Branch comprise of (a) robust financial administration legislation; (b) highly-
trained and dedicated staff in financial management; and (c) a highly effective integrated financial
management system (SLAF). SLAF provides a powerful repository of details on financial transactions
wherever it is applied, and combined with the budget structure, it provides the basis for effective historical
cost accumulation against the goals set in the institutional plans of each entity. This information is put to
good use by MEF and the spending entities and has resulted in effective control, optimum cash
management and informed decision-making. The CFAA action plan include recommendations related to:
(a) more effective oversight by Congress of the budget process and review of the allocation of available
funding; (b) more detailed and frequent reporting on expenditures to Congress; and (c) unfettered
surveillance and reporting by the auditor-general of the acts and reports of the executive.
127.  Among the agreed actions, the following were met satisfactorily as specific benchmarks for PSRL
II: (a) A draft law has been presented to Congress amending the National Control System Law so as to
ensure CGR's functional independence in accordance with the provisions of the constitution; (b) evidence
was presented that CGR is exercising its ex-post control functions with reference to the Ministry of
Defense and other security services of the nation; and (c) MEF has developed a SIAF version for local
govermments (SIAF-GL).
128.  For PSRL IMl it is expected that: (a) MEF will produce and disseminate its mandated semester
report on progress of benchmarks of the Multi-Annual Macroeconomic Framework in its Portal de
Transparencia Economica website; (b) MEF will publish a quarterly report on budget execution in its
Portal de Transparencia Econ6mica website; (c) MEF will assure the extension of SIAF2 to at least 100
operating units between the Ministry of Defense and other civilian ministries to address the control of
"encargos"; and (d) MEF will implement SIAF-GL in at least 50 municipalities by June 2003.

IV. The Proposed Loan
A. Link to Country Assistance Strategy
129.  The last full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Peru was discussed in the Board in 1997
(Report No. 16796-PE dated June 26, 1997). A CAS Progress Report was presented in June 2001 defining
the framework of Bank assistance strategy for Peru, including the programmatic assistance for the PSRL.
A new CAS for FY 2003-2007 is being presented to the Board together with the current operation (PSRL
II).
130.  The Bank's assistance strategy continues to put high priority on the over-arching objective of
poverty reduction in Peru. The focus in 2001-2002 is to assist the country in maintaining a stable political
and economic transition. In 2001, under PSRL I, assistance was provided to help shore up confidence on a
fragile economy and to support the government's effort to hand off a clean slate to the new government.
In 2002, the Bank's assistance in general is helping the new Government to continue maintaining
economic stability, identify sources of growth and competitiveness, ensure access of the poor to basic
social programs, provide social protection and move forward toward strengthening institutions in an open,
democratic system. Ensuring the participation and empowerment of the poor in this reconstruction process
is a critical element of the assistance strategy.
131.  The PSRL is a key instrument in the Bank's assistance strategy for Peru. The PSRL is supporting
a medium-term social reform program that is fully in line with the CAS objectives and priorities (see
Program Objectives below). The PSRL, together with assistance from other donors, will continue to help
close the financial gap resulting from Peru's weakened fiscal situation as it struggles to fully recover from
past years' external shocks and recent political upheavals. Apart from PSRL II, the CAS also envisions
the approval of two other projects in FY03 (Rural Education and Teacher Development; and Rural Water
Supply and Health Sanitation).
132.  Some reforms under the PSRL have been and will continue to be supported by continuous
dialogue and technical assistance provided under parallel investment operations financed by the Bank
(Basic Health and Nutrition Project; Education Quality Project; LIL for Indigenous Populations; Health
Reform Program APL28, and the Rural Education and Teacher Development Project which is under
preparation). In addition, for PSRL II, the GOP has requested a Technical Assistance Loan (see Section C
below) to help implement some reforms taken under the operation and to prepare for the benchmarks for
PSRL m. Complementing policy-based adjustment lending with sector investment operations and
technical assistance ensures coherence in the direction of policy decisions and investments in the social
sectors. The programmatic adjustment loan series operation is front-loading the policy decisions that
then are supported by the sector investment loans and TAL. Also, on building social control and
empowering the poor, the Bank will assist the GOP in building a public accountability mechanism and to
explore ways of increasing the voice and influence of poor people during the transition to a more open
society in Peru.
133.  Cooperation with IMF and Other Donors. As mentioned earlier, the IMF approved in January
2002 a new Stand-By Arrangement for Peru (2002-2003) for an amount equivalent to US$316 million.
The Stand-By Arrangement seeks to ensure the continuation of a solid economic situation during the first
two years of the Toledo government. It highlights the need for prudent management of fiscal and
monetary policies, and further progress in structural reforms is cited as a pre-requisite for continued
economic stability and growth in Peru. The PSRL II loan, together with those of other donors, as well as
28 The Health Reform Program is cofinanced with IDB.
45



domestic financing and privatization proceeds, are projected to help ease the fiscal constraints identified in
the IMF Arrangement.
134.  Similar to PSRL I, PSRL II was being prepared in coordination with a parallel adjustment lending
from IDB (first loan of US$200 million; second loan US$300 million). The second IDB adjustment loan
focuses on fiscal issues, i.e. tax reforms and reform of the public and quasi-public pension system. It also
includes some social conditions focused on improving social expenditure targeting. Preparation of PSRL
II was supported by a Japanese PHRD grant of US$653,000.
B. Program Objectives, Benchmarks and Triggers
135.  The principal objective of PSRL H is to continue to support the medium-terrm social reform
program of the Government of Peru (see Section III). While building on the progress achieved under
PSRL I, the second and third phases of the reform will now put emphasis on supporting the GOP medium-
term social development strategy (see Section II). The priority would be to ensure that resources are being
allocated for, and in fact getting to, the poor population. Specific objectives of PSRL II will be to help:
(i)  Establish a pro-poor social expenditure regime and an adequate social protection mechanism for
the poor;
(ii) Improve access of the poor to critical social programs, through better targeting, improved
efficiency and rationalization of expenditures; and
(iii) Improving transparency in social programs and expenditures and empowering beneficiaries to
participate in the policy and budget process.
B.1 Minimum Triggers to Proceed with Preparation of PSRL II
136.  When PSRL I was approved by the Board, indicative benchmarks were set to show progress of
program development for PRSL H. Out of those indicative benchmarks, a set of minimum triggers were
agreed to proceed with the preparation of PSRL H. These minimum triggers which are shown in column I
of Table 5 were satisfactorily met. Thus, the Bank and the new GOP authorities continued the dialogue
and monitoring of decisions/actions leading to the benchmarks of PSRL H.
B. 2 PSRL II Benchmarks and Triggers for PSRL m
137.   To a large extent, the PSRL 11 benchmarks reflected in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2) are
substantially similar to the indicative decisions/actions projected during the preparation of the
programmatic series. However, the nature and specificity of the "adjusted" benchmarks have now been
influenced by the lessons learned during the first operation and the priorities of the medium-term strategy
of the new Government. Nine of these benchmarks were agreed as minimum triggers (column III of
Table 5) for disbursement of the PSRL H loan. These disbursement triggers have been satisfactorily met.
As explained in Section II.B, the benchmarks for PSRL II and III will attempt to produce an impact on 14
of the 20 results indicators of the GOP strategy. Other components of the Bank assistance strategy, those
of other donors, as well as the GOP-financed programs will obviously have to come into play to ensure
the achievement of the medium-term targets.
138.  For the Policy Matrix, the Bank and the GOP tried to define outputs/ intermediate outcomes-based
benchmarks where it is practical to do so. For PSRL II, the balance is still tilted towards specific
actions/processes, with outputs/intermediate outcomes becoming more of the benchmarks for PSRL Im.
For many of the policy areas of the matrix, baseline information still has to be developed in order to allow
46



for more outcomes-oriented benchmarks in the next loan. The proposed Technical Assistance Loan (see
Section C below) will be extremely important in ensuring that this transformation does occur.
139.  The indicative benchmarks for the third loan listed in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2) do not
necessarily establish all conditions for future lending. Many of them will serve as a guideposts to signal
progress of decisions/actions towards achieving the objectives of the reform program. Among these
benchmarks, some key actions will serve as triggers or minimum conditions for the Bank to proceed with
the processing of PSRL HI. These triggers are shown in column IV of Table 5.

C. Description of Financial Assistance
140.  Financial Assistance. The Bank's financial assistance in support of the social reform program
consists of three one-tranche loans amounting to US$300 million in total. The first loan (PSRL I) was
approved in June 2001 and fully disbursed in July 2001. For PSRL II, the GOP requested US$100 million
to support the continuation of the social reform program as described in Section II. As described above,
indicative benchmarks and triggers were agreed to proceed with another US$100 million PSRL HI in
2003. In addition, the GOP has requested the Bank a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL; US$5 - US$8
million) to assist in the continued implementation of the reforms included, under the PSRL, including the
required progress to reach the benchmarks for and implement the decisions under for PSRL IL. The TAL
will also assist to strengthen the social policy coordination of the CIAS Technical Sectrariat, as well as to
continue the definition and monitoring of the medium term development outcome/output indicators of the
GOP.
141.  Actions taken before Board Presentation. The GOP presented evidence to the Bank that all the
benchmarks and disbursement triggers for PSRL II have been satisfactorily met. The GOP is taking the
necessary steps to maintain a sound macroeconomic framework as indicated by the recently signed IMF
Stand-by Agreement. It has also committed to the continuation of the medium-term social reform
program as indicated in the updated Social Development Policy Letter including the initiation of efforts to
set medium-term results indicators and targets (See Annex 1); The specific benchmarks and triggers the
GOP reached for PSRL II are shown in Annex 2 (Policy Matrix) and were incorporated in the Loan
Agreement for this operation.
142.  Monitoring Arrangements. The MEF has been responsible for monitoring the completion of the
PSRL benchmarks for the first PSRL loan. For the second loan the responsibility will be shared by MEF
and CIAS. These agencies will continue to coordinate decisions/actions necessary to meet the triggers and
the tentative benchmarks indicated for the third loan. In continuing this work, they will also provide the
necessary update reports using the monitoring indicators indicated in Annex 2 to indicate the progress of
the decisions/actions taken for the loan and the completion of the indicative benchmarks for PSRL m.
Measuring the impact of the PSRL reforms on improving the well-being of the poor will be enhanced by
the monitoring and evaluation improvements sought under the loan. As mentioned above, the TAL
accompanying PSRL II and m will assist in the continued development of intermediate outcome and
impact indicators for the reform areas of PSRL II and III. The benchmarks for PSRL m are also designed
to be increasingly outcomes-based. Thus, by the end of the PSRL reform program, there would be a
better sense of the impact of the social reforms on the poor.
D. Loan Disbursement and Audit
143.  Disbursement arrangements for the proposed loan will follow the simplified procedures for
adjustment operations approved by the Board on February 1, 1996. The Government will open an account
in the Central Bank of Peru. Once the Bank formnally notifies Peru that the loan is available for
withdrawal, the Government will submit a withdrawal application so that the proceeds of the loan are
deposited by the Bank in this account to be used in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Although a
routine audit of the deposit account will not be required, the Bank reserves the right to conduct one.
E. Environmental Aspects
144. Peru has initiated actions to address major environmental concerns in the country. Last year, an
Environmental Issues and Strategic Options Study was carried out jointly by FAO and the World Bank to
identify the major environmental issues and their underlying causal factors; review the institutional
framework, policies and instruments in place; and suggest strategic options. To date GOP has: (i) created
a national coordinating and consultative body (CONAM) under the President of the Council of Ministers;
52



(ii) established an institutional framework to harmonize environmental legislation and institutional
responsibilities; (iii) developed a body of sectoral-based environmental legislation; (iv) established a series
of prevention and control instruments (e.g. environmental impact assessments, environmental compliance
programs, and territorial environmental assessments for public and private projects); and (v) established a
national protected area system. Progress is also discernible in the private sector as demonstrated in the
number of approved environmental management plans developed by industries to bring them into
compliance with the legislation, particularly in the fishing, mining and energy sectors.
145.  The institutional capacity for environmental management, however needs significant
improvement. In particular, Peru's environmental assessment framework is characterized by fragmentation
among line ministries, overlapping of mandates and competing -and often contradictory - interests.
Although regulations, standards, procedures and instruments have been nominally adopted, their
enforcement is still very weak. Environmental assessment review is currently under the responsibility of
several sectoral units, including: INRENA at the Ministry of Agriculture, DIGESA at the Ministry of
Health, the environmental units at the Ministry of Energy and Mining, the Vice-Ministry of Transports and
the Vice-Ministry of Housing.
146.  Major challenges remain in developing public awareness and institutional capability to ensure that
environmental issues are adequately addressed in the future. Priorities include the consolidation of an
integrated environmental and social impact assessment system; the harmonization of standards, criteria
and parameters for environmental management (in particular for air, water and solid waste); and
strengthening the institutional capacities for the enforcement of environmental legislation and
environmental management. These challenges form part of the Bank's continuing dialogue with the GOP.
Venues for this dialogue are defined in the FY03-07 CAS, as well as the preparation of new investment
projects (e.g. roads, urban transport, agriculture) that normally require an environmental analysis and
should include components to strengthen environmental units in sector ministries, as well as
environmental data collection and monitoring. In addition, Bank missions reviewing progress in PSRL
implementation (PSRL I and preparation of PSRL II) have included relevant technical expertise to assess
progress in the screening and environmental processing of new GOP investments whose budget
allocations were protected under PSRL I.
147.   With regard to the indigenous population, previous sections of this document have referred to the
special attention given by some protected programs, as well as the Bank-financed projects (education,
health, Indigenous and Afro-Peruvians Peoples Development LIL) on the needs of the dispersed and
indigenous groups. Also, the GEF-financed Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Amazon
Project will help regularize issues related to land-tenure and environment in the Amazon area.
F. Benefits and Risks
148.  Benefits. The PSRL H's immediate major benefit continues to be its contribution to Peru's
maintenance of social stability during a difficult period of adjustment towards economic recovery. The
Loan will not only continue to protect critical social programs for the poor but will also help increase the
quality and efficiency of social expenditures. The social reforms supported by the PSRL operations are
designed to help produce a shift in 14 of the 20 medium-term development results indicators set by the
GOP. The ultimate success of the programmatic operation will be measured by the extent to which public
expenditures have actually reached the poor in Peru. The innovative social control mechanism being
supported by the operation will enhance the poor's possibility to exert influence and voice in the use of
scarce fiscal resources. This programmatic approach also helped build consensus anong the finance
ministry, the office of the Chief of Cabinet (through the CIAS) and the social ministries on important
sequential actions addressing key social issues in Peru. The policy matrix has served as a convening factor
53



for these agencies to come together and decide how and when the GOP should act on the social reform
issues covered by this operation.
149.  Risks: Peru's medium-term prospects are uncertain. The country faces a number of risks that may
pose a threat to the continuation of the social reform program. These risks include: (a) vulnerability to
external shocks such as severe slowdown of global economic conditions and recurrence of the "El Niflo"
phenomenon and their effects on growth; (b) lack of unified vision between the Executive Office and
Congress on a strategy to restore growth; (c) "wait and see" attitude of investors leading to weak tax
revenues, compounded by the political difficulty of raising tax rates; and (d) partial reversal of some
policy decisions due to continued weak coordination and implementation capacity of social agencies. In
the context of Peru's high foreign currency debt, the external shocks will put pressure on public finances
and threaten the sustainability of the GOP's medium-term pro-poor growth strategy. At the same time,
political obstacles to raise tax revenues, an incomplete privatization program and the initiation of a
decentralization program could lead to fiscal imbalances and reduce financing for social expenditures.
150.  To mitigate these risks, the Peruvian Govermnent embarked on a four-month National Dialogue
involving the participation of political parties, academic institutions, grassroots organization, labor unions
and the private sector. The Dialogue yielded a National Accord (Acuerdo Nacional) signed in July 2002
which reflects an agreed framework for a growth strategy, safety nets for the poor and measures to address
macroeconomic imbalances under an IMF-supported program. The Government is also building a
contingent financing plan, combining efforts to increase external donor financing, access of international
capital markets by placing sovereign bonds and gradually proceeding with privatization plans. These
efforts are complemented by structural reforms directed to achieve the Government's medium-term results
targets. Key elements of the medium-term reforms include rationalization of public expenditures,
overhaul of the tax and pension system, increasing competitiveness, further strengthening the financial
sector, and modernization of public institutions. To minimize the possibility of reversal of the social
reforms supported by the PSRL, CIAS will be strengthened, supported by Bank-financed technical
assistance, to continue exercising its role of coordinating and influencing social policies in Peru.
V.     RECOMMENDATION
151.  1 am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the loan.

CARTA DE POLITICA DE DESARROLLO SOCIAL
La presente Carta de Poliftica Social constituye una contribuci6n del Gobierno Peruano al proceso de
dialogo con las principales fuerzas politicas y de la sociedad civil peruana, cuyo fin es lograr un
Acuerdo Nacional en materia de Equidad y Justicia Social, asi como en areas relacionadas con la
Competitividad y Desarrollo Arm6nico y Estrategico, Afirmaci6n de un Estado Eficiente y
Transparente, Fortalecimiento de Gobiemos Regionales y Locales, entre otras.
Este documento presenta un diagn6stico de la situaci6n social y de la pobreza en el Peruj y su
vinculaci6n con el proceso de crecimiento econ6mico en la Oltima decada, y aborda el marco polltico-
econ6mico actual en el que se desarrolla la lucha contra la pobreza, eje central de la Politica de
Gobiemo del Presidente Alejandro Toledo. En tal sentido, a continuaci6n se indican los principales
Lineamientos de Politica Social del Gobiemo y se seflalan las estrategias destinadas a lograr la
superaci6n de la pobreza y fortalecer la justicia y equidad social. En el acapite de Lineamientos se
seflalan, especfficamente, las lfneas de acci6n prioritaras vinculadas al Prestamo Programatico de
Reforma Social (PSRL) II y IlIl, que constituyen los principales desencadenantes de estos prestamos.
I.     Diagn6stico
A lo largo de la decada de los noventas, los niveles de pobreza experimentaron una evoluci6n
errctica, en la que se aprecia una disminuci6n de 57,4% a 50,7% durante el periodo 1991-1997,
para luego incrementarse a 54,1% en el aflo 2000. En terminos absolutos, se estima en 14.6
millones (54.8%) el nOmero de personas que se encuentran afectadas por la pobreza en el aflo
2001.
En las areas rurales del pars, en que la pobreza tiene un caracter mas estructural, la informaci6n
indica que en el aflo 2001, 7,38 millones de personas se encuentran en pobreza, de las cuales
4,81 millones estan en pobreza extrema. En terminos relativos, el 78.3% de la poblaci6n rural es
pobre y el 51.3% se encuentra en pobreza extrema.
En el area urbana, la informaci6n actual sobre los niveles de pobreza indica que, incluyendo Lima
Metropolitana, el numero de personas en situaci6n de pobreza asciende a 7,28 millones, de los
cuales 1,71 millonesson pobres extremos. En esta area del pals, la evoluci6n de la pobreza se
relaciona directamente con las escasas posibilidades de la economia de generar empleo
adecuado, lo que ha derivado en un mercado de trabajo caracterzado por una alta proporci6n de
trabajo independiente y familiar en unidades de escasa productividad y una pequefla proporci6n
de poblaci6n ocupada en el sector formal.
La informaci6n de los niveles de desempleo (alrededor del 10%), no guarda relaci6n con las
vivencias, sentimientos y actitudes que expresan los pobres en esta area, sino mas bien con los
escasos ingresos que logra por las tareas que realiza, las cuales no pueden denominarse
estrictamente "empleos" sino mas bien actividades eventuales y marginales. De 1998 a 1999, la
Poblacibn Econ6micamente Activa (PEA) rural se increment6 en casi 450 mil personas,
particularmente por el aumento de 350 mil activos como trabajadores no remunerados en el agro.
Al respecto, si bien se observa que el 5,7 % de la PEA se encuentra desempleada, hay que tomar
en cuenta que, adicionalmente, el subempleo, fen6meno de caracter estructural mas importante
del mercado laboral peruano que agrupa al 51,8 % de la PEA, afecta la productividad de la mano
de obra y limita la competitividad econ6mica.
La desigual distribuci6n de los ingresos hace que el problema de la pobreza en el Perui sea aun
mas severo. Una evidencia de la inequidad de los ingresos, la constituye la desigual distribuci6n
del consumo de los hogares: el nivel del gasto de consumo per capita del decil mas pobre de la
sierra rural es 22 veces inferior al decil menos pobre de Lima Metropolitana. Esta informaci6n
pone de manifiesto que una persona del decil mas pobre de la Sierra Rural tiene un nivel de
56



consumo diario de s6lo medio d6lar, mientras que una del mejor decil de Lima Metropolitana,
consume US$ 11 d6lares diarios, en promedio.
A estos aspectos se agregan los elementos expresados por recientes estudios sobre las voces de
los pobres en el Peru, los que demuestran que la pobreza es concebida, por la poblaci6n que la
padece, como un fen6meno multiple con dimensiones estrechamente conectadas y que se
refuerzan mutuamente. Esta poblaci6n siente que la pobreza es una combinaci6n de aspectos
como la violencia en el hogar, discriminaci6n por genero, vida familiar bajo tensi6n, alto costo de
curaci6n de enfermedades, deficiencias en los servicios educativos, practicas discriminatorias y
corrupci6n en instituciones publicas, limitado acceso a la justicia, inseguridad juridica en relaci6n
a la tenencia de la tierra, falta de seguridad y violencia, insuficiente acceso al credito formal,
frustraci6n e insatisfacci6n de los j6venes, subempleo y desempleo, falta de poder de negociaci6n
en el mercado, dependencia y vulnerabilidad de la pequefla agricultura, entre otros factores.
A. Pobreza v Crecimiento Econ6mico
A lo largo de los Oltimos afios el Perui ha registrado episodios de gran crecimiento altemados
con otros de recesi6n. En el periodo 1980-1990, la economia experiment6 una contracci6n
promedio anual cercano al 1,0%, en tanto que en el perlodo 1991- 2000, la tasa promedio de
crecimiento anual se elev6 a 4,2%.
El crecimiento promedio de los noventa se sustenta fundamentalmente en la expansi6n
econ6mica del perlodo 1993-1997, equivalente a 7.6% promedio anual, la mitad de ella
relacionada con medidas de estabilizacion econ6mica aplicadas a inicios de la decada. Cabe
recordar, que a partir de agosto de 1990, el Gobiemo de Alberto Fujimori puso en marcha un
proceso de estabilizaci6n econ6mica y, simultaneamente, inici6 la aplicaci6n de medidas de
ajuste estructural. Los objetivos de la politica econ6mica buscaban detener la hiperinflaci6n,
lograr la reinserci6n en el sistema financiero intemacional y la recuperaci6n de las reservas
intemacionales netas.
La tendencia de crecimiento se revierte en la segunda mitad de la decada, producto de la
crisis econ6mica y polltica que enfrenta el pals a partir de 1998, la que aunada a factores
naturales adversos (Fen6meno del Niflo), redujeron significativamente las perspectivas de
crecimiento de la economia peruana. En virtud del escaso progreso econ6mico del pals a lo
largo de los ultimos 50 aflos, al terminar la decada de los 90's, el PBI per capita era inferior al
de inicios de los 70's.
La crisis de este periodo se verifica a traves de la relaci6n pobreza y PBI per capita, la cual se
ha -ido deteriorando, alcanzando las cifras de pobreza niveles significativos, no obstante el
PBI per capita en el 2000 fue mas elevado que en 1985; es decir a pesar de la evoluci6n
positiva de los indicadores macroecon6micos, los indicadores de nivel de vida, muestran
efectos contradictorios, los cuales se manifiestan en la agudizaci6n de la pobreza, el
incremento en la desigualdad de los ingresos y la escasa generaci6n de empleo en el pals.
Asimismo, cabe agregar el extremado centralismo que caracteriza el crecimiento econ6mico y
la acci6n del estado en el Peni, lo cual afecta las posibilidades de desarrollo del interior del
pals, y limita la capacidad de las regiones para generar empleo productivo y propiciar la
elevaci6n de la calidad de vida de la poblaci6n, obligando a una permanente migraci6n
poblacional hacia Lima y otros pocos centros urbanos de importancia.
La desproporcionada concentraci6n de la actividad econ6mica y de los servicios en Lima
Metropolitana, da lugar a que en esta area del pals se genere el 55% del ingreso nacional, se
produzca el 48% del PBI y la banca comercial coloque el 78% de los creditos, no obstante
alberga s6lo el 29% de la poblaci6n. En cuanto a la organizacion estatal, es el gobierno
central el que concentra la mayor parte del gasto y de la recaudaci6n (en 1998 efectu6 el
91.2% del gasto publico), dejando muy poco en manos de los gobiemos locales.
57



B. Pobreza v Crecimiento Econ6mico
Durante la decada de los noventa, para enfrentar el problema de la pobreza, el Estado plante6
dos Estrategias: la 'Estrategia de Alivio a la Pobreza' para el perlodo 1993-1995 y la
"Estrategia Focalizada de Lucha contra la Pobreza" para los affos 1996-2000. Ninguna de las
dos fue ejecutada de acuerdo a los principios y acciones planteados. En su lugar, se
implement6 una polftica social desarrollada a partir de un conjunto de programas, ejecutados
por instituciones y Ministerios, como el de la Presidencia y el de la Mujer y Desarrollo
Humano, que se caracterizaron por su falta de integralidad, coordinaci6n y escasa
focalizaci6n, asi como, por la nula relaci6n con los gobiemos locales y la sociedad civil.
Estas instituciones y programas basaron su accionar en un gasto social creciente, en la
medida que las acciones que desarrollaban requerlan el incremento paulatino de recursos
para el logro de los fines politicos del regimen.
De esta manera, el gasto social pas6 de 3,4% a 5,3% del PBI, entre 1990 y el 2000, siendo el
promedio de la decada 4,8%. Cabe mencionar que la tendencia creciente de la inversi6n
social se verifica especialmente en el gasto destinado a los denominados "Programas de
Alivio a la Pobreza", cuyo presupuesto se increment6 de 178 millones de d6lares a 400
millones entre 1995 y el 2001.
No obstante la fuerte inversi6n dirigida a los pobres, los efectos en Ia reducci6n de la pobreza
se vieron limitados por las caracterlsticas de la intervencion, que no permiti6 la generaci6n de
capacidades e integracion de la poblaci6n mas pobre al desarrollo.
Entre las principales limitaciones de la intervenci6n estatal que impidieron la superacion de la
pobreza, cabe citar:
-   Multiplicidad de programas con poblaciones objetivos similares.
-   Enfoque sectorializado y desarticulado.
-   Gesti6n centralizada y deficiente focalizaci6n.
-   Nula participaci6n de los gobiemos locales en su ejecuci6n.
II.   Marco Poliftico Actual
El Gobiemo del Presidente Alejandro Toledo ha asumido la lucha contra la pobreza como el eje
central de la Polftica de Gobiemo. La nueva politica social ha sido anunciada por el Presidente de
la Republica y expuesta por el Presidente del Consejo de Ministros ante el Congreso de la
Republica.
El punto de partida del reto que implica la polftica de superaci6n de la pobreza es el
reconocimiento que la extrema desigualdad econ6mica y social constituye el problema critico que
afecta a la Naci6n, su desarrollo y la competitividad a nivel intemacional. Por consiguiente, la
eliminaci6n de las condiciones de exclusi6n, superaci6n de la pobreza extrema y reducci6n de los
niveles de pobreza absoluta que afectan a la mayorfa de peruanos, requieren del consenso
politico y social, para emprender una tarea que, por su complejidad, no puede ser resuelta en un
solo perlodo de gobiemo.
Para asumir estos desaflos se cuenta con el compromiso politico del Gobierno para profundizar
las reformas democraticas y entrelazarlas con otras de caracter social y econ6mico, asl como
generar capacidades de analisis para la formulaci6n de polfticas y programas y de gerencia
social.
58



En este contexto; la Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros ha elaborado el documento de Bases
para una Estrategia de Superaci6n de la pobreza, como marco onentador para la elaboraci6n de
dicha estrategia, cuyo enfoque se sustenta en cuatro prncipios basicos:
-  Generar oportunidades econ6micas para los pobres a partir de un crecimiento econ6mico
con sesgo redistributivo.
-  Lievar a cabo un proceso de descentralizaci6n y manejo eficiente del gasto social.
-  Lograr que los pobres puedan tener accesibilidad a los medios necesarios para que sus
demandas sean atendidas.
-  Desarrollar un soporte institucional que permita consolidar las acciones en un marco de
coordinaci6n y concertaci6n.
A diferencia de las experencias anteriores, esta estrategia reune dos condiciones claves para ser
aplicada con exito: (i) va a acompaflada de una racionalizaci6n integral de los organismos, fondos
y programas destinados a la inversi6n social, lo que debe permitir mejorar el uso de los recursos
p(iblicos y lograr el mayor impacto en las poblaciones objetivo; y (ii) una estrecha vinculaci6n de
la programaci6n y ejecuci6n de los programas sociales con las instancias descentralizadas del
Gobiemo, y la participacion y escrutinio permanente de las organizaciones de la sociedad civil
sobre las acciones y el gasto destinados a la superaci6n de la pobreza.
Asimismo, es parte de la estrategia del Gobiemo ampliar y uniformizar la cobertura de la
seguridad social, que otorga tanto directa como indirectamente, con el objeto de canalizar el
subsidio estatal, principalmente, a las capas mas desprotegidas de la poblaci6n, para lo cual se
esta evaluando la viabilidad legal de realizar reformas estructurales que permitan lograr dicho
objetivo3.
En tal sentido, el Gobiemo esta comprometido en divulgar la informaci6n necesaria para crear
conciencia de la sociedad sobre las inequidades de los sistemas de seguridad que existen en el
Perui y el nivel de desprotecci6n actual al adulto mayor.
En el marco del proceso de descentralizaci6n a nivel nacional anunciado e iniciado por el
Gobiemo con la reciente promulgaci6n de la Ley de Reforma Constitucional sobre
Descentralizacifn y, la convocatora para este aflo de elecciones regionales por el Ejecutivo, se
podra, en un futuro inmediato, dinamizar las capacidades locales para que asuman de manera
eficiente la gesti6n de sus proyectos, relacionados con la superaci6n de la pobreza, y generen a
su vez nuevas y mejores condiciones para planificar la propia gesti6n del desarrollo local.
a. Lineamientos de Polltica Social
Los lineamientos de la politica social se agrupan en tres componentes:
1. Pilar de la Dianidad. referido a la reducci6n de la Dobreza v aeneraci6n de trabaio diqno v
productivo.
El objetivo de este componente es realizar las reformas en las pollticas del sector social que
permitan acelerar la recuperaci6n econ6mica, lograr un crecimiento sustentable; e
incrementar la competitividad y la generaci6n de empleo. Para cumplir este objetivo el
Gobiemo se propone:
* Promover oportunidades y capacidades econ6micas para las personas y familias en
situaci6n de pobreza, preservando los derechos laborales.
iste anilisis es muy imponante, dada lajurisprudencia que en materia previsional han dictado detenninadas instancias legislativas.
59



* Ejecutar una politica econ6mica de corto plazo que reactive la economia y ponga en
marcha la capacidad instalada ociosa, as( como los programas de generaci6n de empleo
temporal y otros que mejoren el acceso de las personas en situaci6n de pobreza a
mercados de trabajo, credito, e infraestructura econ6mica y social basica (vivienda social,
caminos, comunicaciones, agua de riego), y, en otros casos, incrementando sus activos
productivos (capacidades laborales, tierras, capital de trabajo).
* Invertir con criterio de sostenibilidad, que genere un elevado crecimiento econ6mico y del
empleo de manera sostenible, para lo cual se buscara aflanzar la estabilidad jurldica, la
promoci6n de la actividad privada, la reactivaci6n del mercado intemo y la promoci6n de
exportaciones.
* Promover la uhificacion de programas de infraestructura rural ejecutados a nivel local.
* Ampliar la cobertura de la seguridad social y homogenizacion de los diferentes regimenes
previsionales a cargo del Estado, a fin de mejorar la calidad de vida de las capas mas
pobres de la poblaci6n de edad avanzada.
* Llevar a cabo politicas sectorales que promuevan la inversi6n y el crecimiento, con mayor
enfasis en los sectores intensivos en el uso de mano de obra, como turismo, agricultura,
industria, construcci6n y en el segmento de las PYMES.
En el marco del pilar de Dignidad, el Gobiemo se compromete a ejecutar las siguientes
acciones prioritarias vinculadas a los PSRL II y IlIl:
* Implementacion de un enfoque pro-pobres para el gasto y la proteccion social y la
promoci6n del empleo, lo que implica:
-Atender preferentemente a los sectores de Educaci6n y Cultura, Salud y Saneamiento, y
Asistencia Social, de modo que las asignaciones del presupuesto poblico del 2003, en
terminos reales, sean iguales o mayores que en el ejercicio presupuestal previo.
-Ejecutar no menos del 95% de la asignaci6n global acordada para los tres sectores
prioritarios a los que se ha hecho referencia, pudiendo reducirse al 90% en el caso de
un deficit fiscal mayor al previsto.
*  Protecci6n de recorte fiscal a seis programas claves que forman parte de la estrategia de
protecci6n social del Gobiemo, lo que implica:
-  El presupuesto a ser aprobado en 2002 destinado al funcionamiento de los programas
de Educaci6n Inicial (S/. 230 millones); Educaci6n Primaria (S/. 229 millones);
Educaci6n Secundaria (S/. 212 millones); Salud Individual (SI. 835 millones); Salud
Colectiva (SI. 432 millones); Promoci6n y Asistencia Social Comunitaria (S/. 383
millobes), seran mantenidos, en terminos reales, por lo menos en los niveles del
ejercicio presupuestal anterior.
-  Las reasignaciones presupuestales que-se efectuen desde programas protegidos de
bajo desempeflo hacia los de alto desempeflo, no superaran el 30% del nivel
presupuestal minimo acordado.
* Superaci6n de la falta de programas contraciclicos de protecci6n contra el desempleo, lo
que implica:
- La implementaci6n del programa de generaci6n de empleo temporal 'A Trabajar",
destinado a familias pobres, tendra un caracter contra-ciclico y metodologlas de auto
focalizaci6n a traves del salario y que tendra las siguientes caracteristicas: i) pago de
un salario mensual no mayor a S/. 300; ii) proporci6n del presupuesto de 'A Trabajar
Urbanoo, asignado a los distritos mas pobres, no menor a 42% y proporci6n del
presupuesto asignado a distritos del primer y segundo quintil no menor de 67%; iii)
porci6n del presupuesto de 'A Trabajar Rural" asignado a los distritos del primer
60



quintil en no menos del 34% y porci6n del' presupuesto asignado a los distritos del
primer y segundo quintil no menor a 59% y iv) proporci6n del presupuesto de 'A
Trabajar Rural' asignado al pago de mano de obra no calificada no menor de 40% del
total y en el uA Trabajar Urbano" no menor al 75%.
- El desarrollo de un estudio de los efectos del pago de jomales por el Programa A
Trabajar Rural en las familias-objetivo, e incorporaci6n de las recomendaciones del
estudio en el segundo ciclo del Programa.
Superaci6n de vaclos de coordinaci6n y duplicaci6n de esfuerzos en los programas
alimentarios, lo que implica:
- Unificaci6n de los programas de desayunos escolares y alimentaci6n infantil del
PRONAA y del Ministerio de Salud, bajo una sola administraci6n, a fin de avanzar en
al focalizaci6n de los programas hacia los mas pobres y en especial a los niflos
menores de cinco aflos y madres gestantes.
- Implementaci6n y evaluaci6n de un programa piloto de distribucion de efectivo en
lugar de alimentos en al menos 5 distritos.
2. Pilar de la Eauidad. refendo a loarar del acceso de los Dobres a la salud. nutricion. educacion.
v cultura.
El objetivo de este componente es el desarrollo de capacidades humanas que permitan el
desarrollo social sostenido, y, especificamente, superar las brechas de acceso de la
poblaci6n pobre a los servicios sociales basicos. Para cumplir este objetivo el Gobiemo se
propone:
*  Lograr una calidad de vida adecuada, a traves del acceso universal a los servicios de
salud, saneamiento y educaci6n basica, superando las barreras de genero, econ6micas,
geograficas, culturales e interculturales. Se trata de hacer llegar a las zonas rurales y a
los pobres servicios de calidad, adaptados a sus necesidades y realidades culturales.
*  Fomentar y promocionar valores eticos, para lo que el Gobiemo realizara todos los
esfuerzos necesarios por mejorar la autoestima de la poblaci6n, promoviendo ciudadania,
conocimiento y respeto a los derechos civicos, asi como transparentando la ejecuci6n de
los programas sociales y sometiendolos a una amplia participaci6n y vigilancia social y
disponiendo la rendici6n de cuentas de sus administradores.
*  Establecer una red de seguridad social, que active mecanismos que operen ante shocks
macrosociales (crisis econ6mica), regionales (desastres naturales), familiares y
personales (muerte, invalidez), reduciendo los riesgos, mitigandolos y protegiendo a las
familias de sus efectos, especialmente a los mas pobres.
En el marco del pilar de Equidad, el Gobiemo se compromete a ejecutar las siguientes
acciones prioritarias vinculadas a los PSRL II y IlIl:
* Acceso de los pobres a los Servicios de Salud, lo que implica:
- Ampliar la cobertura del Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS) especlficamente en el
componente Matemo-Infantil (Ml) a 339 mil madres y 823 mil niflos menores de 5 aflos
en el 2002; para o cual (i) se aprobara un plan de beneficios por Decreto Supremo; (ii)
el presupuesto del SIS para 2002ascendera a SI. 240 millones, de los cuales, S/. 116
millones seran asignados al componente matemo infantil del SIS, y (iii) estableciendose
una agencia aut6noma que se haga cargo del Seguro Integral.
* Mejora de los servicios de Educaci6n y Cultura, lo que implica:
- La publicaci6n y aplicaci6n de la ley de Nombramiento de Maestros, con veeduria de la
Defensorla del Pueblo y la Organizaci6n Transparencia
61



- Otorgamiento de remuneraciones a los maestros bajo las regulaciones de la nueva ley.
- Aprobar e implementar el nuevo r6gimen magisterial, que supone temas relacionados
con: (i) estructura de carrera docente; (ii) sistemas de incentivos a maestros basado en
el merito; (ii) definicifn del perfil del maestro; (iv) sistemas de evaluaci6n de maestros,
y (v) aplicaci6n de sanciones administrativas a la inconducta de maestros.
- Al menos 3.000 maestros trabajando en zonas rurales han recibido incentivos por
permanecer en dichas zonas.
3. Pilar de la InstRucionalidad. referdo a colocar al Estado al servicio de las personas.
El objetivo de este componente es mejorar la transparencia en la asignaci6n de recursos,
la participacifn de los beneficiarios para un mejor control social. Para cumplir este objetivo
el Gobiemo se propone:
* Fortalecer las reglas y procedimientos para un apropiado control y rendici6n de cuentas
en las adquisiciones y en la administraci6n de los recursos financieros del Estado.
. Implementar mecanismos para dar mayor transparencia al manejo de los recursos
pOblicos y que el acceso de las operaciones del sector ptiblico incluya la gesti6n de los
niveles locales y regionales de gobiemo.
* Apoyar la puesta en marcha de sistemas de vigilancia y control ciudadano, con especial
enfasis en la ejecuci6n de programas y proyectos de inversi6n social.
En el marco del pilar de Institucionalidad, el Gobiemo se compromete a ejecutar las
siguientes acciones prioritarias vinculadas a los PSRL 11 y Ill:
* Participaci6n y transparencia en las polfticas publicas, lo que implica:
-  Lanzamiento de un sistema piloto que permita la evaluaci6n pOblica de los servicios
gubemamentales.
- Asegurar el presupuesto para la realizaci6n del la Encuesta Nacional de Hogares
ENAHO IV la misma que debera incluir un m6dulo de percepci6n sobre
transparencia y calidad de los servicios sociales.
* Transparencia en la gesti6n de adquisiciones y financiera, lo que implica:
- Distribuci6n de una gula de politicas para la implementaci6n de sistema electr6nico
de adquisiciones gubemamentales que eleve la transparencia y eficiencia en la
contrataci6n pUblica.
-  La Contralorfa General de la Republica (CGR) y el Consejo Supervisor de
Contrataciones y Adquisiciones del Estado (CONSUCODE) publicaran las normas
de control y supervisi6n de obligatorio cumplimiento en todos los organismos
pOblicos.
- Lineamientos de polftica emitidos para la implementaci6n de un sistema electr6nico
para las adquisiciones gubemamentales contrbuyendo a la eficiencia y
transparencia en la contrataci6n publica.
Cabe indicar que las acciones y desencadenantes a los que se ha hecho referencia, no
ocasionan efectos negativos en el ambiente sino que, por el contrario, las actividades
prionzadas relativas a saneamiento basico y generaci6n de empleo temporal en el area de la
conservaci6n de recursos naturales (agua, suelo y foresterla, principalmente), favorecen un
desarrollo sostenible. En este sentido, es importante seflalar que en el Perui inici6 hace
algunos aflos acciones dirigidas a la protecci6n del medio ambiente las cuales siguen siendo
parte de la politica prioritaria del Gobiemo peruano. Entre las acciones tomadas destacan:
- La creaci6n del Consejo Nacional del Ambiente (CONAM) como ente rector de la
politica medioambiental.
- El establecimiento de un marco institucional que armoniza la legislaci6n del medio
ambiente con las responsabilidades institucionales.
-  El desarrollo de un cuerpo de legislaci6n sectorial de medio ambiente,
62



-  El establecimiento de una serie de instrumentos de prevenci6n y control,
(Evaluaciones de impacto ambiental, programas de acuerdos medioambientales,
evaluaciones territoriales de medio ambiente para proyectos publicos y privados,
entre otros).
-  Establecimiento de un sistema nacional de areas protegidas.
El Gobiemo se ha comprometido a asegurar la provision de recursos para mantener esta
funcion en el total de operaciones de los programas protegidos, en el marco del PSRL,
ademas de realizar evaluaciones de impacto ambiental a las nuevas inversiones que seran
financiadas por los Bancos, en los sectores contemplados en las gulas respectivas.
Asimismo, con miras a evaluar el impacto de las medidas en esta area, el Gobiemo
contempla la elaboraci6n de un indicador de medio ambiente que sintetice los principales
problemas ambientales considerando entre ellos: agua, suelo, aire, flora y fauna, areas
protegidas y limpieza publica.
IV.    Estrategias
Las estrategias benen como elementos fundamentales:
1 .  La promoci6n y el respeto de los derechos y deberes de la persona y la responsabilidad de
las instituciones.
Existe una enorme separaci6n entre las expectativas y necesidades de las personas y la
organizaci6n y cultura prevaleciente en las instituciones publicas. Este distanciamiento es
alentado por la limitada conciencia sobre los derechos y deberes de parte de las personas.
El Gobierno estara atento a evitar que los programas sociales sean subordinados por
intereses particulares o utilizados como instrumentos de clientelismo de diversa Indole,
desnaturalizando los prop6sitos originales para los que fueron creados.
Los derechos de las personas estan consagrados constitucionalmente y su promoci6n y
respeto son responsabilidad del Estado. Por tanto, los programas sociales se estableceran
teniendo como marco de referencia el respeto de esos derechos, de tal manera que cada
peruano sea protagonista de su futuro y sepa exactamente a que beneficios tiene derecho;
que estos se preserven independientemente de la coyuntura econ6mica -protegiendolos
durante las crisis econ6micas- o pollticas (elecciones u otros cambios) y que existan
mecanismos para que la poblaci6n pueda reclamar cuando tales derechos no se cumplan.
El Gobiemo fomentara la aprobaci6n consensual de compromisos sociales explicitos con
las familias peruanas: se explicitara que servicios y que programas van a entregarse, y a
quienes, asl como que mejoras va a hacer en los programas sociales; se establecera
claramente las condiciones para ser beneficiarios de los distintos prmgramas; se publicaran
esos compromisos y condiciones asegurando un conocimiento adecuado de la poblaci6n; y
se estableceran mecanismos que permitan canalizar y responder a los reclamos
ciudadanos (sistema de vigilancia social, fiscales ad-hoc, defensorla, comites de usuarios,
derecho a la revocatoria de funcionarios etc).
2.   El empoderamiento del ciudadano y de la sociedad civil
La viabilidad de la politica social demanda que la poblaci6n desempefle un rol activo en su
ejecuci6n. Por tanto, el Gobiemo buscara la participaci6n y compromiso del ciudadano
para que este opte ser sujeto y no objeto de los programas sociales. El rol de fiscalizaci6n
en el uso de los recursos publicos; la defensa de los derechos ciudadanos; la participaci6n
en la gesti6n de los servicios, en la determinaci6n de los objetivos y en la realizaci6n de las
evaluaciones de los programas sociales, supone que las personas conozcan y hagan uso
efectivo de su derecho a decidir. Una ciudadania empoderada obliga a la democratizaci6n
63



de los programas sociales en las diferentes instancias (nacional, regional, local). Las
familias y comunidades deben tener una participaci6n, tanto en la direcci6n de los propios
colegios y centros de salud, como en la ejecuci6n e implementaci6n de los programas
sociales. En este sentido, existen varias experencias alentadoras en las cuales se ha
podido demostrar los efectos positivos para los programas sociales cuando las personas y
las instituciones de la sociedad civil estbn empoderadas.
3.   Fortalecimiento de capacidades locales
El fortalecimiento de capacidades locales resulta, en este sentido, fundamental en la
medida que es directamente complementario a la creaci6n de oportunidades para los
pobres y al empoderamiento del ciudadano; es una preocupaci6n central de la nueva
estrategia de lucha contra la pobreza que dicho fortalecimiento permita la consolidaci6n de
nuevos actores que dinamicen el desarrollo local.
De esta manera se busca:
* Vincular estrechamente la generaci6n de empleo con los gobiemos y actores locales en
la perspectiva de la promoci6n del desarrollo con equidad, el fomento de la
productividad y la competitividad, la creaci6n de nuevos mercados y corredores
econ6micos; combinando el bienestar econ6mico y social de la ciudadanla.
* En la perspectiva de promover la participacion, se alentara la planificaci6n participativa
que alimente la elaboraci6n de los planes estrategicos de desarrollo, que provean una
visi6n de futuro y de sostenibilidad del desarrollo local.
4.   La asignaci6n de recursos con criterio de equidad
Son conocidas las grandes desigualdades que caracterizan a la sociedad peruana. Del
mismo modo es conocido que los recursos puiblicos son mas escasos en los lugares y
para las personas con mas necesidades. En los ultimos lustros, la inequidad de la
sociedad peruana se ha acentuado.
Los recursos publicos, sobre todo los destinados a los programas sociales, seran
aplicados con crtero de equidad; es decir, se asignaran mas recursos a los lugares y
personas que mas lo necesitan. Avanzar en ia equidad es una estrategia fundamental
para el desarrollo, la democracia y la paz. Aunque existen desaflos tecnicos
importantes, existe tambien una firme decisi6n politica de reducir inequidades.
5.   La descentralizacibn
Los programas sociales han tenido un comportamiento poco efectivo y eficiente debido a
su manejo centralizado. Han tenido resultados limitados porque han prestado servicios
que no estan adaptados a las realidades regionales y poco eficientes, debido a que
ciertas adquisiciones (contrataci6n de personal y los materales como textos, medicinas)
dependen de decisiones centrales, llegan a destiempo o no son de la calidad requerida.
La descentralizaci6n de los servicios tendra como beneficios:
* Servicios mas adaptados a las realidades locales y mas ajustados a las necesidades
de la poblaci6n.
* Mayores posibilidades de la poblaci6n de reclamar cuando los servicios son malos.
64



* Un control social mas directo sobre el personal y calidad de servicios de las entidades
(colegios, centros de salud) que los producen.
Los requisitos centrales para una descentralizaci6n exitosa de los servicios sociales son:
* Ser parte de una estrategia de descentralizaci6n general.
* Considerar los niveles regionales, provinciales, distritales y comunales.
* Establecer claramente las funciones de las distintas instancias de gobiemo.
* Adecuar el financiamiento para sostener los servicios.
* Desarrollar paralelamente un esfuerzo de fortalecimiento de la capacidad de gesti6n
de las instancias descentralizadas de gobiemo.
6.   La concertaci6n entre los diversos actores involucrados
Se busca que las politicas sociales sean producto de una discusi6n mucho mas amplia y
una mayor participacion de la sociedad, lo que demandara no solamente un cambio
desde el Estado, sino tambien un fortalecimiento de la sociedad civil. Particular atenci6n
debera prestarse al empoderamiento de los pobres, ya que, en caso contrario, se corre el
nesgo que el dilalogo se encapsule entre profesionales y sectores medios, cuya
capacidad de organizaci6n y defensa de sus interesas es mayor.
El Estado no debe reemplazar las labores de otros actores que tienen un rol en la lucha
contra la pobreza, ni entorpecer el desarrollo de los mercados. Estos otros actores son
ONGs, iglesias y empresas privadas. En su relaci6n con estas otras instituciones, el
Estado debe desempeflar un rol de supervisi6n de las acciones que realicen, protegiendo
los intereses de las personas y de la ciudadania, en general. Asimismo, debe ser un
facilitador y promotor, para lo que son fundamentales las experiencias de concertaci6n,
en particular en espacios locales. En este proceso, las Mesas de Concertaci6n para la
Lucha Contra la Pobreza y los espacios de diAlogo que puedan generarse jugaran un
papel fundamental.
7.   Transparencia en la gesti6n de los recursos puiblicos
Tradicionalmente, los recursos publicos han sido utilizados como si fuesen de propiedad
de funcionarios o de pequeflos grupos con intereses ajenos a los de la mayoria de la
poblaci6n. La informaci6n, en particular la informacion econ6mica, es mantenida en
secreto o a disposici6n de un reducido grupo prvilegiado por el poder polifico o el poder
econ6mico. Esta situaci6n se da aun en las instituciones que obtienen sus recursos por la
via de contribuciones, como es el caso de la seguridad social.
Para que el pals se encamine sostenidamente por la via del desarrollo y democracia es
imprescindible que estas concepciones y prcbticas sean sustituidas por otras que se basen
en principios democraticos y de servicio pbblico. Debe entenderse que los recursos
publicos son de propiedad e interes de la sociedad en su conjunto y que, por lo tanto, la
informaci6n debe estar al alcance de cualquier ciudadano.
V.     Seguimiento y Evaluaci6n de las Politicas Sociales
El Gobiemo Peruano ha definido un conjunto de 20 indicadores de primer nivel (ver Anexo) para
realizar el seguimiento y evaluaci6n de los distintos programas sociales, particularmente los
vinculados a las iniciativas de reforma social auspiciadas por los Prestamo Programbtico de
65



Reforma Social 11 y Ili. Asl mismo, se viene elaborando indicadores de segundo nivel en
coordinacion con los sectores.,
Mediante este conjunto-de indicadores se medira y evaluara el avance de la politica y de los
programas sociales,-expresados enla matriz de compromisos de la politica de reforma social y la
estrategia del gobiemo de superaci6n de la pobreza agrupados en los tres pilares a que se ha
hecho referencia: (i) de Digriidad, (ii) de Equidad, y (iii) de Institucionalidad.

PSRL = Programmatic Social Reform Loan.
Los indicadores marcados con PSRL, se encuentran en la Matriz de negociacdOn con el Banco Mundial.
Los Indicadores en rojo fueron incluidos al termino de esta MISION en el documento del 13 de abril (versl6n en ingles).
Los demas indicadores y metas se establecieron en versiones anteriores de la Matriz.
Sobre los Indicadores
Sobre la base del programa de gobiemo y la Carta de Politica Social, se determinaron los objetivos
centrales, los mismos que se convierten en pilares de la polltica de gubemamental. A partir de estos
documentos se define los efectos deseados 'lo que el gobiemo aspira lograr en los pr6ximos. 5 aflos". El
analisis de cada objetivo, llev6 a identificar cuales serlan las prncipales areas o sectores de intervenci6n
que el gobiemo debe priorizar para alcanzar sus objetivos. Dado el objetivo central de reducir la pobreza,
se identifican y delimitan areas de intervenci6n a base a los tres objetivos del programa de gobiemo que
se resume en: a) Oportunidades para un trabajo digno; b) Educaci6n, salud y cultura para todos y c) El
Estado al servicio de las personas.
68



La revisi6n del marco conceptual y los estudios diagn6sticos de los determinantes de la pobreza, han
contribuido con mayores cn'terios para delimitar las areas de intervenci6n, los efectos y las variables que,
pueden ser utilizados como indicadores. Con un documento borrador de las areas seleccionadas y los
indicadores que mejor cuantifican los efectos, se procedio a hacer revisiones y consistencias con los
documentos de politica de los sectores y con los tecnicos de cada sector en las areas de interes
identificadas como prioritarias. Finalmente una versi6n revisada paso para aprobaci6n de las altas
autoridades del gobiemo. (Ver figura 1).
Seleccl6n de los indicadores de primer nivel
Tomando como referencia el modelo de causalidad (factor-efecto),en cada una de las areas o sectores de
intervenci6n se identifican el efecto o efectos, que a juzgar por los objetivos del programa gobiemo, son
los deseados y prioritarios. A la variable que mejor cuantifica el efecto se ha denominado indicador de
primer nivel. Como es de esperar, una sola variable puede no ser suficiente para cuantificar el efecto
deseado, sin embargo se ha buscado que sea el menor numero posible. Por otra parte, en la seleccion se
han considerado los aspectos relacionados a su medici6n, sensibilidad, especificidad, nivel de agregaci6n
o desagregaci6n del indicador. Asl mismo, se ha buscado que el indicador cuantifique el grado de
inequidad y que a su vez sea sensibles a intervenciones que revisten mayor prioridad para las
poblaciones de mayor pobreza. (Ejemplo: ingreso promedio del primer quintil de la PEA).
Selecci6n de los Indlcadores de segundo nivel
Siempre tomando como referencia el modelo de causalidad (factor-efecto) y a diferencia de los
indicadores de primer nivel, las variables que mejor cuantifican los factores se a denominado indicadores
de segundo nivel, sin embargo en algunos casos estos indicadores se comportan como efecto de otros
factores, y estos a su vez pueden ser tambi6n efectos de otros factores. Para abordar este proceso de
selecci6n y superar la relatividad de factor-efecto, esta en proceso el desarrollo un marco de referenda de
entendimiento de cada una de las areas de intervenci6n, especfficamente para salud esta tarea se ha
completado. Este marco de referencia en primer termino diferencia 4 dominios de entendimiento de cada
area o sector, un primero dominio denominado de resultados o situaci6n actual del area y otros tres
dominios de intervenci6n que corresponde a los factores; en este segundo grupo se diferencia aquellos
factores vinculados con el contexto, intrinsicos a cada espacio geografico-poblacional y que va desde el
nivel individual hasta el nivel de comunidad; otro dominio es la respuesta social y como operan los
sistemas (salud, educaci6n, agua, etc.) y finalmente el dominio de las politicas de gobiemo.
Por ejemplo en salud se ha planteado que un area de intervenci6n es la salud de madre, el indicador que
cuantifica mejor tal efecto es la mortalidad matema, pero este indicador depende de factores que
pertenecen a conductas propias de la madre (utilizaci6n de los servicios de salud), factores del sistema
de salud ( calidad de atenci6n obstetrica) y de las pollticas de gobiema (Gasto publico asignado). Ver
Figura 2.
Definici6n de metas
Las proyecciones del indicador a efecto de determinar las metas siguen tres criterios de abordajes:
a) Datos hist6ocos y revision de la tendencia del indicador.
b) Por contrastar con la tendencia del indicador en otros palses de similares condiciones (Palses de
la regi6n).
c) El nivel de prioridad asignado por el gobiemo y que se expresa por incrementar inversi6n,
rediseflo de estrategias, proyectos, acciones. En esta aproximaci6n se espera que la meta sea
mayor a la que se alcanzarla de seguir la tendencia reciente.
Las metas planteadas responden al primer y segundo criterio de abordaje, estando en proceso el c)
69



A continuaci6n se detalla el procedimiento seguido para estimar la meta para el indicador desnutrci6n
cr6nica:
El criterio de abordaje seguido se basa en la revisi6n de datos hist6ricos y el arialisis de las tendencias
expermentadas.
En el Peruj en 1975 se determin6 que la prevalencia fue de 39.7%, una segunda encuesta nacional en
1984 reporto 37.8 y luego -las encuestas ENDES y ENNIV proveen estimados nacionales para
1992,1994,1996 y 2000.

Letter N° - 2002-EF/
May 20, 2002
Mr. James Wolfensohn
President
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
Re:    Social Development Policy Letter
We are pleased to confirm the agreement by the Government of Peru of the social reform program
presented by the Transition Government in its Social Development Policy Letter in March last year
relating to the first Programmatic Social Reform Loan (PSRL I). The Policy Letter established the
Peruvian Government's commitment for, among others, the definition and articulation of a social policy;
the transparency and rationalization of social programs, and the creation of a social safety net during
crisis. Progress made in the implementation of the social reform was communicated to you by this
Ministry in Letter N° 1 22-2002-EF/UC-PS dated February 4, 2002 (Report on Closing of Operations for
the Programmatic Social Reform Loan - Loan N° 4615 PE-PSRL I).
Likewise, we are enclosing herewith an updated Social Development Policy Letter. This Letter
includes prior commitments made by the Government of Peru and takes into account the present
Government's general priorities, as well as the poverty alleviation initiatives that President Alejandro
Toledo's Administration has decided to put in place in the short and medium term. Additionally, it
describes the commencement of a major process, such as the National Dialogue which convenes the
nation's political groups to reach a national accord for equity and social justice, the modernization of the
State, and the nation's political and administrative decentralization.
Yours sincerely,
74



SOCLIL DEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER
The Social Development Policy Letter is the Peruvian Government's contribution to a dialogue
between the key players in Peru's political scene and civil society. Its goal is to reach a National Pact
in matters of Equity and Social Justice, and in areas related to Competitiveness and Harmonious and
Strategic Development, the Construction of an Efficient and Transparent State, and the Strengthening
of Regional and Local governments, among others.
This paper offers an analysis of the social situation and poverty in Peru, and how it relates to
economic growth in the last decade. It deals with the current political and economic context which
serves as a backdrop for the fight against poverty, which is in tum the backbone of President
Alejandro Toledo's Govemment Policy. The Government's main Social Policy Guidelines and
strategies to defeat poverty and strengthen social justice and equity appear below. The section on the
Guidelines delineates the priority action lines relating to Stages II and III of the Programmatic Social
Reforn Loan, which are this Loan's main triggers.
Analysis
Poverty rates fluctuated in the 1990s, falling from 57.4% to 50.7% between 1991 and 1997, and
then increasing to 54.1% in 2000. In absolute terms, the number of poor in 2001 was estimated at
14.6 million persons (54.8%). In the country's rural areas, where poverty is more structural in
nature, data indicate that in 2001 there were 7,380,000 people living in poverty, of which
4,815,000 were living in extreme poverty. In relative terms, this translates to 78.3% of the rural
population living in poverty, and 51.3% living in extreme poverty.
In urban areas, present data show that the number of poor has reached 7,389,000, including the
population of Metropolitan Lima. Of these, 1,715,000 live in extreme poverty. In these areas,
poverty's evolution is directly related to the economy's inability to create adequate jobs.
Consequently, the labor market is characterized by a high percentage of independent and family
groups working in low-productivity sectors and only a small percentage of the population
employed in the formal sector.
Data on unemployment (which hovers around 10%) do not reflect the life experiences, feelings
and attitudes experienced by the city poor. Unemployment data instead reflects the small income
earned for work that cannot be strictly called employment but rather occasional and marginal
occupation. From 1998 to 1999, the rural Economically Active Population (EAP) grew by almost
450,000 workers, in particular through the addition to the labor force of 350,000 non-wage
earners to agriculture. Although 5.7% of the EAP is unemployed, labor productivity and
economic competitiveness are further aggravated by underemployment, which involves 51.8 % of
the EAP and which is the most important structural feature of Peru's labor market.
The unequal distribution of income further aggravates Peru's poverty problems. Evidence of the
unequal distribution of income is found in the disparate distribution of consumption among
households. As a result, the poorest tenth of Peru's rural poor exhibits per capita consumption 22
times lower than the top tenth of Metropolitan Lima's population. To illustrate, the data reveal
that a citizen in the poorest decile of the Rural Highlands' population spends only a half dollar
per day, while a member of the top decile in Metropolitan Lima spends on average US$11 per
day.
75



Additional considerations include recent surveys where the poor have expressed their thoughts on
poverty. These surveys reveal that the poor perceive poverty as a phenomenon of multiple
dimensions which are closely linked and reinforce each other. To the poor, poverty is a
combination of elements including family violence, gender discrimination, family life under
stress, the high cost of health care, deficient schools, discrimination and corruption in government
institutions, limited access to justice, legally insecure land ownership, lack of security, violence,
limited access to formal credit, young people's frustration and insatisfaction, underemployment
and unemployment, lack of power in market negotiations, dependent and vulnerable small scale
agriculture, among others.
A.     Poverty and Economic Growth
In recent years Peru has experienced periods of substantial growth alternating with episodes of
recession. In 1980-1990, Peru's economy shrank at an average annual rate close to 1.0%,
while from 1991 to 2000, the annual average growth rate reached 4.2%.
The average growth rate achieved in the 1990s is rooted largely in the economic expansion of
1993 -1997, when growth rates reached 7.6% annually, partially as a result of economic
stabilization measures introduced at the beginning of the decade. From August 1990 onwards,
President Alberto Fujimori's administration launched a process to stabilize the economy while
simultaneously introducing structural adjustment measures. Economic policy objectives
included ending hyperinflation, bringing Peru back into the international community fold, and
restoring net international currency reserves.
The growth trend reversed in the second half of the decade as a consequence of the nation's
economic and political crisis that started in 1998, combined with adverse natural events (i.e.,
the El Nifo weather anomaly), all of which contributed to the significant reduction of the
Peruvian economy's growth. By virtue of scant progress in Peru's economy in the last 50
years, by the end of the 1990s per capita GDP was lower than at the beginning of the 1970s.
The crisis of this period is demonstrated by the link between poverty and per capita GDP
whereby during the period under review poverty deepened significantly despite the fact that in
2000 per capital GDP was greater than in 1985.  That is to say, despite favorable
macroeconomic indicators, standard of living figures show a contradictory fluctuation
pointing to greater poverty, a widening income gap and insufficient job creation.
Moreover, economic growth and the State's initiatives in Peru are characterized by an
exacerbated centralization that hampers development in the interior, and limits regional
capacities to create productive employment and foster a better quality of living for people
there. The end result is ongoing migration to Lima and other major cities.
Metropolitan Lima's disproportionate concentration of economic activity and services causes
this part of the country to generate 55% of national income, 48% of its GDP, and to capture
78% of banks' loans, although it is home to only 29% of the population. The central
government, meanwhile, is the source of most spending and tax collection (in 1998, it was the
source of 91.2% of all public expenditure), and leaves little to local governments.
B.    Poverty and Economic Growth
To fight poverty in the 1990s the government proposed two strategies: the Poverty Alleviation
Strategy (1993-1995); and the Targeted Poverty Reduction Strategy (1996 -2000). Neither
76



program was implemented as proposed in their respective principles and plans. Instead, -social
policy was carried out via a number of programs that were implemented by a range of
ministries and agencies, including the Ministry of the Presidency and the Ministry for Women
and Human Development. These agencies were characterized by a lack of integrity,
coordination, and links to local government and civil society, as well as by insufficient
targeting of benefits to poor and vulnerable groups.
These organizations and programs based their initiatives on growing social expenditure to the
extent their actions required the gradual growth of available resources to achieve the regime's
political goals.
Social spending rose from 3.4% to 5.3% of GDP between 1990 and 2000, with an average of
4.8% for the decade as a whole. Remarkably, the trend towards growing social investments is
particularly manifested in increasing funding for so-called Poverty Alleviation Programs that
grew from 178 million to 400 million dollars between 1995 to 2000.
But despite major investments in the poor, the impact of such spending on reducing poverty
was hampered by the very characteristics of the intervention itself. No capacity building was
undertaken wnd neither was it effective in bringing the neediest into the development
mainstream.
Among the main factors that limited the impact of State interventions on poverty, the
following are worth highlighting:
-   Multiple programs focusing on similar target audiences
-   A sectoral approach lacking articulation
-   Centralized management and deficient targeting
-   Lack of local government participation in program implementation
Present Political Scene
President Alejandro Toledo's present administration has placed the struggle against poverty at the
core of its Government policy. The new social policy was announced by the President of Peru
and presented before Congress by his Cabinet Chief.
The initial challenge posed by the above policy is acknowledging that extreme economic and
social disparity is the country's most pressing issue, as it hampers development and international
competitiveness. Consequently, eliminating the conditions that create exclusion, overcoming
extreme poverty and reducing conditions of absolute poverty that still hurt most Peruvians require
building political and social consensus that will make possible a task that, because of its sheer
complexity, cannot be tackled during a single government term.
To address these challenges, the Government has committed to deepen democratic reforms and
link them to social and economic reforms, while creating the capacity to analyze and design
policies and programns, and to manage social programs.
Against this background, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers has prepared a strategic
guideline paper entitled "Basis for a Strategy to Defeat Poverty" built on the four following
tenets:
77



Creating economic opportunities for the poor, based on economic growth with a
redistributive bias.
- Implementing a decentralization effort together with efficient social expenditure
management.
- Giving the poor the power and voice so that their claims will be heard.
- Developing the institutional support that will strengthen these initiatives in a framework
of consensus and coordination.
Contrary to prior experiences, this Strategy meets two key conditions for success: (i) it is
combined with the comprehensive rationalization of organizations, funds and programs charged
with social investment, thus allowing improved use of public resources and a greater impact on
target populations; and (ii) it is closely related to scheduling and execution of social programs in
decentralized Government agencies, as well as ongoing involvement in and scrutiny of actions
and spending to defeat poverty.
Likewise, it will be part of the Government's strategy to broaden social insurance coverage and
standardize public benefit scales, while redirecting state subsidies to the poorest and most
vulnerable segments of the population. The review of the necessary legal reforms required to
accomplish this goal is underway.42
In addition, the Government of Peru is committed to disseminating the information needed to
raise awareness of the inequalities in existing social security systems and the current lack of
protection for senior citizens.
Nationwide decentralization announced and launched by the GOP through the recent enactment
of the Constitutional Amendment Law on Decentralization, and the call for regional elections
made by the Executive Branch, will immediately allow ability local governments to manage their
own projects and simultaneously create new and better conditions for planning local development
management efforts.
The social policy guidelines and strategies specifically targeting poverty alleviation are presented
below.
m.     Social Policy Guidelines
4. The social policy guidelines are grouped around three components. First, a Dignitv Pillar. to
reduce povertv and create "dignified" and productive jobs. The purpose of this component is
to introduce the reforms in social sector policies that will accelerate economic recovery,
attain sustainable growth, increase competitiveness and create employment. To achieve this
goal, the Government of Peru will:
* Promote opportunities and economic capacity building for poor individuals and families,
with due regard for preserving labor rights.
* Enforce a short term economic policy to jump start the economy and set in motion idle
productive capacity while introducing temporary and other job programs; to improve poor
people's access to labor, credit and basic social and economic infrastructue (low-income
42 A crucial analysis given existingjurisprudence about pension issues decided by various law making instances.
78



housing, roads, communications, irrigation water); and in other instances by increasing
their productive assets (labor skills, land, working capital).
* Making sustainable investments that will accomplish high rates of economic growth and
job creation. To do so, juridical stability, private business, a stronger internal market and
exports will be promoted.
* Expand coverage of the social security network and standardize the various pension
regimes run by the State, thus improving social protection mechanisms for poorest
segments of the senior citizen population.
* Introduce policies to promote investment and growth, with an emphasis on labor-intensive
industries, including tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, housing and small and
microenterprises.
In the context of the Dignity Pillar, the Government of Peru is committed to carrying out the
following priority initiatives related to PSRL II and HII stages.
* Implementing a poor-people driven approach to spending, social safety and job promotion,
including:
-Pay special attention to Education and Culture, Health and Sanitation, and Social
Assistance, so that real-term budget allocations for 2003 will be equal to or greater
than in the previous budget cycle.
-Execute not less than 95% of the overall budget allocation for the three priority sectors
referred to above, with a minimum 90% in case of a greater than expected fiscal
deficit.
* Shielding six key programs from fiscal cuts that are the backbone of the Government's
social protection strategy. This implies the following:
-  Preserving the budget in 2002 for the following programs: Initial Education (S/. 229
million); Secondary Education (S/. 212 million); Health (S/. 835 million); Community
Health (S/. 432 million); Community Promotion and Social Assistance (S/. 449
million). These budget amounts will be kept at the real term levels of the preceding
budget cycle allocations.
- Budget reallocations from poor performing to more effective programs will not
exceed 30% of the minimum agreed budget allocation.
* Overcoming the lack of counter-cyclical unemployment protection programs, the
implications of which are as follows:
-  Implementing the A Trabajar job creation scheme aimed at the poorest families. The
program's counter-cyclical nature and salary-driven self-targeting methodologies
require: i) paying a monthly wage not above S/.300; ii) allocating not less than 40% of
A Trabajar Urban Program budget allocations to the poorest city districts and not less
than 60% of the budget to the first and second poorest quintile districts; iii) allocating
unskilled labor not less than 40% of the A Trabajar Rural Program budget, and not
less than 70% in the A Trabajar Urban Program.
- Undertaking a study on the impact of wages paid by the Rural A Trabajar Program to
target households, and including survey recommendations in the Program's second
cycle.

* Filling coordination voids and canceling duplicate efforts in food program efforts. This
will require:
*  Placing PRONAA's and Ministry of Health's school breakfasts and child nutrition
programs under a single administration to further focus those programs on the
neediest.
*  Introducing and assessing a pilot program for cash allowance distribution to replace
food deliveries in at least five districts.
5. An Equity Pillar to give poor people access to health. nutrition, education and culture.
This component seeks to develop human capacities leading to sustained social development
and, especially, to fill the gaps that prevent access of the poor to basic social services. To
accomplish this goal, the Government of Peru will strive to:
* Create appropriate quality of life by providing universal access to basic health, sanitation
and education, and defeating gender, economic, geographic, cultural and cross cultural
barriers, with a view to supplying rural areas and the poor quality services that match their
cultural needs and reality.
* Foster and promote ethical values through Government efforts to develop people's self-
esteem, best governance practices, awareness of and respect for individual rights, and by
opening social program implementation, expanding involvement and putting these
programs under intense citizen watch and scrutiny, to hold officials accountable for their
decisions.
* Create a social safety net that will trigger schemes to protect the poor against macro social
shocks (economic crisis, war), regional impacts (natural disasters), and family and
individual catastrophes (death, disability), by reducing and mitigating risk, and protecting
families from the fallout, in particular the neediest.
In the framework of the Pillar of Equity initiative, the Government of Peru commits to
undertake the following priority actions related to PSRL stages II and ml.
* Provide the poor with access to Health Services. This implies:
* Expanding the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan (Seguro Integral de Salud, or
SIS in Spanish) to reach 340,000 mothers and one million children under-5 by 2002.
This effort will require: (i) enacting a Supreme Decree to create a benefits plan; (ii)
increasing the SIS budget from S/. 1309 million to S/. 240 million in 2002, of which
the mother-child health insurance component (SIS-MI) will get S/- 116 million; (iii)
creating an independent agency to run the Comprehensive Insurance scheme.
* Improve Education and Culture services, the implications being:
*  Publishing and enforcing the Teachers' Appointment Act, overseen by the Defense of
the People (Office of the Ombudsman) and Transparencia Organization.
*  Paying teachers' wages in compliance with regulations under the new law.
*  Approving -and implementing a new scheme for teachers, which will require (i)
structuring a career path for teachers; (ii) creating merit-based incentives plans; (iii)
preparing teacher job descriptions and profiles; (iv) creating performance assessment
systems; and (v) enforcing administrative penalties for teacher misconduct.
80



* Giving at least 3,000 teachers incentives to remain in their rural posts.
6. An Institutionality Pillar, creating a state that serves the people.
This component seeks to increase transparency in resource allocation, involving
beneficiaries to achieve enhanced community oversight. To reach this goal, the GOP
proposes to:
* Strengthen the rules and procedures to enforce appropriate oversight and accountability
in the State's procurement and management of goods and financial resources, as
appropriate.
* Implement mechanisms to introduce greater transparency in public resource management,
and open governnent transactions to local and regional governments.
* Support the introduction of citizen watch and oversight initiatives, with an emphasis on
investment in and execution of social investment programs and projects.
Against the framework of the Institutionality Pillar, the GOP commits to carry out the
following PSRL Stage II and m priority actions:
* Foster participation in and transparency of public policies. This implies:
- Starting a pilot system for the public to evaluate government services.
- Ensuring an appropriate budget allocation to carry out the Fourth National
Households Survey (ENAHO IV) including a module on respondents' perceptions
of transparency in and quality of social services provided.
* Increase transparency in Govemment's procurement procedures and financial
management by:
*  Distributing a free manual explaining the Government's electronic procurement
system to more fully disclose govemment contracts' information and make them
more efficient.
*  Mandating the General Controller and the Govemment Bidding and Procurement
Regulatory Agency (CONSUCODE) to publish oversight and supervision
regulations for all government agencies.
* Issuing policy guidelines to put in place an electronic system for Government
procurement that will further contribute to public contracts' efficiency and
transparency.
No damage to the environment is expected to result from the initiatives and triggers
mentioned here. Instead, priority activities in basic sanitation and temporary job creation for
resource conservation (including water, soil and forestry, principally) should contribute to
sustainable development. Peru started several years ago a number of environmental
protection initiatives that are still components of the Peruvian Government's policy priorities,
including:
- A National Environmental Council (CONAM) that acts as the guiding body for
environmental policy.
- Creating an institutional setting that matches environmental regulations and institutional
responsibilities. Developing a body of environmental legislation.
- Creating a number of prevention and oversight tools such as environmental impact
assessments, environmental contracts, territorial environmental assessments for public and
private projects, and others.
81



- Creating a national network of protected areas.
The Peruvian Government will ensure sufficient resources to keep all the protected programs
operational within the PSRL framework, and additionally carry out enviromnental impact
assessments for new investments in the sectors included in the corresponding orientations.
Furthermore, to assess impacts in this field, the GOP is considering preparation of an
enviromnental impact indicator that will synthesize basic envirorunental issues,
including water, soil, air, animal and plant life, protected areas and public cleaning.
IV.    Strategies
The strategies include the following fundamental elements:
8.   Promotion of and respect for people's rights and duties and institutional accountability.
A wide gap separated people's expectations and needs and the prevailing culture and set-
up of government institutions. This gap is further widened by scant awareness of
individual rights and duties. Government will pay close attention to prevent subordinating
social programs to vested interests or allowing them to be used as instruments of
patronage, thus corrupting their original intent.
Individual rights are protected under the Constitution and promoting and respecting them
are a State responsibility. Consequently, social programs will be established on the basis
of respect for such rights to give every Peruvian citizen the option to shape his own future
and know his entitlements. Such entitlements should be preserved, regardless of transitory
economic crisis or political transition (elections or other). Mechanisms should be put in
place so citizens can complain when their rights are infringed.
The Govermnent of Peru will foster consensus-built and explicit social commitments with
Peruvian citizens. It will articulate the services and programs to be delivered and to whom,
as well as the improvements in social programs, explaining the conditions required to be
included as program beneficiaries. These commitments and requirements will be made
public and the appropriate mechanisms will be put in place to channel and address citizen
complaints (citizens' watch, ad hoc prosecutors, ombudsman, user committees, right to
repeal goyemment officials, etc.)
9.   Empowering citizens and civil society
A viable social policy requires citizens to actively engage in policy implementation.
Therefore, the GOP will seek to involve and commit citizens to choose to become agents
rather than passive objects of social programs. Overseeing the proper use of public
resources, protecting individual rights, involvement in service management, and assessing
social programs imply that people are aware of and actively use their right to choose. An
empowered citizenry drives democracy building at different levels (national, regional and
local). Families and communities must be involved in managing schools and health
establishments, and in executing and implementing social programs. Several encouraging
experiences demonstrate the positive effect on social programs of greater citizen and civil
society institutions' empowerment.
82



10.  Strengthening local capacities
Stronger local capacities are critical to the extent they are directly related to creating
opportunities for the poor and empowering citizens. Strengthening local capacities is at the
center of the new poverty strategy that will create stronger local players to drive
community development.
Some objectives include:
* Creating a close link between job creation and local governments and actors with a view
to promoting development and equity, enhancing productivity and competitiveness,
and accomplishing the combined economic and social well-being of citizens.
* Participation in a strategic development plan that will nurture a vision of a sustainable
future for local development.
11.  Equity-based resource allocation
The large disparities typical of Peruvian society are well known. Equally well-known is
that public resources are less abundant in places of and for people with the greatest
needs. Moreover, inequalities have only grown deeper in recent years.
Public resources, and more significantly those for social programs, will from now on be
distributed with a criterion of equality. More resources will be assigned to the poorest
places and people. Advancing equity is a fundamental strategic tool for development,
democracy and peace. Although major technical challenges exist, there is also a firm
political decision to reduce the inequality gap.
.12.  Decentralization
Centmlized management has typically made social programs inefficient and ineffective.
Their effectiveness was reduced because they failed to respond to regional needs, while
their efficiency was hampered by goods and services procurement practices that
depended on centralized decision-making, poor timeliness and inappropriate quality.
Service decentralization is expected to render the following advantages:
* Services better adapted to local conditions.
* Services better adapted to local populations' needs.
* More options for people to register complaints about poor service.
* More direct social oversight of the service organizations' staffing and service quality
(as provided by schools, health facilities, etc.)
The key conditions for successful decentralization of social services include:
* Including social services in an overall decentralization strategy.
* Taking into consideration regional, provincial, district and community levels.
* Clearly establishing the functions to be performed by various government instances.
83



* Providing appropriate funding for sustained service supply.
* A parallel effort to strengthen management skills in decentralized government
agencies.
13.  Consensus building among stakeholders
Social policies are seen as the result of broader and more committed social involvement
that will require not only a change in attitude on the side of the State but also a stronger
civil society. Special attention must be paid to empowering the poor because otherwise
technical experts and the middle class, who enjoy greater powers to organize and defend
their interests, will dominate the debate.
The State must not substitute the work of other actors who play a role in the fight against
poverty, nor hamper the functioning of markets. Other players include NGOs, churches
and private business. In its relations with other organizations, the State must perform an
oversight role, protecting the interest of individuals and the citizenry at large. It must
also act as a facilitator and promoter for which purpose consensus building-in particular
locally-is paramount. A fundamental role will be played by the Poverty Struggle Round
Tables, and the forum they will provide for dialogue.
14.  Transparency in public resource management
Traditionally, government officials used public resources as their individual property, or
the property of small vested interest groups alienated from the majority of the people.
Information, in particular financial information, was undisclosed, shrouded by a veil of
secrecy, and available to only a privileged political or economic power elite.
This state of affairs persists in organizations that derive their resources from contributions,
such as social security.
To put the nation on a steady path to democracy and development, it is crucial to replace
such principles and practices for others based on the principles of democracy and civil
service. Public resources must be understood to be the property and interest of society at
large, and that consequently, information must be available to all citizens.

social programs from budgetary cuts in 2001 and to introduce an a social safety net to
be triggered by defined contingencies. On December 4, 2001, after continuing
discussions by the Mesas de Concertacion, the Toledo Government issued a revised
Letter of Social Policy 2001-2006 as a working paper. This revised Letter provides
more detail with respect to the empowerment of citizens and the objectives to be
realized in the nutrition, health and education sectors; gives increased priority, in
particular, to employment promotion; and states more clearly the need for better
coordination and integration of social programs.
The Interministerial Committee on Social Affairs (CIAS) is working closely with
MEF, which is also taking a more active interest and role than previously in the
monitoring of social priorities. The mandate of CIAS as a locus of coordination
among social ministries and agencies has been revitalized and is continuously being
strengthened under the Toledo Government.

directors of the five major anti-poverty programs listed above on a targeting strategy,
including the use of the new poverty map as well as other targeting indicators.
As a complement to the targeting strategy the National Budget Department of MEF
has issued a Directive,6' indicating that the monthly programming of expenditures
should be based, inter alia, on geographical criteria to increase the productivity of
public resource use, particularly with respect to the fight against poverty.

information on programmed and actual budgetary transfers and expenditures at the
provincial and district levels.
On December 14, 2000 the Office of the Public Ombudsman issued Resolution N°
067-2000-DCP, guaranteeing the political neutrality of the Ombudsman's staff and
directives for the supervising the State during the 2001 electoral process. The Office
also carried out a vigorous information campaign to establish its role as a channel for
citizens' complaints regarding the political use of social programs. This campaign
gave priority attention to women, native communities, the disabled, and former
victims of political violence. A similar oversight role is expected to be played during
the 2002 regional and municipal elections.
A Task Force was created in February 2001 to design and implement a social control
mechanism intended to increase citizen oversight over social programs. The Task

learning of contents but development of capacities.
The Commission for a National Consensus on Education was created on January 15,
200163, and a final report was issued and published in the newspapers in September
2001. The Commission, comprised of a broad cross-section of stakeholders in the
education sector, was confirmed by the Toledo Government and continues to work
on questions related to the quality of education. In addition, a National Council on
Education, composed of recognized sector leaders, has been created as a consultative
group.
A Ministerial Resolution" was published on November 23, 2000, empowering
parents in rural areas to keep teacher attendance and to report non-compliance to
regional offices; and a Supreme Decree65 was published Feb. 13, 2001, regulating the
activities of educational centers and authorizing local school directors to take
decisions on the management of personnel and school resources. Workshops were
conducted in September and November 2001 to inform communities in the interior of
the country about the Decree and to solicit suggestions toward a strategy of
decentralization. More than 500 School Councils (Consejos Escolares) had been
inaugurated by end-2001. In addition, a pilot system for receiving complaints
regarding coruption and abuse of power within the educational establishment was
publicly launched on December 12, 2001. It is expected to be fully functional by
May 2002. The Ministry of Education has also signed a Convenio with the Office of
the Ombudsman to channel and achieve the rapid resolution of complaints.

A multisectoral Task Force (including, inter alia, MEF, the CMAN, and municipal

the reform of the Vaso de Leche Program within the context of a decentralization
strategy. A separate Task Force (including, inter alia, PROMUDEH, MEF, the

Annex 5: Civil Society Consultation Process Related to the Adjustment Loan
1. In the last years a process of consultation and dialogue has taken place in Peru although mechanisms
for participation have been largely ad-hoc. A bottom-up dialogue process, nonetheless, has long
been recognized as a legitimate process in the country. During the CAS consultations (1996 and
1999) civil society organizations and private sector associations including the Catholic Church have
participated actively.
2. As a follow-up activity to the 1998 Poverty Assessment, the World Bank decided to broaden its
country dialogue by convening a plural national dialogue on the challenges of poverty reduction in
Peru. Since that year, three National Poverty Fora have been held, involving a broad array of
individuals and organizations representing the government, private sector, civil society and the donor
community. In those Fora, the dialogues fostered a new spirit of collaboration and cooperation
among diverse development actors committed to poverty reduction and produced some insights into
sectoral priorities for poverty reduction projects.
3. For the Programmatic Social Reform Loan I, the Second Forum worked on a social agenda. The
main topic was on the access of the poor to basic services in education, health, nutrition, justice, water
and sanitation. Consultations were held around the country and in Lima. Four regional Fora (Piura,
San Martin, Cusco and Central region of Lima) and one National Technical workshop were carried
out for about six months. All in all more than 250 representatives were consulted and had the
opportunity to give their ideas and recommendations toward a social agenda in Peru. (see Chart A for
a summary of the organizations and topics of discussions). The recommendations of the regional
Fora can be summarized as follows:
*  Education - Orient resources to rural education; adapt basic education to include a multi-
cultural dimension connected to the language and daily life of poor rural people; improve
teacher performance and training; involve stakeholders, specifically parents and students, in
educational policy making; and decentralize.
*   Health - Include cultural dimension within health services to reach the poor based on their
traditional values and morals; organize networking mechanisms; develop a culture that
encourages pro-health behavior; and invest more in the delivery of services to the poor.
*  Nutrition - Orient food supplementation programs to incentives for income generation.
Eliminate the duplication of food and nutrition programs. Prioritize improved nutrition for
vulnerable groups, particularly pregnant women; disseminate information and practical
lessons for the preparation of meals with local products from the region; and increase
coordination with the private sector.
*  Access to Justice - Foster local mechanisms of customary law oriented toward conciliation
practices; develop dissemination, communication and information activities for learning
rights; attend innocents accused of terrorism, youth subordinated by military service and
harassment at local police stations; eliminate lack of documentation on imprisoned in joint
effort with Health, Justice and Internal Affairs Ministries; and decentralize justice,
information and legal public education.
*  Water and Sanitation-Work more closely with other institutions to promote education on
water usage and sanitation practices; support local organizations' institutional capacity
building; and facilitate coordination between the public and private sector on water
management.
108



4. Besides the Poverty Forum other civil society organizations promoted discussion and debate in social
on issues and topics. These included: (i) Foro Educativo an umbrella organization that includes 78
experts and implements an annual national consultation on education, bringing teachers, head of
schools, and NGOs with educational expertise (ii) Macro Regi6n Sur in Arequipa, initiative from the
private sector and municipalities for the discussion on social matters in the region (Arequipa,
Apurimac, Puno, Moquegua Tacna, Huancavelica, Cusco and fO) led by the Chamber of Commerce
of Arequipa, (iii) CONADES - the national social conference on development, led by the Catholic
Church and the ANC - the national organization of NGOs, that organized the biggest event in its
history, promoting participation of more than 1500 participants in the country, grassroots groups,
church and faith organizations, unions, students federations, neighborhood groups, women and youth
associations, peasants "campesinos", among other organizations, for a wide discussion of Peru's
future in the aspects of new ethics, values, social, political and economic; (iv) local assembly for local
development led by the Municipalities in coordination with the Regional Office of the Ministry of the
Presidency under the program of PROFINES; (v) indigenous peoples and Afro-Peruvian consultation,
where recommendations and work plans were developed to improve their lives and status.

Annex 8: Education Sector Issues
1. Low effective hours of instruction. About 90% of rural primary schools are small multigrade schools
in isolated communities with harsh physical and environmental conditions which make it difficult to
attract well-prepared teachers. Rural schools are generally the point of entry for new teachers into the
education system, suffer high turnover, and tend to remain with the least effective teachers. Teacher
housing is rudimentary, if it exists at all, and teachers often leave their schools for distant towns on the
weekends, running the risk of not arriving back on time for class, or having to leave before the end of the
school week, because of extremely limited transportation. At a minimum, teachers must travel to the
provincial capital once a month to pickup their paychecks and needed supplies for the school, forcing
them to leave classrooms unattended at least several days a month. These factors, combined with student
absenteeism linked to climatic conditions and families' need for children's labor all contribute to very low
effective hours of instruction in rural areas.
2. IIl-adapted curriculum and teaching methods. Although Peru has made strong efforts to ensure that
the primary curriculum is relevant to children in rural areas, teachers are not trained in multi-grade
teaching methods, and students lack the self-paced instructional materials that are essential for
effective learning in multi-grade schools. The centralized teacher deployment system fails to ensure
that teachers can speak the local language and deliver bilingual education in the early grades, another
demonstrated strategy for improving rural education quality. Drop out rates in rural areas are 11.4
percent, far higher than 4.8 percent found in urban areas. An estimated 63 percent of Quechua-
speaking children, are over-aged, compared to 50 percent of all children.
3. Poor teacher quality and motivation. The formal level of qualifications of Peru's teaching force is
relatively high: some 67.3% of teachers hold tertiary education degrees. Pre-service teacher training
in Peru is also a relatively long 5 year program. However, the average quality of Peru's teachers is
considered relatively low (compared with elsewhere in Latin America), for four key reasons:
a) Unregulated and low quality pre-service preparation. There are no accreditation standards for
Peru's 350 teacher training institutes and the majority of them are generally acknowledged to be
of extremely low quality. Entry requirements are low, the curriculum is highly theoretical, with
little grounding in classroom practice (no courses to prepare students are for multigrade teaching,
for example) and students have no systematic opportunities for internships in schools as student
teachers, which is an essential part of training in most OECD countries. Only 7% of the faculty in
teacher training institutes have any graduate training and only 18% hold undergraduate-level
degrees in any content areas (mathematics, physics, history, language) besides education.
b) Low standards for entry into the profession. There are no fornal standards for teachers in Peru
or systematic certification/re-certification processes. Recruitment examinations were introduced
in 1998, but these assess teachers' conceptual knowledge only and not pedagogical ability,
methodological skills, interpersonal and team skills or community orientation. Since the 18,000
teacher training graduates currently being produced annually are well in excess of the Ministry's
new hiring requirements (roughly 2,000 net new teachers per year are needed), there exists
considerable scope for the Ministry to elevate teacher standards, by introducing new teacher
certification and re-certification procedures.
c) Law pay and incentives. The average teacher salary in Peru is approximately 1.1 times GDP
per capita, which is relatively low for Latin America, even after adjustment for average hours of
work, which are lower for teachers than in other professions. The salary scale is also quite
compressed, with average pay in the highest teacher category only 1.4 times that of the starting
116



pay level, compared with a good practice ratio of at least 5:1. There are no salary adjustments or
other incentives for teaching in rural areas or other hardship posts, which results in a high share of
schools in rural and low-income urban areas operating with teacher shortages, even though the
system-wide student :teacher ratio is a relatively low 26:1 at the primary level, which suggests
that the overall quantity of teachers is adequate.
d) Poor teacher deployment and supervision. Teacher deployment is highly centralized and,
although some 30% of teachers have a mother tongue that is not Spanish, there has been no policy
to date of deploying teachers geographically in line with their language skills, nor are there any
salary incentives for bilingual teaching. Teachers, especially in rural areas, receive little or no
performance evaluation or support. Visits from the local USE are few and far between and career
development plans and in-service training opportunities are limited. De facto, teachers face
neither positive incentives for good performance nor the threat of sanctions for poor performance.
4. A highly centralized and bureaucratic apparatus which lacks focus on the school .The central
Ministry of Education (MED) shares the responsibility for nationwide provision of educational
services (from preschool to tertiary non-university education) with 24 Regional Education
Directorates (DRE), which vary considerably in terms of geographic size, school system
development, and student populations, ranging from Lima, with over 2.1 million students, to Madre
de Dios, with less than 29,000 students. Each DRE is headed by a director (named by the Director of
the CTARs). Between the DREs and the school level are sub-regional offices of two types 81
Educational Service Units (USEs), which are administrative oversight offices with budgetary
authority, and 187 Education Development Areas (ADEs), which are supposed to focus on
educational supervision and support, and which do not have budgetary authority.
5. Top-down initiatives emanate regularly from MED with little concern for prioritization, avoiding
duplication, and the difficulties of administering cascading requests for information or action at the
regional, sub-regional and school levels. At the Directorate level, there is little autonomy and
accountability for the performance of the schools in their region. Data on school performance and
student learning are not organized and monitored at the DRE level, and DREs are neither rewarded
nor sanctioned for their progress in improving educational indicators over time. Although some
DREs are apparently more innovative and effective than others the Ministry appears to lack
instruments for disseminating effective approaches or intervening where failure is persistent. There
are also clear problems at the USE/ADE level, which is marked by confusing geographic and
functional demarcation of responsibilities, inadequate staffing and equipment for their missions, and
low value added to schools. The Ministry recognizes that, particularly in rural settings, the USEs and
ADEs have generally been ineffective in reaching the schools, and often characterized by a
bureaucratic and punitive orientation, rather than seeing themselves as a source of support.
6. School development planning is not undertaken systematically, plans where they exist are not
resourced, and there are no instruments for holding schools accountable for implementing
improvements. Schools have no budgetary autonomy, and cannot even undertake minor purchases or
repairs. Parents are invited to serve on parent-teacher bodies (APAFAs), but these have no formal
role in school personnel or other decisions and many operate only perfunctorily. In short, in contrast
to the growing number of Latin American countries which are strengthening budgetary and decision-
making, and accountability for results at the school level while simultaneously strengthening key
normative and assessment functions at the Ministry (or system) level, the education system in Peru
remains quite centralized and the focus on school level results is weak.

Annex 9:
System of Social Accountability of Anti-Poverty Programs
"Social Accountability" is the term for actions carried out by the public to monitor compliance with its
rights. The basis for social accountability for anti-poverty programs is the public's participation and the
development of its capacities to instill processes of democracy and transparency into government actions,
especially those within the Anti-Poverty Programs.
One objective of the Sistema de Vigilancia Social (SIVISO) - System of Social Control is to develop a
culture of public scrutiny so that public service management is transparent. In this way, the public can
directly participate in Social Accountability of programs that attack poverty.
The process of developing Social Control requires:
>  Promoting direct and organized participation of the public in the supervision and monitoring of the
public sector, contributing to empowerment.
>  Fostering democratic and efficient processes in the public sector and transparency in sharing
information.
>  Developing agreements between the relevant institutions and social actors for Social
Accountability.
The implementation strategy of SIVISO has five components: Promotion, Training, Participation,
Information and a system for registering Complaints. Related specific actions include:
> Building capacity of grassroots social organizations and of civil society to take part in social
accountability actions.
>  Building capacity of local government and local organizations to coordinate and harmonize their
work, and for the central government to execute its social programs in a more transparent manner.
>  Opening channels of communication between program beneficiaries and executing agencies for a
satisfactory project implementation.
From the experience with consultation of different social actors, there are certain participatory processes
that stand out, These have taken place among the population of 27 communities in the departments of
Ayacucho, Huancavelica and Apurimac. The specific role of each actor in social accountability is as
follows:
118



Social Actor                            Functions
Ombudsman's Office       Leader of the System of Social Accountability.

Poverty                   Responsible for ensuring participation, coordination and
harmonization with all agencies involved with SIVISO.

Organized groups (citizen  Monitor, supervise, register and provide information on the
"watchdogs")             development of social programs
Media                     Dissemination of information collected by SWISO
Contribute to Social Accountability, increasing the public's
Culture of Accountability
The participation and willingness to maintain dialogue consistently is one of the integral aspects of
SIVISO. These elements are fundamental for its sustainability and good functioning over time.
The axis of the system are the citizens whose leadership and commitmnent will promote the development
of their communities. Their willingness to participate has been an explicit part of participatory processes.
The growth of their awareness of public matters depends on a process of consciousness-raising and
training that those involved in the welfare of their communities will take part in over the long-term.
SIVISO's success depends on an adequate strategy of dissemination, which when implemented properly
will result in a public that is informed, interested and willing to participate in monitoring of social
programs. This involves communicating to the public that they have the right to monitor and supervise the
actions and resources intended for them. This reinforces the exercise of democracy and increases the
transparency and efficiency of social programs.
In the process of creating SIVISO, the public should verify if the tasks, activities and objectives of a
project have been completed in the intended manner and timeframe. The public should also detect the
difficulties that have emerged and take measures to solve them in a timely manner. At the same time, the
State should promote democratic and transparent processes in its actions that would achieve the goals of
the Social Programs to Attack Poverty. These processes would help to combat patronage, nepotism and
corruption and to establish clear rules on the management of public funds.
SIVISO is an instrument of democracy, that allows each citizen to obtain information and accounts of the
institutions that execute social programs. In addition, citizens can express their opinions, present their
observations and monitor the anti-poverty programs of the government. The database of the system will
add to the timely information available on social programs, including at the district level. It will also
permit the public to evaluate programs using indicators specially designed for SIVISO. The system
functions on the Internet, on a webpage designed to register information on the programs as well as the
processes for public consultation.
119



The specific indicators for social accountability emerge from the process of the public's empowerment in
this process and from the commitment of the social programs in the first phase of SIVISO", from the
availability of information to the public and in the framework of the implementation of mechanisms for
institutional transparency. The actions undertaken by the public to monitor these programs involve five
indicators for each of the programs:
>   The indicator for monitoring of management (IVG in Spanish), that summarizes the capacity of the
public to execute community programs.
>   The indicator for monitoring of Efficiency (IVE in Spanish), that summarizes public opinion on the
level and quality of the factors and resources employed in execution.
>   The indicator for monitoring of transparency (IVT in Spanish), that evaluates the accessibility, utility
and opportunity for information on social programs to reach the public.
> The indicator for satisfaction (IVS), that evaluates the benefits of the program, the conduct of the
officials in executing institutions, the quality of service providers and the manner in which they
respond to suggestions and the availability of accounts. It also incorporates the self-perceptions of
grassroots organizations in their own accountability while executing programs.
>   The indicator of critical factors (IVFC), to detect clientalism, favoritism, nepotism and other factors
that relate to poor management practices. This indicator evaluates these critical factors as they relate
to public complaints, bribes, political favoritism and discrimination.
The future of SIVISO stems from the willingness of the State to propel forward the processes of
democratization and transparency in its actions, especially with regard to the Social Programs that attack
poverty. Future actions can be established in phases, each of which builds on the next. This juncture is
positive, in view of the attitude and positive response of the public, especially in the poorest areas, the
agencies that execute programs, the dialogue that has taken place, the involvement of the office of
Ombudsman and other civil society actors.
