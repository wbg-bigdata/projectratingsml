INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
ZAIRE FOR A THIRD DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Zaire for the equivalent of US$10.0
million on standard IDA terms for a third development finance company proj-
ect. The proceeds of the Credit would be relent to the Societe Financiere
de Developpement (SOFIDE) at 7.25 percent for a period not exceeding 15
years.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Recent Economic Developments and Prospects of
the Republic of Zaire" was circulated on May 7, 1973 (AE31a - 2 Vol.). It
discusses the economic developments of the last few years and outlines the
longer term issues facing Zaire. A country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
Recent Economic Developments
3.        The problems which Zaire faced for five years after independence
were probably the most intractable of those facing any developing country.
Since 1965, howe'rer, the Government has implemented some far-reaching meas-
ures of economic stabilization and reform. Although substantial progress
has been made to restore conditions conducive to development, much still
remains to be done. What lies ahead is the challenge of altering the funda-
mental economic and social institutions of Zaire to adapt them to the demands
of a growing and modernizing nation.
4.        Zaire has a dual economy: the modern sector, centered around
copper and some manufacturing industry, and the traditional sector employ-
ing most of the population and consisting largely of subsistence farming.
Copper accounts for more than 20% of GDP, about 70% of merchandise exports
and about half of Government revenues. This dualism has its advantages as
well as disadvantages. Copper provides the much needed foreign exchange
and revenue for development expenditure. It is largely on account of the
large revenues flowing from the copper sector that Zaire was able to maintain
an investment rate of about 30% of GDP during the late sixties and early
seventies and an economic growth rate of about 10% in 1969 and 1970. The
substantial flow of foreign exchange and Government revenues from copper in
the years of high price, while permitting a high level of investment partic-
ularly in infrastructure, nevertheless permitted the Government to postpone
consideration and implemention of some of the crucial measures to diversify
the economic base, particularly by increasing agricultural production and
rural employment. Thus, while during 1968-71, manufacturing industry grew
at about 12%, commercial agriculture grew only at 2.7% and subsistence
agriculture by about 2%. As a result, food imports increased from $38
million in 1968 to $75 million in 1971.



-2-
5.        Beginming in the middle of 1970, there was a substantial decline
in the world copper price which, until earlier this year, was 30% below the
high level attained in 1969. The decline in copper price confronted the
Government with a situation for which it was not prepared. The growth rate
slowed down to 5% in 1971 and the surplus in the current account of the
budget was sharply reduced. A substantial gap appeared in the balance of
payments and both in 1971 and 1972 the Government had to resort to large
scale borrowing, particularly in the Eurodollar market, to fill its balance
of payments and investment financing gaps. In 1969 and 1970, the surplus
of current revenues over expenditures was of the order of $100 million per
annum, while in 1971 it was a mere $19 million. The Government, however,
reacted quickly to prune current expenditures and the surplus was increased
to $50 million in 1972. The situation is expected to improve further in
1973 and later years.
6.        Similarly, on the current account of the balance of payments,
Zaire had a surplus of about $50 million per annum. in 1968 and 1969, which
turned to a deficit of $18 million in 1971 and more than $200 million in
1972. A slowdown in the rate of investment, measures taken to limit imports,
and a substantial increase in the copper price, should lower the deficit in
1973 and later years.
Economic Objectives
7.        Although Zaire does not yet have a detailed official development plan,
the Government has prepared a number of guidelines as a preliminary framework
for economic policies. They were presented at the first meeting of the Con-
sultative Group organized by the Bank, in May 1971, and confirmed with increased
emphasis at the second meeting of the Consultative Group, in November 1973;
they can be summarized as follows:
(a) Establishment of a strong central authority to transcend regional
and tribal rivalries, and to promote national identity and unity.
(b) A rate of growth in domestic product of about 6% annually in the
next few years.
(c) Improvement in the management of the economy through reorganiza-
tion of existing institutions and procedures, creation of. new ones, and
progressive replacement of expatriates by nationals.
(d) Prevention of food shortages in urban centers by increasing agri-
cultural production while reducing food imports.
(e) Development of the poorest areas of the country, particularly
the Kisangani region in the northeast; greater emphasis orn growth of the
regions other than the two existing growth poles of Kinshasa and Lubumbasi,
the center of the copper region of Shaba.



-3-
Constraints to Development
8.        The first and by far most significant constraint to economic
development ir, Zaire is the scarcity of qualified manpower. This problem
must be viewed in a historical perspective. At independence there were
fewer than twenty university graduates, and less than three percent of
secondary school age children were enrolled in school. Over the last
twelve years, Zaire has made substantial progress in this respect, but
there is still a dearth of local skills, especially at top and middle
management levels. Many institutions cannot be staffed properly, pro-
cedures are not well established, and in many areas rules and regulations
have to be elaborated or improved. The lack of adequate administration and
management is most visible in development planning, since the scarce com-
petent officials are too involved in day-to-day operations to be able to
provide guidance on long-term policies.
9.        The second constraint to development is the fact that Zaire's
development hitherto has depended on a very narrow base. The modern sector,
benefitting from the copper boom, has grown rapidly and much of the Govern-
ment's emphasis has been on investments which benefit the urban middle
classes and modern industry. However, this sector by itself cannot pro-
vide the basis for sustained economic growth. Agriculture, which provides
employment and income for 70% of the population, has remained stagnant and
its growth is important, not simply to provide food for the cities and raw
material for industry, but also to provide the market for industrial pro-
duction and improve the income and welfare of the major part of the popula-
tion. The institutional, planning and manpower constraints in rural devel-
opment will impinge increasingly on Zaire's development. In addition, the
lack of adequate transport infrastructure remains a major constraint to
development.
10.       Lack of financial resources emerged as a constraint as the
copper price declined. Between 1968 and 1970, when the copper price
was rising, the Government was able to finance about half of the substan-
tial public investment program with its own resources and the balance by
external financing. Public investment doubled in current prices in this
period. In 1971, when copper prices and receipts were lower, foreign
capital inflow was the source of finance for 86% of the investment program.
In the future, any sizeable investment program will probably need to be
assisted by substantial capital inflow along with domestically mobilized
public and private savings.
Plans and Priorities
11.       With the emergence of the resource constraint, there is a growing
realization within the Zairian Government of the need for more sharply
focused priorities, for formulation of a long-term development program, for
planning of specific projects and for mobilization of suitable external
assistance. A Planning Group has been organized in the Bureau of the



Presidency and simultaneously, planning cells are being organized in the
Departments of Agriculture, Transport and Education. Various agencies,
including the Bank Group, are considering assistance for this. The Govern-
ment has given the highest priority to the development of agriculture. At
the same time, it wishes to emphasize the development of transport and
education to ease some of the major constraints to economic development.
12.       Copper is the backbone of the economy and the ongoing investment
program of the Government-held company, GECAMINES, is expected to increase
production from 400,000 tons in 1971 to 600,000 tons in 1980. Furthermore,
the investment programs of two mining companies, Sodimiza and Tenke-
Fungurume, should add 210,000 tons to production in the latter years of the
70's. In connection with the planned increases in production, studies are
being made and financing is being arranged to expand the generating capacity
of the Inga power complex from 150 megawatts to 425 megawatts in 1980, and to
construct a transmission line to the copper producing Shaba region.
13.       In sum, Zaire is undergoing a major transition from relatively
easy resource position and loosely defined priorities, to a tighter re-
source position and an attempt to sharpen priorities. The Government in-
tends to produce a long-term investment and financing plan by the middle of
1974.
Prospects for the Future
14.       Zaire's economic prospects depend to a considerable extent on
future developments in the production and the international price of copper.
As already indicated, investments which will substantially expand production
in Zaire are now being made. The price outlook for the medium term at least
is not unfavorable. The resources so provided plus foreign assistance should
permit the conduct of a substantial investment program which will expand
copper production and at the same time accelerate the utilization of Zaire's
extensive agricultural resources, and expand educational, transport and other
economic and social infrastructure facilities.
15.       Preliminary estimates indicate that such an investment program may
require gross capital inflow during 1974-1978 of approximately $1,400
million. Given this inflow and approximately the same terms as in the
recent past, the debt service ratio, which was 6.2% in 1972, would probably
increase to about 13% in 1974 and 17.5% in 1978. IDA's share in Zaire's total
outstanding debt is now about 6%. In view of the country's low per capita
income, the projected rapid increase in debt service and uncertainties with
respect to copper prices, it seems desirable that much of the assistance
should be on soft terms. Annex I (page 3) includes a table giving the
sources and amounts of external assistance to Zaire in recent years.



-5-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ZAIRE
16.       Bank Group assistance to independent Zaire started in 1969.    In
the first phase, we concentrated on the transport sector, where, because of
years of inadequate maintenance, rehabilitation was essential for any de-
velopment effort.   The first IDA credit, together with a UNDP grant, financed
technical assistance for highway administration along with materials and
equipment required for the beginning of highway rehabilitation. A 1971 IDA
credit financed rehabilitation of river transport facilities and institutions,
and a 1972 credit carried forward the program of rehabilitation of highway
physical and management facilities. In addition in 1970 and 1971 initial
small credits were made to finance a first project in education and to launch
the Development Finance Company for which a third credit is now proposed.
17.       Institution-building has been a major objective of IDA activity
in the several sectors aided to date. The development finance company,
SOFIDE, was established with assistance from IDA and IFC, and is designed
principally to help finance private industrial enterprises. The one educa-
tion project to date is directed toward technical education and teacher train-
ing, and, with UNDP financing, provides for a manpower survey which will
furnish some data necessary for a review of the Zairian educational system.
The river transport and second highway projects assisted in the setting up of
new or reorganized management and operation agencies and included substantial
technical assistance for the purpose.
18.       Total IDA lending to date has amounted to seven credits totalling
US$62.0 million. In addition, in 1969, the Bank made a grant of US$200,000
to finance part of the cost of technical assistance for planning. IFC has
made a US$750,000 investment in SOFIDE. Annex II contains a summary statement
of IDA credits and of the IFC investment, as of October 31, 1973, and notes on
the execution of on-going projects.
19.       Most of the IDA projects in Zaire have been difficult to implement.
Five credits were firsts in their respective subsectors. In four of them,
we helped establish new institutions, SOFIDE, the Bureau of Roads, river
transport agencies, and the National Ranch Development Authority. Projects
in transport have lagged, partly because of the shortage of experienced and
skilled personnel, difficulties in the recruiting of key technical assistance
personnel, and slow decision-making by the government authorities on procure-
ment matters, and on the implementation of the organizational reforms needed.
These problems are gradually being overcome, and we expect progress in the
future to be better than in the past. The education project is now progressing
satisfactorily, after delays caused by a lack of familiarity with Bank Group
procurement procedures. The two SOFIDE projects have, on the other hand, been
expeditiously executed and the credits have been disbursed as planned.



- 6 -
20.       For the future, the Bank Group hopes to help Zaire in easing the
constraints to economic development and fostering a balanced growth of the
economy. An immediate objective iS to assist in the establishment of more
effecti..ve mechanisms for the planning and execution of development programs
and projects. Under the technical assistance for planning referred to in
paragraph 18, the Bank together with the French government and the Zairian
government financed a team of 5 experts, who assisted in the elaboration of
the Government's medium and long-term economic objectives and the definition
of sector priorities. The work of that team terminated in January 1972.
The Government of Zaire has asked the Bank and the UNDP for assistance in
establishing a permanent planning structure and Zairian planning capacity
at the national and regional levels and a technical assistance grant for
this purpose is being presented for your consideration.
21.       A second objective is to ease the severe shortage of trained man-
power by assisting in the expansion and improvement of education, especially
technical and agricultural education.
22.       A third objective, in accordance with the Zairian Government's own
priorities, is to widen the range of production, employment and export.
Towards this end, we plan to increase our assistance in the preparation of
specific agricultural projects. The Livestock Development Project, signed
in June, 1973, includes a heavy technical assistance component for this pur-
pose. We also plan continued assistance in transportation designed to facil-
itate marketing of agricultural products as well as of minerals.
PART III - THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
23.       In 1969-70, the manufacturing sector grew at the rate of about
15%. In 1970, value added in this sector amounted to about $100 million
or 5.5% of GDP. Mainly as a result of capacity constraints, the rate of
growth fell to less than 6% in 1971, but recovered slightly in 1972 to about
7.5%. In 1973, the rate of growth of the manufacturing sector is expected
to reach 11%. The Government of Zaire aims at an annual rate of growth of
about 10% for the sector during the 1973-80 period.
24.       The manufacturing sector is producing mainly for the domestic
market, in particular consumer goods. Most manufacturing firms are privately
owned and under foreign control. In recent years, the Government has been
seeking to increase the production of intermediate goods, through public in-
vestments in steel and cement production. The Government is also promoting
Zairian enterprise by means of new legislation expected to encourage small
industries. A new institution - Office de Promotion Industrielle - is being
set up for this purpose.



-7-
25.       Manufacturing activities are concentrated heavily in the Bas
Zaire-Kinshasa and the Shaba regions. The Government aims at a more even
geographical distribution but so far no concrete steps have been taken in
this direction. The Government declared, at the last meeting of the Con-
sultative Group, its intention to modify the Investment Code in order to
encourage a more even distribution of manufacturing activity, especially
favoring the Kisangani region.
26.       No reliable comprehensive data on annual investment in the manu-
facturing sector and on sources of financing are available; since its
inception in June 1969 to October 1972, the Investment Commission granted
advantages to investments having a capital cost of Z83 million in this
sector (Z22 million 1969-1970, Z24 million in 1971, Z37 million for the
first ten months of 1972). The most important investments were for expansion
and modernization of breweries, a textile plant, three vehicle-assembly plants,
a tire factory, three cement plants and a flour mill. All these projects
have been or are being implemented. About 70% of the new manufacturing
projects were located in the Kinshasa-Bas Zaire region.
27.       The eight commercial banks established in Zaire are allowed by the
Banque du Zaire (i.e., the Central Bank) to grant medium-and long-term financ-
ing for productive investments, provided that these loans are covered by time
deposits in proportions varying from 200% for three months deposits to 60%
for deposits for one year or more.   Minimum interest rates on time deposits
were increased in 1971 and now vary from 3.25% for 15 days to 12.5% for over
one year.  Banks' lending rates for medium-and long-term financing are not
controlled by the Banque du Zaire.   They now average 13-14%, except for
credits to agriculture and directly related activities, which are made at a
maximum of 6%. The outstanding amount of medium-and long-term financing of
commercial banks for productive investments increased from Z 13 million at
the end of 1971 to Z 22 million at the end of 1972.
28.       The Government's policy for the sector is implemented through two
sets of instruments: (i) the Investment Code of 1969 and (ii) tariffs,
credits, taxes, price control and labor legislation including minimum wage
legislation. These measures can be adjusted to particular objectives.
29.       The benefits of the Investment Code may be given to industries
for their new or expansion projects under two systems: the "general regime"
and the "conventional regime." The latter is reserved for very large invest-
ment projects considered to be of major importance to the country's develop-
ment. 'Advantages under both systems include exemptions from taxes on corpo-
rate profits (for the first five years of operations) and expatriate income,
exemptions from import duties for capital equipment, and guarantees for
repatriation of capital invested, interest and profits. Advantages granted
under the "general regime" are for a specified length of time, usually five
years. Benefits under the "conventional regime" are usually for longer
periods, and are agreed in each case. The code specifies that litigation



-8-
arising from foreign investments may be arbitrated, at the request of any
party, under the provisions of the International Convention for the Settle-
ment of Investment Disputes.
30.       The Investment Code established an Investment Commission within
the Department of National Economy and Industry to examine all project
applications; the Code enumerated a number of general economic criteria
fo. the assessment of the contribution of a project to the economy.    However,
the small staff of the Investment Commission has not been able to submit
the large number of applications to piroper scrutiny, and some of these proj-
ects have received extremely favorable advantages, such as practically
unlimited protection against foreign and local competition.
31.       The Investment Commission is now expected to be transferred from
the Department of National Economy and Industry to the Office of the Presi-
dency, and to be supervised by a High Council for Investments, consisting of
the State Commissioners for Finance, National Economy, Labor, the Governor
of the Central Bank and the Director of the Office of the Presidency. The
Government's objective in the change is to improve the degree of profession-
alism in the Investment Commission. The Bank should be able to provide some
technical assistance to the Investment Commission through the proposed tech-
nical assistance grant referred to in paragraph 20. One of the advisers tobe
provided to the Planning Service of the Office of the Presidency would be a
Project Evaluation Adviser. His terms of reference would include assistance
in improving preparation and appraisal of projects in the Office of the
Presidency and in various Ministries.
32.       The Zairian authorities continue to attach considerable importance
to attracting new foreign investors. Most foreign companies already estab-
lished in Zaire continue to invest for expansion or modernization of their
enterprises. Companies without previous experience in Zaire are often re-
luctant to invest except when granted exceedingly generous advantages under
the Investment Code as has happened in some cases in recent years. In the
future, the Government intends to follow a more selective policy, based on
improved assessment of the merits of each individual project, when granting
advantages to foreign investors. Investors already in Zaire, can be expected
to continue to modernize and expand their activities, especially in food
processing, agro-industry and tourism, which offer good opportunities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Societe Financiere de Developpement,
Zaire" (No. 223CK) is being circulated separately. A Credit and Project
Summary is provided as Annex III.



-9-
History of SOFIDE
34.       In 1968, the Bank examined the need for a development finance
institution in Zaire and concluded that there was substantial and unsatisfied
demand for medium and long-term finance for investment in manufacturing
industry, and that the establishment of a development finance company would
be justified. The Bank Group thereafter took an active part in the setting
up of such a company and made arrangements for a group of foreign investors
to participate with private investors and the Government of Zaire in its
share capital. SOFIDE was established in January 1970; the Bank Group
contributed a substantial share of SOFIDE's initial capital resources,
through an IFC equity investment of $750,000 and an IDA credit of $5 million,
both approved in May 1970. In August 1971, a second IDA credit for SOFIDE
was approved, for $10 million.
Capital Structure and Resources
35.       SOFIDE's share capital of Z 2 million is almost fully paid in;
arrears of Z 18,525 (0.9%) as of December 31, 1972, are in the process of
being eliminated. 30% of the share capital is held by private investors
in Zaire and 25% by the Government and the Central Bank. Private foreign
investors hold 26.25% of the capital, and IFC 18.75%. The Government granted
SOFIDE an interest-free advance of Z 1 million, which remains at the disposal
of SOFIDE during its entire life, and a long-term low interest (1% per annum)
loan of Z 2 million of which Z 0.6 million is presently invested in treasury
bills maturing up to December 1973. The proceeds of the $5 million first IDA
credit were relent by the Government to SOFIDE at an interest rate of 7% per
annum plus a commitment charge of 3/4% per annum on amounts authorized for
withdrawal but not yet withdrawn. The proceeds of the $10 million second
IDA credit are relent to SOFIDE at an interest rate of 7.25% per annum, with
the same commitment charge arrangement.
36.       To date, SOFIDE has obtained foreign loans totalling about Z 14.2
million. In addition to the Z 7.5 million equivalent provided by IDA in the
first two credits, SOFIDE was able to borrow Z 0.8 million from the European
Investment Bank (EIB); Z 1.0 million from the Societe Internationale Financiere
pour les Investissements et le Developpement en Afrique (SIFIDA); Z 3.75
million from the Societe Belge d'Investissement International (SBI) and
Z 1.15 million from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). Furthermore,
SOFIDE is to receive about Z 0.63 million in local currency from a Belgian
Government loan to Zaire. The average cost to SOFIDE of its foreign loans
is 7.3%.
Objectives of SOFIDE
37.       The objectives of SOFIDE are to provide finance and technical
assistance for the development of soundly managed enterprises in Zaire in
any productive sector of the economy, and to help foster the distribution



- 10 -
of industrial shareholdings and the growth of a capital market. Initially
its financing was to private enterprises alone. However, since the effect
of this limitation was to direct SOFIDE's financing predominantly to
foreign-controlled enterprises, SOFIDE's Board decided in December 1972 to
allow the financing of parastatal enterprises, provided that investments
in such enterprises were limited to 25% of SOFIDE's commitments.    IL'A and
IFC supported this change, and SOFIDE's Policy Statement was modified
accordingly.
38.       SOFIDE's continuing mandate is to work within the framework of
Government economic policies and to lend its assistance in the carrying
out of economically sound projects that will contribute to the development
of the Zairian economy, while offering adequate prospects of financial
viability and security. SOFIDE may invest in any form suitable to the
project. It may make medium and long-term loans, furnish guarantees,
invest in the share capital of enterprises, and subscribe to issues of
shares and other securities.
39.       SOFIDE's Board of Directors adopted in February 1970 a statement
of general policy, which was revised in March 1973. This statement covers
satisfactorily all important matters normally dealt with in such documents.
It is reproduced in Annex I of the Appraisal Report.
Board of Directors
40.       SOFIDE's present Board of Directors consists of 9 members:     3
designated by private Zairian shareholders, 2 by the Government and the
Central Bank, 3 by non-Zairian shareholders, and 1 by IFC. The Board met
five times in 1972.
41.       An Executive Committee, composed of three Board members, the
General Manager, the Principal Advisor and a former Board member, is em-
powered to approve individual loans of up to Z 150,000 and equity investments
of up to Z 50,000. It met 6 times in 1972 and is working satisfactorily.
Management and Organization
42.       SOFIDE's General Manager since its creation in 1970 was Mr. Guetta,
a Tunisian national seconded by the Bank, who was formerly Deputy General
Manager of the Societe Tunisienne de Banque. This secondment ended in
May 1973. A Zairian, Mr. Kazadi, formerly head of the Central Bank's Credit
Department, succeeded him as General Manager, and shares management responsib-
ility with Mr. Fortuit, a UNDP-financed expert recruited from the French
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). Mr. Fortuit has long
experience in development banking in Africa, and is Principal Advisor.
Messrs. Kazadi and Fortuit form an efficient management team.



43.       SOFIDE is divided into five departments, Appraisals, Execution
of Agreements, Economics, Engineering and Administration. All of these,
except the Engineering Department, are headed by able and dedicated Zairians.
The Director of the Engineering Department is an expatriate financed under a
UNDP Teclnical Assistance Project. A financial analyst, who is due to
join SOFIDE in late 1973 has also been recruited under the UNDP project, thus
completing the 3-man technical assistance team.
44.       As of May 1973, SOFIDE's operating staff totaled 51, of whom
18 were professionals. Of the latter, 16 are Zairian, most of them recent
university graduates with no previous experience in investment finance who
have benefited from training in Zaire or, for four of them, with CEFEB,
the training institution of CCCE. All have performed well so far, have
good potential, but are still relatively inexperienced. This staff, when
completed with the arrival of the UNDP-financed financial analyst in
late 1973, appears adequate to handle SOFIDE's operations over the next
two years.
Operating Policies and Procedures
45.       Appraisal.   The quality of SOFIDE's appraisal work is satisfactory.
SOFIDE's technical assessment of projects has improved since the second IDA
credit was granted in August 1971.   As regards SOFIDE's economic assessment
capacity, further improvements are necessary. In the context of sub-project
reviews and during supervision missions, IDA has worked with SOFIDE staff
to help develop SOFIDE's economic assessment capacity; also, the head of
SOFIDE's economic department recently spent three weeks with the Bank for
training in this area. SOFIDE has agreed to employ appropriate techniques
of economic evaluation and to incorporate them in its appraisal procedures.
46.       Follow-Up.   Because SOFIDE's portfolio is new, SOFIDE has not yet
started any systematic supervision activity. It plans to establish a regular
follow-up system, and specific arrangements have been made.
47.       Projects Approved.   By October 31, 1973, SOFIDE had approved 60
operations to 47 enterprises, for a total of Z14.8 million. In 1971, SOFIDE's
operations expanded rapidly with approvals amounting to Z6 million. In 1972,
however, approvals decreased to Z 2.4 million.    This was due partly to a deter-
ioration in the private investment climate as well as to the fact that SOFIDE
moved away from medium to longer term credits since medium term credits are in-
creasingly granted by commercial banks. Lack of sufficient technical assist-
ance to SOFIDE, which has now been provided, also played a role. Approvals in
the first ten months of 1973 amounted to Z 5 million, which is twice as much
as for all of 1972.
48.       As of October 31, 1973, loans represented 93% of SOFIDE's invest-
ments. Total investment in the projects financed by SOFIDE amounted to
Z 32 million, of which Z 21 million, or 68%, represented import requirements.
The main sectors of activities financed were:

The average size of operations was Z247,000, and 32% of the operations were
for projects related to the creation of new enterprises. The enterprises
assisted by SOFIDE were predominantly located in the West of Zaire, with
47% of total financing in the Kinshasa area and 17% in the Bas-Zaire region.
SOFIDE is trying to improve the regional distribution of its loans. Over
the same period, 25% of SOFIDE's assistance has been to enterprises which
are at least 50% owned by Zairians. This is a noticeable improvement over
the corresponding figure of 5% in August 1971 when the second IDA credit
was approved.
49.       The forecast weighted average economic rate of return of projects
approved to date under the second IDA credit is about 20%. The average cost
per direct job created was Z 13,547, but if modernization projects are ex-
cluded, the average cost was Z6,708 per direct job created.
50.       Financial Results.   In 1971, SOFIDE's net profit amounted to
Z 110,000 or 5.5% of the paid-in share capital. In 1972, after a provision
of Z 60,000 for possible losses, net profit was Z 129,000 or 6.5% of the
paid-in share capital. In 1972, SOFIDE distributed a 5% dividend. Adminis-
trative expenses remain relatively low. SOFIDE's portfolio appears sound
and well balanced among the industrial sectors, and SOFIDE's financial
position is strong.
51.       Lending Terms.   When SOFIDE was established it represented a new
element in a financial market where, except for suppliers' credits, medium or
long-term credit was limited. Given all the uncertainties of an untried mar-
ket it was decided that SOFIDE would charge 10% on its credits, with the Govern-
ment receiving 7.25% and assuming the foreign exchange risk. Since that time
market rates have moved upwards slightly and SOFIDE increased its rate to 10.5%.
Alternative credit sources in Zaire range in cost from about 7-8% on suppliers'



- 13 -
credits to 13-14% for commercial bank credit. These rates apply in an enviroi-
ment where price increases are now in the region of 7% p.a. On balance, there
is at present an element of subsidy in SOFIDE's rates and to move SOFIDE closer
to what might be considered the market it was agreed that under the proposed
credit SOFIDE would (with the exception of smaller Zairian enterprises having
total assets under Z 150,000) either pass on the foreign exchange risk to sub-
borrowers or - at the option of the sub-borrower - charge a 1% foreign exchange
risk coverage premium (i.e. a total cost of 11.5%) which will be transferred
to the Government in addition to the 7.25% interest.
52.       Operational Prospects.   Since December 1972, SOFIDE has been autho-
rized to lend to the parastatal sector. To date, there is no clear indica-
tion of the potential volume of SOFIDE's business with this sector, although
it may be substantial. Another factor which may increase SOFIDE's voltume of
business is the recent legislation to assist Zairian enterprise. A promotion
office, OPEZ, has been established for that purpose, and will be able to
provide assistance to Zairian entrepreneurs and, through a guarantee fund,
some financial support. SOFIDE and OPEZ are expected to cooperate on a
number of projects. On the other hand, the proposed establishment of SOFIDAG,
a development bank that would support medium and large-scale agriculture and agro-
business ventures, could affect SOFIDE's financing of agriculture related projects.
SOFIDE is expected to invest in SOFIDAG, which is being sponsored by SOFIDE
together with bilateral aid agencies (CCCE, CDC and DEG). On balance, the
prospects for a continued increase in SOFIDE's volume of activity are good.
Forecast of Operations and Resource Requirements
53.       In 1973, SOFIDE is expected to approve projects totaling Z 8
million. A similar amount is forecast for 1974, and the total amount of
investments approved is forecast to increase to Z 9 million in 1975, and by
Z 1 million a year through 1977. It is expected that 92.5% of total financ-
ing will be loans and the balance equity investment. Of the loans, 75% would
be to finance the import component of projects.
54.       From CY 1973 to 1975, SOFIDE is expected to have Z 15.5 million
available for commitment, of which Z 8.9 million would be in foreign resources.
The latter consist of Z 4.0 million uncommitted as of June 30 under the second
IDA credit (but likely to be fully committed by early 1974), and Z 4.9 million
from other external sources (KfW and SBI). On the basis of the projected
operations (see para. 53), SOFIDE will require Z 23.4 million over the same
period, of which Z 15.8 million will be in foreign resources. The resource
gap for that period therefore amounts to a total of Z 7.9 million, of which
Z 6.9 million is in foreign resources. The proposed credit of $10 million
(Z 5 million) would therefore cover about 70% of SOFIDE's foreign resource
gap over the period, and 30% of its total resource needs for the 1974-1975
period. The remainding small gap in foreign exchange (about US$2 million)
is expected to be covered through further borrowing from foreign lenders
such as EIB, KfW and SBI.

Financial Projections
55.       Projections of cash flows, income statements and balance sheets
based on the above forecasts of SOFIDE operations indicate adequate debt
service coverage and a sound financial structure. Profits are projected
at Z 270,000 for 1973, or 9.4% of average net worth, 12.2% in 1974 and
15.5% in 1975. The provision for bad debts, set at Z 60,000 in 1972, will
rise to Z 124,000 in 1973, Z 192,000 in 1974 and Z 291,000 in 1975. These
levels are adequate. SOFIDE expects to recommend a dividend of 6% (Z 3.0
per share. in 1973, and of 7% in 1974 and 1975, which compares to 5% in
1972, the first year in which SOFIDE distributed a dividend. Projected
dividends over the period until the end of 1975 represent 45.6% of projected
Disl,ursement
':*       The proposed credit would finance the c.i.f. cost of imported
goods, the foreign cost of auxiliary services, and the foreign component
of goods purchased locally and previously imported or of goods produced
locally from imported materials.
Onlending Terms
57.       The Government will lend to SOFIDE the equivalent of amounts
withdrawn at a rate of interest of 7 1/4% per annum. Now that it is well
established, SOFIDE no longer requires concessional treatment as regards
the commitment change, and a commitment charge of 3/4% will be payable by
SOFIDE on the undisbursed amount of the credit.
Free Limit
58.       For the second IDA credit, a free limit of $100,000 for individual
sub-loans not requiring IDA's prior approval was agreed upon, with an aggre-
gate limit of $2.0 million. Since very few projects have fallen under the
individual free limit in the past, the free limit has been raised to $150,000,
but the aggregate free limit has been maintained at $2.0 million.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Zaire and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and SOFIDE, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.



- 15 -
60.       The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits
for development finance company projects. The effectiveness of the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement is conditional upon the Project Agreement between the
Association and SOFIDE having been duly authorized and ratified; the Govern-
ment and SOFIDE having validly entered into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement In
form and substance satisfactory to the Association, and this Subsidiary Loan
Agreement having become fully effective.
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would colply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
62.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION - ZAIRE L
Gredit No. 152-CK  Technical Assistance - Highway Administration Project:
$6 million, of June 9, 1969; Closing Date: December 31! 1973
The project, financed jointly by the credit and a $1 .5 million
UNDP allocation, consisted of the provision of consultants'
serv.ces for the improvement of the highway administration;
the purchase of an emergency supply of spare parts, vehicles,
materials and maintenance equipment; and emergency maintenance
and rehabilitation work. After initial delays due to lack of
familiarity with Bank Group procurerent procedures, the project
progressed satisfactorily. 75% of the equipment has been
received and rehabilitation work is well advanced. Because
a contractor had financial difficulties and shortages of road
construction equipment, the closing date has been postponed
from January 15, 1973 to December 31, 1973.  A further post-
ponement of the closing date is being considered.
Credit No. 190-CK   Development Finance Company Project: $5 million, of May 28,
1970; Closing Date: October 31 , 1974
This first line of credit to SOFIDE, now fully committed,
enabled it to start operations on July 1 , 1970, with a
general manager seconded by the Bank.
Credit No. 255-CK  River Transport Project: $7 million, of June 21, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The project, based on UNDP-financed studies, consists of the
rehabilitation of navigational aids, dredging facilities and
equipment in the Zaire River estuary; the improvement of
navigation on the Kinshasa-Ilebo waterway; the rehabilitation
of the ONkTRA river fleet; the provision of experts to fill
key positions in ONATRA, RVM and RVF; and a study of the
Voie Nationale, the combination of rail and river links between
the mining areas of Shaba and the Zairian sea-ports. The
Voie Nationale study has been completed, and the final report
of the consultants received, and is under review. The river
agencies have been set up as semi-autonomous public bodies and,
although progress has been slow, substantial improvements
in the administration of ONATRA's ports and shipyard divisions
have been achieved, though further improvements in its operating
efficiency are still urgently needed. The selection of the ten
/1   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weakness in project execution.

experts to fill key positions in the river agencies has
been difficult; and suitable experts have still not been
found for two of the positions. All contracts for works
and equipment under the credit have now been awarded, but
the difficulties met in filling the key positions, and a
longer than expected procurement process, have delayed
completion of the project by one year.   A postponement
of the closing date is being considered.
Credit No. 271-CK   Second Development Finance Company Project: $10 million,
of September 24, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This second line of credit to SOFIDE came only one year
after the first, since SOFIDE's volume of operations was
three times that forecast. This credit was expected to
cover half of SOFIDE's expected commitments until mid-1973,
but because SOFIDE was able to attract funds from other
external sources, the credit will not be fully committed
until December 1973, A Zairian General Manager assisted
by an expatriate senior adviser replaced the Bank-seconded
General Manager in May, 1973.
Credit No. 272-CK   Education Project: $6.5 million, of December 1JJ 1971;
Closing Date: April 31  1 977
The project, designed to meet the priority needs for improvement
and expansion of teacher training and technical education,
consisted of rehabilitation and equipment for an upper secondary
teacher training college, a college for primary teacher trainers
and four technical secondary schools; construction and
equipment of a new demonstration secondary school and a new
technical teacher training college; and technical assistance
for a management study of the Department of Education.
Delays occurred initially due to lack of familiarity with
Bank Group procedures relating to the employment of
consultants. The project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Credit No. 292-CK   Second Highway Project: $19 million, of March 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project, based on studies financed jointly under Credit
152-OK and by the UNDP, was intended (i) to implement the
reorganization of highway management, by providing some
45 experts for two and one half years to occupy executive
positions at all levels of the new organization, (ii) to
assist the Bureau of Roads; to rehabilitate some of the high
priority roads and improve highway maintenance; and (iii) to
finance pre-investment studies expected to lead to a third
highway project. The project is jointly financed by IDA,
the UNDP, CIDA, FAC and USAID. Improvement of the Bureau of
Roads is suffering through repeated changes being made by the
Government in its organization as well as in the purpose of
its existence. Discussions with Government on this matter
have recently taken place in Kinshasa.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of h pages
A training program for road maintenance operational staff
is proceeding well. .A new expatriate Director General
has been appointed to the Bureau of Roads. As a result
of high bids to rehabilitate priority roads, tender documents
are being revised and new bids will be called shortly. A
contract for feasibility and detailed engineering studies
for important roads has been awarded and work is expected to
start soon. Xaintenance equipment for the Bureau of Roads
is now arriving and the Government will be loaning some of
this equipment to contractors and estate managements to carry
out road maintenance work.
Credit No. 398-CK   Livestock Development Project: $8.5 million, of June 21-
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
This project will develop three large government ranches
and establish a National Ranching Development Authority.
Also, the project provides assistance for the preparation
of further agricultural projects.
