SUMMARY
The Bank Group played a vital part in establishing SOFIDE in 1970
to financ3 productive sectors in Zaire; IFC subscribed 18.75% of its share
capital aad helped place 26.25% taken up by foreign institutions.  IDA provided
a credit of $5 million. SOFIDE's operations expanded rapidly in 1971 and a
second IDA credit of $10 million was granted.
ii.          In its first years of operation SOFIDE's lending largely consisted
of medium-term loans to foreign-owned enterprises. This situation has been
modified in 1972 and 1973. In particular, financing of Zairian-owned enterprises
noticeably increased last year and should develop further following SOFIDE's
Board's recent decision to finance parastatal enterprises.
iii.         SOFIDE's general management changed recently; the former General
Manager, a Bank staff member, was succeeded by a team consisting of a Zairian
general manager and a senior expatriate advisor. SOFIDE's staff has performed
well, but still needs guidance; an experienced financial analyst has been
hired to join the two other expatriate advisors to constitute the advisory
team financed by a UNDP project for which the Association is executing agency.
iv.          SOFIDE's project appraisals are reasonably good, but economic
analysis zapacity is weak and should be strengthened. Now that the portfDlio
has grown more systematic follow-up procedures need to be establisned.  Account-
ing and disbursement procedures are adequate, and reporting to IDA is now
satisfact ry.
v.           SOFIDE's portfolio is good and well balanced among productive
sectors. Its financial situation is strong. SOFIDE has already diversified
its resources and obtained loans from EIB, KfW, SIFIDA and Belgian public
institutions for a total of Z6.7 million. SOFIDE has been profitable since
its first year of operation;-profits in 1972 represented a return of 6.5% on
the share capital, and SOFIDE distributed a 5% dividend.
vi.          Future lending prospects are good.  Approvals should total Z8 million
in 1973. The second IDA credit will likely be fully committed by early 1974.
Projections of activity for 1974 onwards are difficult to predict with great
accuracy. SOFIDE's record has shown its sensitivity to investment climate
variations and potentialities concerning parastatal enterprises have not yet
been demonstrated. However, approvals totalling Z17 million for 1974 and 1975
- two thirds of SOFIDE's own forecast - have been projected, resulting in a
foreign currency resource gap of about Z7 million, of which a new IDA credit
of $10 million (Z5 million) would cover about 70%.



- vi -
vii.      During negotiations agreement was reached on further improvements
to be made in SOFIDE's appraisal work, particularly on economic analysis and
a senior member of SOFIDE's staff spent several weeks in the Bank for training
on this subject.
viii.     The proposed Credit would be onlent by the Zairian Government to
SOFIDE with an amortization schedule reflecting the schedules applied to sub-
projects, none of which should in principle exceed 15-years. SOFIDE would
charge 10.50% and pay to the Government an interest rate of 7.25% for its loans
made in local currency to small- and medium-scale Zairian enterprises (i.e. with
total assets not exceeding Z150,000). Other clients of SOFIDE will have the
option (i) either to borrow at 10.50% and take the foreign exchange risk, in
which case IDA funds will be passed on to SOFIDE at 7.25%, or (ii) to borrow in
local currency at 11.50X, with IDA funds being passed on to SOFIDE at 8.25/,
the 1% increase representing a premium transferred to the Government for the
coverage of the foreign exchange risk. SOFIDE would cease to be granted con-
cessional treatment on commitment charges; it would pay a commitment charge of
3A% on the undisbursed amount of the loan from the Government, starting 60-days
after the signature. The free limits for individual subprojects would be raised
from $100,000 to $150,000, with an aggregate limit of $2 million.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01         The Societe Financiere de Developpement (SOFTDE) was established
in 1970, following more than two years of preparatory work in which the Bank
Group played a vital part. The Bank Group was also instrumental in launching
the company: it helped place 45% of the company's capital: 18.75% was subscribed
by IFC and 2.6.25% by foreign institutional investors at the invitation of
the Bank Group; it supplemented SOFIDE's initial resources by granting in
May 1970 a first IDA Credit (190-CK) of $5 million; it seconded a staff member
to become the Director General of the Company and acted as Executing Agency
for a program of technical assistance by UNDP.  A second IDA Credit (271-CK)
of $10 million was granted in August 1971.
1.02         It is expected that SOFIDE's second IDA Credit will be fully com-
mitted by early 1974. This report reviews SOFIDE's performance and outlook
and recommends a third IDA Credit of $10 million.
II. ENVIRONMENT
The Economy
2.01         The Zairian economy is described in "Recent Economic Developments
and Prospects of the R-public of Zaire" (AE-31a, March 5, 1973).
2.02         Zaire, with a population of 19 million and GNP per capita of $90,
is endowed with more diversified resources than most African countries. After
the political turmoil of the early 1960's it has had a stable political situation
since 1965; however, the scarcity of qualified manpower at all levels in the
public and private sectors is compounded by the government policy to reduce
the number of expatriates and to reserve certain categories of jobs for Zairians.
Economic growth has been unbalanced, with a rapidly growing modern sector based
on the copper industry, which now accounts for about 20% of GDP; and a stagnant
agricultural sector accounting for 31% of wage employment and 19% of GDP. The
transportation network has not yet recovered from damage suffered in the post-
independence turmoil.
The Manufacturing Sector
2.03         The value added in the manufacturing sector amounted to Z51 million
in 1970, or 5.5% of GDP. It grew in real terms by 12% in 1969 and 19% in 1970,
while the real increase for GD? was 8% in 1969 and 10% in 1970. The growth
rate of value added in the manufacturing sector declined to about 6% in 1971,
mainly because of capacity constraints, but recovered in 1972 (7.5%), whilst
the overall economic slowdown kept GDP growth rate below 5% in 1971 and 1972.
The manufacturing sector is almost entirely directed to supplying the domestic
market. The composition of -value added in 1970 was as follows:

2.04         A survey published recently by the Department of National Economy
registered in 1970 a total of 530 enterprises with a modern accounting system
in industry; these enterprises employed permanently 108,000 persons (of which
3,000 non-African), and offered temporary employment to about 30,000 persons.
Most manufacturing firms are privately-owned and under foreign control, but
the Government seeks to promote Zairian enterprises and has itself taken majority
participations in new projects such as a steel mill and a cement plant. Forty-
two percent of registered enterprises were in the Kinshasa-Bas Zaire region,
and 27% in the Shaba region around Lumumbashi, the center of the copper industry.
2.05         No reliable data on annual investment in the manufacturing sector
are available; since its inception in June 1969 to October 1972, the Investment
Commission granted incentives for projects having a capital cost of Z83 million
in this sector (Z22 million 1969-1970 Z24 million in 1971, Z37 million for
the first ten months of 1972). Most important investments were expansion and
modernization of breweries and bottling plants, a textile plant, three vehicle-
assembly plants, a tire factory, three cement plants and a flour mill.  All these
projects have been or are being implemented. About 70% of the new manufacturing
projects were located in the Kinshasa-Bas-Zaire region where manufacturing activity
tends to concentrate.
Government Policies for Industry
2.06         The Government's industrial policy is implemented through the
Investment Code of 1969 and related legislation dealing with price antrols,
wages and tariffs.
2.07         The benefits of the Investment Code may be given to industries
for their new or expansion projects under two systems: the "general system"
and the "conventional system". The latter is reserved for very large investment
projects considered to be of major importance to the country's development.
Advantages under both systems include exemptions from taxes on corporate profits
(for the first five years of operations) and expatriate income, exemptions from



import duties for capital equipment, and guarantees for repatriation of capital
invested, interest and profits. Advalitages granted under the "general regime"
are for a specified length of time, uuually five years. Benefits under the
"conventional regime" are usually for longer periods, and they often provide
for prices to be set at a specified pe(rcentage above production costs, guarantees
that for a specified length of time tax conditions will not be modified,
guarantees against the granting of six ilar advantages to a competing company,
and possible protection against imoorz;s. The code specifies that litigation
arising from foreign investments may be arbitrated, at the request of any
party, under the provisions of the International Convention for the Settlement
of Investment Disputes.
2.08         Tariff protection has been increased in February 1972.  Import
duties now vary from 50% to 120% for luxury goods. They average about 50%
for goods competing with domestic production and about 20% for intermediate
and investment goods. Import controls are more important than tariffs as
a protective mechanism and are usually part of the incentive package granted
to investors. The corporate tax amounts to 40% of income. The Government
controls prices paid to producers both in agriculture and in manufacturing
industries. For new investments, the selling price is often calculated in
percentage of cost, leaving a profit margin of about 20% of cost. But most
prices have remained unchanged since 1967, resulting in many cases in a
considerable reduction of profit margins. Control of retail prices is less
effective. Labor legislation includes minimum wages legislation which can
be adjusted to particular objectives.
2.09         The Investment Code established an Investment Commission within
the Naticnal Economy and Industry Department to examine all project applications
for apprcval and granting of incentives; the Code enumerated a number of general
economic criteria for the assessment of the contribution of a project to the
economy. However, the small staff of the Investment Commission has not been
able to submit the large number of applications to proper scrutiny, and benefits
for the larger projects are sometimes decided outside of the Commission. Some
projects have received extremely favorable advantages, such as practically
unlimited protection against foreign and local competition.
2.10         The Bank has long sought to improve the quality of project
appraisal, by the Investment Commission. During negotiations of the second
IDA Credit to SOFIDE in June 1971, it was agreed that the Zairian Government
would request UNDP technical assistance for the Investment Commission with the Bank



- 4-
as Executing Agency. The State Commissioner for National Economy and Industry
sent a request to UNDP in March 1972, but due to limited funds UNDP could not
do more than renew for 1972-1973 the technical assistance already provided
by UNIDO to the Division of Investments of the Department for National Economy
and Industry (consisting of two engineers and a proposed financial analyst)
and to add an industrial economist to the team. Up to the present the Investment
Commission haE only had engineering assistance (two from UNIDO and two from
bilateral GernLan assistance). Effective u3e of technical assistance wE.s also
impeded for lEck of adequate leadership in the Investment Commission. The
situation should improve with the expected arrival of a financial analyst and
of an industrial economist.
2.11         TIhe Investment Commission is now expected to be transferred from
the Department for National Economy and Industry to the Office of the Presidency
and to be supervised by a High Council for Investments, consisting of the State
Commissioners for Finance, National Economy, Labor, the Governor of the Central
Bank and tIBDDirector of the Office of the Presidency. The Government's objective
in the change is to improve the degree of autonomy and professionalism in the
Investment Commission.
2.12         It should be possible for the Bank to provide some technical
assistance to the Investment Commission through the proposed Development
Planning Project which the Bank expects to implement in the near future.
One of the advisors to be provided to the Planning Service of the Office of
the Presidency would be a Project Evaluation Advisor. His terms of reference
would include improving preparation and appraisal of projects in the Office
of the Presidency and in various Ministries.
2.13         GTovernment attaches considerable importance to attracting foreign
investors. But whereas most foreign companies already established in Zaire
seem to find few difficulties in getting along with the Government and continue
to invest for expansion or modernization of their enterprises, new companies
are often relactant to invest in Zaire except when granted exceedingly generous
advantages unler the Investment Code. This might be explained in part by
uncertainties about futvire government policies, and by the fear of various
restrictions on the activity of foreign companies. Among recent measures that
have given concern to foreigners are: the reduction in the transferable amount
of salaries for expatriates, decided last December by the Central Bank as a
means to improve the balance of payments; and the reservation of trading
activities to Zairian nationals, except with special authorization (law of January
5, 1973).



- 5 -
2.14     Promotion of Small-Scale Zairian Enterprises. In addition to the
law mentioned above reserving trade activities to Zairian nationals, three
laws were passed on January 5, 1973, for the benefit of small and medium-
size Zairian enterprises. The first law establishes a promotion office
(Office de Promotion des Petites et Noyennes Entreprises Zairoises, or OPEZ);
the second makes such enterprises eligible for investment incentives similar
to those currently granted by the Investment Code. The third law institutes
a guarantee fund (Fonds de Garantie de Credits aux Petites et Moyennes Entre-
prises Zairoises, or FGEZ) which is not yet operating. OPEZ has recently
started operations. Its chief executive -was formerly SOFIDE's Chief of Operations
and OPEZ and SOFIDE have been discussing how they might work together. SOFIDE
has, in bhe meantime, put special efforts into developing its financing of
Zairian miedium-scale enterprises with considerable success.
2.15     Efficient but limited help, due to manpower and resource restraints,
has been given to Zairian enterprises by the Institut National de Preparation
Professionnelle (INPP) and the Association pour la Formation des Cadres de
l'Industrie et de l'Administration (AFCA) which work in collaboration with each
other (see Annex 14)
Financial Environment
2.16      Eight commercial banks with a total of 46 branch offices cover
virtually the entire country. The Banque Commerciale Zairoise (25.5% Govern-
ment and 25.5% Belgian Societe Generale de Banque) is by far the largest,
with depcsits accounting for more thal  60% of all commercial banks' deposits,
and 20 branch offices. The second largest is Banque du Peuple, controlled
by a multinational group of banks. The newest commercial banks are the Banque
de Kinshasa, almost fully Zairian-owned, wlhich opened for business in 1970,
the Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Occidentale (BIAO) and the First
National City Bank, which opened for business in the first part of 1971.
2.17      Until 1970, bank credit to the private sector was directly control-
led by the Banque du Zaire (i.e. the Central Bank) througlh a system of quanti-
tative ceilings. In 1970, agricultural crop credits became exempt from
direct control and a system of indirect control was introduced for credits
related to the financing of productive investments. Under this system,
medium and long-term financing of productive investment could be freely
granted by the banks provided that they were covered up to 75% by time deposits
of at least six months.  In 1971, this indirect control was further relaxed



by reducing the necessary cover as follows: coverage of 200% for three months'
deposits, of 103% for six months' deposits, and of 60% for deposits for one
year or more. At the same time, ini order both to increase domestic savings
and to discourage foreign private outflow, minimum interest rates on time de-
posits, which previously ranged from 1% to 3.75%, were increased to 3.25% for
15 days, 8% for six months, 12% for one year, and 12.5% for over one year.
As a result, tine deposits, which were belosr Z 5 million before 1970, increased
from Z 11 million at the end of 1970 to Z 19 million at the end of 1972, thus
allowing banks to develop their medium and long-term financing of productive
private investmants; the outstanding amount of such credit increased from Z 13
million at the end of 1971 to Z 22 million at the end of 1972. Banks may also
grant medium anli long-term credits uncovered by deposits, under special
authorization from the Banque du Zaire. These credits, mainly directed to
public enterpri3es, amounted to Z 17 million at the end of 1972.
2.18       Since the introduction in 1971 oi minimum rates payable on time
deposits, the banks' lending rates have edged upwards. The Banque du Zaire
presently does not control interest rates applied by the commercial banks on
their medium-term financing (except for agriculture).  The average cost of banks'
resources for ertending medium-term covered credit is now about 8% and present
lending rates average 13 - 14%, except for credits to agriculture and directlJy
related activities, which are made at a maxiimu of 6%, and rediscountable at
the Banque du Zaire at a preferential discolnt rate of 5%.
III.   THE COMPANY
Policies
3.01       SOFIDE's financing was initially limited to the private sector.  In
spite of SOFIDE's effort to encourage local enterprises, the shortage of local
entrepreneurs in Zaire meant that SOFIDE's financing was predominantly directed
toward foreign-'controlled enterprises. In order to increase SOFIDE's financing
of Zairian enterprises and to increase the scope of the company's operations,
SOFIDE's Board in December 1972 decided to allow SOFIDE to finance parastatal
enterprises, provided that this type of operations would be limited to 25% of
the company's portfolio plus undisbursed commitments. IDA supported this change,
and the Policy Statement was modified accordingly. Parastatal enterprises are
defined as those to which the state contributes directly or indirectly more than
49% of their share capital. The effect of this major change in SOFIDE's policy
on the volume of its operations has yet to be seen.
3.02       Other changes in SOFIDE's Statement of General Policy and Statutes
resulted from the application to SOFIDE of the Banking Act, promulgated in 1972.
In particular, the Government's advance of Zl million is now considered as equity
for the determination of limits for single and global equity investments. The
amended Statement of General Policy is given in Annex 1.



-7-
Ownership
3.03     There have been no changes since 1970 in the ownership of SQFIDE's
share capital, given in Annex 2. The Government, with 25% of the shares,
remains the dominant shareholder.
Board of Directors
3.04      The Board mat four times in 1971 and five in 1972.  Mr. Mambu has
been SOFIDE's Board Chairman since its formation. IFC continues to be re-
presented on the Board by Mr. Khosropur. A list of Board Members is given
in Annex 3.
Executive Committee
3.05      This committee is empowered to approve individual loans up to
Z150,000 and equity investments up to Z50,000. Its composition remaiued un-
changed in 1971 and 1972. A fifth member, Mr. Bokana, a Board membet repre-
senting the government, was added in March 1973. The Executive Comittea,
which ret 10 times in 1971, and about every two months in 1972, appears to
work satisfactorily.
Management
3.06      SOYIDE's Director General since its creation in 1970 has been Mr.
Guetta, a Bank staff member, whose assignment was completed in May 1973. The
problem of his successor was raised during the 1972 Annual Meeting by the
Zairian delegation which proposed as their candidate a Zairian, Mr. Kazadi,
Head of the Central Bank's Credit Department. The Goverment also proposed
that someone with relevant experience would share with him the responsibility
of SOFIDE's management. Mr. Fortuit from the French Caisse Centrale de Co-
opperation Economique (CCCE), who has 15 years' experience as general manager
of development banks in Africa, has been appointed Principal Advisor. The Bank,
as executing agent of the UNDP project, recruited him to provide technical
assistance to SOFIDE (see para. 3.08).



-8-
Mr. Kazadi joined SOFIDE in November 1972, and was in Paris for training with
CCCE from January to March 1973. Mr. Fortuit joined SOFIDE at the beginning
of April 1973. As of May 1, 1973, the Board transferred to Messrs. Kazadli
and Fortuit the responsibilities previously given to Mr. Guetta. All indica-
tions are that Messrs. Kazadi and Fortuit are providing an efficient manage-
ment team for SOFIDE.
Organization and Staff
3.07      As of May 1973, SOFIDE's staff totalled 51, including 16 Zairian
professionals and two expatriate professionals, Mr. Fortuit and an engineer.
Most of the Zairian professionals are recent university graduates with no
previous experience, who have been provided training either on the spot or,
for four of them, with CEFEB, the training institution of CCCE. They have
performed well so far; their potential is good, but given their inexperience
they require fairly close supervision.
3.o8      Of the three TNDP-financed experts that SOFIDE had in early 1971,
one left in June 1971, and the two others in June 1972. An experienced ex-
patriate engineer joined SOFIDE in August 1972 to set up a technical depart-
ment, and an experienced financial analyst recently has been hired to round
out the three-person advisory team that UNDP agreed to finance under a pro-
ject for which the Bank became Executive Agency on August 1, 1972.
3.09      SOFIDETs current organization chart is given in Annex 4.  The former
Department of Operations was split into two when its Director left to head
OPE Z. The new Appraisals Department and the Execution of Agreements Depart-
ment are each headed by young, able Zairians. Of the three remaining depart-
ments, the Administrative Department has performed well under a Zairian
Director; the Engineering Department will need reinfor-cement through the
recruitment of young Zairian engineers. The Economic Department remains the
weakest link in the appraisal process, but an effort is being made to train
its staff including training in the Bank on this subject.  Overall, SOFIDE
has established a solid reputation as a sound and conscientious organization
which is a major accomplishment given its relatively short existence.
Operational Procedures
3.10      Appraisals.  SOFIDE's appraisal work has been maintained at an ac-
ceptable level of quality. SOFIDE's technical assessment of projects has
also improved. The Association, on the occasion of subproject reviews or
during missions, has worked with SOFIDE staff particularly in developing
economic assessment capacity, although further improvements in this area are
necessary. During negotiations agreement was reached on appropriate
techniques of economic evaluation to be used by SOFIDE and they will be in-
corporated into SOFIDE's appraisal procedures.
3.11      Follow-up.  SOFIDE's portfolio is new;  SOFIDE has not yet started
any systematic supervision activity. It was agreed during negotiations that
SOFIDE would establish a more vigorous follow-up system for projects it
financed which would consist of regular plant visits and reports to manage-
ment.



3.12      Loan Administration.  SOFIDE's disbursement procedures are adequate,
but until mid-1972 drawing on IDA Credits was often considerably delayed;
SOFIDE was delaying on drawing down its IDA resources to minimize its financial
expenses by pre-financing loans with practically cost-free local currency re-
sources. At the end of 1972, SOFIDE's balance sheet showed an amount of about
ZO.9 million of loans pre-financed from local currency resources. At the re-
quest of both Government and IDA, SOFIDE has stopped this practice, and drawings
on its foreign credits are now made satisfactorily.
Reporting to IDA
3.13      SOFIDE has agreed to a systematic reporting format with the Associa-
tion, which is now working satisfactorily.
IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCE
Operations
4.ol      SOFIDE's operations are analyzed in Annex 5. As of October 31,
1973, SOFIDE had approved 60 operations (net of cancellations) totalling Z14.8
million; loans accounted for 93%, and equity investments for 7% of the total;
projects financed by SOFIDE represented a total investment of Z43 million, of
which Z29 million (68%) represented import requirements. The most important
subsectors assisted were foods and beverages (29.% of total financing approved),
hotels (17%), cement (10%) and metal works (8%). The average size of operations
was Z247,000      and 32% were for projects related to the creation of enter-
prises. Beneficiaries of loans were predominantly located in the Kinshasa
region (47% of total financing) and Bas Zaire (17%). It is likely that these
areas will remain the most important recipients of SOFIDE's financing, since
most industries are concentrated there, in particular because of transportation
constraints. The projected weighted average economic rate of return of pro-
jects approved so far from the last IDA Credit was 19.8%. The average cost
per direct job created was about Z13,000 and about Z6,700 if modernization
projects are excluded.
4.02      SOFIDE operations expanded rapidly in 1971, with approvals amounting
to Z6 million, although this was somewhat less than was projected in the last
appraisal report of August 1971 (No. DB 79a). Approvals in 1972 decreased to
Z2.) million. Reasons for this decrease were a deteriorating investment
climate and a lack of in-house technical processing capacity, as well as SOFIDE's
moving away from medium-term loans (maturities of less than five years) as the
need for such financing declined because of coimercial banks' increased
activity and as IDA encouraged SOFIDE to be more active in long-term financing.
Approvals in 1973 are likely to amount to Z8 million; after a slow start during
the first semester, they totalled Z5 million at the end October.
4.03      At the end October, 1973, due to SIFIDE's efforts, the proportion of
cumulative financing directed to enterprises belonging to domestic entre-
preneurs has increased to 25% (45% in terms of the numbers of operations), as
compared to 5% in August 1971.



- 10 -
4h04       Commitments and disbursements lagged in 1970 and 1971, but the
situation improved in 1972; as of December 31, 1972, only ZO.9 million of
approved operations had not yet been committed; the figure included
Z0.6 million of operations approved by the Board in December 1972, which
were committed in February 1973. The rate of disbursement also improved;
at the end of 1972, 77% of total committed operations had been disbursed.
4.05       SOFIDE's promotional activity increased in 1972;  the company
played a significant part in the establishment of T¶OUR HOTEL, a tourism
comanuy which will build four hotels in the KIVU region; it also led the
discussions, as the representative of Zairian interests, with foreign institu-
tions, aiming at establishing a development institution, "SOFIDAG", to finance
agriculture and agro-business (see para. 5.05). At the end of 1972, SOFIDE
had comnitted about Z20,000 in studies related to these projects or to other
projects submitted by Zairian businessmen.
Finance
5.01       SOFIDE's income statements, balance sheets and statements of sources
and uses of funds for 1970, 1971, 1972 and the first nine months of 1973 are
given in Annexes 6 to 8. Mainly because the return on short-term investments
was higher than forecast, and due to some foreign exchange gains, net profits
amounted to Z110,000 in 1971, or 5.5% of the paid-in share capital. In 1972,
net profits increased to Z129,900, or 6.5% of the paid-in share capital, after
a provision of a0S,000 for possible losses. For the first tine,a dividend of
5% was distributed. As a result of the decrease of activity in 1972, income
from loans and financial charges in that year were lower than expected, but
interest on short-term investments, although reduced, remained at a high level,
so that profits were nearly as high as forecast in the last Appraisal Report.
5.02       SOFIDE's balance sheet as of December 31, 1972, shows a strong finan-
cial position. Equity and quasi-equity totalled Z5.1 million, while medium-
and long-term foreign borrowings amounted to Z2.6 million, i.e. a ratio of 0.5:1.
SOFIDE's idle funds,invested in bank deposits abroad until mid-1971, were re-
patriated and invested in treasury bonds at 6.5%, the highest rate SOFIDE could
find domestically since, as a financial institution ruled by the provision of
the Banking Act, SOFIDE could not get prevailing interest rates on its short-
term deposits with Zairian banks. The Central Bank, however, agreed in November
1972 to waive this rule for SOFIDE, provided its deposits are made for a maximum
term of six months. The government showed reluctance in April 1972 to redeem
bonds but, at the request of the Association, agreed to do so, as well as to
pay in June 1972 the second Zl million installment of its loan to SOFIDE; SOFIDE,
however, agreed to receive it in the form of Treasury Bills maturing between
March and December 1973. This led SOFIDE, to secure its liquidity position, to
borrow last September ZO.5 million for one year from an associated Italian bank.



- 11 -
4.08      SOFIDE's portfolio as of December 31, 1972, appears sound and well-
balanced among the industrial sectors. There were no arrears at that date.
Of the four equity investments committed at the end of 1972, three were in
profitable, established companies, including one, accounting for 72% of the
total amount, in a cement company; the last equity investment was a small
promotional participation in TOUR HOTEL, the company set-up by SOFIDE and
foreign partners to promote tourism in the KIVU region.
4.09      Resources.  At the end of 1972, SOi3IDE had obtained foreign re-
sources totalling Z9.3 million.

rThe loan granted by EIB to finance a single textile project (9 years at 6.5%)
was signed in December 1971. Z170, 000 was disbursed at the end of 1972. The
SIFIDA loan (three years at 8.25%) was signed in March 1972 and was totally
disbursed at the end of 1972.
4.10      Since the beginning of 1973, SOFIDE has obtained other foreign cur-
rency loans totalling about Z4.90 million. They include a line of credit from
Societe Belge d'Investissement International (SBI) of BF300 million (about
Z3.75 million), and a loan from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of
DK6.5 million (about Z1.15 million). In addition, it will receive the equiva-
lent in local currency of a loan of BF50 million (about ZO.63 million) made
by the Belgian Government to the Zairian Government. Under the SBI line of
credit SOFIDE can finance up to a maturity of 12 years its loans and equity
investments (up to a maximum of 50% of SOFIDE's total assistance for each
project) including local currency expenditures, but is limited to financing
projects with Belgian participation or improving Belgo-Zairian economic
relations, which de facto ties the line of credit to Belgian procurement. The
interest rate of this line of credit is 7.25%. The KfW loan is for 30 years,
including a 10-year grace period; it is intended to be used for loans for
foreign procurement (up to a limit of Z100,000 each) to small- and medium-
scale private enterprises located outside of Kinshasa. The interest rate is
7.5%, but only 2% will be paid to KfW; the other 5.5% will be set aside by
SOFIDE to finance promotional studies of and technical assistance to Zairian-
owned enterprises directly or through specialized institutions. The Belgian
loan to be passed to SOFIDE by the Government is for 30 years, including a
10-year grace period, with an interest of 2%. It is to be used for financing
Zairian-owned enterprises. The Government has assumed the foreign exchange
risk on all of SOFIDE's foreign loans to date.

- 12 -
4.11      When SOFIDE was established it represented a new element in a
financial market where, except for suppliers credits, there was not much
medium- or long-tern lending being done.  Given all the uncertainties of an
untried market it was decided that SOFIDE would charge 10% on its credits
with the Government taking the foreign exchange risk. Since that time
market rates have moved upwards slightly and SOFIDE increased its rate to
10.5%. Alternative credit sources in Zaire range in cost from about 7-8%
on suppliers credits to 13-14% for commercial bank credit. These rates apply
in an environment where price increases are now in the region of 7% p.a. On
balance there is at present an element of subsidy in SOFIDE's rates and to
move SOFIDE closer to what might be considered the market it was agreed that
under the proposed credit SOFIDE would (with the exception of smaller Zairian
enterprises having total assets under Z150,000) either pass on the foreign
exchange risk to sub-borrowers or charge a 1% foreign exchange risk coverage
premium (i.e., a total cost of 11.5%) which would go to the Government.
V.   PROSPECTS
Business Prospects
5.01      Projecting SOFIDE's activity has proved difficult in the past.
As noted in para. 2.13 above, although the Government wishes to attract
foreign investments, it has recently taken a number of measures affecting
the activity of foreign companies and there remain uncertainties concerning
Government's future policies. Except for important projects in the mining
sector, or projects linked to the Inga power dam, the iimediate prospects
for new foreign investment are not bright. However, agro-industrial and
tourism sectors offer good opportunities, and existing private industr-es
a-e expected to continue to invest in the expansion or modernization of their
enterprises.
5.02      As of March 31, 1973, SOFIDE has under serious consideration 21
projects requiring SOFIDE finance of Z7.1 million (see list in Annex 15). The
largest projects were a malt-processing factory, a hotel company and a hollow-
glass factory(Zl million each). Seven out of the 21 were projects sponsored
by Zairians. All these projects were in the private sector.
5.03      Four factors make projection for SOFIDE particularly hazardous
today: (i) the company's potential business with parastatal sector is
unclear; (ii) the proposed creation of a new institution to finance agri-
cultuire and agro-business might have some effect on SOFIDE's operations;
(ii) the effect on SOFIDE's activities caused by the laws recently passed
to promote Zairian entrepreneurship; (iv) recent changes in SOFIDE management
will be followed by a period of reorganization and adjustment, which may
temporarily slow down the company's capacity to appraise and approve projects.
5o04      The parastatal sector is strongly controlled by the Institut de
Gestion du Portefeuille (IGTP), a public holding entity under direct guidance
of the Office of the Presidency, which holds and manages state participation
in productive enterprises.  IGP has a capital of Z500 million, and is managed
by a Chairman, three General Secretaries and 21 Vice-Presidents, all nominated
by the President of the Republic. Each Vice-President is in charge of a
particular sector.  The state participations are particularly important in



- 13 -
mining (GECAMINES), transportation, insurance, banking and public utilities.
There are! few parastatal enterprises in the manufactuirincf sector. SOFIDE's
management believes that SOFIDE will have a role in financing manufacturing
investmernts in the parastatal sector, but potential business in this sector
has not yet been studied in any depth. Theoretically, SOFIDE could also
participate in the financing of parastatal enterprises in the mining or trans-
portatior, sectors, but its contribution would be limited given the large in-
vestment requirements of these sectors.
5.05      The proposed establishment of "SOFIDAG" to invest in large-scale
agricultu:ral and aaro-business projects was originally a joint proposal of
the Commonwealth Developmient Corporation (CDC), the Government and of SOFIDE.
While there is no reason why SOFIDE could not undertake this business if it
were properly staffed, the CDC desired that a separate institution be formed,
and indicated willingness to provide the necessary technical. expertise.
This proposal is under active preparation.
5I.06     Although the future relatioaship between SOFIDE and SOFIDAG is
unclear, the establishment of SOFIDAG would probably have limited effect on
SOFIDE, since SOFIDE until now has not invested in purely agricultural pro-
jects (it, approved a parastatal fisheries project in March 1973), and will
not compete with SOFIDAG- in this sector; it is also probable that SOFIDE
will in any event continue to finance agriculture processing projects.
5.07      Assistance to Zairian-owned enterprises has been and will remain
a major objective for SOFIDE, which will partlv fulfill this role throut,h
financing; of parastatal projects.  A major increase of SOFIDE's investment
in very small-scale private Zairian enterprises is difficult to envisaze,
since SOFIDE's assistance to a single enterprise must normally be over
Z10,000, and since, in addition, most Zairian entrepreneurs need technical
assistance, training, and other extension services more than financial
assistance. However, when OPEZ and FGEZ become fully operational they will
be of assistance to SOFIDE in the financing, of enterprises at the lower end
of the company's financing spectrum.
Forecast of Operations
5.o8      A forecast of SOFIDE's operations is -iven in Annex 9.  SOFIDE pro-
jected approvals totalling Z10.5 million for 1973, including Z3 million for
parastatel enterprises (of which Z2.5 million for umidentified projects), and
Z25 million for the two years 1974 and 1975.  Because of recent change in the
company's management, staff constraints, and uncertainties regarding the
volume of lending to parastatal projects, it is likely that approvals zill not
exceed ZE million for 1973; approvals durinY the first ten months of 1973 totallE
about Z5   million.  For 1974 and 1975, taking into account SOFIDE's past record
and assun.ing the parastatal sector will offer new opportunities, approvals
totalling Z17 million for the two years, i.e., about two-thirds of SOFIDE's
owin forecast, appear conceivable, althoug,h maybe on the hiLgh side.
5.09      In forecastin- SOFIDE's operations, it has been assumed that equity
investments would represent 7.5% of total financing, as compared to 7'l in the
past, and loans 02.5%, 75% of which would be to finance the import component
of projects.

Resources Needed
5.10      On the basis of the above-projected operations, SOFIDE would need
new resources of Z7.9 million to cover its commitments by the end of 1975,
of which Z6.9 million is required in foreign exchange:

5.11          Despite the lag in commitments in 1973 resulting from the slowdown
during the first half of the year. it is likely that the current IDA Credit
271-CK wiLl be fully committed by early 1974. A new IDA Credit of $10 million
(Z5 million) would cover about 70% of SOFIDE's foreign resource gap and 30%
of the total resource needs for the 1974/75 period, on the basis of the above
projections. The small local currency gap can probably be covered by domestic
borrowing.
5.12         The Credit would finance the c.i.f. cost of imported goods and
the foreign cost of ancillary services an(d the foreign component of goods
purchased locally and previously imiported or of goods produced locally from
imported materials.
Financial Projections
5.13         Projected cash flow statements, income statements and balance
sheets for the period 1973-77 are given in Annexes 11 to 13.
5.14         The assumptions on which the projections are based are at Annex 10.
Commitments and disbursements are projected as follows: 70% of approvals
committed the same year, and 30% the following year; 50% of commitments disbursed
in the year of commitment and 50% the following year; interest on SOFIDE's loans
at the current 10.5% p.a. rate; interest on foreign currency borrowings at
an average interest rate of 7.25%; general and aciiinistrative expenses increasing
by 10% annually from 1973 on. On the basis of those projections, profits would
amount to 9.4% of net worth in 1973, 12.1% and 15.5% in 1974 and 1975, a
satisfactory rate of growth.



- 15 -
5.15         SOFIDE's size, as measured by its total assets, will increase
significantly in the next few years. Total assets will almost triple, reaching
about $40 million equivalent by the end of 1975. Through that period SOFIDE
will remain well within the existing debt limit agreed by the company, which
stipulates that long-term debt will not exceed 3 times the sum of SOFIDE's
net worth, Government advance and subordinated debt. Total leverage on net
worth at that time will be about 6.5:1. The debt service capacity will be
ample reflecting the long maturities of much of the debt raised by SOFIDE to
date.
VI.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01         SOFIDE's performance during its first three years of operation
owe much to the personality and dynamism of its first General Manager. Largely
due to his skills and to the dedication he inspired to his staff, SOFIDE has
established excellent relations with the Government and with the financial
and business community. SOFIDEt operations have expanded rapidly, though
subject to substantial variations. SOFIDE has diversified its resources, and
the next IDA Credit will account for only about 30% of its total resource
requirements. SOFIDEts lending in its first two years of operations was
excessively short and too concentrated on foreign-owned enterprises. This
situation has improved. SOFIDE has successfully increased its share of
financing directed to Zairian-owned enterprises (45% of approved operations
as of October 31, 1973) and is trying to develop it further by including
parastatal enterprises among its customers. Up to the present SOFIDE has
approved only one parastatal project, and it is not yet clear what potential
business parastatal enterprises will offer.
6.02         The Association, as Executing Agency for a UNIP technical assistance
program to SOFIDE, has recently recruited the financial analyst who will round
out the three-man advisory team. Lack of expertise has put a heavy burden
on the shoulders of the General Manager. He nevertheless was able to effectively
pursue a program of training for the Zairian staff, whose abilities have improved.
SOFIDE's remaining weaknesses are in the field of economic appraisal and follow-up,
which its new management intends to correct. The new managements arrangements
are satisfactory.
6.03         SOFIDE's financial situation is healthy; as of December 31, 1972,
equity and quasi-equity totalled Z5.2 million, whilst term debts amounted
to Z2.6 million. SOFTDEts portfolio is sound and well-balanced among industrial
sectors. After allocation of Z60,00o to provisions for bad debts, profits
amounted to Z129,000 in 1972, i.e. a return of 6.5% on paid-in share capital.
For the first time, a dividend of 5% was distributed. It is expected that
this dividend rate will be raised in the coming years.
6.04         SOFIDEts operations in 1973 are expected to amount to Z8 million;
after a slow start during the first semester, approvals totalled Z5   million
for the first ten months. Projections for 1974 and 1975 are difficult to make
with certainty; however, assuming the parastatal sector will offer some new



- 16 -
opportunities, projected comnitnents for the two years 1974 and 1975 of
Z17 million, i.e. two-thirds of SOFIDE'sown forecast, appear reasonable.
After deduction of the new foreign resources recently granted to SOFIDE,
a new IDA Credit of Z5 million ($10 million) would partially fill the
foreign resources gap through 1975, leaving an incentive for SOFIDE to
continue to diversify its resource base.
6.05      The proposed credit of $10 million would be relent by the Zairian
Government to SOFIDE, with a flexible amortization schedule conforming to
the aggregate amortization schedules of SOFIDE's subloans, none of which
should in principle exceed a maximum period of 15 years. Funds would be
passed on to SOFIDE at 7.25% in local currency for its loans made at SOFIDE's
current interest rate (10.5%) to small and medium-scale Zairian enterprises
(i.e. with total assets not exceeding Z150,000). Other clients of SOFIDE
would have the option either (i) to be charged SOFIDeS current interest
rate (10.5%) and take the foreign exchange risk, with IDA funds passed on to
SOFIDE at 7.25% in dollars equivalent, or (ii) to borrow in local currency at
1% interest above SOFIDE'scurrent lending rate, the 1% representing a premium
against the foreign exchange risk to be transferred to the Government who would
thus charge 8.25% to SOFIDE. Since SOFIDE is now an established institution,
it is recommended that it pay to the Government a commitment charge, of 34%
per annum on the undisbursed amount of the loan, starting 60 days after signa-
ture. It is also recommended that the free limit for individual subprojects be
raised from $100,000 to $150,000, with an aggregate limit remaining at $2 million.

of Directors.
I.   OBJECTIVES AND OPERATIONAL CRITERIA

2. The Company shall assist enterprises which are majority
privately owmed. The Company will also assist, up to a limit of 25% of
its commitments, enterprises with juridical personality that have, in fact,
ar autonomous administration, financial management, accounting system and

than 49% of their share capital. Those enterprises shall also meet all the
other eligibility requirements set forth in the Statutes and in the present
statement of Policy Statement.

aspects into consideration when appraising the projects submitted to it.
4. The Company shall make every effort to foster the distribution
of industrial shareholdings and the growth of a capital market in the Repub-
lic of Zaire. With this end in view it shall subscribe to issues of shares
and bonds in appropriate cases and shall sell shares from its portfolio,
provided that these operations are carried out under satisfactory conditions
and that the enterprises concerned are not prejudiced by such a sale. The
Company shall endeavor to create a market for its own shares in the Republic
of Zaire and to do everything within its power, within the framework of the
law and its own Statutes, to encourage Zairian investors to participate in
its capital.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
5. In accordance with Article 3 of its Statutes
the Company shall extend all kinds of assistance, financial and
other, in keeping with its objectives.  The Company shall invest in
the capital of enterprises and shall subscribe to issues of shares
and other securities. It shall grant medium- and long-term loans, for

cases.  It shc.ll endeavour to actively promote the establishment of
new and the expansion of existing enterprises. It shall give its
clients technical assistance and advice on the planning, lay-out and
execution of their projects. These loans and participations may be
granted for construction work, purchase of plant and equipment and for
the constitution of permanent working capital.
II. INVESTMENT POLICY
6. The Company's assistance in the form of loans or
participationEs or both forms combined may not normally amount to less
than Z 10,000. However, the Company is prepared to consider requests
for financing of projects which, without reaching this amount,
nevertheless present a definite economic interest.
7. As a general rule, the total amount of loans granted by
the Company together with its participations and any other connmitments
of a financial nature in favor of a single enterprise may not exceed
20% of the paid-up share capital, the unimpaired reserves and the
quasi-capital contributed by the Government pari passu with the share
capital.
8. The Company shall join with other financing institutions,
whether local, foreign or international, in financing projects whose
financial requirements exceed its capacity.
S. The Company's total investments in the form of equity
participations may not exceed the total of the Company's share capital
plus unimpaired reserves and the government advance of' Z 1 million
ran king pari passu with the share capital.

responsibilities in enterprises it assists and shall limit its share
participations to 25, of the share capital of any given enterprise.
It may, however, by unanimous decision of the Board, exceed this
percentage and even assume managerial responsibility if this is
Justified by the circumstances or the nature of the enterprise. The
Company may also, notwithstanding the above restrictions, take any
action it considers essential to protect its investments.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
12. When the Company underwrites an issue of shares or
other securities, it may commit itself for an initial amount in excess
of the limits fixed in the above Articles 10 and 11, as long as it has
good reasons to believe that its final investment will remain within
those limits.
13. When deciding upon the amount%and form of financial
assistance it shall provide, the Company shall take into accolmt all the
financial requirements of the project and the financial situation of
the enterprise in question. In principle, the loans the Company grants
shall not together exceed 50% of the total cost of the project. It
may, however, exceed this limit if there is special justification, such
as in the case of an expansion project.
14. The Company shall endeavour to maintain a balanced portfolio
by distributing its loans, participations and other commitments amongst
all the sectors of industrial and economic activity within the range of
its objectives.

shareholders. To this end the Company shall:
-  maintain a satisfactory balance between the
maturities of its own obligations and those of
the loans it grants;
-   not incur debts of more than one year of termn
in excess of three times the amount of its
capital plus quasi-capital;
-  not incur exchange risks in respect oC those of
its borrowings that are repayable in foreign

generally require appropriate guarantees for the
loans it grants;
fix its interest rates, commissions and other
charges at a level that will enable it to obtain
a satisfactory return;
- make adequate provisions against potential losses
and build up reserves to a level consistent with
sound financial practices, taking into account the
size and quality of its portfolio of loans and
investments as well as the need to pay adequate
dividends to its shareholders.

FED until April 1st, 1973, and now receives French assistance.
INPP trainis and upgrades the staff of existing enterprises and,
to a lesser extent, graduates of vocational training schools who
have not zret succeeded in being employed. INPP has focused on
larger enterprises and government services. It has engaged AFCA
to carry out training activities for small Zairian businessmen
and their employees. AFCA personnel supplement evening management
courses by periodical visits of each participating entrepreneur in
his own enterprise. AFCA also helps small entrepreneurs to find
markets for their production. Last January it began an extensive
survey of 4,000 small enterprises in Kinshasa in order to assess
their characteristics and their needs for help. Experts presently
working w'th INPP and AFCA are expected to be used by OPEZ under
arrangements not yet worked out.
