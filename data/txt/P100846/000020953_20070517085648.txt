Description     The proposed Sindh Education Sector Development Policy Credit (SEDPC) is the first o f a
                programmatic series o f three development policy credits designed to support the Government o f
                Sindh's MediumTermEducation Sector ReformProgram(SERP). The objectives o f the program
                are to improve participation, retention and transition, reduce gender and regional disparities, and
                improve quality in elementary and secondary education (grades 1-10). As a result, (i)            net
                enrollment rates inprimary, middle and secondary education are expected to increase from 48%,
                18% and 12% in2004105 to 59%, 22% and 14% respectively in2009110; (ii)         the share o f girls in
                primary and inmiddle schools inrural areas is expected to increase from 36% and 28% to 40%
                and 31% respectively between 2005106 and 2009110; (iii) transition rate for rural girls
                                                                                the
                between primary and middle school is expected to increase from 47% to 50% between 2005106
                and 2009110; and (iv) completion rates and learning outcomes will be regularly monitored.

                The program is builton four complementary pillars:
                            Improvingjscal sustainability and the effectiveness ofpublic expenditures including
                            ineducation, through fiscal reforms to enable increasesineducation and other pro-
                            poor expenditures, to improve budgetary processes and the composition o f
                            expenditures; as well as financial management and procurement reforms to increase
                            credibility, transparency and accountability inthe use o fpublic resources.
                            Improving education sector management through reforms to strengthen the
                            functioning, capacity and accountability o f provincial and district education
                            management in line with devolution objectives, to provide incentives to district
                            governments to improve service delivery, and to strengthen the role o f school
                            management committees inschool development andmonitoring.
                            Improving access to quality schooling, with a particular focus on rural areas and
                            girls, through reforms to improve          the quality and utilization o f physical
                            infrastructure in schools, to address implementation bottlenecks and improve the
                            effectiveness o f incentive programs (free textbooks and girls' stipends), and to
                            launch partnerships with the non-governmentlprivate sector to increase access and
                            quality.
                            Improving the quality of teaching and learning, through instituting merit based
                            recruitment and improved accountability o f teachers, establishing a competency
                            based system o f teacher education and continuous professional development, and
                            through strengthening the assessment o f student achievement in the provincial
                            education system.

                All four pillars are designed to improve quality, equity and efficiency in education service
                delivery, and to increase accountability in the education sector. Each credit in the SEDPC series
                will be a single tranche operation based on up-front, completed actions that reflect substantive
                ?regress towards medium term objectives.      The speed o f reforms in the different pillars inthe
                ?rogrammatic series will reflect the evolving focus o f the government's reform program, and the
                :xperience in each year. The first credit supports reforms to establish the needed credibility
                hrough up-front governance reforms cutting across the pillars, critical to improving quality,
                :quity and efficiency.

Benefits     There arefive distinct but complementary benefits.
             0     Acceleration of progress towards PRSP objectives by increasing education access and
                    quality, reducing disparities, and improving the efficiency o f education service delivery in
                    Pakistan's second most populous province, albeit one where social indicators are
                    generally lagging. Punjab and Sindh together account for just under 80% o f Pakistan's
                   population; improving education outcomes in Sindh i s essential for appreciable impact on
                   poverty and humandevelopment outcomes inthe country as a whole.
             0     Impacts of sustained Bank engagement and dialogue which provides technical andpolicy
                    guidance on the reforms, leverages political support, as well as changes in provincial
                   resourcesinsupport o freforms.
                   Donor harmonization around a common policy framework and dialogue, including
                   throughparallel financing.
                   Increasedfiscal stability and efectiveness in public resource use, from the accompanying
                   wider fiscal andgovernance reforms.
                   Potentially important spillover efects for other sectors as a result o f the package of
                   education as well as cross cutting fiscal and governance reforms supported by SEDPC,
                   with education possibly leading the way for reforms in other sectors, including other
                   humandevelopment sectors.
asks         The operation is subject to the following key risks:
                   Macroeconomic, from continued inflationary pressures and widening trade and current
                    account deficits at the national level, and fiscal weaknesses at the provincial level. At the
                   national level, the authorities have indicated their determination to take the necessary
                    steps to ensure macroeconomic stability and have already taken steps to tighten money
                   supply. At the provincial level, fiscal deficits are cappedby the total o f donor assistance
                   and net capital receipts. To address potential substantial adjustments in budgetary
                   allocations for the S E W or other pro-poor expenditures, a satisfactory medium term
                   fiscal framework i s builtinto the Pillar 1o f the program.
                   Political risks remain highin Sindh's context o f coalition governments. Inaddition, with
                   elections later in the year, there are risks associated with maintaining continuity in the
                   reform program. Political risks are partially mitigated by the consensus on the key
                   reforms in the package at the provincial and national levels. Consultations with key
                   stakeholders and communication on selected reforms also reduce risks. Finally, the design
                   and sequencing o f the Bank's support to focus on a small set o f critical actions in the
                   government's programassists injudicious use o fpolitical capital, while the programmatic
                   nature o f the support provides a mechanism to match the volume and pace o f lending to
                   the pace o f reforms.
                   Corruption and misuse of resources intended for education programs. These risks,
                   however are substantially mitigated through the explicit actions in the program to
                   streamline delivery and reduce leakages inprovincial programs (stipends and textbooks),
                   partnership agreements which strengthen accountability o f district governments,
                   enhancement o f the financial management capacity ineducation to support districts inthe
                   provision o f adequate, coherent and comprehensive budget execution statements, and the
                   planned third party validations, trackmg o f education expenditures, ex-post procurement
                   reviews, and supervision o f school rehabilitation portfolios.
                    Weak implementation capacity, at provincial, district and school levels. This is being
                   addressed through focused actions and technical assistance to overcome capacity
                   constraints as an integral part of the medium term program, and through sequencing o f
                   reforms to consider capacity constraints.

                   phasing in o f the Project for the Improvement o f Financial Reporting and Auditing
                   (PIFRA), as well as through an ongoing dialogue and Analytical and Advisory Services
                   (AAA) on wider PFM reforms in the province. In addition, selected constraints are

                              I. INTRODUCTIONANDOVERVIEW

1.        The proposed Sindh Education Sector Development Policy Credit (SEDPC) would be the first
o f a programmatic series o f three development policy credits designed to support the Government o f
Sindh's Medium Term Education Sector Reform Program (SERP). The objectives of the medium
term education sector reform program are to improve participation, retention and transition, reduce
gender and regional disparities, and improve quality in elementary and secondary education'. The
specific targets of the program are to: (i)increase net enrollment rates in primary, middle and
secondary education from 48%, 18% and 12% in 2004105 to 59%, 22% and 14% respectively in
2009/10, (ii)  increase the share o f girls inprimary and inmiddle schools inrural areas from 36% and
28% to 40% and 31% respectively between 2005/06 and 2009/10; (iii)                 increase the transition rate for
rural girls from primary to middle school from 47% to 50% between 2005/06 and 2009/10; and (iv) to
regularly monitor completion rates2as well as learning outcomes in language and mathematics. The
vision for the SERP builds on the lessons from the sector reform program initiated in 2001, while
furtherdeepening andbroadening the reforms.

2.        Sindh was the first province to institute reforms in the education sector under its
Education Sector Reform program in 2001.                       Several education sector reforms now being
implemented in other provinces were initiated in Sindh. Sindh was the first province to provide
stipends to girls in all government schools, engage client participation in education by empowering
parent-teacher committees, provide free textbooks to primary students, institute the policy o f hiring
school-specific contract teachers, and finance NGO service delivery (through the Sindh Education
Foundation) in the regular education budget of the government. Several o f these reforms were also
instituted as a part of the Sindh Reform Program (SRP) in 2001, supported by the first provincial
Structural Adjustment Credit (the SSAC) inMay 2002. These efforts have likely contributedto some
o f the observed improvements in education outcomes. However, the pace and scale o f their impact
has been limited due to a combination o f structural issues relating to governance that affect the
education sector in Sindh. Key constraints are the lack o f coordination between provincial and district
governments (and school management committees) and limitedparticipation of district governments,
cumbersome implementation arrangements that led to delays and leakages in the distribution o f
textbooks and inthe payment o f stipends, and limitedprogress on institutionalizing a fail-safe system
for recruitingteachers on merit. These factors reduce the confidence inthe public system o f delivery.

3.        Sindh's own experience and that in neighboring Punjab demonstrate the potential for
rapidly improving education indicators through cross-cutting reforms to improve service
delivery.     Sindh's experience demonstrates that there i s potential to rapidly improve education
indicators ifconcerted steps are taken to improve governance and implementation, backed by political
will and commitment to reforms. The experience in Punjab has also had important spillover effects
and provides important lessons for other provinces including Sindh. These experiences provide four


  Secondary, "Matric" and high school are often used interchangeably to refer to grades 8-10. "Primary" is grades 1-5,
"Middle" is grades6-8 and "Elementary" refers to grades 1-8.
  Completionrates are high accordingto household surveys. Administrativedata, however, show a contrastingsituation of
high drop out rates within primary. Future monitoring efforts will focus on better understanding, and addressing these
discrepancies(see paragraphs0, 33). The baselineand targeted increases inthe completionrate based on administrativedata
are includedin Annex 2a.

important lessons. First, political commitment and ownership are critical, having been a key factor
driving the successful implementation o f the first phase o f reforms in Punjab3. Second, there is an
emerging consensus on the core elements o f a successful reform program. These include governance
and management reforms inthe education sector, other sector specific interventions to improve access
and quality, as well as broader fiscal, financial management and governance reforms. Third, the
experience o f Punjab has demonstrated the importance o f extensive consultation and continued
dialogue with stakeholders and particularly district governments responsible for service delivery.
Fourth it has demonstrated the importance o f a credible monitoring and evaluation system.

4.       The Sindh Education Sector Reform programwhich this credit seeks to support is based
on four complementary pillars. All four pillars are designed to improve quality, equity and
efficiency. (i)    Pillar 1 i s designed to improve fiscal sustainability and the effectiveness o f public
expenditures, including in education, through fiscal, financial management and procurement reforms;
(ii) 2willimproveeducationsectormanagementthroughreformstostrengthenthefunctioning,
    Pillar
capacity and accountability o f provincial, district and school level management; (iii)Pillar 3 is
designed to improve access to quality schooling with a particular focus on rural areas and girls
through complementary interventions on the demand and supply side, and through enlisting the
partnership o f the private sector; and (iv) Pillar 4 aims to improve the quality o f teaching and learning
through reforms to improve recruitment and accountability of teachers, introduce an improved system
teacher education and professional development, and through the strengthening of student learning
outcome assessments and their systematic use. The first credit supports up-front reforms cutting
across the pillars that are critical to establishing the needed credibility, and to achieving the medium
term objectives. Subsequent credits will be based on continued substantial progress on the medium
term reformprogram.

5.       The Government of Sindh has shown exceptional energy and commitment to
accelerating reforms in education, evident in the successful completion of actions to address key
bottlenecks to effective service delivery. The design and implementation o f the reform program are
being led by an interdepartmental Reform Steering Committee, headed by the Chief Secretary o f the
province. The government has taken actions to address key bottlenecks that have constrained full
realization of outcomes to date. First, several actions have been taken to improve fiscal sustainability
and increase effectiveness in the use o f public resources, especially for education reforms.
Specifically, the Government approved a new medium term sector policy framework and financing
plan for the SERF', and a 2006107 education budget aligned with the sector policy framework and
reflecting an estimated 17% real increase inexpenditures over 2005/06. To increase the sustainability
o f the program, the three year education financing plan is embedded in a Medium Term Fiscal
Framework (MTFF) that increases provincial revenues and curtails interest and subsidy expenditures
while increasing education and other pro-poor expenditures. Departmental Accounts Committees are
being revitalized and institutionalized across the province, and this i s expected to reinforce
accountability in the use o f public resources, especially public education resources, by facilitating
significant reduction inunresolved audit paragraphs.

6.        Second, significant changes have been introduced in the management o f the education sector.
A Reform Support Unit (RSU) has been established as an integral part o f the education department
and under the oversight o f the Reform Steering Committee. The RSU, with responsibility for Policy
Formulation (including the development o f new implementation arrangements for education
programs), Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and Donor Coordination i s now fully functional. A

 These reformswere supported by a series of three annual development policy credits to Punjab in the amount of US$ 100
million each. The Education Sector Adjustment Credit was presented to the Board in March 2004, the Second Education
Sector Development Policy Credit in May 2005, and the Third PunjabEducationSector Development Policy Credit in June
2006. Educationsector reforms are also being supported in the NWFP beginningwith the first NWFP DevelopmentPolicy
Credit that was presentedto the BoardinJune 2006.

                                                           4

substantially improved monitoring system is being introduced, at the core o f which i s a new schools
public schools census with enhanced and more reliable information. This has provided baselines for
key performance indicators in the reform program for the province as well as for individual districts.
To strengthen decentralization, and to provide incentives to district governments for improved service
delivery, the provincial government i s holding extensive consultations with district officials and has
signed partnership agreements with all districts. These agreements clarify the roles and
responsibilities o f provincial and district governments, the arrangements for monitoring and
evaluation, and include a set o f agreed performance indicators and targets for each district. A
conditional grant o f Rs. 100 million has been transferred in the first year to each district that has
entered into the agreement with the understanding that inthe second year these conditional grants for
education will be disbursed inpart against performance.

7.       Third, new streamlined implementation arrangements for existing incentive programs have
been introduced to improve their impact. A s a result, for the first time, nearly 90% o f grade 1-10
students received their textbooks at the start o f the school year. Moreover, the full amount of the
annual stipend has been delivered to about 80% o f eligible girls inmiddle and high schools. Fourth,
to improve the quality and accountability o f teachers, a new policy for transparent, merit-based
recruitment o f teachers has been approved which provides for school-specific recruitment o f teachers
and specifies a formula based selection that emphasizes inter alia performance in independently
administered competency based tests, and accords preference to local teachers and female teachers.

8.       The proposed engagement is fully consistent with, and follows the engagement
principleslaiddownin, the FY06-09CountryAssistanceStrategy (CAS). The CAS, discussedby
the Board on June 2, 2006, proposes an increase in lending focused on areas of the government's
program that are most critical for growth and poverty reduction including human development. The
Bank's strategy in education envisages a continued focus on the provinces, usingdevelopment policy
credits to support policy and systemic changes in education together with other areas linked to
education reform including decentralization and governance reforms. The proposed engagement in
the education sector in Sindh is predicated on the continued satisfaction of the strategic engagement
principles laid out inthe CAS: (i)  "client pull" through evidence o f committed reform champions and
demonstrated willingness and ability to carry out needed reforms; (ii)  "strategic selectivity" seeking to
replicate or scale up approaches that have already been shown effective; (iii)increased focus on
"outcomes" guided by the CAS results framework and associated integration of M&Einto the design;
and (iv) the use of a programmatic approach to provide sustained, flexible and predictable support to
medium term reforms.

9.       Accelerating education reforms in Pakistan's second most populous province has
importantsignificance for its growth and poverty reduction objectives, and the reformprocess
i s gaining increasingvisibility. Sindh i s home to nearly a quarter of Pakistan's 160 million people.
The rural population in Sindh is the most vulnerable to falling into poverty compared to other parts o f
the country. Human development and education indicators in Sindh lag behind those o f the rest o f the
country, primarily in rural areas.      Education outcomes are particularly l o w for rural females.
Improving education outcomes in Sindh is essential for an appreciable impact on national indicators,
and thus on Pakistan's PRSP objectives and MDG goals.             It will accelerate progress towards
achievingthe MDGs. The additional focus on secondary education will contribute to the creation o f a
pool o f educated workers able to proceed to higher levels o f education, and to acquire the skills
needed in a global competitive economy, thus contributing to Palustan's growth objectives. For these
reasons, political pressure for accelerating education reforms in Sindh is also high.Although Sindh's
fragmented politics pose risks to implementing and sustaining the reforms, the consensus on the
reform package `at the federal and provincial levels plays an important role in mitigating risks. In
addition, the local government elections in2005 provide impetus to the devolution initiative -key for
service delivery. In the case o f Sindh this has resulted in increased the political alignment between

provincial and local governments increasing the likelihood o f improved service delivery by local
governments.

10.      Since the beginning of the new millennium, Pakistan's economy has staged a
remarkableturnaround, laying the ground for sustained growth and poverty reduction. The 1990s
were a period o f slow growth, and progress in reducing poverty and improving social indicators
stagnated. Successive governments initiated reforms, but with only modest results as reforms faltered
midway due to rising political pressures and constrained external financing. Beginning in 2000, the
Government initiated a more wide-ranging and ambitious reform program that was articulated in the
Government's 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, "Accelerating Growth and Reducing Poverty,
The Road Ahead." These reforms, along with debt restructuring, and increased remittances and
concessional aid flows, resulted in a dramatic turnaround o f the economy. In contrast to several
previous IMF programs, both the 2000 Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) and the 2001 three-year
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were successfully completed.
Recent years have witnessed considerable improvement in the performance o f the industrial and
services sector, leading to a significant acceleration in economic growth, to 7.5 percent in 2003/04
and 8.6 percent in 2004/05 (Table 1). In 2005/06, Pakistan's economy withstood serious adverse
shocks emanating from its worst ever earthquake, a sharp increase in oil prices, and less favorable
weather conditions, and registered continued strong growth o f 6.6 p e r ~ e n tA. ~s discussed below, the
acceleration in economic growth since 2001/02 has led to higher household incomes and lower
poverty. In2005/06, the per capita income increasedto $847, up from $742 a year earlier (an increase
o f 14percent innominal dollars).

11.     The government's prudent expenditure and debt management strategies have resulted in
sustained fiscal improvement, despite limitedprogress in improving revenue collections and reducing
power sector losses. Due primarily to increased savings on the interest bill, the overall fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) declined from 5.4 percent o f GDP in 1999/00 to about 3.3 percent in 2004/05.
Earthquake related expenditures contributedto a higher deficit o f 4.2 percent o f GDP in2005/06.5 Net
o f earth-quake effect the fiscal deficit was 3.3 percent o f GDP, implying that a significant part of
earthquake impact was absorbed within the budget (See Figure 1). Rapid economic growth,
availability o f grants and concessional finance, debt cancellation and fiscal consolidation have
enabled Pakistan to reduce its debt burden sharply. The government policy o f using privatization
proceeds towards retirement o f debt also contributed to a reduction in the debt burden. As a result,
total government debt fell from about 80 percent o f GDP in 2001/02 to 56 percent in 2005/06.
Importantly, despite the rapid fiscal adjustment, the government continued to increase allocations to
social and poverty-related expenditures, which increased sharply by 1.8 percentage points o f GDP, or
by over 12 percent p.a. in real per capita terms over a four year period (2001/02-2005/06).          The
Government promulgated the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act in June 2005, under
which it has committed itselfto specific targets o f fiscal adjustment and debt reduction.

/1 The inflation and export growthnumbersfor 2006/07-2009/10havebeenadjusted by the World Bank staff from the Governmentof
Pakistan's macroeconomicframework accordingto the actual numbersavailable for the periodofJuly to February, 2006/07.

12.        Rapid economic growth and an expansionary monetary policy contributed to strong aggregate
demand. This caused an upsurge in inflation, which increased to 9.3 percent in2004/05. The inflation
rate dropped to 7.9 percent in 2005/06 as the authorities took measures to tighten money supply.
Despite continued healthy growth in exports during the past two years, the external situation
deteriorated, as imports growth exceeded exports by a considerable margin. As the trade gap widened,
the current account has gone from a surplus to a deficit, which in 2005/06 is estimated to have
reached 4.4 percent o f GDP, despite sizeable increases in workers' remittances. The worsening
current account balance has been financed mainly through non-debt inflows as continued strong
foreign investors' interest led to a substantial increase inFDI.

13.        The 2000-2005 period has also been a period of relative political stability enabling
consistent policies and sustained implementation of the government's reform program.
Notwithstanding the fallout from the Afghan War and the war on terrorism, Pakistan i s benefiting
from a period o f relative stability that has contributed to the deepening o f reform. Elections in 2002
restored the National and Provincial Assemblies and despite occasional slowdowns in

implementation, the reform program was carried forward under the elected government. General
elections are due in 2007 and the prospects are good for maintenance o f the government's pro-reform
orientation. The second local government election in 2005 (the first was held in 2001), has led to the
institutionalization o f the new local government system. The decentralization initiative has started the
process o f transferring resources and responsibilitiesto local governments, laying the groundwork for
more responsive and accountable government at the local level as well as improved services.
Relations with India have improved markedly under the comprehensive dialogue launched in early
2003 and trade between the two countries is growing strongly, although from a low base.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
14.      Prospectsfor continuedrapidgrowthare good,provided that political andmacroeconomic
stability are maintained. The government is aiming to increase growth to 7-8 percent over the long
run. For this, it plans to continue to implement reforms to reduce the cost of doing business in
Pakistan, attract investment through the privatization program, and reduce infrastructure and human
development shortfalls. The SBP and the Government have expressed their commitment to control
inflationary pressures and the growing external imbalances, and are expected to take actions to
counter them.

15.      Measures to tighten money supply are beginning to have an impact. Since early 2005,
there has been a gradual tightening o f the money supply. Interest rates have increased;6 reserve and
liquidityrequirements ratios have been raised (by more than 2 percentage points inthe current fiscal
year); and the discount rate has been increased (by 50 basis points to 9.5 percent). These measures,
together with the relative stabilization of oil prices in internationalmarkets and crossing the hump o f
some lumpy imports, have led to a marked slow down in imports during the first 7 months of.
2006/07,' and import growth is projected at 11percent for 2006/07. This, however, did not result in
any significant improvement in the current account balance as exports too decelerated. The Pakistani
rupee has appreciated by around 12percent inreal terms over the past 18 months, which has aided the
strong growth in imports, and may have dampened exports. Nonetheless, the sudden and sharp
deceleration in exports from the beginning of this fiscal year may in part be due to structural factors
that have eroded international competitiveness.             Owing to higher non-debt inflows, the foreign
exchange reserves increased, albeit only marginally. While the current account deficit is projected to
remain highduring the next three years, increased capital inflows flows are predicted to be sufficient

              rates increasedfrom 1.7%in2003/04 to over 8% inthe currentyear.
 The growth    importsdecelerated from 31% in2005/06to 12% duringthe first sevenmonthsof2006/07.

to finance these as well as to contribute to a gradual build-up o f foreign exchange reserves, Non-debt
inflows are projected to remain strong as a result o f which foreign exchange reserves are projected at
3.6 months o f imports in 2006/07 and rising to 3.8 months for the next three years.

 16.      Tighter monetary policy has also led to some easing o f inflationary pressures. Consumer price
inflation declined somewhat from a peak o f 11.5 percent in April 2005 to 9 percent in July 2005 and
8.1 percent in January 2007. On the basis of a sharp deceleration inmonthly inflation in January, end-
year inflation is projectedto decline to 7.5 percent.

 17.      Exceptionally good revenue collection in 2006/07 contributes to an improved revenue
outlook. Tax revenue collection during the first half o f 2006/07 was 27 percent higher than the
corresponding period in the previous year, in spite o f the sharp deceleration in import-related taxes.
Direct taxes were higher by 66 percent, reflectingthe increasedprofitability o f the corporate sector, in
particular banking, energy and telecommunications, as well as better tax compliance due to the tax
administrationreforms within the Central Board o f Revenues (CBR). The fiscal deficit is, therefore,
projected to decline gradually from 4.2 percent o f GDP in 2005/06 to 3.5 percent by 2009/10. These
relatively low levels o f fiscal deficit will contribute to further improvements in Pakistan debt
indicators. Debt sustainability analysis has been carried out by the IMFand by the World Bank, and
indicates that the government's debt reduction path (which is prescribed in the Fiscal Responsibility
and Debt Limitation Law) is consistent with a sustainable debt outlook. The macroeconomic
framework thus provides the necessary assurance to proceedwith policy based support.

 18.      As discussed in paragraph 110, following the conclusion of the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) in2004, Pakistan is now on a standard Article IV surveillance schedule. IMF
post-program Monitoring was deemed unnecessary by the IMF's Board. An IMF Article N
Consultation mission took place in August 2006, and a Staff Report was discussed by the IMFBoard
inearly November 2006.

POVERTYAND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
19.       Economic growth has been accompanied by improvements in poverty and human
development but poverty and social deprivation still pose considerable challenges. Available
analysis o f the newly available Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) 2004-05
survey shows that poverty has fallen between 2000/01 and 2004/05. Estimates o fthe magnitude o fthe
poverty reduction between 2000/01 and 2004/05 vary from between 10.5 percentage points and 5
percentage points.8 The poverty headcount in both rural and urban areas has decreased, with a
somewhat larger decline inthe rural headcount. Poverty depth and severity have also fallen. Although
poverty has fallen, a significant share o f Palustan's population, particularly its rural population,
cannot meet basic needs. Moreover, vulnerability is a key feature o f poverty, with a significant share
o f the population clustered around the poverty line at risk of falling into poverty in response to an
economic shock.




* According to the CPI-based price index overall poverty declined from 34.4% to 23.9%. In urban areas, poverty declined
from 22.7% to 14.9% and in rural areas, from 39.3% to 28.1%. According to survey-based prices, overall poverty declined
from 33.3% to 28.3%. In urban areas, poverty declined from 22.0% to 18.4%, and in rural areas, from 37.9% to 32.9%. The
CPI based price index suffers from being collected only in urban areas, thereby leaving out rural areas where poverty is the
greatest. The survey based price data suffers from being very limited, collecting only food and transport prices, which are
unrepresentativeofthe items on which rural households actually expend.

    20.       The PSLM data also show significant improvements ina range o f Pakistan's social indicators
    including literacy, primary enrollment and immunization coverage (Table 2). Despite this progress,
    however, absolute levels o f social indicators are low and analysis suggests it will be difficult for
    Pakistan to achieve the MDGs for infant mortality, child malnutrition, primary completion, and
    elimination o f the gender gap inprimary enrollment. Pakistan's social indicators compare poorly with
    those o f other countries with similar levels o f per capita income. Only half o f Pakistan's adult
    population and just over a third o f its adult females are literate. Despite rapid progress in increasing
    primary enrollments across region and gender, only one out o f every two children age 5-9 years was
    enrolled in primary school in 2004/05. Gains at middle and secondary levels have been more modest
    and less uniform and less than one sixth o f the relevant age group i s enrolled in school. Moreover, at
    all levels o f school education, inequities between provinces, between urban and rural areas, and by
    socioeconomic status remain large. Concerted efforts to improve education and human development
    outcomes are important not only to improve equity but also as an integral part of Pakistan's growth
    objectives.

    21.       The FederalGovernment hasembarkedon a comprehensiveprogramto reducepoverty
    and improve human development outcomesincluding education. These initiatives at the national
    level provide potentially important momentum and strategic directions for reforms at the provincial
    level. Inturn, successful attainment o f the objectives o f these reforms requires complementary efforts
    in all Pakistan's provinces. Pakistan's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) presented in
    December 2003 and the refinements to the strategy in the five-year Medium Term Development
    Framework 2005-10 (MTDF) adopted with the 2005/06 budget constitute a comprehensive poverty
    reduction and growth strategy. The PRSP, whose targets are hlly aligned with the MDGs, emphasizes
    investing in human capital as a core element o f the strategy and recognizes that the provincial and
    district governments play an important role in improving the delivery o f basic social services.
    Pakistan's ambitious devolution reforms, strengthened by the 2005 local government elections, are a
    cornerstone o f the government's strategy for improving social service delivery by making the public
    sector more accountable to citizens and more efficient at delivering basic services. However there i s
    need to advance fiscal and administrative devolution to increase the ability and incentives for local
    governments to improve service delivery.

22.     At least five key recent initiatives launched by the Federal Government in its role of setting
strategic policy directions and national standards in education are expected to complement and
influence provincial education reforms to improve the quality of school education. First, a white
paper, based on a review of the 1998 National Education Policy has been prepared, which i s expected
to contribute to national debate and an update of the national policy. Second, a modem national
curriculum for school education has been designed and adopted, based on a comprehensive review
and considerable consultation with the private sector and provincial governments, constituting the
first such revision in twenty years.          The new cumculum improves the vertical and horizontal
progression of subjects from one grade level to the next, improves the linkage between concepts and
contents o f the curriculum and textbooks, strives to promote creative thinking, analysis and
application, and has removed controversial material. Third, a new National Text Book Policy i s
expected to lead to the gradual introduction o f country-wide competitive textbook development,
printing and publishing. Fourth, the first rounds o f the National Education Assessments in the 4'

gradeg provide national and cross-provincial baselines on student learning for the first time, and are
also beginning to provide insights into the factors affecting student achievement. Finally, the 2005
National Education Census complements provincial monitoring systems with comprehensive
information on all schools (public and private).


                                      I11       THE PROVINCIAL CONTEXT

23.        Sindh is Pakistan's secondmostpopulatedprovinceand also itssecondlargesteconomy.
Ithad an estimated population o f 36 million people in2005. A coastal province, strategically located
between Europe and the Far East, and the home o f Karachi, Sindh has historically been the country's
industrial and commercial hub. It is Pakistan's most urbanized province with about 50 percent o f its
population in urban areas. Its GDP was around US$28 billion in 2004-05. With GDP per capita at
$835 in 2004/5, it had the highest per capita income among the provinces." Following the slow
growth o f the 1990s and severe droughts in 1999-2001, Sindh has seen a broad based recovery
coinciding with the reforms initiatedat the federal level.

24.        Poverty has fallen more sharply than in other parts of the country and human
development indicators have also improved but rural Sindh continues to face challenges. In
2000/01 although the poverty headcount in Sindh was only slightly higher than the rest o f Pakistan,
rural Sindh had the highest and deepest poverty in the country. Sindh led other provinces in poverty
reduction between 2000/01 and 2004/05, driven primarily by a substantial decline in rural poverty
(Figure 2). The poverty trends, however, reflect the significant vulnerability o f the rural population in
Sindh. Moreover, although the poverty headcount is now the lowest among all provinces both in
urban and rural Sindh, and rural-urban gaps have fallen, rural poverty i s still high.Along with income
poverty, health and education indicators such as literacy rates, enrollment rates, and immunization
rates, have also improved in Sindh like in the rest o f Pakistan (Table 2). Nevertheless, most social
indicators remain below the national average reflecting the still substantially lower outcomes inrural
areas. Addressing the l o w human development indicators in rural Sindh i s critical to achieving
Pakistan's growth andpoverty reduction objectives.

FISCALDEVELOPMENTS,OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES
25.        Provincialfinances haveimprovedinrecent years, reflectingthe improvedeconomyand
increasedrevenueflows fromthe federal government,but also the fiscal reformsunderthe SRP
supported by the SSAC. Under the SRP, provincial taxes were rationalized, the backlog o f
provincial deferred payments was largely cleared, debt servicing expenditures reduced through early
retirement o f expensive federal debt, and the composition o f public expenditures was improved by
reducing non-priority expenditure (e.g. provincial untargeted subsidies) and improving the mix o f
development and O&M expenditures. Inpart as a result of the continued benefits o f these reforms, as
well as the increased revenue transfers from the federal government, the present fiscal situation o f the
province is stable (Table 3). After over a decade o f fiscal deficits, although o f manageable
proportions, Sindh showed small fiscal surpluses in 2003104 and 2004/05. The improvements in the
fiscal balance were achieved despite increases in the PRSP-related expenditures by more than 140%,
and overall development expenditure by 3.5 times over the last five years.

26.      All debt-related parameters have shown considerable improvement. Together with the
increased revenue transfers from the federal government, the debt reduction strategy adopted by the
province has helped it in creating additional space o f 1.2% o f provincial GDP between 2001/02 and
2005/06." Although, between 2001/02 and 2005/06, public debt o f the province has increased at a
rate of 2% p.a., the overall government debt as a share o f provincial GDP has declined from 10.1% in
2001/02 to 6.2% in 2005/06. Moreover, the composition o f the debt has improved with a fall in the
share o f the more expensive debt, reducing the interest liabilities of the provincial government at a
rate o f about 4% p.a. Looking forward, short o f an unlikely huge external fiscal shock, the debt
situation o f the province i s likely to improve significantly. While the pace o f the improvement will
depend on the strategy adopted by the provincial government, even inthe most conservative scenario,
public debt as a share of PGDP, its Net Present Value and the ratio o f debt servicing to provincial
revenue will fall. (Annex 6).

27.       These improvements, together with the fiscal and expenditure framework embodied in the
Medium Term Fiscal Framework (paragraph 61) constitute an appropriate fiscal and expenditure
program. Fiscal relations with the Federal Government are satisfactory and do not undermine
provincial incentives for fiscal policy reform.




"Abouttwo-thirdofthisfiscalspaceisattributabletotheincreasedtransfersfromfederalgovernment,whiletheremaining
one-third is due to reduction in interest payments, partly to accelerated reduction in provincial debt to the federal
government. As discussed earlier, a large portion of this fiscal space was utilized to increase the provincial development
expenditure.

                                                            13

28.       Nevertheless, there is need to address some outstanding weaknesses and particularly to
introduce an outcome focus and a medium term perspective in budget processes, to further
strengthen provincial finances. Perhaps the most important structural issue is the need to strengthen
budget processes. Since the very beginning, the provincial budget has been prepared on an annual
basis with primarily an input focus and little or no linkage with to outputs and outcomes. As a logical
consequence, no systematic review is undertaken to assess the budgetary implication o f government's
current actions and new initiatives. An example o f this i s the separation o f the development budget
from its future impact on recurrent budget discussed below. In order to enhance fiscal discipline,
improve the effectiveness o fpublic expenditure, give a medium-term perspective to its budget-making
and make it focus more on outputs and outcomes rather than inputs, the provincial finance authorities
intend to move to a Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF) in a phased manner. Embodied inthis
and thus in future annual budgets will be appropriate compositions o f development and recurrent
expenditures, and the province's strategy for own source revenue mobilization.

29.       The provincial development program (ADP) has increased to over 5 times in the last 4 years,
as the provincial government has attempted to address the accumulated unmet development needs
since the adverse fiscal situation in the 1990s. While affordable within the improved resource
position, there is need for commensurate strengthening in the planning, programming and
implementation capacity of the province, as well as in the financial management system and
accountability mechanisms, to ensure the effective use o f these fiscal resources. Importantly, large
increases in development spending have implications for O&M budgets in the future. The end-year
throw-forward o f development portfolio was 4.6 years in 2005/06, implyingthat it would take at least
4.6 years to complete all the schemes included in the development budget at present allocation
levels." Reducing the end-year throw forward would increase the ability o f the province to respond to
changing expenditure needs.

30.       On the revenue side, as in the case o f other provinces there is room to increase medium- to
long-term sustainability o f provincial finances by reducing dependence on federal transfer^.'^ On the
positive side, the amendment to the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award by the President on
January 19, 2006, will strengthen provincial finances, and Sindh i s likely to get an additional Rs. 50
billion between 2006/07 and 2010/11. In addition, the energy-related "straight transfer^"'^, in which
Sindh has the maximum share, have been increasing at a much faster rate than any other revenue head.
Provincial own-source revenue has grown at a normal rate o f 13%-14% p.a. In part, growth in
provincial own-source revenue in Sindh i s constrained relative to other provinces as unlike other
provinces, Sindh has devolved three provincial taxes, including the relatively broad-based Urban
Immoveable Property Tax (UIPT), to the district governments and Taluka/Town Management
Authorities (TMAs). Inaddition, most provincial tax-bases, with the exception of Motor Vehicles Tax
(MVT) and Infrastructure Development Cess (IDC), have not grown at the same rate as the economy.
Despite these constraints, it will be important to at least maintain, and gradually enhance, own-source
revenue mobilization as a strategy to reduce dependence on federal transfers and in particular,
revenues from exhaustible oil and gas resources.




  This impliesthat it would take at least4.5 years to complete all the schemes included in the development budget at present
allocationlevels, even ifno new schemes are includedinthe development programduring this period. A part of the recent
increaseinthe throwforward,however, is attributableto federal schemes beingimplementedinthe provinceon a cost sharing
basis.
l3The revenuetransfers (including tax and non-taxtransfers from NFC-relatedand straight transfers, andgrants) from federal
government amounted to 84% of all provincial revenuein2001/02. By 2005/06, this share has increasedto 86%. With new
NFC-formulabeing adopted from 2006/07 and the rapid increasein energy-relatedstraight transfers, the share o f federally
transferredrevenueintotal is likely to increaseeven more infuture.
l4These remainoutside the (amended) NFC award.

EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENTSAND CHALLENGES
31.       Enrollment rates in Sindh have improved, particularly in primary schools in rural
areas, but are still low in rural Sindh where gender gaps are also still significant. As seen in
Table 2, literacy rates in Sindh improved significantly between 1998 and 2005. Education indicators
also improved between 1998 and 2005, reflecting in particular large improvements in primary
education and inrural areas.15 With the exception o f girls in middle schools, there has been little or
no progress at middle and secondary levels. Despite this progress, education indicators are still low in
rural Sindh, and the province still lags behind Punjab and the NWFP in rural areas. The rural-urban
gap is much worse than the gender gap which itself is largely a rural phenomenon (Figure 3). The
disparities are best seen in comparing urban males with rural females: for every 100 boys who enroll
inprimary and highschool inurban Sindh, only 43 and 17 girls do so respectively inrural Sindh. In
2004/05, the NER for rural girls was only 29 percent inprimary, 13 percent inmiddle, and 10 percent
inmatric. Inurbanareas, the primary gaps arebetween the richestandpoorest quintiles.

32.       Low enrollment rates in rural Sindh reflect primarily low entry rates into primary
schools, but also low transition rates from primary to secondary. A striking finding from the
household data is the staggering share o f rural children who are completely missed by the school
system in rural Sindh (Figure 4). Over 70 percent o f rural girls in Sindh had never been to school.
This share i s highest in Sindh compared to the rest o f Pakistan. According to the household data,
children who do enroll have fairly highcompletion rates: about 96 percent o f urban boys, 97 percent
o f urban girls, 92 percent o f rural boys and 91 percent o f rural girls who have started schooling have
actually completed primary education. On the other hand, low enrollment rates also reflect low
transition rates from primary to secondary education. Only about 80 percent o f urban boys, 76
percent o f urban girls, 67 percent o f rural boys and 46 percent o f rural girls16 stay enrolled for some
middle or secondary education.




IsThe sharp increase inpoverty between 1998/99 and 2001/02 was accompanied by declines inparticipation rates duringthis
period, mainly in urban areas and for boys. However, most groups saw increases in (or more or less stable) participation
since 2001.
  Estimates for completion and transition are for children aged 11 to 17.

33.       Administrative data show a contrasting picture on completion rates. Although primary
completion rates are high according to the household data, the administrative data show a contrasting
situation o f highdrop out rates within primary, and offer useful insights. Administrative data, like the
householddata confirm that girls inrural Sindh are much less likely to enroll at all compared to boys.
They also confirm a significant drop-off between primary and middle schools for both boys and girls
but proportionately higher for girls. However, in sharp contrast to the household data, they show
much lower completion rates in primary school. In particular they show extremely high drop out
between grades 1 and 2 (once again proportionately higher for girls). The large discrepancy most
likely reflects a large number o f children who register for first grade but never attend for any
meaningful lengtho f time. Future monitoring efforts will focus on better understanding this huge drop
o f f and better monitoring attendance after enrollment.

34.       Recently available evidence on student achievement shows low qualityof education. Two
years o fresults o f grade 4 standardized tests from the National Education Assessment System (NEAS)
are now available. Additional information on learning outcomes is available from the 2006 rural
schools survey. Both sources show that learning outcomes in Sindh, as in the rest o f Pakistan, are
below curricular requirements (Box 2). For example, according to the NEAS 2006, both in Sindh, and
inPakistan, scores were significantly below the set meanespecially inlanguageandmathematics. The
mean score inmathematics in Sindh was comparable to the rest o f the nation while the mean score in
Urduwas significantly higherthan inother provinces (Figure 5).

35.        The remaining paragraphs in this section examine some o f the causes o f poor outcomes and
key constraints to improving education outcomes based on analysis from recently available data
sources (Box 1).

                                         Box 2: Learningoutcomes in Sindh
This box summarizes key findings on student learning outcomes in mathematics and language and on their
determinants from (i)     the 2006 round o f grade 4 standardized tests carried out in Sindh and nationwide in
covernment schools only; and (ii)    the 2006 Schools Survey inrural Sindh (Box 1) which includes a (very) small
sample o f private schools. In the NEAS, students' achievement is assessed on the basis o f their scores on tests
which provide a measure o f how well the students can answer questions based o n the National Curriculum.
Scaled scores are used, with the scale used the same as inTIMSS, SAT, TOEFL, etc. The range o f scaled scores
is 0-1000, and the achievement scales are constructed so that a student achieving 50% correct marks receives a
scaled score o f 500 and the standard deviation o f the scale i s set at 100.

    Learning outcomes are low: In the NEAS, both in Sindh, and in Pakistan, scores were significantly below
    the set mean especially in language and mathematics. The mean score in mathematics in Sindh was
    comparable to rest o f the nation while the mean scores in Urdu were significantly higher than in other
    provinces. To some extent this reflects the significantly higher performance o f Sindhi mediumstudents inthe
     language test.

     Inthe NEAS, nationwide, mathematics results were better when it came to number recognition and simple
     mathematical processes while results were weakest when it came to conceptual applications o f processes,
     definitions, relations and measurement or ingeometry or spatial competencies. Inlanguage, performance the
     most difficult areas were narrative or persuasive writing, and reading for connection, while students did
    better at reading for information, or general understanding.

     The rural Schools Survey (Box 1) also showed that students' knowledge inmathematics i s behind curricular
    requirements inrural Sindh. While mathematics questions with fractions and decimals are difficult for most
     students in grade 5, and the majority o f students are behind curricular requirements, even simple operations
     are not acquired by all students. For example only 84% o f fifth graders were able to do simple subtraction
     comparable to grade 1 in the curriculum. Results in language were also low - with only about half o f fifth
     graders able to answer questions based on a paragraph, or give plurals or opposites o f selected words.

    Schools can make a large dzference to learning outcomes. Usefil insights into the determinants o f learning
     outcomes emerge. First, girls do significantly better than boys in language but there i s no discernable
     difference in mathematics. Second, while family background (such as family wealth) is important, the
     characteristics o f the particular school are far more important, washing away the impact o f most personal or
     family background variables. In other words, differences in learning outcomes between children would fall
     significantly if all children presently attending "bad" schools were to attend "good" schools. Third, students
     attending private schools do significantly better and this difference inperformance is not due to the fact that
     children attending private schools are from relatively better off households or villages. In fact, learning
     outcomes inprivate schools are better even after controlling for differences inschool infrastructure, teacher
     qualifications and teacher presence in schools, suggesting that the incentive and accountability mechanisms
     inprivate schools are associated with better learning outcomes. These latter two results, derived from staff
     analysis from the rural schools survey (Box I),   apply to rural areas.

    Learning outcomes are better when teachers show up to teach, when teachers have a bachelor's degree,
     and when schools have a better physical environment. After controlling for other background characteristics,
     student learning outcomes are better when a teacher is absent fewer days and when helshe has at least a
    bachelor's degree. More than two-thirds o f primary teachers do not have a bachelor's degree inrural Sindh.
     In-service training as is presently being designed and delivered does not increase student learning. Better
     school amenities as represented by an index o f availability o f electricity, water, toilets and a boundary wall
     are associated with better outcomes. Yet, school infrastructure is seriously lacking and schools are also
    poorly equipped with sitting and writing space, working blackboards, supplies of consumables, etc.

A. Issues in Public Education Expenditures

36.         Publicexpenditures on education are still low. Fiscal reforms have increased the space for
pro-poor expenditures including on education and consolidated education expenditures have increased
at nearly 17.5 percent per annum in nominal terms (about 10.1 percent per annum inreal terms) over
the past four years (Table 4 and Annex 5). The composition o f the education budget has also
improved, as the share o f non-salary recurrent and development expenditures has increased and the
share o f salaries in the education budget fell from 84 percent in 2001/02 to 75 percent in 2005/06,
reflecting in particular the provincial initiatives (e.g. textbooks and stipends) financed under the
education reform program. Despite these improvements, education financing was still low, at about 20
percent o f the total provincial budget and 1.3 percent of provincial GDP in 2005/06, and key non-
salary and development inputsin schools remainedunderfinanced.

37.          Weak implementation, low overall accountability o f sector management (see below), together
with weaknesses inthe overall fiduciary environment (paragraph 133) which also affect the education
sector, reduce the effectiveness o f education spending.               Accountability in education spending is
particularly undermined by the significant backlog on addressing audit issues, and delays in the
availability o f accurate fiscal information for decisionmaking and for public scrutiny.

B. Issuesin SectorManagement

38.         There are weaknesses ineducation management at all levels. The provincial government
i s still making the transition to effectively steer and monitor reforms, while weak capacity,
limited autonomy and lack of accountability limit effective service delivery by districts. The
provincial education department has been transitioning, with devolution, from being the main
deliverer o f education services, to its new role in policy making and planning, setting standards,
monitoring, and provision o f technical support. The transition has suffered in part due to lack o f
clarity inthe roles o f the district and provincial governments (Box 3). Another constraint has been the
poor quality o f information, weak monitoring and supervision capacity and weak linkages between
policy formulation and data collection and analysis. Data collection and analysis were
administratively separate from policy formulation. Vertical linkages in the information chain were
also weak and the limited use o f data from the education management system for effective monitoring
contributed to its poor quality and limitedreliability.

39.         Limited fiscal autonomy, lack o f accountability for outcomes, and weak capacity are key
constraints to effective service delivery by local governments.First,until2006107, only the non-salary
budget was transferred through the district account IV and that too with significant delays. District
governments - which are heavily dependent on provincial transfers - have thus been limited in the
regular availability o f funds and in their ability to allocate resources in line with priorities, including
education service delivery. Second, in a devolved set up, the senior district management plays a

                                                            19

critical role for service delivery. Yet, in the transition towards full administrative devolution, senior
district management i s not yet adequately accountable to elected local governments.                         Tensions
between provincial and district governments have often contributed to politically motivated postings
as well as frequent transfers o f senior education managers, reducing the accountability o f district
management to elected local governments for improved service delivery. This also reduces the
accountability o f front-line providers in schools, including teachers, and contributes to high levels of
teacher transfers. Third, there i s a lack o f clarity in the roles o f various education managers at district
and sub-district levels, and qualifications and training o f senior management staff are not
commensurate with their responsibilities. Opportunities for professional development are limited and
uncoordinated. There is virtually no system o f quality assurance - the quality of school supervision i s
poor, there is almost no external evaluation o f schools, nor i s there any support or advice on
pedagogcal or school management issues provided to schools, head-teachers and teachers.

                                            Box 3: DevolutioninPakistan
Pakistan's devolution initiative is a cornerstone o f the government's strategy for improving service delivery by
making the public sector more accountable to citizens and more efficient indelivering basic services. Creation o f
the political structure for devolution began in 2001 with the creation o f a new local government structure
consisting o f over 6,400 new elected governments. New local governments were sworn in following local
government elections in August 2005. However, while political devolution has moved rapidly, fiscal and
administrative decentralization have progressed more slowly. Thus incentives for improved efficiency inthe use
o f public resources, for increased accountability o f service providers to elected govemments, and for service
providers to be accountable to citizens have not yet been fully realized.                 Lack o f clarity in roles and
responsibilities between provincial and district governments, inadequate fiscal and a e s t r a t i v e autonomy, and
capacity constraints o f local governments are some o f the constraints to full realization o f benefits. Addressing
these and other constraints will take time; however it is generally accepted that devolution offers the best
prospect for improved service delivery and access by the poor to all services, including education. On January
19,2006, the president amended the 1997NFC award, which now transfers additional resources to the provincial
government. It should alleviate some of the fiscal pressures being faced by provincial and, in turn, local
governments.

40.      Client power can be increased, and the performance of schools improved, by increasing
the effectiveness of School Management Committees (SMCs). Sindh perhaps went the furthest
under its ESR program in establishing functional SMCs and in giving them powers beyond
maintenance and repair, to include monitoring o f schools and teachers, construction o f shelterless
schools, etc. It was also the only province to have formally incorporated local political leadership
within SMCs, thus giving councilors a direct stake inthe affairs o f the local schools. As a result, the
majority o f primary schools in Sindh have SMCs. Available evidence from Sindh" (as from other
provinces in Pakistan) shows that well functioning SMCs can improve quality and access and that
active parent and community participation has contributed to improved attendance, improvements in
school infrastructure and materials, and improved teacher regularity. However, the performance of
SMCs varies. Key outstanding challenges increasing school management in most schools are: (i)
limited participation o f parents and community members; (ii) o f understanding o f roles and
                                                                                  lack
responsibilities; (iii)  although improved inrecent years, funding i s still irregular or delayed and bears
almost no relationshipto school size, while funds are often not utilized; (iv) expectations from SMCs
well beyond their capacities; and (v) poor quality o f leadership in schools, and no clear objectives and
plans for improvement.

                             Box 4: Decomposing Enrollment Trends between 2001 and 2004
A preliminary analysis o frecent enrollment trends from the PRHS panel data provides insights into the relative importance
o f income versus other factors in explaining the observed increases in the participation o f rural girls in Sindh and Punjab.
The focus is on entry rates which are staggeringly low for rural girls in Sindh. Between 2001 and 2004, there were
substantial gains for girls -both absolutely and relative to boys - inthe proportion o f 7-16 year old children ever enrolled
inschool (including pre-school) in2001 and2004. This gainwas observed for all age groups 7-9, 10-12, 13-15 and 16-18
years. The gains were larger inSindh - which also had far lower base (i.e., 2001) girls' school enrollment - than Punjab.
Comparisons o fproportions ever enrolled, even for a given age, however, confound year and cohort effects.

Period effects occur due to shifts in the economic/policy environment over the recent time that could have impacted all
cohorts (i.e. children of different ages) who could potentially have entered primary school in response to these shifts.
Period effects may be further decomposed into the influences of different factors such as income growth or recent policy
changes. Cohort effects are due to longer-run trends that affect successive cohorts o f children, possibly the result o f
economic development or past policies. It should be noted that the period between 2001 and 2004 coincided with the
launch of Sindh's Education Sector Reform Programs. Punjab's reforms gainedmomentum about two years later.

The figure below presents the main results. In Sindh, the proportion o f girls ever enrolled in school rose 20% points
between 2001 and 2004. A third o f this rise was a cohort trend- i.e. in2004 girls eligible to enter school were born three
years later than those in2001 and thus more likely to be enrolled. The rest (two-thirds) was a period effect across all the
cohorts (i.e. those who were 5-12 years old in 2001).        In Punjab, both the overall rise in girls' enrollment and the
proportion attributable to the period effect were much smaller than inSindh. The gender gap inenrollment closed inboth
provinces between 2001and 2004, but more so in Sindh, where the gap was initially much greater. For girls in Sindh, a
substantial portion - but still less than half - o f the period effect can be explained by growth in household incomes.
Almost none o f the period effect inSindh canbe explained by a change inavailability o f schools as there was no change in
availability inthe sample; inPunjab the little positive increase insupply observed had a significant positive impact on girls
enrollment.

The findings have some useful insights for policy. First, increases inincome played an important -but only partial -role in
Sindh and other (unexplained) factors were also important. Other factors could have contributed to increasing demand for
girls schooling, or to addressing supply side constraints (e.g. school or teacher quality), including some o f the reforms
supported through the ESR. Further analysis would be needed to establish magnitudes and roles o f different factors.
Second, the importance of income effects suggests a role for policies to relieve affordability constraints from direct and
opportunity costs at the primary level. Third, no income effect was found invillages that did not have a primary school
suggesting that demand and supply side policies are complementary and cannot be viewed inisolation.

C. Constraintsin increasingaccess to quality education

41.         Poor infrastructure, low availability of functioning schools and of female teachers is a
constraint, and more so for girls. The recent household surveys confirm that physical access is
important for starting school, particularly inrural areas, and that children - especially girls - are more
likely to start school if there i s a primary and middle school nearby. While access i s important, most
children live near a primary school, even inrural Sindh, and only about 4% o f children live more than
30 minutes away from a primary school. Sindh has a large number o f government primary schools -
approximately 42,000 for a total enrollment o f about 3.2 million children - and nearly 90% o f these
schools are rural. Physical access is, however a serious constraint at the middle and higher levels.
About two-thirds o f rural children live very far (more than 30 minutes away by foot) from a middle
school. There are only 2600 middle schools, 1900 of which are inrural areas o f which about 500 are
girls' schools.

42.         Even at primary level, however, the large number o f schools overestimates the availability o f
schools that meet minimumphysical standards and are actually functioning (Figure 6). The condition
o f school infrastructure is particularly poor in Sindh; nearly a quarter of its schools lack shelter.
About 16% o f schools and 28% o f girls' schools are non-functional. The majority o f schools are
small, with one or two (often overcrowded) classrooms and a single teacher. Lack o f shelter and basic
facilities (building, water, toilets, and electricity) is associated with lower student attendance and poor
quality o f teaching and learning." After teacher-related issues (para 48), lack of physical facilities are
the next major reason for school closures and non-regular functioning o f schools.

43.         There is a considerable lack o f female teachers. At the primary level, there are five times
more male than female teachers inrural areas. Girls who want to be taught by female teachers must go
to girls' schools and the larger class size in girls' schools reflects a demand for female teachers.
Although both types o f schools admit girls, administrative data show that 63% o f boys' schools and
54% o f mixed gender schools do not have a single girl left in grade 5. Controlling for school and
village characteristics, girls' schools (perhaps because o f the female teaching force) retain girls better
than boys and mixed schools. Given the shortage o f middle schools for girls, about 45 percent o f girls
inmiddle schools attendmixedgender schools with male teachers. Inparticular, girls livinginpoorer
villages are caught in a vicious cycle where fewer schools, poor school infrastructure, and low initial

 availability o f female teachers have perpetuated low female participation in schooling, maintaining
 low availability o f teachers.

44.         High costs, low perceived returns and social constraints reduce demand, while poor
 implementation of Sindh's incentive programs has reduced their effectiveness. Poverty, parental
 education, and the high direct and indirect costs of sending children to schools are other important
reasons for l o w attendance. Together with poor quality o f schools and low perceived returns they
reduce demand. Sindh pioneered many o f the interventions subsequently adopted by other provinces
to encourage families to send children to school and to reduce costs, including free education and free
textbooks for grades 1-10, and a scholarship program for all girls in middle and secondary school^'^.
However, weak implementation and monitoring meant that the programs have not had the potential
 desired impact. Textbooks reached with delays and shortfalls relative to needs. Stipends were either
not receivedat all, receivedwith delays, or in significantly reduced amounts2'.

45.         In addition, despite these initiatives, recent household surveys still point to affordability
 constraints2' and high direct (and particularly opportunity)                       costs. Costs o f uniforms and
transportation, for example, are not negligible, particularly for rural families. Opportunity costs are
 also high: recent household surveys as well as the school survey report a high incidence o f work by
 children - boys and girls alike - even from a very young age. Many are unable to combine work and
 school and the tradeoff increases as children get older.                While the returns to education have been
increasing, they are still low upto matric (tenth grade), and increase significantly only at higher levels,
and may not yet provide sufficient incentive for rural parents who see few chances o f going beyond
matric.

46.         Recent evidence from the Country Gender Assessment suggests that highdirect costs (such as
transportation) and indirect costs (opportunity costs and concerns about grls' securityheputation) are
a particular constraint for girls o f middle and high school age. The presence o f a school in the
settlement has an important impact on attendance of girls at middle and highschool ages, particularly
inthe villages o f Sindh and southern Punjab with scattered settlements2'. This is true even within a
household where the location o f a school in the settlement has a greater impact on school attendance
decisions for daughters but not for sons. The report presents evidence that rural households who send
their girls to school incur considerably higher travel costs as girls approach middle school age, and
this i s most likely due to cultural norms and safety concerns (Figure 7). It recommends targeted
interventions to rural girls to address the higher costs and security concerns.

47.        The potential of the private sector as a partner in increasing access to quality education
i s yet to be fully exploited. A strilung feature of education in Palustan, and indeed, in the urban
centers inKarachi, i s the significant role played by the non-government sector, including the low cost
private sector. Between 27-29 percent o f enrollments at all levels of school education inPakistan are
in non-public schools. Although urban and better off populations are more likely to use private
schools, these schools also cater to the rural and poor populations (Figure 8). About 16percent of the
children fiom the poorest quintile in Pakistan and 12 percent in Sindh attend primary schools run by
the private or non-government sector, and the proportions are similarly significant at middle and high
school levels. Rural private schools offer better quality schooling (Box 2) and at lower                                          The
private sector has contributed much o f the recent growth in enrollments in urban Sindh; however its
share inrural Sindh has not increased. It i s virtually absent outside the large urban center~:*~urbanto
rural ratios inprivate school enrollments are 10.8 times inSindh, 2.3 times inPunjab, and 5.3 times in
Balochistan, reflecting the uneven penetration o f this sector in Sindh. Sindh has been home to a
number of innovations inpartneringwith the non-government sector, including programs runthrough
the Sindh Education Foundation. However, the existing models o f partnerships rely heavily on
facilitation/establishment/adoption approaches which do not lend themselves to the rapid scaling up
neededto have an appreciable impact quality and access.




23The findings in Box 2 are based on the schools survey (see Box 1) which has a relatively small sample o f private schools in
Sindh. However, a recent WB Policy Research paper (No. 4067, by Das, Pandey and Zajonc) finds similar results higher
learning levels in private schools in Punjab compared to public schools on average, and also large variation within public
schools. Andrabi, Das and Khwaja (WB policy research paper no. 4066, Nov 2006) find that the average fee o f a rural private
school in Punjab is Rs. 6 a day. These schools hire predominantly local, female, and moderately educated teachers who have
limited alternative opportunities outside the village. Hiringthese teachers at low cost allows the savings to be passed on to
parents through low fees. This mechanism
are minimized    - defines                    - the need to hire teachers with a certain demographic profile so that salary costs
                           the possibility of private schools: where they arise, fees are low. It also defines their limits. Private
schools are horizontallyconstrained inthat they arise in villages where there is a pool o f secondary educatedwomen.
24Unlike Punjab and NWFP, most "private" schools in rural Sindh are NGO schools such as the Fellowship, Baanh Beli, etc.

 D. Constraintsin improvingteachingand learning

 48.         Patronagebasedrecruitmentof teachers compromisestheir quality and accountability,
 and, therefore, effective teaching and learning. Effective teachers are at the heart of any
 educational system and all other measures to improve the quality o f education will only produce
 results if there are capable and committed teachers in the classrooms. Patronage based recruitment
 although an issue in all provinces, has historically been more significant in Sindh, compromising the
 quality o f teachers recruited and thus teaching and learning.25Political interference inrecruitment and
 postings also reduces teacher accountability and contributes to a highdegree o f absenteeism. Nearly a
 quarter o f schools in the 2006 rural schools survey (see Box 1) reportedthat teacher absenteeism was
 a problem, while about 13% o f teachers were absent on the day o f the surveg6. Monitoring
 mechanisms for teacher presence are weak, and there are limited opportunities to reward good
 performance or to discipline non-performing teachers. A highincidence o f transfers also contributes
 to wide disparities in student-teacher ratios and inefficient use o f existing resources. Several studies
 have documented teacher related issues - including teacher quality, teacher non-availability, or
 teacher absence - as the primary reason for school closureshon-functional schools, low or irregular
 student attendance and limited teaching and learning.

 49.       To begin to address these, the GoS adopted a policy o f facility based recruitment o f teachers
 on contract basis under its ESR in 2001. Available evidence suggests that contract recruitment in
 Sindh has been associated with lower teacher absenteeism." Teachers who live inthe same village are
 also less likely to be absent (Figure 9) - likely due to lower commuting costs and increased
 accountability to local communities. In a more recent innovation, the GoS has introduced a test
 developed by reputable independent institutions to select competent teachers. Outstanding problems,
 however, include (i)significant pressure leading to regularization o f primary teachers recruited on
 contracts and the associated reduction in accountability; (ii)                     significant room for discretion in the
 recruitment process, due to the disproportionatelyhighweight o f interviews inthe process; and (iii)                                   a
 need to ensure that the test is based on the key competencies for teachers.



 25 See Hasnain (2005), "The Politics o f Service Delivery inPakistan," World Bank, Report no. SASPR-6
 26 About half o f teachers absent on the day o f the survey had given prior notice o f their absence. The figure o f 13% i s most

50.     Poor quality of teaching and learning results not only from deficiencies in teacher
recruitment, but from serious gaps in the mechanismsfor trainingand further development of
teachers. Existingevidence shows overwhelmingly that professional teacher training - as presently
provided - does not improve learning outcomes (Box 2). The primary reason i s that Initial Teacher
Education (ITE) and "In-service Training" (Inset) o f teachers within Sindh have developed in a
piecemeal fashion as a result o f which there are overlaps, duplications and gaps in the system o f
training and further development o f teachers. At present, these systems are not effective inbuilding
and sustaining effective teaching shlls, appropriately retaining these within specific phases o f
education, and thus sustaining effective learning. There are four key issues. First, ITE relies
excessively on centralized governmental provision which is qualification based. The opportunity for
teaching practice before qualification is virtually non-existent, and there is no effective induction of
new teachers into their posts.28And there are no universal standards and competencies at the core of
the process. Second, ITE and inset are being provided by government bodies whose functions and
responsibilities have become blurred (notably the Bureau o f Curriculum, BOC, and the Provincial
Institute for Teacher Education, PITE).

51.      Third, the concept for "development" is that teachers progress from being qualified to and
workmg in primary education, through middle and secondary schools, and then possibly through
higher education or sometimes into education management at the district level. There i s no concept o f
"promoted posts" o f some kind o f responsibility at the school level (other than that o f head-teacher in
middle and secondary schools) which would provide motivation, instigation o f leadership capabilities,
opportunities for supporting and improving teacher quality, and the basis for more coherent
professional development process relating to such a "career path" (commonly referred to as
"Continuing Professional Development").              There i s no real incentive to improve practice (through the
acquisition of lmowledge and slulls) and no tangible rewards for doing so. The development o f a
cadre or career path for teachers is also necessary as a longer term solution to address some o f the
inherent difficulties relating to pressures for regularization, pension payments etc. associated with
contract employment.

52.     Fourth, the criteria and process for the selection o f teachers to undertake development are not
transparent and (with the exception of some programs organized by NGOs and donors) has not been
based on any form o f training needs analysis. Not surprisingly then it i s frequently the same teachers

*'Otherthansome NGO/donorsupportedprograms.

                                                             26

who attend the training course, and benefits o f the training to the school are minimal. Moreover, a
significant proportion o f professional development i s undertaken during school time and i s confined
to specific locations that require travel; a fact that mitigates against female teachers who are already
inshort supply at locallevels.

53.     There is insufficient feedback on student learning, but this is changing with the
implementationof, and gradual improvements in, the National Education Assessment System
(NEAS). A sound system o f assessing student achievement can play an important role inproviding
feedback on the quality of education and in improving teaching and learning inthe classroom. Until
the introduction o f the NEAS, only available information on student learning achievement was from
the high stakes grade 9 and 10 exit examinations, which are also used for college admissions. There
was no feedback available on student learning achievement at earlier grades inthe system. Moreover,
several problems with these exit examinations limit their usefulness as tools to monitor student
learning*'.   A particular problem with these, as with the majority o f internal assessment processes in
public schools, is the excessive emphasis on the reproduction of factual knowledge, which reinforces
approaches to teaching and learning that reward memorizationand rote learning.

54.      The NEAS, a large scale external assessment, has now been implementedtwice ingrade 4 and
the first large scale assessment in grade 8 i s being carried out in 2007. There are still several
challenges that need to be addressed to improve the reliability o f this system for tracking student
learning achievement. These include the need to introduce performance standards to enhance
interpretation, to strengthen analysis, dissemination and use for policy purposes, and to improve the
quality o f the instrument in assessing critical thinking skills. There i s also a need to institutionalize
the NEAS, beyond the project to a more permanent function o f the Federal Ministry o f Education. At
the same time, the system needs to be strengthened and used within provinces as a meaningful tool to
increase accountability and to provide feedback for policy evaluation and design. Immediate
challenges include: (i)      the need to define the role o f the Provincial Education Assessment Center
(PEAC) as a permanent function o f the provincial education system, rather than an arm serving the
NEAS; (ii)   to strengthen the capacity to support this role; and (iii) strengthen the assessment itself
                                                                                   to
to support provincial education reforms (including through a possible revision o f the sample design to
enable more disaggregated information, inclusion o f province specific information in background
questionnaires and its analysis, regular analysis and dissemination o f assessment results at the
provincial level).



             IV.       THE SINDHEDUCATIONSECTORREFORMPROGRAM

55.      To address the challenges and key constraints highlighted in the previous section, the
Government o f Sindh has adopted a medium term Education Sector ReformProgram (SERP) in2007.
The vision for the SERP builds on the lessons from the sector reformprogram initiated in2001, while
further deepening and broadeningthe reforms. Inparticular, it recognizes that education reforms can
only be successful when sector specific reforms aimed at improving quality and access are included in
a broader framework that improves accountability in the sector. It also acknowledges that education
reforms cannot be successful in isolation, but need to be embedded in a broader reform framework
that ensures fiscal sustainability and improves the fiduciary environment.

56.        The objectives o f the Government's medium term education sector reform program are to
improve participation, retention and transition, reduce gender and regional disparities, and improve


29 Problems include their non-comparability with other provinces as well as within the province (between different
examinations boards), low credibility due to large scale cheating and other malpractices, and deficiencies in analysis and
dissemination. Efforts are underway at the national level to improve the quality and administration o f lothgrade exams.

                                                              27

quality inelementary and secondary education. The specific targets o f the program are to: (i)              increase
net enrollment rates inprimary, middle and secondary education from 48%, 18% and 12% in2004/05
to 59%, 22% and 14%respectively in2009/10, (ii)                increase the share o f girls inprimary and inmiddle
schools in rural areas from 36% and 28% to 40% and 31% respectively between 2005106 and
2009/10; (iii)    increase the transition rate for rural girls from primary to middle school from 47% to
50% between 2005/06 and 2009/10; and (iv) to regularly monitor completion rates3' as well as
learning outcomes in language and mathematics3'. The Government o f Sindh recognizes that
improving education outcomes i s a long term process that could span one or more decades, but
expects to make appreciable progress in improving indicators in the medium term. Based on regular
feedback on progress inmeeting its objectives, it will adjust the reforms as needed.

57.       The reform program is based on four complementary pillars to address the key constraints to
improving education outcomes. All four pillars are designed to improve quality, equity and efficiency
in education service delivery. Importantly, all four pillars improve accountability in the education
sector.    Pillar 1 improves accountability for public education expenditures by linhng budgetary
allocations to outcomes, and through financial management and procurement reforms.                          Pillar 2
improves accountability of provincial and district managements for service delivery through the
strengthening and dissemination of information on inputs, outputs and outcomes, the partnership
agreements, conditional transfers to districts linked to performance, strengthening of the inspection
and school evaluation system, strengthening o f community and parent participation in schools, and
through the clarification o f roles and responsibilitiesat all levels. Pillar 3 increases accountability for
the implementation o f government programs (textbooks and stipends) and the provision and use of
physical infi-astructure in schools, and by promoting partnerships with the private sector; and Pillar 4
increases accountability o f teachers through merit based and local recruitment, o f institutions
providing teacher education and development, and o f the province, districts, and schools for learning
outcomes through assessment reforms.

58.       The overarching objectives and key reforms inthe four pillars are discussed below. The pace
o f reforms across pillars i s expected to vary over the medium term, building on experiences in each
year, and reflecting the emerging consensus and realities on the ground. Inparticular, the new reform
program squarely acknowledges governance challenges as a key constraint to improving service
delivery, and seeks to take upfi-ont actions to address these. Accordingly, the first year of the
government's program focuses on governance reforms that cut across all pillars, critical to
establishing the needed credibility to the reform process, in addition to improving access, quality and
efficiency. In addition, the government has also used the first year to prepare the ground for deeper
reforms inthe medium term, across the pillars.

Pillar I:Improvingfiscal sustainability and the effectiveness of public expenditures

59.       The first pillar inthe Government's reformprogram seeks to improve fiscal sustainability and
improve the effectiveness o fpublic expenditures, includingpublic education expenditures. This pillar
will (i)accelerate fiscal reforms to ensure sustainability o f provincial finances while increasing the
fiscal space for education and other pro-poor expenditures; (ii)             increase, and improve the quality of,
education sector expenditures; and (iii)         accelerate financial management and procurement reforms to
improve the effectiveness o fpublic expenditures (including on education).




30Completionrates are high according to householdsurveys. Administrativedata, however, show a contrastingsituation of
high drop out rates within primary. Future monitoring efforts will focus on better understanding, and addressing these
discrepancies(see paragraphs0,33).
31A full set of baselines, targets andmonitoringinstruments is includedas Annex 2a

 (i) Enhancing sustainability of provincial finances while creating additionalfiscal space

Actions in the First Year
60.      The government has taken a number o f important steps to introduce a medium term focus to
inbudgetprocesses, further improve the compositionofpublic expenditures, institute discipline inthe
development budget, and ensure adequate growth o f own source revenues.

61.      First, as an important first step to introducing a medium-term and output or outcomes
perspective to its budget-malung, the government has approved a medium term fiscal framework for
FY 08-FY10 which projects the provincial fiscal resources and recurrent and development
expenditure by broad aggregates and for key sectors/departments. The MTFFmakes a serious attempt
to (i)rationalize public expenditure by striking a better balance between development and recurrent
expenditures, and within the recurrent budget a better mix o f salary and non-salary O&M spending,
and (ii) to support the emergmg sectoral priorities o f the government, includes significant increases in
the non-salary recurrent budgets o f the education, health, irrigation and roads sectors (see Annex 5).
Overall, the draft MTFFvisualizes a 14%p.a. increase infederal tax transfers and a 10%pea.increase
in federal subventions and grants during 2006/07-2009/10.                  Provincial own source revenue is
projectedto grow at a rate o f 13.8% p.a. The aggregate revenue o f the province3' is expected to grow
at a rate o f 13.5% p.a. On the expenditure side, the recurrent and development expenditures of the
government (net o f investments inpension and General Provident Funds) are projected to increase by
13.4% p.a. and 15% p.a., respectively. The budget is expected to remain balanced with fiscal deficits
remaining under 0.5% of GDP.

62.      Second, the 2006/07 budget increased provincial own source revenues by over 13%, reduced
provincial interest and subsidy expenditures by more than 30%, increased allocation for PRSP
expenditures by over 24%, and maintained the consolidated provincial deficit to below 0.5% o f
PGDP. Although development expenditures increased, a significant portion of the increase i s financed
by donor programs. Importantly, to institute discipline inthe development budget, reduce the number
of new schemes, and ensure early completion of on-going schemes, the 2006/07 budget allocated 75%
of ADP funds for on-going schemes.

63.      Despite the allocation, duringthe SRP and again in the 2006/07 budget, o f 75% o f ADP funds
for on-going schemes, the impact on the end-year throw-forward o f development portfolio was
marginal, as it remained at about 4.5 years. The medium term program therefore builds in further
actions to reduce the throw forward, including addressing the large share (more than one-third) o f
ADP resources typically assigned to block allocations, important not only for reducing the throw-
forward33but also for increasing fiscal transparency.       34



Medium TermPriorities:
64.      In the medium term, the provincial government intends to deepen the reforms in budget
processes, by instituting a Medium Term Budget Framework, initially in the education sector, and
expanding gradually.       Annual budgets will be prepared in accordance with the revenue and
expenditure targets reflected in its MTFF and will including further actions to institute discipline in
the development budget and reduce the throw-forward.                     These will include: (i)continued
implementation o f the policy o f allocating 75% o f ADP resources to on-going schemes; (ii)                reducing
the number ofnew schemes inthe mediumterm budgets (with a target ofbelow 300 inthe provincial
ADP) and limiting the inclusion of new schemes into the approved ADP; (iii)                    reducing the throw-
forward o f development portfolio through early completion o f development schemes by channeling a
significant portion o f block allocation funds towards on-going schemes (its target is below 3 years by
2008109); and (iv) significantly reducingthe proportion o f ADP funds assigned to block allocations
(including sectoral block allocations).

65.      In addition, the government is re-vitalizing the Fiscal Monitoring Committee (FMC)
established in 2001/02. This committee will periodically review the fiscal situation, including the
collection o f provincial revenue. It will formulate, and recommend for adoption, a forward-looking
strategy for additional resource mobilization based on restructuring and streamlining o f provincial tax
and non-tax revenue bases, and by enhancing the capacity and accountability of, and incentive for,
provincial tax administration.

 (ii)Improving the level and quality of education expenditures

Actions in theFirst Year
66.      The government has approved a new medium term sector policy framework and an
accompanying mediumterm financial plan. The financing plan envisions an average annual increase
o f 17.5% inthe nominal budget for education (amounting to real increases o f about 10%per annum).
Non-salary recurrent allocations will increase at about 30% per year (about 22% in real terms),
reflecting the allocations for the reforms. Although reflected in the provincial allocations, a
significant proportion of the increases will be implemented by districts in the form o f conditional
grants (paragraph 79). Inadditional, the districts are beingencouraged, through the conditional grants
to increase their own non-salary allocations. The government approved the 2006/07 budget, aligned
with the sector policy framework. This budget inthe initial year ofreforms has the largest increase in

non-salary reform allocations (a three fold increase at the provincial level or almost doubling o f
consolidated nominal non-salary allocations), amounting to a total nominal increase o f nearly 26%
(17% in real terms). As a result, the share o f education in total budget i s expected to increase from
20% to about 23% over the mediumterm, and from 1.2% to 1.5% o fprovincial GDP.

Medium TermPriorities:
67.      Inthe second andthirdyears of theprogram, the government will implement annualbudgets
in line with the education sector strategy and financing framework. As discussed above, this is
expected to lead to continued increases in the budgetary allocations for education, and in the non-
salary O&M expenditures including in district budgets. Per student expenditures on elementary and
secondary are expected to be at least maintainedinreal terms.

(iii) Increasing effectiveness of public expenditures (including on education) through public
finance management andprocurement reform

FinancialManagement
68.      To enhance the credibility, transparency and accountability in the use o f public funds across
the province, including in the education sector, the province has embarked on wide-ranging reforms
through its commitments under the Project for Improvement o f Financial Reporting and Auditing
(PIFRA) project - an umbrella project at the Federal level. The need for these reforms, which are key
to improving the overall fiduciary environment, has been reiterated in the findings o f the 2003
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the 2004 Sindh Provincial Financial
Accountability Assessment (PFAA) (paragraphs 132, 133). The reforms aim to introduce adequate
financial information systems, enhance the quality and timeliness o f audits, and provide the platform
to allow for the submission o f the audit reports and audited accounts of the government to the
legislature within 12 months o f the end o f the fiscal year. The regularity o f conducting legislative
scrutiny o f audited accounts and audit reports, and the enforcement o f Public Accounts Committee
(PAC) recommendations are also key areas in the reform strategy3'. Improved audit quality and
timeliness is expected to be a direct result o f the gradual roll-out o f the new Financial Audit Manual
(which uses a risk-based approach that is also compliant with the International Standards o f
Auditing). Inaddition, the government's financial managementreformprogram focuses on enhancing
the accountability process inthe use o fpublic education resources.

Actions in the First Year
69.       An Executive Order has been issued by the Chief Secretary to all provincial and district
government formations, including those o f the education sector to revitalize Departmental Accounts
Committee (DAC) meetings and hence review and resolve audit observations raised against them.


35 The PAC is a parliamentary body. Dialogue with the PAC will continue to be intensified as an ongoing feature o f Bank`s
engagement in Sindh so as to support the enhancement of the Committee's capacity as well as its Secretariat, through
exposure to international good practices and training, as is currently being done with the Federal PAC.

                                                              31

Like other departments, the education department, which has 767936un-reviewed and unresolved
audit observations3', i s only now beginning to hold D A C meetings to enable progressive reduction o f
pending audit observations not only at its provincial sector units but also at the district government
units.Inaddition, a financial management cell has been set upwithin the ReformSupport Unit(RSU,
para 77), to monitor DAC performance as well as report and monitor the budget execution status o f
the entire sector.

70.       T o strengthen the accountability o f district governments in terms o f quality, timeliness, and
credibility o f financial information, as well as the pace and strength o f effectiveness o f the legislative
oversight function, Zilu Accounts Committees (the district government equivalent o f Provincial
Government Public Accounts Committee) have been established in 16 out o f the 23 districts, a
situation that compares favorably to that prevailing in other provinces. For the 2006/07 budget year,
the government has prepared the district governments' budgets (including the education sector's) on
the new Chart o f Accounts (COA) under the principles o f the New Accounting Model (NAM)that is
largely compliant with IMF Government Financial Statistics (GFS).                     The budgets o f the provincial,
government had, since FY 2005/06, been prepared on the basis o f the new CoA. The province-wide
transition to the new chart will enable uniform and coherent fiscal and financial information across
the whole province. Continued progress has been made on the plan to achieve full IT connectivity by
FY0838. The province has also started, through the office of the Accountant General, to provide more
reliable and comprehensive budget execution statements (otherwise called civil accounts), o f the
provincial and district governments at the function and sub-function levels.

Medium Term Priorities
71.       Inthemediumterm, the government plansto (i) institutionalizetheresolutionprocess
                                                                    further
o f `advance' audit paragraphs, particularly o f the education sector, and achieving meaningful
quantifiable progress inresolvingun-reviewedbacklogs and arising paragraphs; (ii)                   prepare and make
available on the education department website, monthly Budget Execution Statements o f the sector at
aggregate function, sub-function, and detailed object expenditure heads o f account; and extend these
to cover sectoral budget statements for the entire province; (iii)               complete third party tracking o f
education sector expenditures in randomly selected districts to examine the effectiveness o f
expenditures in support o f the program; (iv) establish Internal Audit functions in all provincial line
departments, including the Education Department; (v) support the regular review o f district audit
reports and audited accounts by the ZilIu Accounts Committees; (vi) conduct an update assessment o f
PFM and Procurement in the province; and (vii) update the Financial and Treasury Rules of the
GoSindh.

Procurement
72.       The government's reformprogram inthis area aims to increase transparency and efficiency in
public procurement, including improving procurement practices in the education sector. The
government recognizes the importance o f establishing the appropriate regulatory and institutional
framework for public procurement and strengthening public sector procurement capacity.

Actions in First Year
73.       GoS has adopted the federal Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) Ordinance
andprocurement rules as an interim arrangement. The procurementregulatory authority, which has
been placed in the Planning & Development department, is being staffed. In addition, to ensure


36Representthe baselinenumber of `advance' auditparagraphsfor four latestyears to FY 2005/06.
37The "advance" audit paragraphs o f the Auditor General o f Pakistan are provided to line departmentsafter audit exercises
are completed. Line departments are expected to conduct regular DAC meetings to review the observationsraised against
their departments and resolvethe issues before they become draft paragraphsfor Provincial or ZiZu Accounts Committees'
deliberations. DACmeetingsare not regularlyheldinSindh, contributingto abreakdownin the accountabilitycycle.
38Five accounting sites and one budgetingsite haveso far been implementedunder the PIFRA project.

                                                           32

transparency in the procurement of works, the conventional system of pre-registratiodenlistment o f
bidders has been abolished and all the works procurements are being offered for bidding to all
interestedparties, subject to clearly disseminated qualification criteria.

74.      Based on the recommendations o f a stakeholders' workshop, the government i s preparing in
consultation with key stakeholders, a road map for procurement reforms. The road map will define
time-bound commitments to improve procurement rules and standard documents in line with best
practice, establish a complaints' redressal mechanism, and provide comprehensive capacity building
for the public as well as private sectors in order to ensure effective implementation o f procurement
reforms. It has forwarded for approval the replacement o f the Composite Schedule o f Rates (CSR)
with Current Market Rates (CMR). As an interim arrangement the current (2004) CSR is being
updated. The signed Terms o f Partnership Agreements with districts and guidelines provided to
districts address the issues o f third party assessments o f program effectiveness and construction
quality, and the use o f the approved rules for procurement. The process to engage consultants for
construction supervision as well as procurement ex-post review for civil works contracts for the
provision o f missingfacilities, shelter and additional classrooms, has beenlaunched.

Medium Term Priorities
75.      Inthe mediumterm, the government will implementitsroad-map for procurement reforms. It
will approve procurement rules aligned to international best practice; issue standard documents for
procurement o f goods, works and services; and implement comprehensive procurement training
programs at provincial and district levels. It will ensure adequate capacity and resources for the
procurement regulatory authority. To improve the efficiency o f public procurement inthe education
sector, the medium term program builds in third party supervision o f construction, and representative
ex-post procurement reviews inevery district.

Pillar 2: Improve Education SectorManagement

76.      The objectives o f the Government's reformprogram inthis pillar are to (i)  increase provincial
capacity inpolicy formulation, standard setting, technical support and monitoring and evaluation and
improve the quality and accountability o f local education management in line with devolution
objectives; and (ii) improve the effectiveness o f school management committees and increase client
participation.

(0 Increasing provincial capacity in educationpolicy formulation and monitoring and evaluation
and improving the accountability, management structure and capacity of local education
management.

Actions in the First Year:
77.      T o Government has taken a number o f significant steps to strengthen provincial capacity in
policy formulation and monitoring and evaluation, inline with its role ina devolved set up. A Reform
Support Unit (RSU) has been established as an integral part o f the education department. It combines
the previously separated policy formulation and monitoring and evaluation functions. Its mandate
includes data collection and management; program monitoring (direct and through third party
validations); data analysis, policy formulation linked to the analysis, establishment o f implementation
arrangements for various reform interventions; and management and coordination o f all donor
programs and technical assistance inputs supportingeducation.

78.      Significant actions to strengthen monitoring and evaluation (paragraph 127) have included: (i)
the implementation o f a revamped public school census in M a y 2006 which includes more reliable
information as well as key new information (e.g. on sanctioned teachers positions, filled posts,
identification and academic and professional qualification, available physical infrastructure and its

                                                    33

condition); (ii)establishment o f baselines on key performance indicators for the province and
individual districts which have formed the basis o f partnership agreements with districts; (iii)
improved information to support effective implementation o f incentive programs; (iv) progress on the
development o f a database to monitor the tenure o f district education management beginning with the
Executive District Officers (Education), and the development o f an information management system
to integrate the various databases; (v) establishment o f a financial management cell within the RSU
to provide fiscal and financial information and monitor resolution o f audit paragraphs; and (vi)
equipment upgrading and capacity building at provincial (SEMIS) and district (DEMIS) offices and
appointment o f district monitoring officers. This should greatly facilitate the provision o f on-time
information on key interventionsand indicators.

79.       To strengthen decentralization and service delivery by district governments, all salary,
development, and district development funds from the province to the districts have been transferred
as single line transfers through the District's Account IV for the first time, increasingthe flexibility o f
districts to allocate resources in line with priorities. Second, in a significant step to increase
accountability o f district governments for improving education service delivery, the provincial
government has entered into Terms of Partnership Agreements with all district governments. These
agreements specify district baselines and performance indicators (output and outcome targets and
efficiency measures). They also set out roles and responsibilities o f provincial and district
governments in planning, implementation and monitoring, as well as accompanying audit and
accountability arrangements associated with the use and flow of funds.                               On the basis o f these
agreements, additional funds (over and above the single line transfer) in the form o f conditional
grants have been made through the Districts' Account IV. Inthe first year, districts have received
uniform earmarked grants to finance education inputs. In subsequent years, however, the size o f
conditional grants will be linked in part to need and in part to progress in achieving agreed
performance indicator^^^. The implementation o f these agreements i s being supported by a continuous
process o f consultation, the provision o f guidelines and technical assistance, and the significantly
improved information and monitoring that i s now available.

Medium TermPriorities
80.       Inthe mediumterm, the government will buildonthe above efforts. RSUcapacity inanalysis
will be further strengthened. School censuses will be carried out annually, and the results o f all third
party validation exercises, impact evaluations and policy studies on the components o f the reform
program as well as monitoring indicators on the outputs and outcomes of the reform will be widely
disseminated including on the Department's website. Continuous improvements are planned, both in
the information collected and in their use - for example, the Human Resources database will be
extended to cover all senior district education managers, a complete profile o f teachers, and
information on non-teaching staff. A census o f all private schools is also being implemented.

81.       Annual partnership agreements will continue to serve as the backbone of the reforms to
strengthen the accountability o f districts for education service delivery. Conditional grants for
education will be provided against these agreements, with the size o f the conditional grant determined
increasingly by districts' progress against agreed performance targets.

82.       Inaddition, the province has launched a process to strengthen education management at all
levels. A working group, comprising representation from the RSU, Provincial and District levels in
the fields o f Education, Finance and Legal services i s expected to review roles and responsibilities at
various levels and to provide recommendations and an action plan for a revised education
management framework and career structure. This plan, which will be rolled out in the coming years,


39Critical performance indicators in the first year will be process indicators relating to efficient and responsible utilization o f
funds and districts' own non-salary allocations.

                                                               34

i s expected to inter alia put into place a system o f quality assurance including a strengthened school
inspection system (linked to school development planning and school self-evaluation), an improved
system o f advice and support to schools. The worhng group will also identify and assist in the
implementation o f leadership and management training needs associated with the new management
structures.

(io Increasing community participation through school management committees and improving
the effectiveness of school level management

Actions in the First Year
83.         To include school management, community members and parents as active partners in
improving education outcomes, the government has taken a number o f steps to strengthen SMCs,
buildingon the experience to date and the findings o f field studies. Specifically, the government has:
(i) notificationstoenhancetherepresentationofparentsandthelocalcommunityinSMCS;~'
    issued
(ii) established SMCs and launched the preparation o f school development plans in all middle and
secondary schools with the assistance o f reputable firms and NGOs; (iii)                      launched a third party
assessment o f the effectiveness o f SMCs in primary schools; (iv) prepared guidelines to clarify the
roles and responsibilities, working and monitoring o f SMCs, and the use of funds (responsibilities
will include encouraging student attendance and discouraging drop-out, management o f SMC funds
and record keeping, actions to improve the school environment, and monitoring o f teacher
attendance); and (v) completed a first round o ftraining o f SMCs inprimary schools.

84.       The 2006/07 budget increasedthe fundingto SMCs, linkingit more closely to school size and
their timely release has been included as an obligation of district governments in the Tops4'.
However, release o f these funds has been delayed untilthe completion o f the third party assessment o f
SMC effectiveness inprimary schools, and the completion o f the school development plans inmiddle
schools.

Medium Term Priorities
85.       Strengthening the participation and monitoring o f parents and the community, and
introducing effective planning and management in schools is a gradual and long term process;
however it is a key component o f the SEW. T o improve and sustain the quality o f education
provision, the government intends to increasingly move in the medium term to use school
development planning supported by a systematic monitoring process undertaken by SMCs. It will
evaluate and build on ongoing experience, and inparticular, plans to develop and implement school
improvement pilots based on school development plans and an agreed and trialed school self-
evaluation process. Specific interventions will be piloted and evaluated prior to scaling up, and will
include the necessary training and capacity building.Funds will be provided to schools, increasingly
linked to the number o f students, and to the school development plans.

Pillar 3: Improving Access to Quality Schooling

86.       The third pillar o f the government's strategy aims to improve access to quality schooling
through (i)   reforms to improve the physical quality and utilization o f public school facilities, address
implementation bottlenecks and improve the effectiveness o f incentive programs; and introduce new


40 SMCs are to be chaired by a parent, the head teacher is to be the Secretary, and the SMC will include a Union Council
member, a retired civil or military officer, a representative of an NGO or Community Based Organization, and an eminent
educationalist nominated by the local government.
41 The allocations provided for SMCs are Rs. 2lOkhild enrolled with a minimum o f Rs. 25,000 for a primary school, Rs.
50,000 for a middle school, and Rs. 100,000 for a secondary school. These are almost an insignificant share o f the per
student cost o f public school but can go a long way towards meeting the needs o f non-salary recurrent inputs at the school
level.

                                                              35

targeted programs to address constraints to access particularly in rural areas; and (ii)       reforms to
increase the role o f the non-government and low cost private sector as a partner in providing quality
education. While the first set o f interventions have as a primary target group the rural areas and girls,
the second could inaddition become an important component o f the strategy to reachthe urbanpoor.

(i) Improving the quality and utilization of public school infrastructure and improving the
effectiveness of incentiveprograms.

Actions in the First Year
87.      To make immediate progress in increasing the availability o f minimumphysical facilities in
government schools, conditional grants have been released to districts to increase the number o f
government schools that meet minimumphysical standards (of shelter/buildings, basic infrastructure
-includingtoilets, water, boundarywalls, and electricity, andadequate classrooms).            A complete
inventory o f the state o f physical infrastructure in schools was prepared, the needs costed,         and
detailed guidelines provided to districts on the basis o f which a prioritized list o f schools has been
selected by each district for the first year. The process o f selection ensures that schools would be fully
functional in terms o f all essential inputs (including teachers), and that there is no duplication with
donor funded programs. The government has also launched a survey o f closed schools and a study to
examine their viability.
88.      The government continued to roll out its programs to reduce costs and encourage families to
send their children, through the expansion o f the middle schools girls stipends program to cover girls
inhighschools (grades 9, 10) for the 2005/06 school year, andthrough the extension o f the policy o f
free textbooks upto grade 10 in the current school year. Importantly, however, the government took
significant steps to address implementation bottlenecks and introducednew, streamlined mechanisms
for delivery o f both programs. It has also strengthened monitoring mechanisms for the programs. It
was particularly successful in improving the mechanisms for textbook delivery and, for the first time,
nearly 90% o f grade 1-10 students received their textbooks at the start o f the school year. The full
amount o f the annual stipend for the 2005/06 school year was deliveredto about 80% o f eligible grls
inmiddle and highschools, however as a result o f several unanticipated problems the delivery took
longer than targeted. A thirdparty validation o f both interventions has been launched.

Medium TermPriorities
89.      In the medium term, the government will continue to provide funds to support school
rehabilitationthrough conditional grants, although as discussed earlier, these will vary across districts
based on needs as well as performance. Based on the study o f closed schools, the government plans to
stop all funding to non-viable closed schools while exploring options (including non-traditional
approaches such as operation by the non-government and private sector) to operationalizing schools
that are found viable but are not functioning. While the conditional grants are for present primarily
focused on primary schools to address the substantially low entry rates into school, the government is
also upgrading 1200 primary schools into middle schools with the assistance o f the Asian
Development Bank. It plans to support and accelerate this project to substantially expand middle
school access, starting from the thirdyear o f the program.

90.      The third party validation studies o f the incentive programs will be completed and the results
widely disseminated. The government also plans to introduce further improvements inthe mechanism
for the delivery o f the stipends program based on the lessons learned and to include minimum
attendance requirements beginning next year. It is also developing a "differential policy" to address
the special constraints faced by middle and high school girls in rural talukas, including higher costs
associated with transportation and safety concerns.          This program will be targeted to girls in
talukas/districts with low gender parity and low girls participation in middle and high schools. It i s
expected that this policy will include a combination o f interventions including a higher stipend

                                                     36

amount, and that the policy will be rolled out randomly over the targeted talukas to facilitate
evaluation of impact. Finally, based on the impact evaluation of the Child Support Pilot in Sindh
(being supported under PRSC IT to facilitate attendance of girls and boys from poor families to public
or private schools), the government o f Sindh will support its roll out and expansion, includingthrough
ensuring adequate supply indistricts where this i s rolledout

(ii) Extendingpartnerships with theprivate and non-government sector

Actions in the First Year
91.      The Sindh government recognizes that private schools play a significant role inthe delivery of
schooling in Sindh and, particularly in urban areas such as Karachi and Hyderabad, provide a ready
network o f institutions that can be tapped to meet educational access and quality objectives. It i s
determined to employ the strengths of the private and non-governmental sector, inparticular the more
flexible regulatory environment (e.g. on teacher contracting) and higher accountability that is inherent
in the private sector. This more favorable environment could, in principle, enable far more rapid
achievement of education outcomes including access and quality. At the same time, it recognizes that
reforms to reach out to the private sector are politically difficult and could face opposition from
groups with a vested interest inthe existing education system with low accountability.

92.      Its reform strategy has accordingly focused in the first year on establishing credibility in the
education reforms, improving the implementation o f its own programs, and increasing accountability
in the public sector and by improving the implementation of its own programs. This is also a
prerequisite to successful partnerships with skeptical non-governmental partners. At the same time it
has begun to work on a proposal to introduce aprogram- starting inlow income communities both in
and outside the main urban centers o f Karachi and Hyderabad - under which it would fund low-fee
private schools on the basis of the number o f the students they enroll. The program, which would be
implemented by the Sindh Education Foundation, would be similar to the Punjab Education
Foundation's Foundation Assisted Schools (FAS) Program in Punjab as well as numerous similar
schemes inother countries.

Medium Term Priorities
93.      The government i s finalizing the design of its PPP initiative and intensive consultations with
the private and non-governmental sector are also ongoing. It expects to finalize the design and
introduce the initiative possibly during fiscal year 2007/08. According to the present concept, the
PPP initiative would be managed by the SEF under a MoU with the Department o f Education. The
SEF would carry out a number of tasks, including determining the areas where the program will be
implemented, selecting participating schools, disbursing payments to schools, capacity building
participating private schools and operating a quality assurance (QA) framework for participating
schools. The initiative would be introduced in low-income areas - including but not limited to the
slums in the main urban areas - to ensure targeting toward those most in need. Schools would be
chosen from applicant schools based on meeting selection criteria (teachers, infrastructure, etc.).
Participating private schools could either be entrepreneurial (for-profit) or not-for-profit and the SEF
could sign the MoUwith either individual schools or with existing organizations which may operate a
number of schools42.Participating schools would be expected to continue to meet quality benchmarks
to remain on the program. The medium term program will include an evaluation o f the impact o f the
initiative prior to expansion, and the ongoing private schools census i s expected to provide a baseline
for the evaluation.




42 Examples include the Citizens Foundation, Aga Khan Education Services, CARE, the National Rural Support
ProgradSindh RuralSupport Organization, BahnnBelli, Sindh GraduatesAssociation,for example.

                                                      37

94.      Inaddition, a strategic review ofthe Sindh Education Foundation is plannedand the medium
term program envisages a restructuring o f the Foundation and the introduction o f supporting
legislation to alter the structure and governance as needed.

95.      Based on the experience in Punjab, as well as in other countries, the government expects that
the initiative could produce rapid increases in enrollment inparticipating schools. Inthe longer term,
such initiatives have also been found to attract new private schools and expand the network.
Depending on the experience with this initiative, the medium term to longer term program envisages
the possible introduction o f up to two additional models:                         (i)private sector management of
government schools; and (ii)       subsidy/voucher models. All o f these models represent a departure from
current education PPPs in Sindh in that they involve public fundingbeing used to support students to
attend private schools. Key elements are per student funding o f schools and complete autonomy of
providers over teachers and school managers, considerable management flexibility, independent
quality assurance arrangements, and sufficient tenure and stability built into the partnerships.

Pillar 4: Improving the quality of teaching and learning

96.      To improve and sustain improvements in the quality o f teaching and learning in the
classrooms, reforms in this pillar will: (i)institute merit based recruitment and strengthen
accountability o f teachers, and improve the quality o f Continuing Professional Development (CPD);
and (ii)  increase accountability for student learning outcomes by strengthening the use of sample
based assessments in the province. In or around the third year, the government also anticipates
gradually introducing competition in the production and printingo f textbooks and reading materials,
to improve their quality and affordability. The design and implementation o f reforms in the area o f
textbooks and learning materials are expected to benefit from the directions being provided in the
National Textbook Policy and the lessons from ongoing reforms inPunjab. Inaddition, the improved
availability o f learning materials (as distinct from textbooks) i s inherent inan improved CPD system43
and improved school development planning.

(i) Instituting merit based recruitment of teachers, strengthening teacher accountability, and
improving the quality of teacher education and development

Actions in the First Year
97.      To improve the quality o f teacher recruitment, reduce discretion and political interference in
the hiringprocess, and increase accountability, the Government i s committed to the transparent merit-
based recruitment o f teachers on school specific contracts and has approved a new recruitment policy.
To reduce the potential for undue influence, the previous policy o fhighweight to interviews has been
discontinued and the new policy specifies formula-based selection usingcriteria such as test scores (in
an independently administered test), domicile o f the candidate, gender, and academic qualifications.
The formula gives preference to local and female teachers. Hiring o f local teachers is expected to
reduce incentives for transfers and increase teacher presence. All teachers will be recruited on school
specific contracts, and the contractual provisions reduce the risk o f regularization and do not permit
transfers. The government has also completed an analysis o f school specific needs which will be
discussed with district governments. Finally, the teacher database in SEMIS has been greatly
enhanced, and the new information will allow for the tracking o f teacher transfers, disaggregated by
type and quality o f school, location, and teacher demographics.




43Learning materials have been produced by teachers and "master trainers" as part of donor supported projects such as ESRA
and the revised CPD system will build on this experience. The current world trend is to use more locally-generated
teachindlearning materials which are relatively inexpensive, flexible and locally relevant.

                                                             38

98.      The government has also begun to work on the future design o f teacher education and
development in Sindh.        A working group, chaired by the education department and comprising
representation from BOC, PITE, higher education institutions, non-governmental providers o f teacher
education and teachers, has been established. The group has begun to analyze the roles and functions
o f BOC, PITE and Teacher Resource Centers to make proposals for an integrated system for teacher
education and development, the first phase o f which will focus on CPD.

Medium TermPriorities
99.      In the medium term, and beginning in the second year, the government will recruit new
teachers on the basis o f the new policy while evaluating and strengthening it as needed, and
increasingly linking it to the developing system for CPD. The teacher recruitment policy will be
widely disseminated, and based on the consultations with local governments on potential for
redeployment, recruitment needs will finalized. A competency-based selection test will be developed
and pilot-tested by a reputable, independent, third-party organization. The implementation of the
policy will yield school specific merit lists. T o further enhance transparency in the process, the
government plans to post recruitment results locally. A Third Party validation exercised on the first
round o frecruitment is planned and the results will be widely disseminated.

100.     In the medium term, greater weight to local candidates and a strengthened role o f school
management committees in monitoring absenteeism i s expected to reduce absenteeism. The
government also plans to introduce a system of regularly monitoring teacher attendance through
facility surveys. Based on these it will consider the inclusion o f teacher absenteeism indicators in the
partnership agreements with districts and/or the piloting o f a rewardincentive system to improve
attendance.

101.     Significantly, the government's priorities in the medium and longer term are to introduce a
competency based system o f ITE and CPD. The concept paper being discussed by the working group
proposes the establishment o f an "Apex Body" to provide effective oversight, policy linkage,
management and quality assurance across the whole system o f teacher training and development.
With these tasks delegated to the apex body, the focus o f the education department would become
more strategic in ITE (as it is to some extent presently in inset) with regard to the formulation of
policy, standards and competencies, and management o f strategic planning for Teacher Education.
Thus the Apex body would take on tasks such as the creation and updating o f standards and
competencies for teachers and head-teachers, development o f a career structure or "career path" for
educational professionals (other than district education management), developing the framework and
standards for ITE and accrediting a range o f providers, devising a coherent framework for CPD and
producingand publishing information for schools and parents.

102.      The present vision i s that PITEwould take on tasks such as accreditation and certification o f
providers o f CPD, o f SMC training programs, and quality assurance o f District Professional
Development Centers (PDCS)~.The transition plan envisions the conversion of some o f the colleges
presently being used for qualifications upgrading and some o f the in-service, into PDCs which would
support centers for schools and teachers in the provision o f "advice" and "support". This builds on
and extends practice that has been successfully trialed ina number o f donor-supported projects in the
province. With regard to the role o f the BOC, which is currently also involved directly in the
organization and delivery o f teacher education and development; the emerging concept envisages that
it will re-focus its functions again on curriculum, while the delivery o f ITE shifts from public bodies
to the private sector. Its role could then be enhanced to include the provision o f guidance, advice and
support to schools on all curricular matters as well as workmg with the PEAC (Provincial Education


44 CPD would be based on training needs analysis. Thus the need for training in multi-grade teaching techniques, for
example, which is beingprovidedby some donor supportedprojects, would be supportedthroughthis framework.

Assessment Center, see below) to strengthen formative assessment in schools, in specific subject
areas, to enable teachers to continuously assess the achievement o f curricular standards by students.

103.     The government recognizes that this is a major reform and that the final design and pace o f
implementation o f this reform will depend on the emerging consensus among key stakeholders.
Nevertheless, in intends to make significant progress towards the establishment o f a competency
based system o f ITEand CPD inits medium term SEW.

(ii) Increase accountabilityfor student learning outcomesand strengthen the use of sample based
assessments

Actions in theFirst Year
104.     NEAS has now begun to provide information on learning outcomes in Sindh, benchmarked
against other provinces and the country as a whole. Grade 4 results in mathematics and languages for
2006 provide a baseline for monitoring student learning outcomes. While outstanding challenges to
improve the reliability of NEAS (para 54) are being addressed at the Federal level and through the
proposed strengthening o f provincial coordination on assessment, the S E W seeks to strengthen
student assessment as a permanent feature o f the provincial education system and to integrate it into
the overall provincial reforms. As a first step towards introducing assessment as a permanent function
in the province and towards strengthening horizontal linkages with the provincial education
department, staff positions are being created for PEAC withinthe regular budget.

Medium TermPriorities
105.     Inthe medium term, the government will (i) strengthen the capacity of the PEAC so
                                                        further
that student assessments can provide regular feedback on the provincial education system and on
provincial policy questions, and so that BOC/PEAC can support formative (continuous classroom)
assessments in schools; (ii) support the timely and reliable implementation o f the assessments at the
provincial level, including a follow up large scale 4~ grade test inmathematics and language, possibly
with a sample defined to provide disaggregated results for provincial needs; and (iii)       support the
collection o f information, analysis, and dissemination o f the findings from the provincial assessments
and use the results inthe design o fprovincial education policies.


                V.      BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO CAS
106.     The proposed SEDPC is fully consistent with the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on June 2, 2006. In line with
Pakistan's recent performance and the Government's request for increased Bank Group Support, the
FY06-09 CAS proposes a substantial increase in the volume o f lending to Pakistan during the next
four years. It envisions an expansion in lending for human development, in support o f the
government's priorities for sustaining growth and accelerating poverty reduction. The three inter-
linked and mutually reinforcing pillars o f the CAS correspond to the strategic pillars of the PRSP: (i)
Pillar 1: sustaining growth and improving competitiveness; (ii)Pillar 2: improving government
effectiveness and service delivery; and (iii)Pillar 3: improving lives and protecting the vulnerable.

107.     The SEDPC series implements the Bank strategy in education which is expected to continue
to focus on the provinces, usingdevelopment policy credits to support policy and systemic changes in
education together with other areas linked to education reform including decentralization and
governance reforms.

   108.      Table 7 shows how the SEDPC series is central to the delivery o f CAS outcomes in all three
  pillars, particularly Pillar 3.

  strategic engagement principles in the CAS (i)               client pull; (ii) upheplicating approaches that
                                                                                  scaling
  have already shown to be effective (iii)            focus on outcomes; and (iv) use o f a programmatic approach
  to provide sustained, flexible, and predictable support to mediumterm reforms.

  COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMPAND OTHER DONORS
   110.      The Bank continues to work closelywith the InternationalMonetaryFund (IMF), with
  regular consultations and coordination on macroeconomic issues and technical assistance. The final
  IMFreview o fthe PRGF arrangement inDecember 2004 was successfully completed and Pakistan is
  now on a yearly Article IV Consultations                           Close coordination with the Fund has continued
  after the completion o f the PRGF; the Bank participated as an observer during the last Consultation
  mission inAugust 200646.

   111.      Several donors have been supporting the education reform programin Sindh. There is
  active collaboration with donors at the federal and provincial levels (for example, through the PRSP,
  PRSC, and joint fiduciary and analytical work including the Sindh Economic Report). In addition,
  major active donor programs ineducation inthe Province include:
  (i) ADB-supported DevolvedSocial ServicesProgram(DSSP) andDecentralizedElementary
       The
  Education Project (DEEP). The former supports Sindh's devolved social services, with the education
  sector being the largest beneficiary, through program loans and technical assistance. A large
  component o f the latter consists o f upgradingo f middle schools.
  (ii)The USAID-supported EducationSector ReformAssistance (ESRA) program targeting four
  districts supports the strengthening o f education planning and management capacity, teacher training,
  strengthening o f SMC capacity and school improvement planning, and female literacy.


  45 The Pakistan authorities have decided not to seek a successor arrangement after the expiry o f the PRGF arrangement in
  December 2004. The Fund is maintaining a dialogue with the authorities on economic and financial developments and
  policies inthe context o f the Fund's normal consultations with member countries.
  46  The report on these consultations was issued in December 2006, and is available at the IMF official website:
  httv://www.imf.ordextemallvubs~cat/lon~es.cfm?sk=20        156.0

                                                                 41

(iii)UNICEF support (at the taluka level) infive districts, to assist inachievement ofuniversal
primary enrollment (WE),providing focused inputs and support to schools and teachers.

112.    The SEDPC, and the associated support to the development of a medium term sector
policy reform framework, is providing an unprecedented opportunity to deepen donor
harmonizationincludingthrough parallel budget support. The European Commission plans to
provide parallel financing to the same program through a package of budget support and technical
assistance. The budget support will be based on the same subset o f the government's program,
summarized in a common policy matrix (Annex 2) and the technical assistance will support the
priority needs of the program. With policy formulation, monitoring and implementation, all under the
auspices o f the Reform Support Unit, greater attention i s being paid to the need to direct ongoing and
new donor programs (investment, technical assistance or budget financing) to the needs o f the
program. Concerted efforts are being made to avoid duplication (for example in the provision o f
missing facilities, paragraph 87) or to build on existing donor initiatives (e.g. for the upgrading o f
primary to middle schools, paragraph 89).


RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS
113.      The proposed SEDPC is closely linked to a number of ongoing and planned
development policy andinvestmentoperationsinthe country. Ithas benefited fromthe experience
and design o f a similar series o f operations in Punjab. It complements the DPCs in Punjab as well as
the planned DPC series to support Human Development reforms inNWFP, in supporting Palustan's
PRSP objectives. The reforms supported by the SEDPC also complement those supported at the
Federal level by the PRSC series; for example, PRSC 1 has supported the launch of the NEAS and
PRSC 2 supports the CSP demand side pilot interventions. Assessment reforms at the provincial level
build on the technical assistance and investment inputs under the NEAS project. Finally, the Public
Financial Management reforms supported by the SEDPC series complement those being implemented
under the platform o f the Project for Improvement o f Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA), to
improve the overall fiduciary environment and enhance the accountabilityprocess inthe use o f public
education resources.

114.     Importantly,the reforms supported by the SEDPC series build on the lessonslearned
from Education Sector Reformprogramsupportedby the Sindh StructuralAdjustmentCredit
(SSAC), while further deepening and broadening the reform agenda. Table 8 shows how the
SEDPC, supporting the S E W builds on the SAC experience in selected interventions. Beyond the
ESR agenda, the fiscal, financial management and procurement reforms also seek to accelerate
progress initiated under the SAC.

LESSONSLEARNED
115.     Beyond SSAC lessons, the proposed operation also builds upon lessons learned from other
ongoing sector DPC operations in the country, the prior experience with provincial adjustment
programs, the long-standing experience o f sector investment projects in Pakistan, and broader Bank-
wide experience with development policy operations. Some key lessons are:

         Strong political commitment and ownership is critical for successful steering o f a sector
         reform program and for addressing governance constraints to effective service delivery. A
         well designed DPC in support o f education reforms can be an effective instrument in
         harnessing the necessary ownership and coordination across departments and levels o f
         government that i s important for the success o f the reforms.
         A reform program that combines sector reforms with cross-cuttingfiscal and fiduciary
         reforms is more likely to yield results and to be sustained. It also contributes to increased
         ownership o f sector reforms beyond the line department.
          Upfront actions combining governance reforms with reforms that visibly and quickly
         improve outcomes increases credibility and acceptability of reforms. This can lay the
         foundation for the more complex institutional reforms - such as those in the fourth pillar or
         enhancing accountability through private provision - that come with considerable challenges
         and resistance from vested interests.
          The success of sector reforms is dependent on collection and dissemination of credible
         data and information.        Establishment o f baselines at the onset, followed by intense
         monitoring and verification i s essential to provide credibility for the reforms, to monitor
         progress and to support the necessary analysis for design. A monitoring and evaluation system
         that also builds in impact evaluations o f specific interventions increases political
         sustainability o fthe interventions while providing feedback for roll-out or adjustments.
          Weak capacity to plan, manage and implement reforms requires careful sequencing
         combined with appropriate capacity building efforts. Capacity, particularly at the district
         level and below, is often weak and calls for focused capacity building efforts to be built into
         the program. It also calls for a reform agenda that is implementable, and developed in line
         with existing capacity.
         Programmatic, policy based lending provides the flexibility needed to support reforms
         while managing risks. Single tranche DPCs help support a complex reform agenda while
         providing a mechanism to adjust to the pace o freforms.
         Analytical support including throughjust in time demand-driven notes adds considerable
         value. This has been done to support the preparation o f the SERP and the SEDPC series
         through the preparation of analytical notes based on the new data (section III),  and through a
         series o f technical assistance notes to inform reforms in public-private partnerships, teacher
         development and district managementreforms.

ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS
116.     The directions in the S E W and the actions supported by the proposed DPC series has
benefited from a range o f analytical work and dialogue, most recently by the "just in time" demand
driven analysis and notes (see section IIIand paragraph 115) and the extensive dialogue during the
preparation o f the Sindh Economic Report. Table 9 below provides a brief summary o f the linkages
o f the proposed reforms with formal analytical reports.

117.     Fiduciary reforms supported by the SEDPC series have similarly been informed: in the case
o f financial management by a CFAA finalized inDecember 2003 and a PFAA inNovember 2004, and
inthe caseofprocurement, bythe mostrecentrecommendations inthe SindhEconomic Report.

                                                         CREDIT

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION
118.     The proposedSEDPC for US$ 100millionwouldbethe first of a programmatic series of
three developmentpolicy credits in support of the government's mediumterm reformprogram
to improve participation, retention and transition, reduce gender and regional disparities, and improve
quality in elementary and secondary education (grades 1-10). The specific objectives o f the SEDPC
series are the same as those in the Government's reform program. The policy matrix (Annex 2)
constitutes a subset o f the governments' reform program.                 The first SEDPC i s expected to be
presented to the board in FY07. Should the reform momentum be maintained, follow up credits o f
US100 million each are proposed in FY08 and FY09, as part o f the programmatic series in support
of the Government's medium term reformprogram.

119.     The proposedSEDPC hasfive distinct but complementary benefits.
First, with its focus on increasing access and quality, reducing disparities, and improving the
efficiency o f education service delivery in Palustan's second most populous province, albeit one
where social indicators are generally lagging, SEDPC will assist Pakistan in accelerating progress
towards its PRSP objectives. Punjab and Sindh together account for just under 80% o f Palustan's
populationand improving outcomes in Sindh would be essential for appreciable impact inthe country
as a whole. The series supports progress towards the MDGs relating to primary completion and
elimination o f gender disparities in primary school. The additional focus on middle and secondary
education will contribute towards the creation o f the required pool o f educated workers able to
proceed to higher levels o f education and to acquire the skills needed in a global competitive
economy. By improving education indicators, particularly in rural areas, and by reducing rural-urban
inequality, it has important potential benefits in reducing poverty and breaking the vicious circle of
low education and high poverty and vulnerability in rural areas. Moreover, the focus on female
secondary education, particularly in rural areas, has an important role to play in terms o f supplying
future teachers thus addressing an important constraint to improving education outcomes.

Second, it provides a vehicle for the accompanying sustained dialogue and strategic and technical
guidance on the direction and content o f the broad reform program (including the education, fiscal,
and fiduciary reform agenda), while harnessing the necessary political support for critical reforms. In
addition, the financing o f the credit supports the provincial debt management strategy and leverages
changes inthe government's own budget insupport o f the reforms.             47


Third, the SEDPC and the associated support to the development o f a medium term sector policy
reform framework, has provided an important vehicle for coordinating donor support around a
commonprogram (paragraph 112).

Fourth, the accompanying wider fiscal and governance reforms that are essential for proceedingwith
SEDPC will contribute to continued fiscal stability and improved overall effectiveness o f public
expenditures.

Finally, the package o f reforms (education as well as cross cutting fiscal and governance reforms)
supported by SEDPC could have an important signaling effects and pave the way for deeper reforms
in other sectors, including other human development sectors. The Bank has gained significant
credibility as a catalyst for reform through willingness to exercise selectivity, lending only in the
presence o f sufficient ownership. This ownership and capacity at present i s most evident in the

donor financing.

education sector in Sindh. Successful Bank assistanceinthis sector could pave the way for reforms in
other sectors and follow on or parallel DPCs to Sindh, as was the case inPunjab.

120.      The preparation of the SEDPC series follows the good practice principles on
conditionalityas laid out inthe Reviewo fWorld Bank Conditionality (Box 5).

                                Box 5: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The operation supports the SERP which has emerged as a deeper and broader programbased on the ESR program
that GoS has been implementing since 2001. There i s consensus on the key reforms in the package at the
provincial as well as at the national level on the reform agenda under SERP. Inaddition, ownership and active
participatiodconsultation o f district governments - who have primary responsibility for service delivery in
Pakistan's devolved set up - i s embodied in the partnership agreements that are negotiated and signed between
provincial and district governments. The design and implementation o f the reform program are being led by an
interdepartmental Reform Steering Committee, headed by the Chief Secretary o f the province. The government's
track record is demonstrated inactions to address cross-cutting governance reforms including key bottlenecks to
effective service delivery, as well as broader fiscal, financial management and governance reforms.            This
sequencing also reflects political economy considerations. Finally as discussed inparagraphs 116, 117 key A4A
has fed strategically into the government's policymaking process.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the government and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The Bank's support is summarized in the policy matrix attached as Annex 2 to this program document. It
constitutes a focused subset o f critical actions from the government's reformprogram. The EuropeanCommission
i s providing parallel financing including technical assistance and budget support based on the same policy matrix.
Under the auspices of the RSU, increased attention is being paid to aligningkoordinating ongoing donor
assistance to the SERP and to directing any future budget support to be provided under the same performance
accountability framework (policy matrix).

Principle 3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The SEDPC series is designed as a programmatic series with three one-tranche annual operations based on an
agreed performance accountability framework (Annex 2) derived from SEW. The Bank has committed to provide
information on future development policy support commitment levels as early as possible in order to enhance
predictability o f aid flows. GoS has approved a MediumTerm Fiscal Framework that incorporates the proposed
DPC support for the next three years. Sensitive policy reforms - such as performance based partnership
agreements with districts and merit based recruitment o f teachers as well as broader provincial fiduciary and
governance reforms - are owned by key stakeholders within the province. Indeed there is broader consensus
across Pakistan on these as core elements o f a successful education reform program, drawing from experience in
other provinces such as Punjab.

Principle 4: Chooseonly actionscriticalfor achieving resultsas conditionsfor disbursement
The Bank's policy matrix uses only 8 prior actions and 13 benchmarks for SEDPC. Only 7 indicative triggers are
proposed for SEDPC I1and 17 benchmarks are used to reflect progress inthe medium term program. Conditions
andprior actions focus on critical steps inimplementation, including approvals o fpolicy andbudgetdocuments.

Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
The agreed cycle o f performance reviews for the program includes an annual review which will coincide with pre-
appraisal o f each operation in the SEDPC series. A preparation mission will also take place early ineach budget
preparation cycle o f the government, which is also when annual data from education monitoring is expected to be
available. This process allows for predictability in the Bank's financial support as well clarity in performance
review cycles. All reviews will be joint missions o f the World Bank and European Commission. To facilitate a
results focus, GoS will provide the necessary background information including statements o f budget and budget
execution including presentation o f priority figures as defined in the SEW, statistical information relating to the
outcome and output figures inthe policy matrix and SERP progress reports.

 121.     The first SEDPC supports the completion of upfront cross-cutting governance reforms
 critical to establishing the needed credibility to the reform process. The government has
 completed the following actions prior to Board Presentation.

differential policy for rural secondary school girls and its PPP initiative. InPillar 4, it is expected to
support the establishment o f the essential ingredients o f the new system for the design, research,
accreditation, commissioning and monitoring o f continuous professional development and the first

POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACTS
124.    The SEDPC is designed to support the Government's PRSP objectives. Equityconsiderations
are central in the design o f the series, which aims to ensure the benefits o f growth are widely shared,
both through focusing on Sindh, a province where human capital indicators are lagging, as well as
through the design o f targeted programs to improve human capital outcomes among the poor, female
and rural population o f Sindh. According to a 2007 report "Rural Growth for Poverty Reduction,"
investing ineducation o f the rural poor and g r l s i s particularly important for poverty reduction efforts
in rural Sindh, where the poor lack access to land or water, more so than in other provinces. All
pillars contribute to the poverty objectives. Pillar 3 is particularly designed to promote access to
quality schooling for girls and boys in rural areas and from low income families, and to reduce the
barriers for girls to access schooling beyond primary levels. Free textbooks and stipends for girls
reduce costs to poor households. The government is also focusing on geographic areas where there is
larger gender disparity at the primary and middle school levels by designing a special incentive for
girls in these areas. Infrastructure rehabilitation will benefit particularly children in rural areas and
low income urban areas who attend these schools. In addition, pillar 1 creates fiscal space for pro-
poor expenditures, pillar 2 addresses key deficiencies in service delivery in rural areas and increases
community participation, and pillar 4 i s designed to support improved teaching and learning,
including for the poor and ruralpopulations.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Implementation
125.    Implementation o f reforms i s being managed by a Reform Support Unit (RSU) (paragraph
77). The RSU, established as an integral part o f the education department, is headed by a Chief
Program Manager, reporting directly to the Secretary and Minister o f Education. Regular oversight
and inter-departmental coordination is assured by a Reform Steering Committee chaired by the Chief
Secretary o f the Province.      A s discussed earlier a key aspect o f implementation and a major
immediate priority for the Sindh Government and the RSU, has been the revamping o f
implementation arrangements o f existing programs, seen as essential to establishing credibility and
confidence inthe public education system and as a prerequisite to broader and deeper reform.

126.    While the overall monitoring and design o f the reform program and implementation o f
selected provincial initiatives i s the responsibility o f the RSU and Education Department, the district
education management is directly responsible for ensuring implementation o f the program. The TOP
agreements which articulate roles and responsibilities o f provincial and district governments, and the
efforts to strengthen district education capacity (pillar 2) reflect significant steps to strengthen
implementation at this level.
Monitoring& Evaluation
127.    Establishment o f a credible Monitoring and Evaluation system and strengthening capacity in
M&E has been an integral component o f the reform program (paragraph 78). Administrative
arrangements to strengthen the M&E function include the integration o f the Sindh Education


                                                      49

Management Information System (SEMIS) within the RSU to strengthen the linkages between data
collection and monitoring, analysis and policy planning. SEMIS i s made up o f a strong team at the
provincial level supported by a DEMIS officer in each district placed in the ED0 Education's office.
Equipment, software and skills are being upgraded at provincial and district offices.

 128.    In the first comprehensive exercise in Sindh to improve the reliability of education
information, a new public schools census has been launched to provide significantly improved
information on an annual basis. Incontrast to the past, where the information was provided by school
and district education managers and was not verified, the new system i s administered by supervisors
and builds in regular validation exercises combined with incentives and sanctions. In addition to
facilitating the development of comprehensive baselines for the reform, and enabling transparent
decision-making on key aspects o f the reform program, this will now enable annual monitoring o f
targets. As discussed earlier, fiscal and human resource information in the education sector i s also
being strengthened. New monitoring systems for textbooks and stipends programs have been
introduced. Monitoring of learning outcomes i s being strengthened in the province as part of the
reformprogram. FinallyThe RSU is includingthe different databases into an integrated MIS.

 129.    Ongoing monitoring will be strengthened by commissioning regular independent third party
validation exercises to monitor teacher recruitment, absenteeism, delivery o f incentive programs,
procurement processes and to track education expenditures. Household suwey information from the
PSLWCWIQ i s expected to complement information from the SEMIS every two years. The RSU also
commissions regular studies on specific policy issues such as viability o f closed schools,
effectiveness o f SMCs. To facilitate school level monitoring, the reforms support the strengthening
o f School Management Committees.

 130.    Finally, moving forward, the program builds in systematic impact evaluations for key
interventions - including the differential policy and public-private partnership initiatives.        By
establishing appropriate counterfactuals on the outcomes in the absence o f these interventions, these
rigorous evaluations o f impact will facilitate decisions on mid-course corrections prior to roll out o f
initiatives.

Consultationandparticipation
131.     Policies and programs supported by the proposed Credit have included stakeholder
participation and consultation. Consultations with district governments are a key aspect of the initial
design o f the reforms, and these are ensuring greater ownership and input into the reforms. Greater
participation o f communities and parents i s also a pivotal aspect o f the program, and strengthening of
SMCs will enable a greater social impact on sustaining improvement ineducation.

FIDUCIARYASPECTS
132.     CFM Findings: From the financial management perspective, the CFAA (December 2003)
revealed several weaknesses in data reliability, particularly below the federal level. It concluded,
however, that the fiduciary risk to Bank funds and other donor funds managed through mainstream
government systems in Pakistan i s minimal. It cited improvements in expenditure reporting and
monitoring and concluded that development policy loans disbursed and managed through reliance on
government-own financial management systems have shown satisfactory outcomes. The report
recognized however that greater effort i s required in building institutional and personnel capacity to
engender increased comfort and support the transition to full reliance on government systems,
controls and financial reporting. A number o f initiatives and actions are currently being implemented
to remedy a significant number o f lapses, in order to further strengthen the accountability process,
including the country wide PIFRA project.

133.    Sindh PFAA Findings and Overall Reform Progress: A comprehensive `Provincial
Financial Accountability Assessment (PFAA) for the Province was finalized inNovember 2004. The
PFAA report concludes that fiduciary risks remain, and that the province will need to consolidate
ongoing reforms and introduce further institutional reforms to strengthen the fiduciary environment
and to reduce fiduciary risks to Bank and other donor funds managed through mainstream accounting,
internal control and financial reporting. Issues identified were delineated under four main P F M
pillars: (i)Budget Development and Execution; (ii)Accounting, Internal Control, and Financial
Reporting; (iii)External Audit; and (iv) Legislative Oversight. On the basis o f this, a set o f PFM
milestones has been developed (Annex 7) which constitute the crux o f the ongoing dialogue with the
GoS, supported to a large extent by the PIFRA project.                 The expected outcomes include
improvements in the internal control environment, a more accountable environment, and enhanced
credibility o f financial and fiscal information for effective decision making inthe province. The GoS
has already embarked upon wide rangmg reforms to improve the provincial accountability
environment and a number o f steps have been taken in the first year o f the program (See Annex 7 and
paragraphs 69, 70). To facilitate better and informed fiscal and financial decision mahng, the monthly
civil accounts o f the provincial and district governments will be prepared not only at the functional
classification levels, but also at the `object' (economic classification) level, by July 2008. These
reform measures will entrench, and consolidate on, the accountability reforms that the province has
committed itself to. In effect, the culture o f good accounting, financial reporting, and external audit
practices, the use o f state-of-the-art, IT-based application, and conforming to the international best
standards, i s beingprogressively being builtunder the auspices o fthe PIFRA.

134.     The updating o f the Sindh PFAA, under a coordinated multi-donor arrangement (WB, DFID,
ADB, and EC) using the PEFA PFM Performance Measurement Framework as well as the OECD-
D A C Baseline Procurement Assessment Framework, will be launched in 2007, in order to provide
baseline performance indicators and more coherently measure their trajectory of change inthe overall
fiduciary domain, over time.

135.    Procurement: The procurement roadmap (paragraph 74) will identify the mechanism for
monitoring and evaluation o f procurements. The ownership will rest with the procurement regulatory
authority which will maintain a database for the province wide procurements and will monitor the
impacts o f the reforms on the overall procurement environment. The key elements o f the database
shall be identified and the observations will be used to adjust the way forward for the reform.

136.     Foreign Exchange Control Environment: An IMF Safeguards Assessment of the State Bank
o f Palustan (SBP) was conducted in 2001.          It highlighted significant vulnerabilities at the SBP
particularly as relating to its financial statements and disclosure policies which fell short o f acceptable
Central Bank standards. However, since a program o f reform has been agreed with the IMF and is
being implemented, the risks associated with foreign exchange management control have been
mitigated. The State Bank o f Pakistan has transitioned to producing financial statements which
accord with international accounting standards and formats. An independent review o f the SBP's
internal audit function, as recommended by the Safeguards Assessment, has since been completed and
recommendations implemented. The SBP has also established a formal process o f reconciling data
reportedto the Fundas well as implemented guidelines to prohibit operations that pledge or encumber
reserves, or place restrictions on, or otherwise impair the availability o f foreign exchange reserves
outside an authorized framework; equally, the SBP's Act has been accordingly amended to strengthen
and guarantee its independence and autonomy in the management o f reserves as required under the
Safeguards Assessment.

137.     Overall Fiduciary Environment: Commitment to reform is progressively tahng shape as
exemplified by the necessary actions already taken, particularly as pertaining to the province's
implementation support for the PIFRA related reforms.           While there has been a slow pace o f

                                                     51

implementationo f reforms, specifically at the district levels, the fast-track implementation strategy for
rolling out the integrated financial management system across the entire province by January 2008
will provide greater impetus to further shaping the financial accountability environment in the
province.   Reforms in the area o f procurement (paragraph 72-75) would equally entrench the
provinces' accountability regime as they mature in the medium term. With the measures already
taken, and coupled with the mitigatedrisks associated with the manner inwhich the SBP manages the
country's foreign exchange reserves, the overall fiduciary risk o f the operation is rated `modest'. The
continuing dialogue on the provinces' performance against the PFM and Procurement milestones as
well as on the outcome o f the PEFA PFM Performance Measurement Framework Assessment and
OECD-DAC Baseline Procurement Assessment, will inform on the future reform implementation
progress and hence impact the fiduciary riskrating for subsequent series inthe program.

DISBURSEMENTAND FIDUCIARYASSURANCE
138.    Recipient and Financing Agreement. This proposed Credit would be made to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, represented by the Federal Ministry o f Finance. The Credit proceeds would be
transferred by the Federal Government to the Government o f Sindh under the terms and conditions
consistent with the Government o fPalustan's on-lending policy.

139.    Funds flow arrangements: The Government o f Pakistan shall identify a Foreign Exchange
Account with the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) and which forms part o f the country's official foreign
exchange reserves, into which the proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed on a single tranche basis
upon Credit effectiveness. The Rupees equivalent o f the funds in the Account will, within two
working days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fundo f the Government o f Sindh (Account No. 1
-Non-Food) heldwiththeSBPwhichisusedtofinancebudgetexpenditures.

 140.   Disbursements: from the Consolidated Account No.1 (Non-food) by the Government o f
Sindh shall not be tied to any specific purchases and n o special procurement requirement shall be
needed. The proceeds o f the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the
negative list as defined in the Schedule o f the Development Credit Agreement. Ifany portion o f the
Credit i s used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule o f the Development
Credit Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an
amount equal to the amount o f the said payment to IDA. Amounts refundedto IDA upon such request
shall be cancelled from the Credit.

 141.   Assurance Requirements: There will be no special fiduciary arrangements established for the
Credit in terms o f a requirement for an audit. However, within 45 days o f disbursement o f the Credit
by IDA, the Finance Secretary o f the Province shall provide a written confirmation to IDA certifying
the receipt o f the Rupees equivalent o f the Credit into the Consolidated Fund Account o f the
Government o f Sindh, the number o f the account, the date o f the receipt, and the exchange rate
applied to translate the Credit currency into Rupees.

ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS
 142.    The policies supported by the proposed loan may entail only minor effects on Sindh's
environment, forests, or other natural resources. The government's reform program includes the
rehabilitation o f schools and provision o f basic facilities and additional classrooms in small schools,
but these will be aligned with environmental safeguard standards. The Terms o f Partnerships with the
District Government require adherence to environmental guidelines issued by the Provincial
Government to safeguard the environment.

 143.    Furthermore, Pakistan has an adequate institutional framework and has adopted
environmental safeguards aimed at offsetting and minimizing potential environmental risks associated


                                                    52

   with construction o f small civil works. The country's legal framework contains provisions to
   strengthen enforcement o f environmental regulations. Additionally, there i s a high level of
   environmental awareness inthe Province.

   144.     Although supported policies are not expected to have significant environmental effects,
   analytical work is planned to complete the due diligence to determine whether additional efforts are
   needed to safeguard the environment. This work will be undertaken prior to the beginning o f the
   second operation.

   RISKS AND R I S K MITIGATION
   145.     There are several risks to the proposed operation and reform program. Table 10
   provides a discussion o f the key risks and mitigation strategies. Risks are mitigated to a fair extent
   although political risks remainhigh.However the potential benefits are high- for Sindh as well as for
   the country as a whole - and in the Bank team's view, together with the present levels o f energy and
   commitmentjustify support o f the SEDPC series.

                                             highest national level leadership to accelerate education reforms in
                                             Sindh.     Third, intensive consultations with key stakeholders and

As you know. human dcvelopment indicators in Siidh alike other provinces continue to be weak
and these however become more pronounced when compared with comparator econoiiiies in the
region. Sindli's Net Enrolment ratios (NER) at the primary, middle and secondary levels at
present are 48%, 18% and 12% respectively. The indicators o f rural Sindh are significantly lower
as aliiiost 40% o f boys and 70% o f girls of school-going age in rural areas have never attended
school and for every 100 boys in primary and secondary schools in rural areas there are only 43
aiid 17 girls enrolled in schools. Moreover, the unifoimly poor quality of education is reflected in
tlic poor learning achievements o f children co~npletingthe primary level. The results o f a test
conducted in 2006 for children attending grade 4 by the National Education Assessment System
(NEAS) showed that in language (Urdu) and Matliematics children in Sindh, like those in tlie rest
of Pakistan. performed below the mean scores set for the test.

In 2001. the Government o f Sindh (GoS) initiated education sector reforms to bring about visible
iinprovenients in the education sector. In fact, among tlie provinces, Sindli pioneered many
 iiiteiventions to stiiniilate demand for education, like free tuition for 10 *ars      o f sclioo1,ing.
stipends f'or girls enrolled in grades 6 to 8, free textbooks for students in primary classcs and
f'tiiidiiig of School Manegenient Committees (SMCs). However, because of weak implementation
and supei-vision, lack o f expenditure prioritization, frequent policy changes, high turnover of
personnel in leadersliip positioiis the full impact of the reforms could not be realized.

riased on tlie Iessoiis learned from the results of past efforts, we have begun to iinpleinenl a more
coiiiinitied, well-orchestrated, multi-pronged reforin strategy involving rigorous implementation
o f supply and deniand side interventions. Our reforni strategy for the medium term is deeper and
broader and inore forward looking within tlie education sector. It also recognizes the need for
coiiiplementary fiscal, financial management and procurement reforins to enstire financial
sustainability and iiiiprove effectiveness o f expendit.ures.

The priorities for the sector are to improve participation. retention and transition, reduce gender
and regional disparities, and improve quality in elementary and secondary education, thereby
reducing poverty and inequality and sustaining the inipressive economic growth rates of recent
years. The targets of the program are to (i)increase net enrollment rates in primary, middle and
secoiidary education froni 48%, 18% and 12% in 2004/05 to 59%, 22% and 14% respectively in
2009/10, (ii)illcrease the share o f girls in primary and in middle inrural areas froin 36% and 28%
to 40% atid 31% respectively between 2005/06 and 2009/10; (iii)increase the transition rate for
riiral girls froin primary to middle froin 47% to 50% between 2005/06 and 2009/10;and (iv) to
regularly moilitor completion rates as well as learningoutcomes in language and mathematics.

' N e proposed reforms hinge on four core areas o f focus: (a) improving fiscal sustainability and
tlic effectiveness o f public cxpcnditures including in education, thraugh fiscal, financial
nimiilgernent and procureinent reforms; (b) Iniproving education sector management through
reforms to strengthen tlie fuiickioning, capacity and accountability of provincial and district
edtlc,iition maiiagement in line with devolution objectives, and to strengthen school management
coininittees; (c) Imptyving access to quality schooling, with a particular focus on rural areas and
girls, througli reforms to improve the quality and utilization of physical infrastructure in schools,
effective iinplernentatiori o f incentive programs, and public private partnerships; and (d)
iniproving the quality of teaching and leaniing through reforms to enhance teacher capabilities
aiid their presence in schools and through improved assessment o f student learning outcomes.
Together these four pillars will contribute to improvenients iii access to, and quality of, education
and increase accountability in the education sector.

In thc iiiccliuni term. we will clcepeii {lie MTFF exercise to formulate a Medium Term Budget

Ilieii espiiliding it gradualIy over tlie years to include other sectors and provincial departments.
We have re-vitalized the Fiscal Monitoring Committee (FMC). established in 2001/02, to
periodically review tlie fiscal situation, and formulate a forward-looking strategy for additional
resoiircc inobilizatioii based        011 restructuring and streamlining o f provincial tax and noli-tax
rcveiiiie birses. and by enliaiicing the capacity and accountability of. and incentive for, provincial
tiix adininistration. W e will deepen our efforts to institute discipline in tlie development budget by
continuing to itllocate 755'0 o f ADP resources to on-going schemes: reducing the number o f new
schemes iii the medium term budgets and limiting the inclusion of new schemes into the approved
ADP, retliicirig tlie thaw-forward .o f developiiieiit portfolio through early completion of
tlcvelopiiient schemes by clianiielinp a significant portion o f block allocation funds towards on-

of ADP fiinds assigned to block allocations (including sectoral block allocations).

working in rtrral areas. As a result of these interventions arid reform measures the consolidated
(hoth pimiiiicial and district) budgetary allocations increased by over 26%. reflecting the largest
iiicrcasc iii recent ycars in allocations for non-salary reforms.

To enstire coritiiiued financial coiiiiiiitmcnt to education refornis over the mediuin term, and to

We recognize that we will not be able lo meet our objectives of attracting and retaining students
in schools without ensuring that schools increase the capacities and capabilities o f our children.

essential to ensuring tlie children graduating from our education system are able to participate
effectivel) in a knowledge intensive global economy, and for our country's growth and
cc,iiil,etiti\'eness objectives. We are therefore determined to address a critical gap       011the regular
availability of reliable information on student's learning achievements, by supporting the receiit
efforts and developments at the Federal level with interventions and policies at the provincial
level. TUthis end. we will strengtlicn tlie capacity of the Provincial Education Assessment Center
(PEAC) to prwide regular feedback on learning, and of PEAClBOC to support continuous
assessmelit in schools. We would continue to support regular analysis and findings from these
assessments.

Conclusic~ll

'l'hc Govcrnineiit of Sindh is strongly committed to implementing a comprehensive education
reform agenda which will improve access and quality for all children. We are confident of the
sirstainability of tlie reform program because: (a) similar policies are being pursuednationally; (b)
the fiscal situation has improved substantially and tlie sector framework is integrated in tlie
medium term fiscal framework for the province; (c) the district governments are entering into
 partnership agreements with the provincial government that clearly set out the roles and
 vesponsibilities o f both parties in the implementation of the program; (d) a number o f major steps
 have been taken as prior actions making reversibility difficult; and (e) the institutioiial changes in
 the education sector will form ail integral component of the reform agenda (for example, the
 implementation of transparent criteria to ensure merit-based recruitments) and (f) we have
 coiisulted widely with key stakeholders and will continue to widen and deepen our consultations.

The Governiiieiit of Sindh, tlirougli the Economic Affairs Division, has requestedthe World Bank
to provide financing for its three-year reform program. A total of US300 inillion is required as
 IDA assistaiice over a three-year period commencing in FY2007. with $100 iiiillion requestedfor
the first Credit        The reforin agciida and the instruments and institutional arrangements for its
effective implementation have been desigiied in consultation with the World Bank. Negotiations
 I'or this credit arc expectedto take placc in May 2007.

Public Information Notices (PINS)form part o f the IMF's efforts to promote transparency o f the
IMF's views and analysis o f economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(orcountries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions o f Article IV
consultations with member countries, o f its surveillance o f developments at the regional level, o f
post-program monitoring, and o f ex post assessments o f member countries with longer-term program
engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions o f general policy matters,
unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2006
Article IV Consultation with Pakistan is also available

On November 22, 2006, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IVconsultation with Palustan.'

Background

Pakistan's recent economic performance has been impressive. Growth has accelerated, improvements
inpublic spending and wide-ranging structural reforms have reduced the debt burden and increased
efficiency, and pro-poor policies have helped lower poverty rates. The devastating earthquake o f
October 2005 left a heavy toll interms o f human lives and physical and social infrastructure, but had
relatively minor effects on macroeconomic indicators (except for an increase in government
spending) owing mainly to the small share o f the affected areas inthe overall economy.

Economic developments duringthe fiscal year ending in June 2006 were favorable, with buoyant real
GDP growth and inflation declining to 7.6 percent. The external current account deficit, however,
increased to U S 5 billion (3.9 percent o f GDP), from US$1.5 billion (1.4 percent o f GDP) a year
earlier. Record-high net capital flows (mainly from foreign direct investment-including
privatization) more than covered the larger deficit and allowed for a buildup of nearly US$1 billion
in official international reserves. The interbank market exchange rate was broadly unchanged from
end-June 2005.

The fiscal deficit exceeded the original budget target for 2005/06 owing to earthquake-related
spending. Excluding the latter, revenues and expenditures rose by roughly the same amounts
compared to the outturn in the previous fiscal year. The government debt-to-GDP ratio fell to
56percent by the end o f June, below the 60 percent ceiling stipulated in the 2005 Fiscal
Responsibility Law. The budget for 2006/07 targets a deficit o f 4.2 percent o f GDP (excluding
grants), unchanged from the estimated outturn for 2005/06.

The growth o f broad money and bank credit to the private sector decelerated in 2005/06, but private
sector credit continued to expand at a relatively strong pace. Bank lending rates became increasingly
positive in real terms as inflation declined; the real return on bank deposits remained negative.
The State Bank o f Pakistan's (SBP) claims on the government rose by more than total government
borrowing from the banking system, as the SBP absorbed treasury bills that commercial banks did
not roll over upon redemption. In July 2006, the SBP tightened monetary conditions by raising
reserve and liquidity requirements on bank deposits and the discount rate.

Foreign investors' interest in Pakistan increased significantly in 2005/06. Foreign direct investment
inflows, excluding privatization, rose by 70 percent, and foreign demand for Pahstani bonds was
strong. Government divestiture from electricity and telecommunications entities generated large
foreign exchange inflows and revitalized the privatizationprocess.

Progress on structural reforms, other than privatization, was mixed. Reforms to broaden the income
tax base and streamline rates continued, and the legal framework for investor protection was
strengthened. However, implementation o f the schedule o f higher regional electricity tariffs, a key
step for continued reform o f the power sector, remains pending, and progress on trade liberalization
slowed.

Executive BoardAssessment

Executive Directors commended Pakistan's impressive macroeconomic performance since 2001.
They welcomed inparticular the acceleration in output growth, the steady decline in debt ratios, and
the fall in poverty rates. Directors noted that Pakistan's strong track record on the macroeconomic
and structural reform fronts had made the country increasingly attractive to foreign investors, as
shown by the record-high inflows o f foreign direct investment (FDI) during 2005/06 and the
favorable terms obtained on recent sovereign bond placements inthe international capital markets.

Directors noted that during 2005/06 the Pakistani economy had withstood well the impact o f large
negative shocks, including the tragic earthquake o f October 2005, a sharp rise in international oil
prices, and unfavorable weather conditions. Although these shocks had limited the scope for fiscal
maneuver, growth had remained buoyant, inflation had declined slightly and the import coverage o f
reserves hadremained stable.

Directors nonetheless noted the risks to the outlook, including the continued strength o f domestic
demand, and its adverse effects on the trade and current account deficits as well as on the pace of
disinflation during 2005/06. They noted also the authorities' view that macroeconomic imbalances
would decline without the need for hrther changes inthe stance o f policies envisaged for the current
fiscal year, and welcomed the government's commitment to tighten monetary policy, if warranted.
However, most Directors felt that macroeconomic policies during2006107 should be more effectively
geared at reducing domestic demand and strengthening the balance of payments position. To this
effect, many considered that a further tightening o f monetary policy (including by allowing higher
cutoff rates at treasury bill auctions) should not be delayed to help strengthen the external position
and allow the government to meet its inflation target. Most Directors considered that to be effective,
monetary policy should be supported by exchange rate flexibility and a fiscal policy that keeps this
year's budget deficit (excluding grants and earthquake-related expenditures) at least at the level o f
2005/06.

Directors stressed that, beyond 2006107, Pakistan's macroeconomic policies should aim at ensuring
that the external current account deficit-to-GDP ratio remains on a declining path with a steady build
up o freserves. Inthis regard, they encouraged the authorities to adopt a policy stance that maintains
real interest rates at positive levels accompanied by a close monitoring o f credit growth, and a fiscal
consolidation program that lowers the overall fiscal deficit to a sustainable level over the medium
term.

Directors viewed the favorable prospects for sizable FDI inflows as important for future gains in
productivity and investment, but also as presenting challenges for macroeconomic policy inthe years
ahead. They highlighted that continued reliance on FDI inflows o f uncertain size and timing would
require a large degree o f flexibility in economic policymaking. Inthis connection, Directors stressed
the need to improve the government's capacity to generate timely policy responses to shortfalls o f
external financing arising from negative balance o f payments shocks. Directors were o f the view that


                                                    2

those shocks should generally require monetary policy and exchange rate responses, but also
envisaged a role for fiscal tightening in cases where the shocks are large, or more permanent in
nature. Directors cautioned that the option o f resorting to the use o f international reserves to cover
shortfalls o f external financing (especially those stemming from delays inFDI-related flows) ought to
be used sparingly.

Directors viewed structural reforms conducive to higher saving and investment, an improvedbusiness
climate, and well-targeted poverty-related spending as critical for sustaining growth and poverty
reduction over the medium term. They encouraged the authorities to quickly complete the reform o f
the regulatory and tariff framework for the power sector, and step up efforts to broaden the tax base
and further curtail tax exemptions. Directors also saw scope for improving the government's debt
management strategy, including by increasing the issuance o f long-term marketable securities and
reducing its reliance on treasury bills and the National Savings Schemes (NSS) to finance the fiscal
deficit. Directors welcomed the initiatives underway to modernize the NSS and reform the system of
broker-financing o f stock trading, but noted that these should be followed quickly with measures that
enable the integrationo fthe NSS with local financial markets.

Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to maintaining a liberal trade regime and their
determination to contribute to the success o f the Doha round o f trade talks. They called on the
authorities to resist pressures to reinstate ad-hoc tariff and nontariff measures and broaden export
subsidy schemes.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further improve the quality and timeliness o f data, including
by reporting fiscal data on an economic classification. They also urgedthe authorities to expedite the
process of subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.

                         Annex 6: Sindh -Provincial Debt Sustainability Analysis

1. Together with increasedrevenue transfers from the federal government, the provincial debt
reduction strategy adoptedby the province enabled it to create additional space o f 1.2% o f provincial
GDPbetween 2001/02 and 2005/06.49All debt-related parameters have shown considerable
improvement. Between 2001/02 and 2005/06, althoughpublic debt o f the province has increased at a
rate o f 2% p.a., as a percent o f provincial GDP, the overall debt o f Sindh government declined from
10.1% in2001/02 to 6.2% in2005/06. Moreover, there has been substantial positive change inthe
composition o f this debt. While the share o f Cash Development Loans (CDLs) from the federal
government fell from 34% o f total debt in2001/02 to 23% by 2005/06, the shares o f foreign debt and
GPFundliabilities increased." As CDL (and GP Fundliabilities) are much expensive loans than the
foreign debt, the interest liabilities o f the provincial government have been falling at about 4% p.a..

2. Moving forward three alternative scenarios are considered. Inthe most conservative (baseline)
scenario, on the basis o fpresent (and expected future) project andprogram assistance from
internationaldevelopment partners, it i s expected that while the share o f CDL-related debt o f the
Sindh government will continue to fall (to 17% by 2009/20lo), the share of foreign debt would
stabilize (at about 53%) and that o f GP Fundliabilities would increase (to 30%). This implies that
decline ininterest payment o f the government would decelerate (and eventual would become positive,
ceteris paribus). Even inthis conservative scenario, overall, the public debt o f the province is
projectedto increaseby only 1%p.a. As a result: (i) public debt will fall from 6.2% o f PGDP in
                                                                     the
2005/06 to about 2% by 2015/2016; (ii) this period, the Net Present Value (NPV) o fpublic
                                                   during
debt will be reducedto one-third; and (iii)           the debt servicing to provincial revenue ratio would fall
from 6% to 2% (see Table 1).

3. Compared to the above described baseline scenario, the alternative scenario would be that the
province i s able to prematurelyretire more o f the federal loans by utilizingprogram assistance from
international donors". Inthis case, boththe public debt and interest liabilities will fall faster than
projected for the baseline scenario. Similarly, the third scenario which envisages no additionalpre-
mature retirement o f federal loans but a more accelerated capitalization and professional management
o f the provincialpensionand G.P. Funds would show a faster than the baseline (butnot as muchas in
the case o fretirement o f federal loans) decline indebt and interest liabilities.

4. This analysis clearly shows short o f an unlikely situation o f a huge external fiscal shock, the debt
situation o f the province i s likely to improve significantly infuture. The pace o f this improvement
would depend on the strategy adopted by the provincial government to manage its domestic debt.




49About two-third o f this fiscal space is attributable to the increased transfers from federal government, while the remaining
one-third is due to reduction in interest payments, partly to accelerated reduction in provincial debt to the federal
government.
50From 50% and 16%, respectively, to 53% and 24%.
"Aspertheunderstandingbetweenthefederal andprovincialgovernments, theprovincescanuseprogramassistancefrom
the donors for premature retirement o f federal loans. This is primarily to encourage the provinces on formulating and
implementingstructural and sectoral refoms which could be supported by the donors.
