INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CN
A PROPOSED LOAN TO
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM), with the guarantee of
the Republic of Colombia, for the equivalent of US$15 million to help finance
a third telecommunications project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including five years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Colombia, 138-CO) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 18, 1973. A note on major developments in the economy since that time
is included in Annex I.
3.        The Colombian economy has shown impressive gains in the recent past.
The rate of economic growth has accelerated to more than 7 percent per annum,
and the expansion of non-traditional exports has been remarkable. Such
improvements are very much needed in order to accelerate employment generation
and to raise gross national product per capita, currently US$400, one of the
lowest in Latin America, to a more acceptable level. Colombia also needs to
spread the benefits from growth more widely in order to surmount problems of
poverty and population pressures in both rural and urban areas. Concentration
of land ownership, technical backwardness, and under-employment characterize
most rural areas. In urban areas, pressures of population growth, compounded
by heavy migration from the countryside, have generated serious unemployment
and a severe housing deficit. Prospects for coping with these problems seem
brighter as a result of the accelerated growth upon which the Colombian
economy has embarked in the past several years.
4.        Recent Government administrations have reacted to rural poverty and
urban unemployment in a more systematic fashion than in the past, but much
remains to be done. In spite of the passage of an Agrarian Reform Law and the
creation of the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA) in 1961, only modest results
have been achieved in alleviating rural poverty. Additional legislation has
been enacted which lays a better basis for land reform but much remains to be
done to raise income in rural areas. In recognition of the problems of urban
concentration and unemployment, Colombia's previous Government placed greater
emphasis on urban development, particularly in the housing field, but despite
such action unemployment continued to increase in most of Colombia's major
urban centers. Preliminary indications suggest that the new Government, which



took office in August 1974, will strive to sustain a high rate of economic
growth while simultaneously attempting to achieve a more equitable distribution
of its benefits, inter alia, through expansion of employment opportunities and
increased investment in education, health and agriculture. There is likely to
be more emphasis on the development of agriculture and industry, and less
reliance on the urban construction sector to provide a stimulus to economic
growth. Export diversification will continue to be a major component of
development strategy and the Government is currently rationalizing the
export promotion system. These development programs have necessitated
and will continue to require a strengthening of the fiscal effort.
5.        At the latest Consultative Group Meeting held in June 1973, members
of the Group expressed the view that growing needs for public investment and
other public expenditures called for increases in domestic fiscal efforts.
While the Government then expressed the intention to further increase
revenues by new tax measures and by increasing the savings of public enter-
prises, little progress was achieved, and the fiscal situation remained weak.
To overcome these problems, Colombia's new Government has institutedc  comp~-
hensive structural reform of the fiscal system which includes major modifica-
tions of the sales and income taxes, and a strengthening of the fiscal con-
tribution of decentralized public enterprises. Discussions between the
Government and the Bpnk on fiscal issues are continuing.
6.        Colombia's efforts to expand exports have been amply rewarded in
recent years. Merchandise exports amounted to US$1,334 million in 1973, of
which over half came from non-coffee items. Allowing for price increases,
this represents a fourfold increase (representing an average annual real
growth of 24 percent) in non-traditional exports since 1965-67. Flowers,
clothing, emeralds, cotton thread and cloth, chemical and pharmaceutical
products, sawwood, and wood products enjoyed particularly large gains, although
raw cotton, sugar, meat, and other agricultural products continued to account
for the greatest absolute amounts. Coffee receipts were up largely as a
result of high international prices as the volume of coffee exports has
increased relatively little in recent years.
7.        Rapidly expanding exports accompanied by more slowly rising imports,
despite progressive removal of import restrictions, have created substantial
balance of payments surpluses. Net foreign exchange reserves of the Banco de
la Republica reached at the end of February 1974 nearly US$600 million, or
the equivalent of about five months' imports of goods and non-factor services
at the 1973 rate.  This compares favorably with the US$345 million and
US$170 million held at the end of 1972 and 1971, respectively, and to the
deficit positions that were common prior to 1968.  Since February, accelerated
import payments resulting from liberalization of import restrictions and
lengthening of the lag between export registrations and exchange surrender
together with lower world prices for coffee, moved the current account of
the balance of payments from a surplus position in 1973 to a deficit for the
first eight months of last year. Sharply reduced external borrowing by the
Government has further lowered the inflow of foreign exchange, and reserves



-3-
probably declined by about US$120 million during 1974. Care will have
to be exercised in foreign exchange reserve management since world coffee
prices may remain weak for some time and prices of several of Colombia's
non-traditional agricultural exports appear to have peaked, while those of
imports are expected to continue to rise. The new Government is aware of
the possibility of some weakening in the balance of payments, and since taking
office in mid-August has more than doubled the rate of depreciation of the
peso, ahead of domestic price increases, in an effort to hold down the rapid growth
of imports and sustain adequate incentives to exporters. A longer-term problem
is that, unless appropriate action is taken, Colombia will become a sizeable net
importer of crude petroleum near the end of the decade, and the pressure on the
balance of payments from petroleum imports, should they become necessary, could
be considerable. A high-level Energy Cowncil is studying exploration incentives,
taxation and foreign-exchange arrangements, product pricing, and other aspects
of this problem.
8.        The rapid growth of Colombia's GDP in 1972-73 was accompanied by
a sharply accelerated rate of price inflation. Consumer prices jumped 22 per-
cent in 1973, as compared with 14 percent in 1972, 12 percent in 1971, and
an average of 7 percent yearly in 1967-70. Food prices, which have a weight
of about 50 percent in the cost of living index, increased by 30 percent in
1973. The authorities have taken a number of ileasures to dampen price
pressures, including liberalization of import controls, reduction of tariffs,
and tighter controls on public expenditure, but given the weak state of
public finances, inflation continued being a problem throughout 1974 and is
expected to have reached 25 percent by year end. To deal with this situation,
the new Government invoked emergency economic powers and is moving forcefully
to implement a comprehensive fiscal and monetary reform aimed at strengthening
public finances and at producing a more balanced flow of resources through
Colombia's financial system and at providing the authorities with greater
monetary control.
9.        Colombia's public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$2.6 billion at the end of 1973, or US$1.9 billion excluding
undisbursed commitments. The Bank's share of this external debt (disbursed
only) as of end 1973 was about 28 percent, but this share is expected to decline
to 25 percent in 1978 as Colombia relies to a greater extent on other external
borrowing. Service on this debt is modest (12 percent of foreign exchange earn-
ings in 1973) relative to other developing countries. Since exports have risen



-4 -
more rapidly than debt service in recent years, there has been a decrease
in the debt service ratio at a time when economic growth has accelerated.
The debt service ratio is expected to rise moderately and peak in the
mid-1980s at about 18 percent as a result of greater capital inflows
associated with a high growth rate. The Bank's share of total debt service
is expected to peak at about 28 percent in 1975 and is likely to decline
thereafter. Should economic growth continue at a rapid pace, which appears
feasible, and should that growth be accompanied by a further strong expansion
of non-coffee exports and the maintenance of sound economic and financial
policies, Colombia should find it possible to secure the amounts of external
capital it needs and to service the indebtedness that this borrowing would
generate.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIDNS IN COLONBIA
10.       The proposed loan 2/--the fifty-ninth to be made to Colombia--would
bring the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,127.8 million (net
of cancellations). Of the foregoing amount, US$854.6 is now held by the
Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$19.5 million for highways in Colombia
in 1961.
11.       Disbursements have been completed on 33 loans and the one IDA
credit. IFC has made effective investments and underwriting commitments
in 20 enterprises in Colombia, totalling about US$27 million of which IFC
now holds US$13 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, the IDA credit, and IFC investments as of September 30, 1974, and
notes on the execution of the 23 on-going projects.

j/  The proposed loan is presented simultaneously with two other proposed loans
for a Small-Scale Industry Project and a Water Supply and Sewerage Project.



12.       Since 1968, Bank lending in Colombia has become more diversified
than in earlier years. All three loans in the education sector have been
made since then as were one-half of the eight agricultural loans, four of
the five loans in the water supply sector and four of the loans for
industry. This compares with six loans during these past five years in
the sectors where the Bank has been traditionally active, i.e., power
and transport. Bank efforts have been focused on production-oriented
activities and activities which carry social as well as economic benefits.
Projects being developed will seek to combine the objectives of increasing
output with maximum benefits in terms of employment and improving the
income of the poor, particularly in rural areas.
13.       We expect over the next several years to make an increasing
contribution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with particular
emphasis on projects involving small and medium size farmholdings and
industrial enterprises. The other major focus of our activities would
be in such social sectors as education and water supply. We would con-
tinue to support projects in the traditional sectors of Bank lending--
electric power and transportation--in those cases where support is required
for necessary institutional development. Projects are currently in an
advanced stage of preparation for rural settlement and irrigation
rehabilitation.
14.       The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in
Annex I, pages 3-4. While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about four-fifths
of total external financing to Colombia in the 1961-72 period, their
share has decreased since then. The IDB has assisted projects in low-
cost housing, university education, agrarian reform, ports, electric
power, water supply, transportation, and industry. AID has shifted the
emphasis of its lending in recent years from program to sector loans,
particularly for education, urban development, and agriculture.
PART III: TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN COLOMBIA
15.       The Ministry of Communications exercises governmental control of
the sector, It is responsible for policy making, licensing and regulation
of the various entities operating in the sector. Responsibility for providing
telecommunications services in Colombia is shared by 54 entities, Operating
as the sole government-owned entity, TELECOM has the exclusive license to
provide national telegraph, telex and long distance services and all inter-
national telecommunications services, Local telephone services are provided
by TELECOM and the 53 other municipal entities.   With prior mrinisterial approval,
TELECOM is allowed to acquire the entities operating local telephone services.
However atthis stage TELECOM only owns and operates about 5 percent of the



-6-
local subscribers lines (35,000 out of 677,000).
16,       The main problem of the telecommunication sector is the fragmented
operation of local telephone service. The large number of entities complicates
sector interworking with varying operating standards and often results in
uncoordinated planning of facilities. Some large municipalities provide
reasonably good service. In smaller cities and towns, however, the quality
of the telephone service is unsatisfactory due to the small scale of
operations (all except eight operate less than 10,000 equipment lines) and
the insufficient attention paid to the extension and improvement of the
telecommunication service.
17.       The long term solution of the problem lies in consolidation of
the several local operating entities by TELECOM into a single national
telecommunication body. When approving increases in TELECOM's long distance
tariffs in 1971, the Government specified that part of the expected additional
revenue should be set aside and used exclusively by TELECOM for local expan-
sion,including acquisition of local entities. TELECOM has taken over control
of seven such entities during the last three years and plans during 1975-78
to take over 19 more entities. By 1981 TELECOM expectBto have taken over
all local telephone entities, except the eight largest in the major cities.
18.       While TELECOM's long distance service development is progressing
satisfactorily, local telephone service planning and development by the
other telephone entities is not able to keep up with demands. The local
services entities do not have adequate financial resources for planned
development. Two of the largest such entities (Bogota and Cali) would,
beyond 1975 and 1976 when their present plans fructify, have serious problems
in financing future development, and have requested the Government to
organize and mobilize financial assistance from various sources including
the Bank. The position of the other smaller entities is even worse, and
their future development plans are based not on need, but on the quantum and
timing of supplier credits which they hope to obtain. The Government is
aware of these problems and requested the Bank to undertake a sector study
and to assist the Government to assess the requirements of each entity over
the next 5-10 years, establish priorities for investment, and consider
possible sources of funds. The Sector Study has been completed and the
report is in course of preparation. The sector mission's main conclusions
are that present fragmentation of the sector has resulted in increased costs
and lowered efficiency, as well as lack of coordination and rationalization
in policy planning, investment programming and budgeting, procurement and
regulatory control. Its chief recommendation is that the most appropriate
solution to this problem lies in consolidation of the many separate entities
into one; namely, TELECOM. Discussions with the Government on these recommenda-
tions are continuing.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
19.       The project was appraised in November 1973 and loan negotiations
were held in Bogota during October-December 197h. The Colombian delegation
was led by Dr. CristiAn Mosquera. A loan and project summary is attached
as Annex III to this report,and an Appraisal Report (605-CO) is being



-7-
circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
20.       The proDosed loan constitutes the Bank's third lending operation
for telecommunications in Colombia. The first Loan to TEELECOM (L99-CU) of
utS16 million was rmade in 1967 to help finance the establish2aent of a basic
long distance network and for the expansion and improvement of national and
international telecommunications services. The loan has been fully disbursed
and the physical work; still outstanding should be completed by mid-1975. 'Tlhe
second Loan to TELECOM, (740-CO) for US$15 million which was approved in 17i,
assists in financing new local networks and extension of long distance
facilities. The project will be completed by June 197b, one year behind
schedule.  TELECOM's performance has in general been satisfactory; however,
iL has had organizational problems in recent years, and would engage technical
and financial consultants to assist in improving its operational efficiency.
Descriotion and Purpose of the Project
21.       The project is estimated to cost Col41,609 million (US452.1 million)
withi a foreign exchange component of US$33.5 million equivalent. The proposed
Bank loan (US$15 million) would cover part of the foreign exchange costs,
while the balance (US$1.5 million) would be financed with TELECOM's own
resources.  The Government is prepared to provide the necessary foreign
exchange from the general foreign exchange reserves of the country. The
Govern:;ient believed that, at least for the time being, potentially availabl'e
foreign credits carry unacceptably onerous terms. The project is national
in scope, and consists of installation of (a) about 18,000 additional lines
of switching equipment, cables and subscribers plant, to connect about 16,000
additional subscribers; (b) long distance equipment for about 5,400 additional
circuits; (c) telex equipment to connect 500 additional subscribers; and (d)
call office telephone facilities in about 200 rural areas. A further important
objective of the loan would be to enable the Bank to continue its institutionl-
building effort in the telecommunications sector.
Execution of the Project
22.       lELECOM's staff will do engineering designs and, with the assistance
o' tecimical consultants retained under Loan 740-CO, will prepare bid documents
and technical specifications,. evaluate bids and draw up contracts for goods.
TE'LECO'I will lay all distribution cables and will supervise construction of
cable ducts and buildings constructed by local contractors. All telephone
and transmission equipment in new locations will be installed by the suppliers
with the assistance of TELECOk staff. Extensions to existing plant will be
installed by TELECOIM1, which will also carry out acceptance tests of all
installed equipment.



-8-
Finances
2.        From 1971 to 1973 TELECOM's overall revenues increased by 92 per-
cent to Col$1,1L41 (US$43.9) million, partly as a result of tariff increases.
During the same period, operating expenses increased by 91 percent to
Col$1,022 (US$39.3) million, maimly due to increases in personnel expenses.
The rate of return, on an annual basis, was 11.7 percent in 1971, 14i.9 per-
cent in 1972 and 7.5 percent in 1973. Following a 12 percent tariff
increase in January 1974 it is estimated that TELECOM's rate of return for
19714 will be sufficiently high to make up for the 1973 deficiency and
provide for an 11 percent return. This accords with the rate of return
covenant in Loan 740-CO, which requires TEIECOM to achieve an annual rate
of return of at least 11 percent, but allows a shortfall or overrun to be
carried forward to the next year. In computing the rate of return,
assets are valued in terms of peso equivalents of their dollar values.
2).       For the future, TELECOM has undertaken to maintain the 11 percent
rate of return and to review on an annual basis (i) the need for a tariff
increase prior to April 1, and (ii) to adjust its rates, if necessary,
prior to July 1 each year (Section 5.05 of draft Loan Agreement).
25.        TELECOMts debt service coverage by internal cash generation
declined from 2.1 times in 1971 to 1.1 times in 1973, because of the
continuous devaluation of the Colombian peso and the increasing amounts of
foreign debts incurred. During this period TELECOM experienced difficulties
with the collection of receivables from other telephone entities operating in
Colombia,and from Government. TELECOM has informed the Bank of the steps it
has taken and will take to improve this situation. It has just completed the
collection of the Government debt in question. The Government will also use
its good offices with municipalities, departments and the connecting local
telephone enterprises to clear within a reasonable time their present arrears
to TELECOM and to prevent future accumulation or arrears (Section 3.02 of
draft Guarantee Agreement).
26.       Domestic tariffs are set by the Board of TELECOM, subject to
approval by the Minister of Communications and the National Tariff Board.
In addition to the installation charge of about US$14.50 equivalent, and the
guarantee deposit of about US$33, new local subscribers are required to pay
a non interest-bearing deposit which varies between about US$20 and US$49
equivalent per line. Telephone monthly rentals of US$1 for residential and
about US$1.40 for business subscribers, and the local telephone call charge
of US$0o0oh (Col$0010),are very low compared with similar charges in other
countries.



-9-
27.       TELECOM's financial position is expected to improve during the
project period. Its liquidity position would in every year be satisfactory
and enable TELECOM to meet regularly its current debt service obligations.
While total debt service payments are projected to increase from Col$183 mil-
lion in 1974 to Col$372 million in 1978, the annual debt service coverage
ratio is projected to improve from 1.1 times in 1973 to 2.0 times in 1978.
Procurement
2c.       All goods financed by the Bank loan will be procured through
international competitive bidding, except the extensions to existing exchanges
(valued at US$2.6 million) which were obtained through international competi-
tive bidding under Loan 740, where the equipment is for reasons of
standardization, being obtained from the original contractor at unit Prices
cuoted under the earlier bid, and adjusted for inflation.  2ELEGOA will finance
from; its own resources other imported goods which will be erocured by negotiatiorIs
woita thie suppliers and through competitive bidding, and goods such as cables,
cab_e ducts, poles and fittings which are manufactured locally and which will
De nrocured through competitive bids fromi domestic suppliers.
-.        None of the Bank-financed goods are currently produced in Colombia;
therefore, the issue of preference to domestic suppliers does not arise.
Though Colombia is a member of the Latin American Free Trade Association
(LAFTA) and the Andean Pact, TELECOM is exempt from import dutiesj hence,
bid preference for LAFTA and the Andean Pact countries is not applicable.
Disbursement
Disbursement would be for the CIF costs of imported equipment and
the foreign costs of its installation. Any unused balance of the loan would
be used to finance additional equipment, similar to that already procured
under the loan, after consultation with the Bank.
Rate of Return and Justification
The project's rate of return is about 27% if benefits are measured
-el- by the incremental net revenues attributable to -he project.  l'he incre-
eonta:L revenues uwlderstate the benefits since the project costs include the
`ull costs .f extending service to new areas even though the fu_l Denefit of
such extension would be obtained only when additional potential subscribers
o-re connected. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out showing Lhat th1e
r2ate of -eturn would be 22 per cent for unfavorable variatio,ns of tn1e main
..a-aieters by 10-1i per cent.  The project would iiiake an i;.,ipL.rtant indirect
cont-ibusion to the economLic development of Colomibia by inc-easing operating
efficiency ill atministrative, indusLrial card commercial activities.

COLOMBIA - MEMORANDUM ON RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
A. Recent Economic Developments
Economic Growth
1.         The Colombian economy has performed impressively in a number of
important respects in the past several years. Real growth of gross domestic
product accelerated from an average of 4.7 percent in 1950-67 to an average
of 6.4 percent over the 1967-72 period. During the past two years, Colombia
has sustained even higher rates of growth, 7.1 percent in 1972 and 7.3 percent
in 1973, the highest rates of growth achieved in 25 years. Strong expansion
of the industrial, agricultural, and in 1973, construction sectors, rapid
growth of non-traditional exports, and favorable coffee prices were the key
factors in this achievement. Preliminary indications are that GDP growth has
decelerated slightly in 1974 as a result of a slowdown in the construction
boom and a weakening of coffee prices. While industry continues to be the
leading growth sector, expanding by 10 percent in real terms in 1973 and
accounting for about 30 percent of growth of GDP, a boom in construction
generated an increase in value added by that sector of 12.6 percent. Despite
rapid growth of the labor-intensive construction sector, unemployment has
continued to increase in most of Colombia's major urban centers, in part as
a result of accelerated rural to urban migration. While the rate of growth
of agriculture (4.8 percent in 1973) was well above the historical average,
most of the growth was concentrated in agricultural commodities for export.
Lagging production for domestic consumption, insufficient to keep pace with
domestic demand has contributed to inflationary pressures. Mining production
has declined steadily for the past several years as a result of declining
petroleum production.
Inflation
2.         Inflation has become a serious problem in Colombia and seems likely
to persist for some time, despite a number of measures taken in recent months
to combat it.  The cost-of-living index is expected to have risen by about 25 percent
in 1974 as compared to, 22 percent last year, 14 percent in 1972, 12. percent
in 1971, and an average of 7 percent per year between 1967 and 1970. Accelera-
tion in the rate of inflation during 1973 and the first quarter of 1974 was
the result of a surge in the level of demand stemming from (a) the substantial
increase in the income of the export sector; (b) the large fiscal deficit in
the cash operations of the public sector; and (c) continued strong private
investment. Rising cost of imports, labor and credit, combined with tight
controls on imports and a decline in the output of agricultural production
for domestic consumption further aggravated inflationary pressures. Measures
adopted in late 1973 and early 1974 to limit the rate of expansion of aggregate
demand and increase aggregate supply have begun to take hold and the rate of

Page 6 of 12
inflation has declined during the second and third quarters of 1974. However,
increasing pressure for substantial upward wage adjustments from organized
labor and the need to eliminate some subsidies and allow upward adjustment
in prices of a number of items which have been controlled for the past 12
months have caused some increase in the rate of inflation during recent
months. Progress in reducing the rate of inflation in 1975 will depend
heavily upon the Government's success in arresting the deterioration in
public finances which has taken place since 1972.
Balance of Payments
3.         Colombia's rapid growth in 1972-73 was sparked by strong growth of
coffee and most minor exports which permitted a large accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves. Coffee exports increased an estimated 34 percent to
US$630 million, largely as a result of continuation of the upsurge in world
coffee prices (an average of uS$0.73 per pound in 1973 as compared to US$0.57
in 1972) which began in mid-1972 as Brazilian coffee production declined. Of
even more significance from the point of view of the long-term growth of the
Colombian economy was the continued strong performance of minor exports which
increased 48 percent to US$630 million. Price rises for these goods accounted
for a significant proportion of the increase, but volume exported also rose
by a substantial 15 percent. Despite the impressive 40 percent increase in
total export earnings which took place in 1973, Colombia continued throughout
most of the year to maintain tight controls on imports. As a consequence the
value of imports exceeded the 1972 level by only 22 percent, not substantially
more than the increase in import prices. The increased real availability of
imported goods accordingly did little to dampen domestic inflationary pressures.
Despite official measures to speed up import payments and to reduce foreign
exchange inflows to the Bank of the Republic arising from private borrowing
abroad, official reserves increased from US$345 million at end-1972 to US$524
million at end-1973.
4.         Export performance during the first seven months of 1974 was out-
standing.  Higher world coffee prices and a 32 percent increase in the volume
shipped resulted in a 36 percent increase in coffee export registrations
during this period as compared to the same period of 1973. Registrations of
non-traditional exports increased 51.4 percent through July, an increase of
over 30 percent in real terms. Exports of manufactured products have been a
major element in the strong expansion of non-traditional exports with earnings
from textiles increasing three-fold, while those from chemicals and pharmaceuti-
cals, and metals and metal products, doubled. Import liberalization has led
to accelerated import payments and there has been a lengthening of the lag
between export registrations and exchange surrender. Thus, despite strong
export performance the current account of the balance of payments has shifted
from a surplus of over US$100 million during the first seven months of 1973
to a deficit of US$80 million during the same period of this year. Sharply
reduced external borrowing by the Government has further lowered the inflow
of foreign exchange, and reserves probably declined by about US$120 million
during 1974,



ANNEX I
Page 7 of 12
5.       The estimated decline in foreign exchange reserves of US$120 million for
1974 should not present any problem to Colombia since an appropriate cushion of
reserves, sufficient to cover about 4 months of imports, probably still existed
by year end. Foreign exchange reserve management over the next eighteen
months should aim at preventing further losses, since world coffee prices may
remain weak for some time, and prices of several of Colombia's non-traditional
agricultural exports appear to have peaked, while those of imports are expected
to continue rising. The new government is aware of the possibility of some
deterioration in the terms of trade and is attempting to sustain the high rate
of growth of non-traditional exports by accelerating devaluation of the peso
so as to compensate exporters for the differential between internal and ex-
ternal inflation. Since mid-August the rate of depreciation of the peso has
been substantially greater than the differential between domestic and world
inflation and the Government intends to continue this policy for the fore-
seeable future.
Public Finances
6.         Deterioration of Colombia's public finances since 1971 has made
it increasingly difficult for the authorities to manage aggregate demand so
as to contain inflation while maintaining a desirable pace of development.
Despite an average annual real rate of growth of GDP in excess of 7 percent,
National Government tax revenue has failed to show any significant increase
in real terms and, as a percentage of GDP, declined from the peak of 9.4 per-
cent in 1971 to an expected 7.4 percent in 1974. This weakening in domestic
resource mobilization through the tax system was, in 1972 and 1973, reflected
in increased Government recourse to general purpose external borrowing to
cover the Government's cash deficit, and in declining real levels of public
investment. In order to overcome these problems, the new Government has
initiated a comprehensive structural reform of the fiscal system which includes
major modification of the sales and income taxes, elimination of the wheat
subsidy, reduction of fiscal incentives for non-traditional exports, and
strengthening of the fiscal contribution of decentralized public enterprises.
The reform has not yet been fully put into effect, but it could, if fully
implemented and supplemented by an urban property tax and measures to eliminate
the subsidy of gasoline consumption, produce a substantial strengthening of
public finances.
B. Development Problems and Policy Requirements
7.         While Colombia's growth, and balance of payments performance has
been excellent in recent years, lagging performance in several important
areas could, if permitted to continue, jeopardize the country's development
effort. The key areas where policy action is required include improving
the performance of the petroleum sector, strengthening public finances and



ANNEX I
Page 8 of 12
investment, maintaining the appropriate balance in the flow of resources
through the financial system, further improving income distribution and the
employment situation, and assuring continued strong expansion of non-tradi-
tional exports.
Petroleum
8.         Colombia is fortunate in having sufficient crude petroleum supplies
to escape any immediate adverse balance of payments' effect of recent in-
creases in world oil prices. However, an unrealistic pricing policy has, in
recent years, encouraged excessive consumption and contributed to a decline
in output. While the internal reference price paid to producers for "new"
crude oil was increased to US$4 per barrel in February 1974, prices to
producers for petroleum flowing from existing fields as well as prices at
the refinery and consumer levels have not been changed since June 1971, and
are far below prices in international markets.
9.         Crude oil production has declined 20 percent since 1970, and crude
exports have stopped altogether. Creation of appropriate incentives for in-
creased exploitation of oil from fields already in production, and a modest
dampening of domestic demand by means of long-overdue price increases, would
permit Colombia to hold off crude oil imports until 1979-80. If decisive
action is taken in the months ahead to encourage exploration and drilling,
it is entirely possible that new oil, sufficient to meet domestic demand,
could become available in 5-6 years. Failure to act in the immediate future,
however, could, in the early 1980's, result in a heavy burden on Colombia's
balance of payments.
10.        Prices of petroleum products are controlled by the Government and
tihe retail price of gasoline is among the lowest in the world (regular
gasoline is US$0.12/gallon). Considering the country's supply and demand
situation, product prices to the consumer and at the different stages of
production should be increased so as to be more in line with international
prices. Such a price adjustment should be done as soon as possible since
low petroleum product prices have not only discouraged production of petroleum,
but have diverted attention from development of the abundant coal, natural
gas, and hydroelectric resources which Colombia possesses. Hydropower, coal,
and natural gas currently account for only 4 percent, 12 percent, and 17 percent,
respectively, of energy production and there is considerable scope for sub-
stituting these alternative energy sources for petroleum. To develop them
will, however, require careful planning and sizable capital outlays, as well
as proper pricing to encourage an appropriate energy balance. There is a
close relationship between petroleum pricing policy and the fiscal situation
since price increases of petroleum products would increase the Central Govern-
ment's fiscal resources through further improved finances of the State-owned
oil company, ECOPETROL, and through increased gasoline tax collections. This
would help to overcome the revenue shortfalls which hamper the investment
program and which limit the government's ability to reduce present inflationary
pressures.

Public Savings and Investment
11.        Notwithstanding the booming production and trade conditions of the
economy over the past few years, Colombia's public finance performance has
been disappointing. Largely because of poor tax collections in 1972 and 1973
(especially for the income tax) the real current surplus in both years was
below that in 1971. The real decline in income tax collections in 1973 oc-
curred despite a 7.3 percent increase in real GDP and reveals a serious
weakness in income tax administration. Real public investment spending in
1973, covered in part by severe compression of current outlays and by
US$80 million in Eurocurrency borrowing, fell sharply despite the continued
pressing need for expanded social and economic infrastructure. Preliminary
data for 1973 indicate that the decline in public investment has not been
offset by an increase in private investment and that the share of total
investment in GDP has fallen from an average 21.4 percent in the 1969-72
period to 19.3 percent in 1973. Without substantial strengthening of public
finances, public investment could continue to decline in real terms and the
expansion of the private sector could be constrained by lack of complementary
social and economic infrastructure.
12.        Reliable data are not yet available concerning Colombia's overall
public sector accounts for 1971-74, but enough is known to make it clear that
the decline in National Government investment during this period was not
offset by spending in the rest of the public sector. The new Government is
aware of the need for increased investment by decentralized public sector
agencies and is expected to move rapidly in the coming months to assure an
appropriate increase in the internally generated resources of these agencies.
Deficits of public enterprises in the electric power, water and sewerage,
and telecommunications sectors, with the exception of Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM),have risen in recent years as a result of lagging
tariffs. Three decentralized enterprises, Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos
(ECOPETROL), TELECOM and Empresa Colombiana de Puertos (COLPUERTOS), have in
the past few years accounted for 90 percent of the total current surplus of
the public enterprises. Dissaving of public enterprises was concentrated in
four enterprises; IDEMA (the Government's agricultural marketing agency), the
Railways (CNR), Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA), and Instituto Colombiano
de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA). In the rest of the public sector the tendency
has been for savings to decline also since 1969. As a result total public
savings fell from 7.0 percent of GDP in 1969 to 5.0 percent in 1973.
13.       The recently completed fiscal reform contains an impressive array
of measures aimed at (a) increasing tax revenue; (b) improving the progressivity
of the tax system by reducing the tax burden on the lowest income groups, increas-
ing taxes on the highest income groups, and by closing numerous loopholes which
have permitted high income groups to avoid paying taxes; (c) increasing the
elasticity of the tax system; and (d) improving tax administration. While it
will be several months before the revenue implications of the fiscal reform
become completely clear, preliminary estimates indicate that new tax revenue
of about Col$ 2.5 billion will be generated in 1975. In addition, elimination
of the wheat subsidy has reduced the need for transfers to IDEMA by an esti-
mated Col$ 1.2 billion in 1975.   The outlook for 1975 is for a sharply



ANNEX I
Page 10 of 12
reduced National Government deficit as the recent revenue generating measures
begin to take hold. The Central Government deficit should be reduced from
about 2% of GDP in 1971-72 to 0.2% in 1975; but it must be noted that this
is likely to be achieved only with the help of a further reduction in real
terms in investment expenditures by the National Government.
Reform of the Financial System
14.        In August 1974, the new administration introduced a series of execu-
tive decrees and resolutions aimed at domestic monetary reform. These measures
involve restructuring of interest rates, including establishment of a maximum
ceiling on the rate of monetary correction, a simplification of Colombia's
complex reserve requirement system, the elimination of numerous portfolio
requirements, the elimination of several rediscount facilities, and the
adoption of more stringent controls over existing facilities. In broad terms,
these measures should produce a more balanced flow of resources through
Colombia's financial system and provide the authorities with greater control
over the functioning of the monetary system.
Income Distribution and Employment
15.        Despite the paucity of suitable statistics it seems clear that the
existing distribution of personal income is markedly unequal. The poorest
fifth of the population appears to be receiving 3 percent of total income,
while the richest fifth gets about 60 percent. Not much can be said about
changes over time, but since rural incomes seem to be more highly skewed than
urban incomes, the increasing demographic importance of the towns and cities
would seem to present a prima facie case for presuming a modest improvement
in the overall national income distribution. This conclusion is to some
extent supported by national income accounts data which indicate that the
share of wage and salary income of GDP increased from 36 percent in 1950
to 40 percent in 1970. Few Colombians would accept past rates of improvemerst
as adequate, however, and a great deal remains to be done in order to spre-.'
the benefits of economic growth more widely. Rural land redistribution.
more effective taxation, higher public spending for education and health
services, and a vigorous effort to boost overall production and employment
growth are all needed, together with continuing efforts to prevent abuses
arising from monopoly power. Colombia's authorities have accelerated their
efforts to do all of these things in recent years.
16.        The employment goal is perhaps the most important of all the major
national objectives in the economic sphere. Increasing and spreading employ-
ment opportunities is the single most effective way to raise the level and
improve the distribution of national income. Data on unemployment are sparse,
but the available figures for 1972 point to an improvement in Bogota accom-
panied by deterioration in Medellin, Barranquilla, and other urban centers.
If rough weights by city are applied, a slight overall deterioration seems
to have occurred. Since 1972 rural to urban migration appears to have
increased and as a result unemployment in Colombia's major urban centers has
increased. The one exception to this has been in Cali where accelerated
rural to urban migration has not been as pronounced because of its rich agri-
cultural hinterland and decentralized agro-industries located in a number of



ANNEX I
Page 11 of 12
smaller cities throughout the Departments of Valle and Cauca. The challenge
facing Colombia's authorities is to encourage and shape growth of employment
through the use of excise taxes, depreciation allowances, import tariffs and
general monetary/fiscal policies. Special incentives should be provided to
industries which are labour-intensive and to firms willing to undertake
multiple shifting as a means of increasing employment.
External Borrowing
17.        Available data indicate that Colombia's public external debt out-
standing at the end of 1973 came to US$2.6 billion, of which US$1.9 billion
had been disbursed. During 1973 contracts were signed to borrow US$421
million (of which US$305 million were project loans). The levels and composi-
tion of 1973 borrowing closely approximated the amounts set forth in the 1973
project list (as described in the May 1973 IBRD Economic Report net of expected
slippage and droppage). An estimated disbursement of US$340 million on public
external borrowing occurred in 1973, as compared to US$355 million in 1972 and
US$223 million in 1971. While disbursements on project loans increased 20
percent in 1973, a slowdown of such disbursements has taken place since late
1973, reflecting a scarcity of local counterpart funds stemming from the
deteriorating fiscal performance. However, the fiscal actions now being taken
by the Colombian Government, and those under consideration may to some extent
ameliorate this situation, and it is hoped that by the time of the 1975
Consultative Group Meeting sufficient action will have been taken to enable
the Group to proceed with consideration of a full assistance program for
1975-76.
C. The Growth Perspective and Capital Requirements
18.        Recent IBRD Economic Reports on Colombia have concluded that the
economy can sustain a 7 percent annual rate of growth over the long-term
without excessive foreign borrowing, provided that exports can be increased
at a reasonable rate. During 1972-73 this growth target was attained, and
it is likely that in 1974 real growth will again reach about 7 percent. These
high rates of growth were accompanied by a strong export and balance-of-payments
performance, which made possible a large build-up of foreign exchange re-
serves, and a decline in the debt service ratio. The long-term projection
made last year is being revised, to take into account recent developments and
new information on the outlook for commodity prices and world inflation.
19.       For the time being it seems safe to assume that the volume of coffee
exports will increase 1.5 percent annually from 1975 through the remainder of
the current decade and that export earnings from coffee in current prices will
increase an average 7.6 percent annually, until 1979. Growth in the volume of
other exports which include a wide ranze of manufactured and agricultural exports,
can be assumed on that basis to decline from 20 percent in 1975 to 10 percent
for 1979. Total exports would increase in current prices at an average 14.3



ANNEX I
Page 12 of 12
per year from 1974 on. In real terms the growth rate of total exports may thus
be between 7% and 7.5%. Imports may be assumed to be about 15 percent of GDP
throughout the projection period provided that Colombia will not require sub-
stantial imports .of crude oil. Under these assumptions Colombia will require
public external assistance disbursements totalling about US$3.5 billion during
the five-year period 1975-79. This level of external assistance implies new
commitments averaging US$700 million annually. These public external assistance
requirements imply only modest increases in real terms over recent levels.
20.       In the past the structure of Colombia's external debt has been strongly
influenced by the receipt of large amounts of development assistance from inter-
national development agencies. This, together with the successful export per-
formance, explains the low and relatively stable debt service ratio which Colombia
has experienced over the past decade. As a result of continuing rapid growth of
non-traditional exports and favorable coffee prices, the burden of debt service
n the balance of payments declined moderately in 1973.    The debt service ratio
(principal and interest payments as a percentage of exports of goods and nonfactor
ser-vices) amounted to a modest 12 percent in 1973 compared to 12.9 percent in 1972
an.d 14.3 percent in 1971.  The debt service ratio is now lower than throughout
most of the 1960s. Despite the expected shift away from external assistance
from international development agencies and the large increase in total external
borrowing (in current prices) which is foreseen at least until the end of the
current decade, the debt service ratio would remain well manageable during that
period. In these circumstances, and assuming that Colombia is able to sustain
its export expansion and avoid external borrowing on unfavorable terms to cover
fiscal shortfalls, the country should have little difficulty in obtaining the
required external capital and in servicing its external debt obligations.
However, some of this capital will have to finance local costs, if the
country is to cover its justifiable resource gap, since the foreign exchange
content of the projectizable portion of the investment program is likely to
be comparatively small.

C.    PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
1.         Summarized below is the current status of all loans signed but not
fully disbursed:
Ln No. 502 Irrigation (Atlantico I); US$9 million, June 1967.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1973;
current - December 31, 1974.
2.         While all physical works should be completed by the current clos-
ing date, final payments to contractors will not occur until March or April
1975. A further extension of closing date to June 30, 1975, is therefore
being considered. The delays in project execution have been occasioned by
poor selection of areas suitable for irrigation, technical problems in the
construction of irrigation and drainage works, and non-compliance by con-
tractors with established schedules. Agricultural development has also been
slow, due to poor project management and lack of adequate supporting services
to the farmer. lIowever, INCORA has now appointed a very capable Project
Manager who has brought with him a competent agricultural team who, it is
believed, have the potential to develop the project satisfactorily under its
less than ideal circumstances. Citrus has now been abandoned as a project
crop. Rice is now proposed as a temporary irrigated crop in order to allow
the leaching of salts from the soil profile. The intensive cropping pattern
needed to justify the investment in irrigation facilities will be several
years in development.
Ln No. 536 Water Supply (Bogota I); US$14 million, June 1968.
Closing date: original - June 1972;
current - December 31, 1975.
3.         As of September 30, 1974, US$13.6 million or 97 percent of this
loan has been disbursed. Notwithstanding that the Project is essentially
completed, the Closing Date was extended because of delays in procurement
and to permit final payments to suppliers.
Ln No. 575 Electric Power (Interconnection): US$18 million, December 1968.
Closing date: December 31, 1974.
4.         The original project was completed and commercially operational
in 1971. The Bank agreed that an undisbursed balance could be used to fi-
nance a 220 kv transmission line, Guatape - Barrancabermeja, which would

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

be completed in the first quarter of 1975, one year behind schedule. The
cost is estimated at US$7.2 million of which about US$4.1 million represents
the foreign currency component. The Bank is seriously concerned about ISA's
financial situation which is being discussed with the borrower and the Govern-
ment.
Ln No. 624 Agricultural Credit II, US$17 million, June 1969
Closing date: original - December 31, 1973;
current - June 30, 1975.
5.         After disappointing performance in the first three years, changes
in project management and organization and an increase in technical personnel
provided the basis in February 1973 for the Bank's agreeement to enlarge the
project area and include lending to small farmers under the project. As a
result, the project is now proceeding in a satisfactory manner. All project
funds are expected to be committed by end 1974.
Ln No. 625 Development Finance Companies III: US$25 million,
June 1969.
Closing date: June 30, 1974
6.         The loan is fully committed to sub-projects.    The Bank will ascertain
whether the Borrower wishes the Closing Date postponed or the small undisbursed
balance cancelled.
Ln No. 651 Livestock II; US$18.3 million, December 1969
Closing date: July 31, 1975
7.         After a disappointing performance during the first three years after
signing, 1970-72, CAJA's project administration was reorganized and the project
area was extended to cover the entire country. The project has, since early
1973, progressed satisfactorily. Demand for on-farm investments is high and!
disbursements have been. accelerating. All loan funds are expected to be com-
mitted by end 1974 and disbursements might be completed before the original
closing date of July 31, 1975.
Ln No. 679 Education II; US$6.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1973;
current - December 31, 1974.
8.         Major civil works have been completed and all nine project schools
have been in operation since January 1973. However, operation of schools is
below the expected level because of inadequate organization and shortage
of local funds to meet current expenditures. Procurement of equipment and
furniture has been delayed. All contracts will be signed before the extended
closing date, but disbursements should continue later on. A further post-
ponement of the closing date is therefore planned.
Ln No. 680 Highway VI; US$32 million, June 1970
Closing date: original - November 30, 1974;
current - November 30, 1976.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 8 pages
9.         The largest component of the project, the paving program, has ex-
perienced considerable cost increases and is still experiencing delays. The
Ministry of Public Works has taken many steps (approved by the Bank) which
have reduced, although not avoided, delays and contractor bankruptcies. Due
to cost increases, the Bank's participation in the paving program has been
reduced to 15 percent. The status of the other components of the project
is more satisfactory.
Ln No. 681 Chivor Hidroelectric Power; US$52.8 million, June 1970.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
10.        The Chivor Hydroelectric Project is expected to be put into ser-
vice in June 1975, six months behind schedule. The project's foreign and
total costs are expected to be 35 percent higher than originally estimated.
Because the shareholders have not made their financial contribution to ISA
when due, ISA has not been able to pay its contractors on time. Another
problem facing ISA is the present ownership of its capital stock, which
permits three of the four shareholders holding individually more than 25
percent of the shares to block any resolution requiring a 75 percent majority.
The Bank is seriously concerned about ISA's financial situation.    The
Government has now formulated a plan of near term action which is expected to
shortly restore ISA's financial viability.
Ln No. 682 Cali Water Supply and Sewerage; US$18.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1974;
current - December 31, 1975.
11.        As of September 30, 1974, about 42 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to a late project start, but the
entire project is under execution, and it is expected that construction
activities will be finished by June 1975.
Ln No. 738 Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2 million, May 1971.
Closing date: March 1, 1975.
12.        As of September 30, 1974, about 40 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial management and fiscal
problems. A financial crisis in early 1973 has now been resolved through
higher tariffs and tight budget control. Construction is expected to be
terminated in late 1975.
Ln No. 739 Land Settlement Caqueta I; US$8.1 million, May 1971.
Closing date: April 30, 1975.
13.        Because of considerable price increases and unexpectedly difficult
physical problems, project objectives were reduced to about 70 percent of
appraisal targets in August 1973, halfway through the project period. Since
then, the livestock credit program has picked up speed so that the revised
goal for this component should be achieved ahead of time. On the other hand,
the road construction program has fallen behind schedule so far that not

enough time remains to catch up, even with an accelerated work pace. Despite
these problems, the project is making a substantial contribution to the suc-
cessful colonization of the Caqueta area. A second-phase project was ap-
praised in February 1974.
Ln No. 740 Telecommunications II; US$15 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1975.
14.        Due to initial delays in the procurement of project equipment, a
slippage of about one year in the completion date of some works on the
project is now anticipated.
Ln No. 741 Water Supply (Bogota II); US$88 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1978.
15.        Disbursements up to September 30, 1974 amounted to 17 percent of
this loan, only 42. percent of the appraisal estimate. Slow progress in the
construction of the vital palacio - Rio Blanco Tunnel is the main reason for
the project's delay; the orevious foreign contractor has been replaced
by another firm. EAAB's financial situation was weak, but important mea-
sures to improve it have been taken by the Empresa.
Ln No. 742 Development Finance Companies IV: US$40 million, May 1971.
Closing date: December 31, 1974.
16.        This loan is fully committed.   Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
The Borrowers will soon request postponement of the Closing Date.
Ln No. 842 Development Program and Export Expansion Project; US$ 60 million,
June 1972. Closing date: December 31, 1974.
17.        The US$10 million DFC portion of this program loan is now almost
fully committed. The last subproject which will utilize the unallocated
balance of the loan (US$943,000) was presented to the Bak before the final date for sub-
project submission September 30, 1974, and is now under review. Disburse-
ments are proceeding satisfactorily and amounted to US$5.2 million as of
October 31, 1974. However, itwifU. be necessary to extend the present clos-
ing date of December 31, 1974 to allow commitments to be fully disbursed.
Ln No. 849 Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5 million, June 1972.
Closing date: March 31, 1978.
18.        Construction of drainage facilities is lagging far behind schedule
primarily due to the poor performance of the contractor having the major re-
sponsibility for the drain construction financed under this loan. Steps are
being taken to either force compliance with the contract or replace the con-
tractor with another. With the high world prices of livestock products, it
appears that more of the project area will be devoted to combination cattle
feeding and milk production than was previously envisaged. The returns per
ha from such enterprises will not differ too much from the field crops
originally contemplated.



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 8 pages
Ln No. 860 Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project;
US$9.1 million, October 1972. Closing date: September 30, 1976.
19.        As of September 30, 1974, about 6 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial serious management pro-
blems. Lower demand than estimated has prompted investment reprogramming and
it is expected that construction activities will not be finished until 1979.
Ln No. 874 Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; US$56 million,
January 1973. Closing date: December 31, 1978.
20.        The progress of the work is generally satisfactory except for delays
in the resettlement of El Penol and Guatape villages, which will make it dif-
ficult to start filling the Santa Rita reservoir before mid-1977, two years
behind schedule.   If filling of the reservoir does not begin in mid-1976,
an energy deficit in the interconnected system of at least 10 percent from
1978 to 1981 is expected. The revised project cost estimate (US$119.2 mil-
lion) is 21.3 percent above appraisal estimates, mainly due to higher costs
of the works at El Penol and Guatape. EPM has failed to achieve the 9 per-
cent rate of return required under the Loan Agreement and it has fallen
behind in its payments to ISA, thus contributing to the problems experienced
by the latter (see Loan 681). The Bank is seriously concerned about EPM's
financial situation which is expected to be adequately improved soon by a
substantial increase in EPM's electricity tariffs.
Ln No. 903 Development Finance Companies V; US$60 million, May 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
21.        Commitments of the loan were interrupted for several months this
year pending agreement on a revised interest rate. Commitments are proceeding
well, and it is expected that the balance of US$27.2 million unallocated at
October 31, 1974, will be fully committed early in 1975. Currently, loan
applications pending approval exceed the unallocated funds available. Disburse-
ments are still behind schedule, but in view of the rapid rate of commitment,
they should be completed by the closing date, June 30, 1977.
Ln No. 920 Education III; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
22.        This loan became effective on January 9, 1974.   Shortage of counter-
part funds delayed to September 1974 the opening of construction bids for the
first 22 project institutions. Construction works are expected to proceed
smoothly by April 1975. Procurement of teaching equipment has been progressing
satisfactorily and 60 percent of the purchase orders have been placed. Im-
plementation of the technical teacher training program is expected to commence
within the next six months. Various studies for the sector analysis are also
expected to begin within the next four months.

Lu No. 926 Sixth Railway Project; US$25 million, August 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1976.
23.        Implementation of CNR's Investment Plan is progressing satisfac-
torily; track rehabilitation and maintenance, together with workshop produc-
tion, continue to improve. Project objectives probably will have to be reduced
by 35 percent because of the large increase in the price of materials. CNR's
financial picture has continued to improve because of increased traffic and
tariffs. However, the Government's recent emergency program, which intends
to halt imports of wheat, will have a serious adverse impact on that traffic
between Santa Marta and Bogota. The Government's performance under the fi-
nancial provisions of the Guarantee Agreement was satisfactory to the end of
June but subsequently has been inadequate. The matter is currently under
review.
Ln No. 971 Preinvestment Studies Project; US$25 million, March 1974.
Closing date: December 31, 1978.
24.        This loan became effective on June 27, 1974.
