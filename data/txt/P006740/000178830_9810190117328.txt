APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project which includes a part of the works
in Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM) 1974-80 telecommunications
development program scheduled to be started and completed during the first
phase five-year period (1974-78).
ii.       The project is estimated to cost Col$ 1,609 million (US$52.1 million)
with a foreign exchange component of US$33.5 million equivalent. The proposed
Bank loan (US$15 million) would partially cover the foreign costs, while the
balance (US$18.5 million) would be obtained through TELECOM's own resources.
The project will provide:
(a) about 18,000 additional lines of switching equipment; cables
and subscribers plant to add about 16,000 new subscribers;
(b) long distance equipment for 5,400 additional circuits;
(c) telex equipment to connect 500 additional subscribers; and
(d) telephone facilities to about 200 rural areas.
iii.      The proposed loan is the third lending operation for telecommunica-
tions in Colombia. The first Loan 499-CO (US$16 million) was made in 1967
to finance the establishment of a basic long distance network and for the
expansion and improvement of national and international telecommunications
services. The loan has been fully disbursed and the physical work still
outstanding would be completed by mid-1975. The second Loan 740-CO (US$15
million) approved in 1971 will assist in financing new local networks and
extension of long distance facilities. The project will be completed by
June 1976 except for installation of 9,900 local exchange equipment lines
which could not be procured for lack of loan funds caused mainly by changes
in exchange parities. The installation of these local lines has been provided
for in the third project.
iv.       TELECOM, the proposed borrower, is an autonomous entity responsible
for national telegraph, telex and long distance services and all international
telecommunications services. TELECOM, which together with 53 other entities
operates local services, is now consolidating the sector by acquiring gradually
some of these entities. TELECOM's organization structure needs some changes,
which TELECOM has put into effect. With the assistance of financial and
technical consultants to be retained by TELECOM for the first two years of
the project period, the entity would be able to carry out the proposed project.



- ii -
v.        All Bank financed goods would be procured by international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement, except
some extensions (valued at US$2.6 million) to equipment earlier contracted
for under Loan 740-CO, which is being obtained for reasons of standardization
from the same contractors as the original equipment at unit prices quoted under
the earlier bid adjusted for inflation.
vi.       TELECOM's liquidity has been tight during the past four years, caused
in part by significant arrears in collections from the Public Sector and the
connecting local telephone enterprises, and in part by its increasing debt
service burden which is attributable to stepped up borrowings and the devalua-
tion of the Colombian peso. TELECOM would improve its accounts receivable
position during the project period. TELECOM would provide about 65 percent of
the funds required during the project period from its own cash generation.
TELECOM's liquidity would be satisfactory and the annual rate of return on
net fixed assets in operation would meet the 11 percent minimum level.
vii.      The project is suitabLe for a Bank loan of US$15 million equivalent
for a term of 20 years including3 a grace period of 5 years.  The guarantor
would be Republic of Colombia.

APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has requested Bank assistance in financing
Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones  (TELECOM) 1974-80 telecommunications
development program which aims to extend and improve long distance national
and international telecommunications facilities and to provide local telephone
service in some areas of Colombia where service is limited or non-existent.
The program's cost is estimated at Col$ 5,929 million (US$171.2 million)
including a foreign exchange cost of US$106.5 million equivalent.
1.02      The proposed project, which would cover part of the works in
TELECOM's program on which construction would be started and completed during
1974-78, provides for the installation of additional local exchange lines;
the extension of long distance facilities; and telex equipment. The cost of
the project is estimated at Col$ 1,609 million (US$52.1 million) including
a foreign exchange component of US$33.5 million equivalent. The proposed
Bank loan would provide US$15 million equivalent, while the balance of
US$18.5 million equivalent would be financed through TELECOM's own resources.
1.03      This would be the Bank's third lending operation for telecommuni-
cations in Colombia. In 1967, the Bank approved a US$16 million loan (499-CO)
to TELECOM to help finance the establishment of a modern long distance network,
and for the expansion and improvement of national and international telecom-
munications services. The loan has been fully disbursed. Work on the project
has been completed, except for four local exchange installations, which will
be completed by mid-1975. The second loan (740-CO) for US$15 million approved
in 1971, will assist in financing the installation of new local networks and
the extension of long distance facilities. The project after initial delays
is now progressing satisfactorily. About 9,900 lines of local exchange equip-
ment provided in the project have been carried over to the third project due
to shortage of loan funds mainly caused by changes in exchange parities.
Except for this item, the project is expected to be completed by June 1976 -
about a year behind schedule.
1.04      Because of the important role of exports in Colombia's economy and
for the development of its national resources, rapid and reliable telecom-
munications services are essential for providing a means of exchanging informa-
tion between the producers and exporters of products such as coffee, petroleum
and fuel oil, cotton and textiles, and bananas. Good telecommunication facili-
ties are also extremely important for efficient administration of the country,
particularly the inaccessible areas, and for improving transportation and
distribution of goods within the country,. The proposed project aims at
providing basic services in rural areas, and at extending and improving



-2-
telecommunications services within the country. In addition, the Bank's
participation in the project would assist in institution building including
consolidation of the telecommunications sector (see paragraph 2.05) and the
establishment of a reliable telecommunications network.
1.05      This report is based on information obtained from TELECOM, and on
the findings of a mission compoi;ed of Messrs. M. DeLima and N. Kohler which
visited Colombia in November/December 1973 and in February 1974: and an
updating mission composed of Messrs. M. DeLima and B. Holmgren which visited
Colombia in November 1974.
2. THE TELECOVMUNICATIONS SECTOR
The Telecommunications Sector
2.01      The Ministry of Communications exercises governmental control of
the sector. It is responsible for policy making, licensing and regulation
of the various entities operating in the sector. By law, "the Ministry of
Communications, in agreement wit'h the President of the Republic, is respon-
sible to adopt national communications policy in harmony with the overall
development policy." A planning office has been set up to make a broad study
of the telecommunications sector and to recommend to the Ministry ways to
improve, extend and economically provide telecommunication services within
the country. As the licensing authority for all telecommunications services,
the Ministry has issued licenses to various municipalities to operate local
telephone services and to TELECOM. The Ministry exercises regulatory powers
by approving investment plans of the various telephone entities, and recom-
mending tariff proposals receivec from these entities to the National Tariff
Board for final approval.
2.02      Responsibility for providing telecommunications services in Colombia
is shared by 54 entities as set out in Annex 1. Operating as a Government
owned entity, TELECOM has the exclusive license to provide national telegraph,
telex and long distance services and all international telecommunications
services. Local telephone services are provided by TELECOM and the 53 other
entities. TELECOM is also permitted to provide local telephone services,
with the approval of Ministry of Communications, in any area where the local
municipality does not obtain a license to operate such services, and requests
TELECOM to do so. With prior minLsterial approval, TELECOM is also allowed
to acquire an existing entity.
2.03      At the end of December 1973, about 677,000 local telephone lines
were in operation in Colombia (245,000 of these in Bogota), of which TELECOM
operated 35,000 representing about: 5 percent of total telephone lines operating
in the country. Annex 2 sets out statistical information on telephones in
various countries of the world. IDetails of telecommunications facilities
currently operated by TELECOM are set out in paragraphs 5.22-5.25.



-3-
2.04      The major problem of the telecommunication sector is the iragmented
operation of local telephone service. Some large municipalities have created
separate telephone entities to administer and operate the local telephone
service. They provide reasonably good service. In smaller cities and towns,
however the telephone service is operated in conjunction with other public
utility services such as water supply and electric power. The quality of
service in these areas is unsatisfactory due to the small scale of operation
and the insufficient attention paid to the extension and improvement of the
telecommunication service. The large number of entities (all except nine
operate less than 10,000 equipment lines) complicates sector interworking
with varying operating standards and often results in uncoordinated planning
of facilities. Further each entity independently purchases costly imported
plant and equipment, in small quantities, thereby paying high prices and
causing an avoidable drain on the country's foreign exchange resources, and
creating serious standardization problems.
2.05      The long-term solution lies in the consolidation of the several
local operating entities into a single national telecommunication body. The
large financially viable local municipal operating entities are reluctant
to merge with other smaller similarly operated entities which are generally
weak financially and technically and also local and regional political
influences would defer or prevent voluntary mergers of entities in adjacent
operating areas, or even compulsory mergers through legislation. For these
reasons, when approving increases in TELECOM's long distance tariffs in 1971,
the Government specified that a part of the expected additional revenue (see
paragraph 6.14) should be set aside and used exclusively by TELECOM for local
expansion including acquisition of local entities. Consolidation therefore
can only be undertaken by TELECOM which is authorized to operate over the
whole country. TELECOM has taken over some seven entities during the last
three years and plans during 1975-78 to take over 19 more (see Annexes 1 and
20). By 1981 TELECOM proposes to acquire all local telephone entities,
except the eight largest.
2.06      On completion of projects financed under Bank Loans 499-CO and
740-CO, TELECOM would have a reliable long distance network and good financial
and technical management. The third project would extend telecommunications
services to rural areas and increase long distance circuits. While TELECOM's
long distance service development is progressing satisfactorily, local tele-
phone service planning and development by other entities is not able to keep
up with demands.  The local entities do not have adequate financial resources
for planned development. Two large entities (Bogota and Cali) would have
serious problems in financing future development beyond 1975 and 1976 on the
completion of their present plans and have requested Government for financial
assistance from various sources including the World Bank. Supplier credits
were considered unsatisfactory by these entities because of the higier prices
of equipment to be paid (compared to prices under international bids) and
short repayment periods. The position of the other smaller entities is no
better, and their future development plans are based not on need, but on the
quantum and timing of supplier credits which they hope to obtain. The un-
certain availability of finance has caused even the larger entities to plan



-4-
on a short term basis and has stopped development altogether in some smaller
entities for which long term bank credits are not available. TELECOM's long
distance development plans aft:er the end of the third project period (1978)
will depend largely on the local service development achievement of the eight
largest entities. Close coorclination of sector development and investment
is therefore essential for a balanced development of telecommunications in
the country. The Government is aware of these problems and has requested
the Bank to undertake a sector study and to assist the Government to assess
the requirements of each entity over the next 5-10 years, fix relative pri-
orities for investment, and cc,nsider possible sources of funds. A Bank
sector mission visited Colombia in August-September 1974 and is preparing
a report.
3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      Government has approved TELECOM's third telecommunications develop-
ment program for the period 1974 through 1980. TELECOM proposes to complete
the program in two phases: from 1974 through 1978 and from 1977 through
1980. The program comprises mainly the following:
(a)  Installation of 119 new local automatic exchanges with a
total capacity of 63,250 lines; additions of a total of
3,675 lines to 21 lo,al automatic exchanges; and associated
cable network to connect about 54,000 additional subscribers;
(b) installation of HF radio equipment; VHF/UHF radio equipment
and microwave equipment with associated multiplex equipment
to provide about 9,100 additional circuits;
(c)  installation of 3 new long distance automatic exchanges
(total of about 2,600 terminations) and extension of
existing long distance exchanges to provide a total of
18,000 additional terminations;
(d) installation of 6 new teleprinter exchanges with a total of
2,450 subscriber lines and 1,350 channel terminations;
1,440 VFT channels and 2,500 teleprinters;
(e) construction of buildings for housing equipment and stores;
(f) extension of the international telephone exchange by 400
lines and the international telex exchange by 300 lines; and
(g) purchase of testing equipment, tools and transport.



-5-
3.02      The program cost (including Col$ 942.1 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$19.6 million equivalent of preinvestments for the
program after 1980) is estimated at Col$ 5,929 million (US$171.2 million)
including a foreign exchange component of US$106.5 million equivalent.
Details of the estimated cost of the program are given in Annex 3 and the
physical content of the program and project with completion dates of each
item is given in Annex 4.
The Project
3.03      The project for Bank financing would cover part of the works in
phase one of TELECOM's telecommunications development program and would be
carried out during the five-year period (1974-78). It consists of the follow-
ing:
(a)  Installation of 43 new local automatic exchanges with 14,150
lines and 3,675 additional lines in 21 existing exchanges;
(b)  installation of local distribution cables and subscribers
equipment to connect about 16,000 additional subscribers;
(c) installation of microwave, UHF/VHF radio terminals and
multiplex equipment to provide about 5,400 additional
long distance circuits; and 10 HF radio systems; and 30 VHF
radio systems to provide telephone services in about 200
rural towns;
(d)  installation of 3 new long distance automatic exchanges and
additions to existing exchanges, with a total of about
17,600 additional terminations;
(e)  installation of 6 new teleprinter exchanges with a total
of 2,150 subscriber lines and 1,350 channel terminations;
VFT equipment for 1,440 channels and 500 teleprinters; and
(f)  acquisition of land and construction of buildings to house
equipment.
Project Costs
3.04      The cost of the project is estimated at Col$ 1,609 million
(US$52.1 million) with a foreign exchange component of US$33.5 million
equivalent. A summary of costs is given below:

The Bank loan would finance US$15 million equivalent of the foreign costs as
shown in para 3.08, while the balance - US$18.5 million - would be financed
through TELECOM's own resources.
3.05      The foreign cost estimates are based on price quotations recently
obtained by TELECOM from various manufacturers, and on average prices adjusted
for recent currency parity changes, obtained on international competitive bids
under Bank loans. TELECOM is exempt from payment of customs duties on imported
goods.
Contingencies
3.06      TELECOM has fixed the total number of local exchange lines; radio
equiptment terminals; and telex equipment lines that would be installed under
the project. The quantity of telephone subscribers equipment and number of
teleprinters have also been finally decided. Variations in quantities could
therefore only occur in cable duct works and buildings when final designs
are prepared. TELECOM has included physical contingencies, at varying rates
for the different building materials, in the basic estimates for cable duct
works and buildings. Physical contingencies (about 10 percent of total local
costs of these works) have been shown separately.
3.07      TELECOM has based the costs of some imported goods for which inter-
national competitive bids were called recently, on the lowest bids received.
For goods for which bids have not yet been received, the foreign cost estimates
include a contingency of US$1.7 million to cover a possible 10 percent increase
in estimated prices of these imported goods. Local price contingencies of
US$6.5 million have been provided to cover uncertainties during the construc-
tion period in the wages of construction staff and cost of locally procured
materials.
Amount of the Proposed Loan
3.08      The proposed loan of US$15 million would finance the following items:
Local Exchanges                                US$ (million)
Exchange equipment          2.1
Subscribers plant           0.7                  2.8
Long Distance Equipment
Microwave system            4.2
Multiplex                   1.7
Rural systems               2.0
V.F.T Systems               0.9
Switching equipment
(extension)               1.7
Switching equipment (new)  0.8                  11.3
Contingencies                                      0.9
Total                                             15.0



Procurement
3.09      All goods (except extensions to existing long distance switching
equipment) provided under the pr'oject for Bank financing will be procured
through international coompetitiv,e bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Extension equipment (valued at US$2.6 million) to switching
equipment - the latter was obtained through  international competitive bidding
under Loan 740-CO - is being ob-:ained from the same contractor at unit prices
quoted under the earlier bid anct adjusted for inflation. Other imported goods
will be procured by negotiations with the suppliers and through competitive
bidding. Goods such as cables, cable ducts, poles and fittings which are man-
ufactured locally, will be procured through competitive bids from domestic
suppliers and financed with TEIECOM's funds.
3.10      None of the Bank financed project goods are currently manufactured
in Colombia;  hence price preference for locally manufactured goods does not
arise. Though Colombia is a mermber of the Latin American Free Trade Associa-
tion (LAFTA) and the Andean Pacl, TELECOM is exempt from import duties; hence
bid preference for LAFTA and the Andean Pact is not applicable.
Execution of the Project
3.11      The schedule for exect.tion of the project, set out in Annex 5 is
realistic. T=LECOM's staff will do engineering designs and with the assist-
ance of technical consultants retained under Loan 740-CO (see para 5.04) will
prepare bid documents and technical specifications, evaluate bids and draw
up contracts for goods. TELECOY. will lay, joint and commission all distri-
bution cables and will supervise construction of cable ducts and buildings
constructed by local contractorE. All plant in new locations will be
installed by the suppliers with the assistance of TELECOM staff.  Extensions
to existing plant will be installed by TELECOM since it has gained sufficient
installation experience. TELECCM will carry out acceptance tests of all
installed equipment.
Disbursement
3.12      Annex 6 gives the estimated loan disbursements during the 1975-78
period. Disbursement would be for the CIF costs of imported equipment, and
the foreign costs of its installation. Because the project as designed,
does not meet all the estimated demand, any unused balance of the loan should
be used to finance additional equipment, similar to that already procured
under the loan, after consultation with the Bank.
4. JUSTIFICATION OF TIHE PROJECT
4.01      The basic justificatioa of the projcCt is to support Colombia's
development objectives by providing an essential service for the country's
agriculture, business, trade and industry.  Rapid and reliable communications



-9-
are important for the efficient organization of the flow of inputs for produc-
tion, and for the distribution and marketing of agricultural and industrial
goods. The project would make an important contribution to the economic
development of Colombia by increasing operating efficiency in administrative,
industrial and commercial activities.
4.02      Colombia is currently undersupplied with telecommunications services
in that the local and long distance network is inadequate in quality and
congested and there is a large unfilled demand for telephones. The project
aims to:
(a)  improve the quality of service to existing subscribers
essentially by replacing manual by automatic local exchanges,
and by providing an adequate number of high quality long
distance telephone circuits;
(b)  extend and improve the telex system;
(c)  extend telecommunication service to about 200 rural areas; and
(d) meet part of the demand for telephone.
Local Facilities
4.03      TELECOM has computed separately for each exchange it is currently
operating the local exchange requirements up to 1980 by considering the
present unfilled expressed demand, the past growth and the commercial impor-
tance in each exchange. TELECOM has thus forecast a 10 percent annual growth
(working connections plus unfilled demand) up to 1978, and an 8 percent growth
thereafter up to 1980. The growth forecasts are reasonable. During the
project period (1974-78) TELECOM would, with utilization of equipment installed
under Loans 499-CO and 740-CO and this project, provide about 750 connections
per month - an objective which is attainable and realistic. Even so, the
project cannot meet the current unfilled demand in some exchange areas during
the project period. The current unfilled and future demands up to 1980 in
these areas would be met in TELECOM's second (1977-80) project. TELECOM has
not proposed a larger project presently due to financial constraints, and
the need for consolidation of administrative changes (see paragraph 5.03)
before embarking or further expansion.
4.04      TELECOM currently operates in Colombia about 35,000 telephone
connections with a total capacity of about 38,000 exchange lines. TELECOM
would install in this project a total of 17,825 local automatic equipment
lines. Existing exchanges would be extended by 3,675 lines. Another 11,400
automatic exchange lines would be installed to replace existing manual
exchange lines at 35 localities to improve quality of service.   The balance
of the automatic exchange lines (2,750) would be installed at 8 localities
where there is currently no service. These installations are justified on
the basis of population and economic importance of the localities. The
capacity of each exchange at these new localities has been worked out on the



- 10 -
basis of TELECOM's experience of demand in existing localities in the
country with similar population and economic background. Annex 7 sets out
the demand, equipped capacity an,l connected lines (1970-80).
Rural Services
4.05      As the first step towards implementation of Government policy to
provide telecommunications services to rural areas, TELECOM proposes to
extend the telecommunication network by installing public call offices in
a total of about 200 rural areas scattered over the country.
Long Distance Facilities
4.06      While the quality of speech on long distance circuits is generally
satisfactory, the traffic is much greater than the circuit capacity resulting
in congestion and long wait for calls. TELECOM has computed separately for
each route, future circuit requirements needed to remove existing congestion,
and to meet increased traffic from existing and new connections provided
within the country during the project period. The demand forecasts are in
line with experience in other developing countries. The project is designed
to provide an additional 5,400 high quality circuits - a growth rate of 23
percent per year, which is realistic.
Telex
4.07      The number of telex network subscribers has increased from 2,138
in 1968 to about 2,600 in 1973 - a growth rate of 5 percent per year. With
the introduction of international. telex service via satellite communication,
demand for telex connections is increasing and is projected at 4,600 by
1978. TELECOM aims to increase telex capacity by 2,150 lines and connect
about 2,000 subscribers over the period 1974-78 to meet estimated demand;
this will result in an annual grcwth of 12 percent.
Least-Cost Solution
4.08      TELECOM's project consists of a number of separate small works
covering expansion of capacity in a number of existing exchanges, and pro-
vision of automatic exchanges in new localities. The choice of automatic
exchanges for providing local service and for handling long distance traffic
provides a better more rapid and more reliable service and represents the
least-cost solution. The original exchange installations provided for the
most economical future extensions; extension of existing exchanges is being
made with the same type of equipment. In general provision of large blocks
of high grade long distance circuits can be made using coaxial cables; or
radio equipment (microwave UHF/VHF). With Colombia's topography, utilization
of radio equipment is the most economical way to provide such large blocks
of long distance circuits. Depending on the anticipated number of circuits
required from point to point, TELECOM will use either microwave, UHF or VHF
systems.



Rate of Return
4.09      The project's rate of return is about 27 percent (Annex 8), if
benefits are measured by the incremental net revenues attributable to the
project. The incremental revenues, however, understate the benefits consumers
receive from the project and therefore this rate of return is a minimum
estimate only of the benefits to the economy. A sensitivity analysis has
been carried out (para 4 of Annex 8) showing that the rate of return exceeds
22 percent for variations of the main parameters by 10 percent or 15 percent
respectively. With the very unlikely combination of all adverse events, the
rate would still reach about 21 percent.
5. THE BORROWER
Organization
5.01      TELECOM, an autonomous entity established in 1947, is managed by
an eight member Board of Directors with the Minister of Communications as
ex officio chairman of the Board. The President of the Republic appoints
all members of the Board and the president of TELECOM. An organization
chart is shown in Annex 9. The day to day management of the entity is the
responsibility of the president of TELECOM. He is assisted by five vice-
presidents one each in charge of technical (engineering), operation, integra-
tion, industrial relations and finance. In addition the chiefs of the legal
office, organization development and public relations report directly to
the president. A secretary-general responsible for Board matters, project
coordination and general services also reports to the president.
5.02      TELECOM has seven operations regions with regional managers in
charge at Bogota, Bucaramanga, Cali, Manizales, Medellin, Barranquilla and
Ibague. A regional organization chart is set out in Annex 10. The regional
managers are responsible on the technical side for the routine maintenance
and operations of all plants (except long distance) within their regions.
The responsibility to plan, program and execute all new telecommunications
works within the region, devolves on the technical vice-president at Bogota.
5.03      The organizational structure, though basically the same as existed
at the time of second project appraisal, can no longer in its present form,
effectively meet the additional commitments TELECOM has undertaken by acqui-
sition of local telephone entities and expansion of local and long distance
services to rural areas all over the country. No clear line of demarcation
of duties exists at the headquarters: there is too much centralization of
work at headquarters, and the regional managers mostly do commercial and
public relation works and carry out routine technical maintenance. Financial
management is weak, particularly in budgeting and cost and plant accounting
fields. Planning, programming and project control need more effective coor-
dination. TELECOM's performance in awarding contracts for goods under the
two previous Bank loans was unsatisfactory, delaying project execution.
TELECOM is aware of the need for reorganization and in June 1973 appointed



- 12 -
a director for organization development. The director reviewed and recom-
mended a more effective headquarters and regional organizational set up.
TELECOM has commenced to reorganize its headquarters organization to give
clear cut responsibility to each department and unit and will complete the
reorganization by March 31, 1975. TELECOM has at end of March 1974 decentral-
ized work in Medellin and Bogota regions and made regional managers fully
responsible for all operations within the region and plans to decentralize
work in all regions by April 1, 1975.
5.04      Financial consultants were to be engaged under Loan 740-CO to
strengthen financial management. TELECOM expects to retain financial consult-
ants by February 1, 1975. TELECOM has retained planning and technical consult-
ants to assist TELECOM in planning, preparation of long term demand forecasts,
programming, bid evaluation and contract preparation for goods to be procured
under the third project and preparation of acceptance testing schedules. The
cost of the technical consultants (US$200,000) would be met from savings under
Loan 740-CO. The technical consultants would be retained through December
31, 1975.
Staff
5.05      The senior engineeringr and financial staff are well qualified,
experienced, and with some assistance from consultants, are capable of managing
the present assets and those to be added under the project. The financial
and technical consultants would also assist TELECOM staff in improving finan-
cial management and project cont:rol during the most important part of the
project.
5.06      TELECOM's staff as of December 31, 1973 totals about 12,000 - about
8,500 for telephone operation and about 3,500 for telegraph operation. Loan
740-CO required TELECOM to limit: the net annual increases in staff during the
project to a maximum of 5 percent of the number of employees at the begin-
ning of each year. This provision which has been satisfactorily complied with.
In view of the extensive commitmients for telegraph, telex and long distance
facilities, it is no longer appropriate to relate TELECOM's staff to the
number of local lines in service. As the existing staff levels are con-
sidered reasonable, and as TELECOM has expressed its intention to limit staff
increases to those necessary to meet the additional commitments, a staff
limitation covenant is now considered unnecessary.
5.07      Annex 11 gives details of the number of employees in each depart-
ment with their pay ranges and service conditions. The pay scales are
generally commensurate with the duties, and the salaries are comparable, or
slightly higher in some cases, with those paid for similar duties and qualifi-
cations by other telecommunications organizations. Turnover of staff is
negligible.
Recruitment and Training
5.08      TELECOM is able to recruit an adequate number of professional staff
who come mainly from the local universities. Likewise TELECOM has no diffi-



- 13 -
culty in recruiting staff with the required basic qualifications for its
technical, operating, and administrative needs.
5.09      Graduate engineers are given on-the-job training and some supervisory
staff are sent abroad for training under arrangements made with suppliers and
under bilateral technical assistance programs. The Technical Institute of
Electronics and Communications (ITEC) at Bogota imparts basic and refresher
training to technical, operational, and administrative staff. During 1973,
a total of about 1,800 personnel (1,000 technical, 300 operational and 500
administrative) completed a total of about 100 training courses at Bogota.
While technical, operational, and administrative courses are given at this
training center, only operational courses are given at the regional training
centers in Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cali, Manizales, Medellin and Ibague.
During 1973, a total of about 700 personnel completed a total of 32 courses
in the regional training centers. The training facilities are adequate to
meet TELECOM's needs for trained staff during the project period.
Accounting and Audit
5.10      While a number of serious accounting deficiencies existed at the
time of appraisal of the first Bank project, TELECOM's accounting system has
now been brought to a generally satisfactory level. However, with the aid
of the financial consultants (paragraph 5.04), TELECOM plans further improve-
ments in cost and plant accounting and budgeting. Presently financial state-
ments are only prepared at June 30 and December 31 with a relatively great
time lag. The delay in preparing the financial statements has increased
considerably in 1973 due to changeover difficulties with the new accounting
code which was introduced in January 1973. This is of temporary nature only
and TELECOM expects to prepare the financial statements beginning 1974 on a
timely basis. TELECOM agreed during negotiations to adhere to the four-month
deadline agreed in connection with Loan 740-CO.
5.11      The existing external audit arrangements are satisfactory and meet
the requirements of Loans 499-CO and 740-CO. TELECOM agreed to the inclu-
sion of the existing covenant for auditing and submission of financial state-
ments in the new loan agreement.
Billing and Collection
5.12      TELECOM's billing arrangements are rather complex due to its special
status within the telecommunications sector. The company bills the subscribers
directly for telex and telegraph traffic. In the case of automatic long-
distance telephone traffic, TELECOM bills the connecting local enterprises
monthly for the total of the traffic originated by their subscribers.
5.13      In the case of operator-dialed (semiautomatic and manual) long-
distance telephone traffic, TELECOM bills the local enterprise monthly by
submitting details of the calls for each subscriber. In Bogota and Calarca
TELECOM bills such services directly to the subscriber from whom it also
collects.



- 14 -
5.14      For telephone service there are revenue sharing agreements in effect
for each local connecting enterprise. The percentage shares of revenues
granted to the local enterpriseEl are from 22.5 percent to 33 percent for
manual and semiautomatic service, decreasing with the size of the exchange
area, and from 24.5 percent to 35 percent for automatic service. In the
case of international traffic, these percentages are applied on the net
Colombia share of revenues.
5.15      Collection has been a critical problem for TELECOM for several
years particularly in the case cf accounts due from the Public Sector and the
local connecting enterprises (paragraph 6.08). Most of the latter including
all large ones are contractually bound to pay 1 percent interest per month
on the total of past due accounts. However, since the nominal market interest
rate for local bank loans is presently around 18 percent p.a. (effective cost
up to 30 percent p.a.), this delayed payment rate does not provide much
incentive for such entities to pay TELECOM promptly.
Tariffs
5.16      Domestic tariffs are set by the Board of TELECOM, subject to approval
by the Minister of Communications and the National Tariff Board. Details of
TELECOM's principal tariffs are given in Annex 12. Telephone monthly rentals
of about US$1 for residential and about US$1.40 for business subscribers -
while in line with those of the other local enterprises - are low compared
with other similar countries, particularly when considering the extremely low
local call charge (paragraph 5.17). In addition to the installation charge
of about US$14.50, and the guarantee deposit of about US$33, new local sub-
scribers are required to pay a non interest-bearing deposit which varies
between about US$20 and US$49 equivalent per line. Both deposits are refund-
able when service is terminated. Telegraph and telex charges are reasonable.
5.17      The local telephone call charge of Col$0.10 (US$0.004) is very low
compared with any standard. The domestic long distance charges which have
been increased from January 1, 1974, vary between Col$ 0.90 (US$0.04) per
minute and Col$ 6.75 (US$0.27) and are generally reasonable. Nevertheless,
the differences between manual and automatic call charges of 12 percent to
33 percent for the various distance categories seem low to induce direct
subscriber-dialing in future when sufficient long distance facilities will
be in service.
5.18      Tariffs for the international services and the related participa-
tions are established in agreemeats between TELECOM and the foreign entities.
The equivalent Colombian peso charges for international traffic, which are
based on and settled in dollars or gold francs, are revised approximately
every two years to take into accaunt the peso devaluation. These arrangements
are satisfactory.



- 15 -
5.19      In view of the unrealistically low level of some basic telephone
charges (paragraphs 5.16 and 5.17) which are more or less the same for all
local telephone entities in the country, as well as the structural deficiencies
in TELECOM's long distance tariffs, a comprehensive study of the telephone
tariff system in Colombia should be carried out,taking into.consideration sug-
gestions which will be included in the Bank's sector study (see paragraph2.06).
Insurance
5.20      TELECOM carries fire and related perils insurance coverage for its
properties which contain technical installations with a value of Col$ 5 mil-
lion (US$192,000) or more; in addition coverage is also maintained for its
stores. The enterprise does not carry business interruption (loss of profits)
coverage except for its earth satellite ground station which is insured for
fire, lightning, vandalism, etc. These insurance practices are acceptable.
Existing Facilities
5.21      Existing local automatic telephone exchange network is set out in
Map 1 and existing long distance network is set out in Map 2. Basic network
data are set out in Annex 13. A brief description of TELECOM's facilities
as of December 31, 1973 is given below.
Local Telephone Service
5.22      As of December 31, 1973, TELECOM operated 39 local automatic and
362 manual exchanges with a total capacity of 38,002 lines and 34,609 connected
lines. The percentage of automatic lines was 55. Annex 14 gives a list of
automatic exchanges, their capacity, and the number of connected lines as of
December 31, 1973. The average exchange fill i.e. the percentage of total
connected automatic lines to total installed automatic capacity was 89 per-
cent. Annex 15 sets out data on exchange capacity, number of connected lines,
and number of telephones from 1968-73, and the projected growth from 1974-80.
Long Distance Service
5.23      Long distance services are provided by microwave radio systems,
VHF radio systems (see Map 2), HF radio systems, open wire carrier systems,
and open wire physical lines. Facilities for subscriber dialing of long
distance calls are available to nearly all subscribers on the automatic
exchange network; for the others, long distance is provided on a semiautomatic
and manual basis.
Telex and Telegraph Service
5.24      TELECOM had in operation at end December 1973, 40 telex exchanges
having a total capacity of about 3,200 subscriber lines and about 2,600 sub-
scribers. A network of about 1,500 telegraph offices (about 200 connected
to telex) serves public telegraph service needs.



- 16 -
International Facilities
5.25      Colombia has good int:ernational communications to countries in
Central and South America, Europe and US. These services are provided
through HF radio to Panama; VHF radio to Ecuador and Venezuela; earth sate-
llite station to US; and through earth satellite station to all other coun-
tries in Central and South America, and Europe. Eighty-five international
telephone circuits - 68 of these worked on a semiautomatic basis - are pro-
vided for an average daily traffic of about 1,000 international calls (mainly
to US - 470, Venezuela - 170, Ecuador - 95, and Panama - 90).
Quality of Service
5.26      Lack of adequate plarnning in the past has caused the telephone
network to have a number of deficiencies which in turn have led to poor
service. There is a large unfilled demand; service on large manual boards
is unsatisfactory; and congestion exists on long distance service. The project
aims to meet part of the unfilled demand. When some large manual boards are
replaced by automatic exchanges, service would improve considerably. Conges-
tion on long distance facilities is caused by traffic originated being much
greater than can be handled by existing circuit capacity, and the unreliable
service provided on open wire lines. The project aims to remove congestion
by providing about 5,400 additional long distance circuits, to improve speech
quality by using VHF and microwave radio systems on all main routes, and to
install more reliable radio system to replace unstable open wire lines.
6. FINANCES
Past Financial Performance
6.01      TELECOM's audited income statements for the years 1971 through
1973, are shown in Annex 16.  The enterprise's overall revenues increased by
92 percent from 1971 to 1973 to Col$ 1,141 (US$43.9) million. This includes
the effect of a 19.9 percent national telephone tariff increase on January 1,
1971, and a 25 percent national telegraph tariff increase on April 1, 1971.
During the same period, total operating expenses increased by 91 percent to
Col$ 1,022 (US$39.3) million, mainly due to personnel expenses.
6.02      Loan 740-CO requires 'CELECOM to achieve an annual rate of return
of at least 11 percent (9 percent through 1970 under Loan 499-CO) on the net
value of fixed assets in service calculatce on the current peso equivalent
of the dollar value of the assel:s (see Annex 19).  Any shortfall or overrun
in the annual return can be carried forward to the subsequent year. On an
annual basis, the rate of return was 11.7 percent in 1971, 14.9 percent in
1972 and 7.5 percent in 1973. Ilowever, TELECOM did not violate the rate
covenant during the three years since it was able to meet the minimum require-
ment by taking advantage of the carry-forward provision.

6.03      TELECOM's debt service coverage by internal cash generation declined
from 2.1 times in 1971 to 1.1 times in 1973. This has been caused by the
continuous devaluation of the Colombian peso and the increasing amounts of
foreign debt incurred.
6.04      TELECOM's audited balance sheets for the years 1971 through 1973
are given in Annex 17.  TELECOM's financial situation was rather tight during
the past three years and the enterprise had overdue debt service obligations
at each year-end. The current ratio has fluctuated around 1:1 during this
period.
6.05      TELECOM's debt/equity ratio was 60/40 as of December 31, 1973, which
is slightly less favorable than in the preceding years, reflecting the increase
in debt due to the disbursement of the Bank loans.
6.06      Under a 1968 law, the administration of severance payments for
TELECOM's employees was to pass to the Fondo Nacional de Ahorro (FNA) as of
January 1, 1972, and TELECOM was to transfer the funds for the total assessed
liability for past services to FNA over a period of seven years. TELECOM
made arrangements with FNA so that the transfer payment for 1972 was waived.
TELECOM has obtained approval from FNA to retain these funds through 1975,
while continuing to make payments directly to its employees.
6.07      Through 1970 TELECOM followed the practice of charging to operations
the actual pension payments to former employees rather than amounts to cover
the actuarially determined future pension costs. An actuarial study was made
in December 1971 to comply with Section 5.07 of Loan 740-CO, but TELECOM has
not established proper accounting procedures to build up a provision for past
service pension costs. TELECOM agreed during negotiations to establish account-
ing procedures satisfactory to the Bank to reflect in its balance sheet TELECOM's
pension liabilities as evaluated in the actuarial study carried out in December
1971.
6.08      TELECOM has faced critical financial problems due to large amounts of
account arrears mainly from the public sector and the connecting local telephone
enterprises. TELECOM has renegotiated new contracts with local telephone enter-
prises and has included a rising delayed payment interest rate. Except for
severance payments made by TELECOM and which are to be reimbursed by Social
Security (CAPRECOM) and which are being separately negotiated TELECOM's out-
standings with the Government,and current bills will be settled within 15 days
of presentation,in consonance with Government orders recently issued. During
negotiations the Government further agreed to continue to use its best efforts
(a) to cause its agencies to make due and punctual payment of all their present
and future debts to the Borrower; and (b) to ensure that the local telephone
enterprises will make due and punctual payment of all their present and future
debts to the Borrower.

6.10      TELECOH would provide about 65 percent of the required funds,
including part of the foreign exchange requirements from own cash generation,
whereas 28 percent would be debt financing. The balance of the requirements
would come from subscribers' deposit:s (3 percent), and miscellaneous sources
(4 percent).
6.11      The peso equivalents of all foreign currency capital expenditures
and debt service payments have been based on projected foreign currency/peso
rates of exchange which have been estimated considering an 8.5 percent annual
peso devaluation compared to the US dollar. In addition, the amortization and



- 19 -
interest payments for Bank Loan 499-CO were forecast by taking into account
the rates of exchange in early January 1974 between the US dollar and the
various other currencies presently outstanding.
6.12      The financing plan also includes, besides the proposed US$15 million
Bank loan (assumed to be at a 20-year term including five years grace) in 1977
and 1978, utilization of US$9.5 million of possible future long-te-m borrowiirs
to cover the foreign currency costs of the 1977-&  project and of the intern>-
tional faiilities not included in the Bank-project.
6.13      Col$ 77 million (US$2.5 million) included in the financing plan
would be a supplier credit already secured, and Col$ 261.0 million (about
US$8.3 million) would be debt incurred by TELECOM for the acquisition of local
telephone enterprises (paragraph 6.14).
6.14      Due to the limitations in the availability of financial resources,
TELECOM plans to acquire only 19 local telephone enterprises during 1975-78.
TELECOM has not fulfilled so far Government's resolution authorizing the 1971
telephone tariffs increase, according to which 6 percent of gross national
long distance telephone revenues, together with the net operating income of
the acquired entities should be set aside by TELECOM in a fund for the develop-
ment of local telephony. TELECOM has agreed during negotiations to establish
accounting procedures satisfactory to the Bank to reflect in its balance sheet
the funds allocated by the Borrower for the acquisition of local telephone
entities.
6.15      Because TELECOM's capital investment program could be over-ambitious,
a limitation on new investments, outside the investment program currently
contemplated, is necessary. TELECOM has agreed during negotiations to obtain
Bank concurrence before committing itself auring the project period to any
capital expenditure not required for the project, if the aggregate of such
capital expenditure made or to be made in any one fiscal year should exceed
an amount equivalent to US$1.0 million, or an amount equivalent to ten percent
of the aggregate amount of all its capital expenditure made during the preced-
ing fiscal year, whichever amount is greater.
Future Operating Results
6.16      Forecast income statements from 1974-80 are given in Annex 16.  The
rate of return in these years is projected to be maintained at 11.0 percent
through periodic tariff adjustments. Operating expenses are expected to
increase by nearly 20 percent each year during the project period. This is
mainly attributable to: 15 percent higher average employee personnel costs
per year (13-15 percent increase in the past three years); additional staff
requirements; the systematic provision for future pension costs; and increases
in other operating expenses caused by expanding operations.
6.17      Since the projections in Annex 16, page 1, indicate a continued
need for tariff actions beyond 1974, the Government has undertaken to
allow TELECOM to revise tariffs as necessary to offset continued domestic



- 20 -
inflation and meet TELECOM's cash requirements to service foreign debt,
which are expected to increase becaise of continued depreciation of the value
of the peso as well as TELECOM's borrowing plans.
6.18      Therefore, during negotiations agreement was obtained that TELECOM
xvill maintain adequate tariff level;3 in the future to enable it to reach the
11 percent rate of return calculated on the peso equivalent of the US$ valued
net plant in service (see Annex 19), by requiring TELECOM each year: (i) to
estimate by April 30 (when prior year's statement have to be available) the
adequacy of its tariffs to produce the 11 percent rate in that year and to
cover any shortfall carry-forwards, and (ii) to implement tariff increases,
if needed, by July 1.
Forecast Financial Position
6.19      Forecast balance sheets a; of December 31, for the years from
1974-80, and related notes are given in Annex 17. During this period TELECOM's
financial position is expected to improve, in particular its liquidity posi-
tion as reflected in the current ra~:io which increases from 1.0:1 in 1973 to
1.5:1 in 1978. The cash position would in every year be satisfactory to enable
TELECOM to meet regularly its current debt service obligations.
6.20      If fixed assets, which are valued in TELECOM's balance sheet at
historic peso costs, are considered at the current equivalent of their dollar
value, as required for rate making purposes (see Annex 19), net fixed assets
in service at December 31,, 1972, would have amounted to Col$ 1,129 million,
as against Col$ 804.0 million in the balance sheet. To avoid increasing
distortion between the two fixed asset values and of the debt/equity relation-
ship, while causing no change in the rate of return calculation for the Bank,
TELECOM has agreed to adjust its book value of fixed assets at December 31,
1974 to the updated values containecl in the memorandum accounts and to adjust
these values annually on an index-basis for future peso depreciation.
6.21      TELECOM's debt/equity ratio will decrease only slightly from 60:40
in 1973 to 59:41 in 1978, due to the annual revaluation of 8.5 percent of the
foreign currency debts. As per Loan Agreement 740-CO, TELECOM requires Bank
approval before incurring any long-term debt unless its maximum debt service
in any future year is covered 1.5 times by the net revenues of the preceding
fiscal year or a later 12-month period prior to the incurrence of the debt.
This covenant is repeated in the proposed new loan agreement.
6.22      While total debt service playments are projected to increase from
Col$ 183 million in 1974 to Col$ 372 million in 1978, the annual debt service
coverage ratio is projected to improve from 1.1 times in 1973 to 2.0 times
in 1978. This is acceptable. Indicators which will help monitor TELECOM's
future performance are given in Annex 21.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) TELECOM will have its accounts and financial statements
audited by independent auditors and will furnish within
four months after the end of the fiscal year certified
copies of its financial statements (paragraph 5.11).
(b) TELECOM will establish accounting procedures to reflect
in its balance sheet (i) TELECOM's pension liabilities;
and (ii) the funds allocated for the acquisition of local
telephone entities (paragraphs 6.07 and 6.14).
(c) Government will continue to use its best efforts (i) to
cause its agencies to make due and punctual payment of
all their present and future debts to the Borrower; and
(ii) to ensure that the local telephone enterprises will
make due and punctual payment of all their present and
future debts to the Borrower (paragraph 6.08).
(d)  TELECOM wll obtain Bank concurrence before committing
itself to any capital expenditure not required for the
project, if the aggregate of such capital expenditure
made or to be .rade in any orne fiscal year should exceed
an amount equivalent of US$1.0 million, or ten percent
of the aggregate amount of all its capital expenditure
made during the previous fiscal year, whichever amount
is higher (paragraph 6.15).
(e) TELECOM will revalue its assets and maintain tariffs at
a level adequate to assure a minimum rate of return of
11 percent calculated on the peso equivalent of the US$
valued net plant in service (paragraphs 6.18 and 6.20).
(f)  TELECOM will not incur debt unless its maximum debt service
in any future year is covered 1.5 times by the Pet revenues
(paragraph 6.21).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$15 million for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years.

Internal Financial Rate of Return of the 1974-1978 Project
1.        The table below presents the cost and benefit streams relating
to the project over a period of 23 years. This period was determined as
extending from 1977, when the majority of the facilities will be put into
service, over the estimated useful life of 20 years.

2.        The costs and benefits are on the basis of 1974 prices and no
residual value was assumed at the end of the useful life period.
3.        Based on the above assumptions, the rate of return will be
about 27%.
4.        A sensitivity analysis of the internal financial rate of return
to four different variations in the main parameters was made, as given below:
(a)    the construction periol is extended by one year (to six years
in lieu of five), the construction cost increased in total by
15%, the increased costs being allocated over the last four years.
Revenues and cash operating outlavs are also delayed by one year.
The rate of return would fall to about 22%.
(b)    a decrease of revenues by 10% is assumed.  The rate of return
would fall to about 24%.
(c)    An increase of operating expenses.  The rate of return would fall
to about 26%.

(d)    with the least favorable assumption of a very unlikely combination
of adverse events of 10% increase in capital expenditures and
operating revenues, and a 106 decrease of operating revenues the rate
would be 21h.

Notes on the Balance Sheets
1. Fixed Assets ( book values, not adjusted for peso devaluation)
Works under construction were assumed in general to be equal to
50% of the balance brought forward from prior year plus the current
year capital construction. However, in 1980 all works related to
the future program we:-e assumed to be still under construction.
2. Other Assets
(a)   Investments were increased by the estim,ated amounts of further capital
contributions to INTELSAT.
(b)   Accounts and Notes Receivable assume settlement of Col$56 million
through real estate tiansfers of Col$66.6 million from the National
Post Administration (I'PA) in 1974 and 1975 which would create a
liability to NPA. Past due debts of Col$12.7 million from the
Ministry of Communications was assumed to be settled in 1975.
(c)   Employees' housing and other loans were assumed to increase by
estimated annual requirements.
(d)   Deferred charges (deferred pension obligations and interest of
Loan 499-CO during construction) are being amortized by TELECOM
over 20-years.
3. Current Assets
(a)   Cash represents the rec;idual of TELECOM's future cash flows.
(b)   Accounts receivable - gross were assumed to be 30% of TELECoM's
future net revenues; this assumes some improvement of TELECOM's
receivable collection. The corresponding provision for doubtful
accounts was assumed to be O11 of gross receivables.



ANNEX 17
Page 3 of 3 pages
(c)   Stores were assumed to be about 6% of net fixed plant in operation
which is in line with the industry's and TELECO''s experience;
the total gross balance was reduced by a 10% provision for inventory
losses. Materials related to project under construction are
presented under fixed assets.
(d)   Advances and prepaid charges were assumed to increase 15% per year.
4.        EgLutr does not show separately as "appropriated earnings" the
amounts TELECCM4 should set up in form of a fund for the development of local
telephony, but which so far has not been complied with by TELECOM (see
paragraph 6.16).
5.        Provision for pension and severance payments was assumed to
increase in the future in line with total projected staff costs.
6.        Subscribers' deposits were increased by the estimated new deposits
to be paid by TELECCM's additional telex and telephone subscribers.
7.        Current liabilities - accounts payable were assumed to increase
by 15% per year. Short-term borrowings of Col$200 million has been assumed

Formula for Computation of Financial Rate of Return
1.        The rate of return will be computed annually by relating the
Ihpresa's net operating income for the year in question to the average
value of the net fixed assets in operation.
2.        For the purpose of this computation:
(a) The valuation of gross fixed assets in operation and of
accumulated depreciation will be determined as explained
in paragraph 3 below.
(b)  The "net fixed assets in operation" means the gross value of the
fixed assets in operation less the accumulated depreciation thereon.
The "average value" of the net fixed assets in operation will be
determined by adding the value of the net fixed assets in opera-
tion at the beginning of the year to the value of the net fixed
assets in operation at the end of the year and dividing the total
by two.
(c) The "net operating income" shall be determined by subtracting from total
operating revenues all operating and administrative expenses, including
taxes (if anr) and adequate provisions for maintenance; provision for
depreciation should be included at a notional h-1/2% rate on the dollar
value of fixed assets in operation, converted into pesos at the average
exchange rate during the year.
3.        For the purposes of computing future values of net fixed assets in
operation as basis for our rate commitments, the dollar value of gross
fixed assets in operation and the depreciation reserve will be recorded in
memorandum accounts which will be made up as follows:
(a) to the agreed value of gross fixed assets as at December 31, 1972
will be added each year a sum representing the annual amount of
new plant commissioned translated into dollars at the average
exchange rate during the year, subject to a deduction of an amount
for retirement of assets during the year;
(b) to the agreed dollar value of depreciation reserve as at December
31, 1972 will be added each year a sum representing the annual
provision for depreciation calculated at 41% of the dollar value
of the average gross fixed assets in operation; appropriate adjust-
ment will be made to reflect retirement of assets during the year.
4.        For purposes of the rate covenant the dollar value of the net fixed
assets in operation will be averaged and converted to pesos at the average
rate during the year.
