NUYORADUM AND EEC     ATON OF THE PRESIDENT
Or TEE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS9OCIATION
TO TER EZICUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THM REPUBLIC 0P HORDURAS FOR A SICOND SOCIAL INVE8TMENT FUND PROJECT
1.           The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Honduras for SDR7.445 million (US$10.2 million equivalent)
is submitted for your approval. The proposed credit would be repayable on standard
IDA terms with forty years maturity, including ten years of grace, and would help
finance a second Social Investment Fund project (PHIS-IX) in Honduras. The project
would be cofinanced with other donors for SDR34.7 million (US$37.5 million
equivalent). The total project cost is estimated at US$67.5 million.
2.           Background.  Since March 1990, the Government of Honduras has carried
out a comprehensive economic stabilization and adjustment program to correct
distortions resulting from past macroeconomic mismanagement and to lay the
foundation for sustained economic growth over the medium term. Recent improvements
in the economy show the progress achieved in the implementation of the program.
Preliminary figures for 1991 show: (i) a 2.2k growth in GDP; (ii) a decrease in the
fiscal deficit from S.4* of GDP in 1990 to 3.7*; (iii) a decline in inflation from
IIt during the fourth quarter of 1990 to 2W during the same period of 1991; and (iv)
an increase in private and public investment of 11.5% and 30.3%r, respectively. The
adjustment program has had an uneven impact on different sectors of the economy.
The liberalization of the exchange rate and decontrol of agricultural prices have
raised income earning opportunities in agricultural and export-oriented activities,
but have increased hardships for urban dwellers and net consumers of food in rural
areas who face higher food prices. Urban workers have also been affected by
increases in public utilities tariffs and contraction in government employment. The
high levels of open unemployment and underemployment have meant that the families of
workers laid off as a result of restructuring in the public and private sect r have
often faced reductions in disposable income. The combined impact of these various
factors on chronic poor families has raised concerns that health, nutrition, and
education indicators may decline in the short-term, particularly among pregnant and
lactating mothers and childrei.
3.          The potentially serious impact of economic adjustment on the poor
spurred the Government to establish two innovative safety net programs in 1990:
first, the Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS), which finances labor-intensive
social and economic infrastructure, social services, and informal sector sub-
projects, prepared and executed by municipalities, communities, and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs); and second, the Family Assistance Program (PRAF), which
provides nutritional assistance via food coupons for the most vulnerable groups of
the population. These programs are viewed as temporary in nature and as providing a
transitional instrument for responding rapidly to a critical poverty situation,
until the line ministries have been strengthened and project activities have been
reintegrated into the normal operations of line ministries. Recognizing NGOs as
important agents ot oocioeconomic development, the Government created an NGO Liaison
Office (MW) to strengthen the collaboration between the Government and NGO8 in
addressing poverty issues.
4.           The Bank and IDA have strongly supported the Government's efforts to
restructure the economy. A Second Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL It) of US$90
million was approved in September 1990, followed by a Structural Adjustment Credit
(SAC) of SDRi4.3 million in January 1991, and an Energy Sector Adjustment Credit
(BbAC) of SDR37.95 million in October 1991. As a result of the reclassification of
Honduras as an IDA-only country in late 1991, it became eligible for the IDA Reflow



-2-
program and a supplemental credit of SDR23 .8 million (attached to the ESAC) was
approved in November 1991. Support for a reform program in the agricultural sector
is at an advanced stage of discussion with the authorities. IDA has also been
actively involved in supporting the Government's poverty alleviation efforts. In
February 1991, a Social Investment Fund credit (Cr. 2212-HO) of SDR14.3 million was
approved to finance PHIS and other priority social sector project activities (a
pilot food coupon program, Living Standards Measurement Survey, social sector
services planning). In addition, preparation is advanced for a proposed Nutrition
and Health project and a possible social sector reform operation is under
discussion, which would focus on improving the efficiency and sustainability of
primary health, primary education, and nutritional assistance programs.
5.           The First Social Investment Fund project (FHIS-I) hao a total ccst of
US$68.0 million; in addition to IDA funds (US$20.0 millicn equivalent), the project
also receives financing from other external aid agencies (US$33.0 million),
Government (US$8.0 million), and project beneficiaries (US$7.0 million). The
project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1993. however, the mid-term review
of the FHIS-1 project, carried out in November 1991, showed that project
implementation had been much faster than expected and outcomes have met the intended
objectives during the first phase of project implementation. FHIS has proved to be
a successful subproject financing mechanism. By December 31, 1991, FHIS had
approved 2,870 subprojects for a total of about US$50 millior., which helped to
generate an estimated 30,000 temporary and permanent jobs. An estimated 500,000
poor Hondurans have directly benefited from FHIS investments in schools, sewerage,
roads, and other types of subprojects. Subprojects are generally of good quality.
The largest part of the financing went to the rehabilitation of social
infrastructure (63* of total subprojects cost), such as primary school classrooms,
health posts, and water and severage systems; economic infrastructure (160), such as
road maintenance and irrigation; and social services (14*), such as training of
midwives and health volunteers, deworming of children, provision of vitamins to
children and mothers, and supply of school desks to primary schools. Finally, FHIS
provided credit (7%) to small and micro-entrepreneurs, such as market vendors and
handicraft makers, who do not have access to the banking system. Subloans,
administered by NGOs, were made at market oriented rates. This program has worked
well with arrears of only 3.7 percent.
6.           The PHIS has a strong and independent management and a well-qualified
and motivated staff. FMIS-financed projects have been implemented efficiently, with
reasonable administrative costs (representing 9% of total commitments). The PHIS
has coordinated its operations well with those of responsible line ministries and
Government agencies (ministries of Bducation and Health and the National Water
Service), complementing their programs and using their norms. Approval of
subprojects is made in consultation with these ministries, which ensure the
sustainsbility of the subproject investments by committing themselves to provide
staff and other recurrent expenditures. Local committees are required to be
organixed for cost sharing (12% in 1991, exceeding the estimated 10% appraisal
target), cost recovery, and maintenance. In addition, FHIS has a contract with the
National Water Service for maintenance and technical sustainability of water Systems
provided under PHIS subprojects. The PHIS has had a positive institutional impact
on municipalities and private sector organizations including small private
contractors and NGOs that have either sponsored or implemented subprojects.
7.           FHIS has targeted its subprojects well, based on a poverty map using
population and poverty criteria, which are transparent to all concerned. Poorer
communities received more funds (60* of total FHIS resources, compared with the



- 3 -
appraisal target of 731) than less poor communities. The actual amount committed by
the PHIS for poorer communities reached 70* of funds targc.ed at appraisal for these
communities, and this percentage is improving. FHIS has reached poorer places where
there had previously been hardly any Government social support effort, but poorer
communities have lagged behind in preparing subprojects to be financed by FHIS.
B.           While the mid-term review has been very positive on the performance of
the FHIS, it was agreed that, to further improve its operations the FHIS would,
inter &i.i: (i) expand its supervision and monitoring capacity; (ii) integrate its
management information systems; and (iii) prepare an action plan to channel more
resources to the poorer municipalities. Actions (i) and (ii) have already been
implemented.
9.           As of December 31, 1991, FHIS had committed US$50 million (741) of the
total available funds of US$68 million, and it had disbursed US$12.1 million, or 601
of the total IDA Credit, i.e., considerably more than the amount of US$7.5 million
(381 of the total Credit) expected at appraisal. Given that total remaining funds
available for commitment frum all sonurces were about US$18 million, and as about
US$3 million per month have been committed recently, FMIS will likely exhaust its
funds as early as June 1992. Additional funds are urgently required for FHiS to
continue its operations beyond mid-1992.
10.          FHIS has clearly demonstrated that it has a strong implementation
capacity, and the Government has provided adequate counterpart funds. At the time
of FHIS-I appraisal, IDA appraised a project of more than US$100 million as the
Honduran Government proposed. But at negotiations, InA and the Government agreed to
downsize the project to US$68 million because of uncertainty about the FHIS
implementation capacity and availability of counterpart funds. Based on the
successful FHIS-I experience, FHIS could easily channel additional funds to finance
subprojects totaling between US$60 million and US$70 million by December 1993.
11.       * Rationale for IDA   Iolv emet.  This follow-up IDA Credit for the
second phase of FHIS programs fits in well with IDA's assistance strategy, which is
to provide technical advice and financial support for the Government's adjustment
programs and short-term safety net operations, as well as for its efforts to
introduce sectoral policy reforms over the medium term. The proposed project would
build on the achievements of FHIS-I and would help the Government sustain its
poverty alleviation efforts during the transitional period, until the line
ministries strengthen their institutional capacities and complete their policy
reform programs.  The FHIS-Il project would complement activities to be implemented
under the proposed Nutrition and Health project, and would contribute to the
institutional strengthening of the line ministries by helping them to improve their
project implementation capacities through close collaboration with FHIS. IDA
support for this second phase is critical to ensure that: (a) improvements agreed
at the mid-term review are fully internalized and implemented during the remainder
of FPIS's operating existence and transferred to line ministries, as appropriate;
and (b) sufficient concessional funds are mobilized from the international donor
community to finance and follow through the safety net operations during the
socioeconomic adjustment period.
12.          ProJect   4eatien. The aim of the project is to help the Government
sustain its poverty alleviation efforts and maintain social cohesion while the line
ministries strengthen their institutional capacities and complete their reform
programs.



13.          Proiect Description. The credit would finance a range of small-scale
subprojects (91W of total project cost) sponsored by municipalities, community
organizations, and EGOs, in four broad categories: (i) social infrastructure (54S
of total subproject cost); (ii) economic infrastructure (13*); (iii) social services
(22%); and (iv) credit to small informal sector entrepreneurs (11W). Wherever
feasible, the subprojeats would be carried out by small private contractors using
labor-intensive methods. The credit would also provide institutional support
through technical assistance to the PIBS. Finally, the credit would provide
technical assistance to the NW, to strengthen the partnership between the public
sector and NGO8 in addressing poverty problems, and to promote NGOs' role in the
preparation of subprojects in poorer communities, so that the poor can actually take
advantage of all funds targeted on them. The credit would not finance the operating
costs of the executing agencies (9* of total cost).
14.          The total project cost is estimated at US$67.5 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$17.0 million (25 percent). The proposed IDA Credit of
SDR7.445 million (US$10.2 million equivalent) would finance 15* of total project
cost. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Honduras are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 104S-HO, dated May 18, 1992, is also attached.
1S.          Pro i_ct Ilemomentatio. The project would be implemented over a
period of about two years. The main executing agency would be the FHIS, which has
clearly demonstrated its strong implementation capacity over the last two vears.
Quarterly and annual audits of MIS expenditures confirm that there has been no
misuse of funds. IHIS's limited life was to expire on March 1993, but has been
extended to March 1994. The other executing agency, the NL, io a new office
established in the Presidency in 1992.
16.         Actins Aned. During neaggtigtion:  (a) PHIS presented evidence
that a more diversified social services program, targeted to poorer communities, had
been prepared; (b) the Borr-wer provided evidence of preliminary agreements on
financing of approximately US$30 million available from IDB, and approximately US$10
million from other financing agencies and donors; (c) the Borrower presented an
action plan for 1992 and 1993, satisfactory to IDA, to channel more funds than in
1990 and 1991 to poorer mtunicipalities, and agreed that, without IDA's approval,
PIS would not comnit more funds for relatively richer municipalities beyond the
agreed amoAunt programmed in the action plan for these municipalities; (d) the
Borrower agreed to provide funds as indicated in the project financing plan and as
needed to cover the operating costs of the PHIS; (e) the Borrower agreed that any
future appointment of the IBIS's Executive Director would be subject to prior IDA
consultAtion and agreement; (f) retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million would
be permitted for eligible expenditures incurred since April 1, 1992; (g) IHIS agreed
to carry out quarterly and annual audits by private independent external auditors,
acceptable to DA; and (h) the Borrower agreed to undert.ake a mid-term review of the
PIBs-SS project not later than February 28, 1993, prepare an action plan, based on
discussions with, and acceptable to, IDA, by March 31, 1993, and thereafter
implement it in accordance with the timetable included in the plan.
17.          The acnditian of effectiveness would be that:  (i) a technical
assistance contract between IHS and UNDP, satisfactory to IDA, would have been
signed; (ii) the Operational Manual has been amended in a manner satisfactory to
IA; (iii) a Subsidiary Agreement for making the funds available by the Borrower to



-5.
the FHIS, satisfactory to IDA, would be entered into; and (iv) a funding agreement
of approximately tS$30 million between the FnIS and IDS, and funding agreements
totaling approximately US$10 million for the FHIS, with other financing agencies and
donors, respectively, would have been signed.
18.          A condition f or disbursement for the  WLO component would be the
appointment of key staff to the NW and the issuance of the regulations to the
legislation that established the NW.
19.          Ravironmental Aspects.  FRIS's operational manual stipulates that all
subprojects financed by the FHIS in various sectors do not adversely affect the
environment and indigenous cultures, and this manual has been well enforced.
20.          Participation of Women. FHIS has programmed 22V of its resources for
subprojects ca basic needs (health, nutrition and education). All these subprojects
would be presented and executed by NGOs and community organizations, thus providing
a systematic channel for the participation of women in the improvement of their
household's and communities' well-being. Based on experience under PHIS-I, about
half of the beneficiaries of informal sector subprojects are also expected to be
women.
21.          Benefitg.  By transferring resources to poor urban and rural
communities, the PHIS would help: (i) prevent a deterioration in the living
standard of the poor during the period of economic adjustment; (ii) improve the
social infrastructure so that the beneficiaries enjoy better sanitation, health,
lower transport costs, and less erosion damage in their communities; (iii) reduce
the rates of mortality, malnutrition, and illiteracy, particularly among women and
children; and (iv) provide the Government experience with a decentralized mechanism
for delivering development assistance to municipalities and small businesses and
mobilizing grass-roots efforts, which could subsequently be put to use by line
ministries.
22.          Risks. There is a risk that the Government may respond to the social
cost of adjustments with excessive speed, and project funds might be poorly used and
diverted to uses not envisaged in the project.  Experience with FIIS-I has
demonstrated that this risk is small, considering FHIS's excellent management,
capable and motivated staff, its good information system, quarterly audits, and
close supervision.
23.          Recomation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of IDA and recommend that the Bxecutive Directors approve the
proposed Credit.
