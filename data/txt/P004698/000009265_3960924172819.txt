FROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
NORTHERN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 929-TH)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Northern Agricultural
Development Project (NADP) for which IDA Credit 929-TH in the amount of US$25.0
million was approved on June 12. 1979. After cancellation of US$3.1 million, the
Credit financed 47X of total project costs of US$45.7 million. Joint financing
was provided by the Governments of Australia (121), and the United King*4m (12).
for technical assistance. The Credit was closed in December 1988
This PCR consists of two parts, being the Reg--on's Evaluation Summary and
Overview of project performance prepared by IDA and a comprehensive completion
report prepared by the Borrower's Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, with
assistance from the FAO Cooperative Program. The PCR is based on Staff Appraisal
Report No. 2269-TH, the IDA Credit Agreement dated June 28, 1979, supervision
reports, project files, the aforementioned completion report by the Borrower and
separate terminal roports by the implementing agencies and by AIDAB and its
consultants and on the findings of a follow-up IDA mission in May 1991.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments.  Comments
received from the Ministry of Agriculture and C3operation, the Department of Land
Development and the Department of Public Welfare are attached as Annexes.

PROJECT UOMPLETION REPORT
NORTHERN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 929-TH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Oblectives and Api2roach
1.    The Northern Agricultural Developmenkt Project (Cr. 929-TH) was a multi-
component area development project designed to reduce poverty and curtail
environmentally damaging shifting cultivation among upland smallholders and
hilltribes in northern Thailand. Under the project. land would be classified
according to its capability to support permanent agriculture. Titles and land-use
certificates over suitable land would be given to beneficiaries to motivate
investment and conservation. Land not suitable for farming would be protected as
forest reserve and would benefit from replanting with forest species. Village
woodlots would be established to lessen use of forest as a household fuel source.
Technical assistance would be given to increase output and incomes from a smaller
farmed area while conserving soil and water resources; earth roads constructed
to provide access to markets and services; schools built to educate village
children for non-farm employment opportunities; and clinics established to
improve health conditions and reduce the birth rate.
Implementation Exierience
2.    The project took nine years to implement, instead of the five expected.
In common with many other integrated area development projects (IADPs). this
multi-component operation proved difficult to implement. This was compounded by
an underestimation of the magnitude of social change as set out in the SAR. Of
the two target groups, one was substantially composed of a number of different
hilltribes, each with a separate language, customs, land-use patterns and degree
of willingness to cooperate with outside intervention. The other target group
also proved difficult to influence because upland activities were usually
supplementary to loarland farming and non-farm activities.
3.      Much of the implementation delay was due to the need for further
preparation, particularly acute in the case of access tracks, and the failure to
elaborate on how specific mechanisms would operate to achieve the broad
objectives.    Fortunately,  project management proved  to be  exceptionally
resourceful in developing effective means of implementing the project activities.
Of note was the involvement of beneficiaries in planning and decision making.
through "problem census" meetings by which villagers expressed their views,
problems and priorities and management worked with them to adapt project
activities to local perceptions.



- vS -
4.    The two main implementation issues remain unresolved.  These are: (i) the
reluctance of the Royal Forestry Department (RFD) to release land from the Forest
Reserve for issuance of land title to those using uplands and for issuance of
land-use permtts (8KSM) for those using the highlands, and (b) the reluctance of
beneficiaries to adopt key features of the agricultural technology being
promoted. With respeict to the STKs no connection has yet been found between
farmer performance and land-use restrictions in the project area.   During
implementation, IDA's position on these instruments shifted from one of support
to a recommendation for further expert study of the problem (PPAR No.6085,
Thailand PAL). While possession of clear title has been shown to affect farmer
performance, the RFD hae been unw. ling to reduce the size of the Foreet Reserve,
given the policy emphasis at the    -,,st level on retaining maximum forest cover.
5.       In recognition that farmers will continue to use slopes, the project
promoted construction of terraces and large earthea bunds, to be used together
with legume-based crop rot --ons, contour plowing and planting, improved
varieties, fertilizers and general improvements in crop husbandry. This strategy
of "conservation farming" was expected to curtail shifting cultivation by
providing the same or greater food and cash crop production from a smaller, fixed
area of lower slope. Farmers' unwillingness or inability to accept terracing and
bunding caused major problems in implementing the agricultural component.
Terracing was eventually discontinued, but some bund construction continues, none
of it at farmers' cost. Bund maintenance remains a serious problem and farmers
frequently plow them out.
Project Achievements and Impact
6.      The project was successful in concentrating increased resources on the
project area, which benefitted about 35,000 households through increased farm
irzomes, better health care. increased literacy, and improved access. Except for
the earthworks, the conservation farming package was successfully developed and
proved generally acceptable to the community with consequent and well-documented
increase in food and cash-crop production. The impact on shifting cultivation is
not yet clear, because of inherent measurement difficulties.  In the highlands,
it appears to be minor and localized. In the uplands, the reported bush fallow
area fell sharply following land clearing but this needs further investigation.
The project also had a major impact on the key implementing institutions and
developed an effective system of applied research, extension and on-farm
demonstration. Despite limited impact on shifting cultivation in the highlands,
v a project was successful in fostering confidence between the isolated
nilltribes and the PWD.
7.        At the time of Credit closing in December 1988, there were serious
reservations about project sustainability. For the upland component, there was
a 501 reduction in field staff, a shortfall in budgetary support for maintenance
of project works, uncertain institutional responsibility with respect to credit
and marketing,  and the unresolved land tenure issues.          For the highland
component, the Government is continuing the project with bilateral financing on
an expanded area.

Leso,ss Learned
The following art the main leesons learned through implementation of this
project.
8.    (a)    The project objectives should be feasible.   In this case, the
magnitude of social and institutional change was not such that it
could reasonably be expecte6 to be achieved in five years.
(b)    Projects should not be unduly complex. The project should probably
have been at least two separate operations, one for the uplandt and
one for the highlands. While the problems were somewhat similar,
the human and agricultural resources are quite distinct, as are the
agencies responsible.
(c)    The land tenure problems should possibly have been dealt with by a
separate specialized operation, such as eventuated in the Land
Titling Projects (Lns 2440-TH and 3254-TH).
(d)    Specifics of how project mechanisms will operate need to be spelt
out in detail, as do the precedents for the technical assumptions
made. This would have led to better preparation and probably
changes in design. The concept of reducing shifting cultivation by
issuing land use permits over lower slopes was attractive, but no
measures were introduced to prevent access to steeper slopes.
(e)    Technology transfer needs adaptation and monitoring. While it is
understandable that the project may have begun with inappropriate
earthworks, it is not clear why project management persevered so
long, even when its own reports pointed out the deficiencies.
(f)    Subsidies  and grants  should not be  used  in  the  absence  of
beneficiary demand. The establishment of woodlots and bunds at no
beneficiary cost may have helped to reach targets, but did not
change basic attitudes and has left the agencies with a maintenance
problem.

THAILAND
NORTHERN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 929-TH)
OVERVIEW
I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Introduction
1.1       The  Northern  Agricultural  Development  Project  (NADP)  aimed  to
progressively end shifting cultivation in Northern Thailand and to raise the
standard of living of the rural poor of that region. IDA Credit 929-TH of US$25
million was the secord in support of the Royal Thai Government's (RTG) rural
development efforts, following the North-east Thailand Rural Development Project
(Ln. 1198-TH).   Joint cofinancin3 of US$0.90 million, later increased, was
provided by Australia, and of US$0.34 by the UK. with the Royal Thai Government
(RTG) providing the local currency equivalent of US$21.26 million to meet the US$
47.5 million total expected project costs (Table 2.2). The Credit Agreement was
signed on June 28, 1979, and was closed on December 31, 1988.
Project Objectives
1.2       The Project grew out of concern for forest, soil and water degradation
cauied by shifting cultivation of ever shorter rotation, over an area of some
222,000 ha of undulating to steeply sloping land within the legally designated
forest reserves of Northern Thailand. The principal aim was to end shifting
cultivaz'on by identifying about 64,000 ha of land suitable for permanent
agriculture, issuing land-use permits, and settling some 21,500 subsistence
families on farms. All cultivation would be prohibited in the 'emaining 158,000
ha of land to be kept as forest reserve.   Introduction of newly developed
sustainable farming systems was expected to raise output, nutrition levels and
farm incomes.   Basic education and health services would be upgraded and
expanded. These objectives were in line with the growth with equity goals of
RTGs Fourth Development Plan. The project also aimed to build institutional
capacity in development planning, research and management.
Proiect Beneficiaries
1.3       The target group comprised 21,500 farm families from amongst the
poorest in Thailand. At appraisal, it was estimated that their total family
incomes averaged about US$400 - US$500 per year, far less than the US$950 average
annual income of agricultural households throughout Thailand in the late 19708.
Of these, 15,000 families grew subsistence crops of rice with some cash crops of
maize, peanuts and others on rainfed uplands, where problems of soil suitability,
rainfall reliability, farming techniques and tenure status were the major
limitations. Another 6,500 families grew mainly subsistence crops of hill rice
and maize in the highlands where such constraints were even further compounded



by the fact that the population comprised ethnic hilltribes of fragile
integration within the rest of the Thai economy and society. Infrastructure
coverage and the level of basic social services received were also below national
averages.
1.4       Upland farmers are generally ethnic Thais who practice a mixture of
settled and shifting agriculture. Many have land use permits and some have clear
title to small parcels of irrigated lowlevels.   The poorer highland farmers
belong to Karen, Hmong, Yao, Akha, Lisu, Lahu and minor tribes with distinct
cultures, religions, lwaguages, arts and dress. The hilltribes are part of a
larger population extending into China, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.   Despite
having dwelt in the forest highlands of northern Thailand for at least a century.
or longer, the majority of tribals have no land titles or other form of official
tenure recognition, beyond tolerance of their customary land use. Except for
some relatively recent arrivals they are Thai citizens who numbered about 500,000
at the time of the 1988 census.
Prolect Desian
1.5       The Project consisted of the following three separate and related
programs administered by three Government agencies, coordinated by a steering
committee. These we-e:
(a) U2land develo2ment for 15,000 ethnic Thai families on about 30,000 ha
of land abzve the major valleys at up to 500m elevation and under the
*             responsibility  of the Land Development  Department  (LDD)  of the
Ministry of Agriculture  and Cooperatives  (MOAC).    This was  an
expansion of on ongoing Thai-Australian Land Development Project,
which concentrated on land use classification, introduction of soil
conservation practices, and increasing farm production and incomes.
(b)  Hifhland development for 6,500 hilltribe families  or about 34,000 ha
of land above 500m elevation and under the Hilltribe Welfare Division
(HTWD) of the Public Welfare Department (FWD) of the Ministry of the
Interior  (MOI).    This was  an  expansion  of  the  ongoing  Zonal
Development Program which in addition to agricultural development,
introduced basic health care, schooling and other services to remote
villages.
(c)  Forest conservation and rehabilitation of about 138,000 ha of steep
land degraded by shifting cultivation and not suitable for farming and
under the care of the Watershed Management Division of the Royal
Forestry Department (RPD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives. This was to be an expansion of the ongoing watershed
identification, demarcation, legal classification, protection and
replautting program.
1.6       Supporting components were added to strengthen provincial planning and
project preparation to improve local capacity to extend the atrategy throughout
the country's uplands and highlands.



- xi -
ProJect ApDroach
1.7       The  project  began with    an  attempt  to match  land  capability
classification with actual land use. As land suitable for permanent farming was
delineated and developed, land-use certificates were to be processed and given
to eligible families, who would then be expected to surrender traditional use of
swidden land.   Areas of less than 31 slope were developed for small-scale
irrigation and areas of 31 to 35Z would be used for rainfed farming with
construction of terraces and contour banks to control erosion. No farming would
be permitted in lands with more than 351 slope, which would be gazetted for
permanent forest reserve. Some 5.000 ha of degraded areas within the reserves
were to be replanted, and fire control measures were to be established using
village labor.
1.8       Specialized equipment was brought in and the land suitable for farming
was cleared, bench terraces and contour banks were shaped and the first
cultivation was made by the project. A major technical assistance effort was
undertaken to introduce legume-based rotations and diversified cropping patterns,
particularly into treecrops,  including coffee,  tea and fruits.   This was
complemented by provision of improved seed, fertilizer and other inputs at
incentive prices for the first three years.
1.9       Although not provided for in the project, follow-up farm credit from
tne Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) and extension
services were channelled through the Cooperatives Department of the Ministry, as
part of their re;ular programs.  Access tracks were constructed to link the
villages to  existing all-weather roads.  In order to take pressure off the
watersheds, village woodlots were planted for fuel and small lumber. Training
was given to project extension staff and further development of technolc;y
packages through research activities on pilot operations was supported. Project
performance was to have been continuously monitored and periodically evaluated.
Project Management
1.10      Since the project was an expansion of an existing and well functioning
set of programs, no new management structure was established. Management of the
uplands component was left to the Land Development Division of the MOAC.
Management of the highlands was left with the specialized Hilltribe Welfars
Division of the MOI, while the Royal Forestry Department of the MOAC continued
with its traditional role of managing and conserving the forest estate. An
inter-Ministerial Project Execution Committee (Section 3.11 of DCA) was formed
to resolve matters at an interagency level.
1.11      The  administration  of  support  to  provincial  planning  was  the
responsibility of the Under Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior (OUSMI);
that for preparation of subsequent projects was the responsibility of the
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB); and that for pilot R &
D was the responsibility of the Under Secretary of State of the MOAC.
1.12      Assistanca in training and implementation was given through the
Australian Government technical assistance program. This program had begun in
1967, and focused on upland agriculture until 1979, when it was expanded to



- xii -
include highlands. It formed the technical basis of the Northern Agriculture
Development Project (NADP). After closure of the NADP the program has continued
and now focuses on the highlands, through the Thai-Australia Highland
Agricultural and Social Development Project (HASD).
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation ProRress
2.1       General.  The Project took nine years to implement, from October 1979
to December 1988, instead of fivs years envisaged at appraisal. This compares
with the standard disbursement profile for agricultural development of eight
years for the Region, and of 8.5 years Bank-wide for area development. The main
causes of the 15 month delay in start of physical implementation were the lead
time needed  to define detailed activities  and for selection of  specific
development sites, for land surveys, for detailed design of civil works, to
convince farmers to agree to participate, and to train extension staff. After
the initial difficulties were overcome, further delays were due to cumbersome
tendering procedures, shortage of land suitable for permanent agriculture,
institutional shortcomings, budget constraints, and farmers' indifference towards
acceptance of many of the proposals, particularly those for contour banks and
upland woodlots.
2.2       On balance, the long implementation period may have been beneficial,
as it allowed adjustments to be made.   At the start of the project,  the
conservation farming techniques relied heavily on engineering works for field
crops through construction of quite large bunds and terracing. This approach was
gradually changed %.th more emphasis being placed on grass strips, strip cropping
and crop choice in favor of treecrops. The change evolved from experience in
implementing the project; further preparation and faster implementation would not
have led to a better result. Many of the pre-set physical targets were to a
large extent arbitrary and based on informal judgements of the capacity of
institutions to accept some fairly fundamental changes. IDA's current practice
and policy would have required a more thorough investigation of the cultural and
physical environment, particularly with respect to land occupation and
administration issues.
2.3       Implementation Issues. The main difficulty for project implementation
was the inability to resolve the incompatibility between land use customs and
formal land administration. Although much land was officially designated as
Forest Reserves, in reality there was fairly intensive use for agricultural
purposes. The RFD was not convinced of the suitability of project design from
the start and had a long-standing policy of not releasing land from the gazetted
Forest Reserve. This has not changed in the ensuing years. (PPAR No. 6085,
Thailand SAL, para. 3.38).
2.4       Of the 230,637 rai developed by the LDD, STK permits have been given
for only 2,975 rai. Among reasons given was the charge that illegal sale of
permits made the occupants by those who then became worse off by becoming
landless, and that the land classification maps produced by the project were



- xiii -
inadequate. To a large extent the FD's conservative position is understandable.
By definition, all of the highlands and much of the Uplands are watersheds which
the RPD is required to protect.   Watershed degradation has reached crisis
proportions in much of the country and logging is currently banned. Clearly,
resolution of this issue has to be made in a wider context than that of the
project.   Much of the Forest Reserve is farmed, some of it fairly intensi'ely,
and much of the Forest Reserve is not forest at all. In these circumstances,
the best watershed protection would be conservation-based farming with reduction
of swidden. This does seem to require reduction of the Forest Reserve area, a
very contentious point, and issuance of some form of land tenure security
instrument - provided that there is a reasonable expectation that swidden area
will be reduced. This is not certain, but some evidence is emerging from the
project that an increase in permanent agriculture has been accompLanied by a
reduction in shifting cultivation area where laoor supply is limiting (para
3.18).
2.5       Implementation of the roads program also proved difficult because the
budget allocation of Baht 30,000 per km, derived from an appraisal estimate,
which proved totally inadequate.  Tracks were frequently constructed on very
steep foottrack alignment, of insufficient width and without cross and
longitudinal drainage. This problem was cited often by supervision missions, and
IDA suspended disbursements against the component until the allocation was almost
tripled. Maintenance and the need to upgrade roads remain a problem, but the
track network is functional and the low density of only some 30 inhabitants per
square km would not justify more costly construction.
Prolect Achievements - in Relation to TarRets
2.6       Farm Development.  Some 35,860 farm families benefitted directly at
an average cost of US$1,273 (Table 2.1).   This compares favorably with the
anticipated 21,500 families at an average cost of US$2,208 estimated at
appraisal, and is low for an agricultural development project in general. This
chiefly reflects the low civil works content of the project and its emphasis on
technical assistance aimed at changing farming systems (Table 2.02). It also
reflects the smaller farm sizes of 0.9 ha actual in comparison with the 1.6 ha
expected which had an important bearing on soil conservation efforts.   Land
developed for cropping was about 33,000 ha at an average cost of about US$ 350
per ha, about that expected.
2.7       Forestry.  Only 4,532 ha of village woodlots were established, a 36Z
shortfall, mainly because of the availability of firewood from standing forest.
The RFD surpassed its goal of rehabilitating 4,600 ha of degraded forest and
planted 5,880 ha at an average cost of US$814/ha.   While in excess of the
estimated US$673/ha this is a low cost for such difficult terrain and reflects
the somewhat inflexible budget allocation system of fixed amounts per ha without
due regard to local conditions.

2.8       Civil Works. Construction of large contour banks was reduced from the
target of 7,500 km to 4,406 km due to their need to pass through multiple farm
lots whose various owners were often not in agreement with their utility - a view
also expressed by supervision missions.   Only 41 of the expected 160 small
irrigation schemes were built. Concrete and mechanically formed water diversion
structures were established, but these were destroyed by recurrent flooding and
the project reverted to supporting simple clay core and gabion wiers.  Costs
averaged a low US$770/ha.
2.9       A total of 1,660 km of access tracks were constructed, slightly over
the 1,595 km target, at a very low cost of only US$2,066/km. again reflecting the
budget allocation system of providing a fixed sum per km without due regard to
local terrain. The tracks are of formed earth, generally without provision for
drainage. While definitely under-designed, the tracks are kept functional by the
District authorities and by the villagers themselves. Some 79 village schools
were opened in line with the target, whereas only 21 of the expected 32 health
posts were found to be needed. Although not financed by the project, 117 village
water supply facilities were provided in the project area.
Proiect Costs
2.10      Total project costs were US$45.66 million, compared with US$47.49
million anticipated (Table 2.2). This represented a 4X cost underrun while the
Baht cost increased by 152, from B 950 million estimated at appraisal to B 1,092
million actual, resulting from differences in price changes and exchange rate
movements. Although the variation in total cost was small for a project taking
so long to implement, the variation in component cost was large, ranging from a

III. PROJECT IHPACT
A. Hiahlands
Infrastructure
3.1       Project impact was greatest in the highlands, where the provision of
access roads and the introduction of significant cash cropping induced major
changes in the 297 villages with a population of 9,847 families. Prior to the
project, many highland villages were several days' walk, over mountainous
terrain, from vehicular roads. This isolation severely limited the delivery of



-xvi-
health care, schooling and extension services to the hilltribes and constrained
cash cropping to production of non-perishable commodities with high value to
weight ratio, such as opium. The project adopted a strategy of linking "key"
villages with   426 km of simple access  roads.   Project  activities were
concentrated on the key village. Outlying "satellite" villages were not served
directly, but were usually close enough for access to the key village.
3.2       Schools.  All the schools built by the project were in the highlands.
These schools were designated "temporary" and were staffed by teachers aides of
the Hilltribe Division of the DPW and had an annual enrollment of some 2,000.
Five years of primary schooling are given, after which those wishing to continue
must travel by access road to formal schools in towns. The temporary schools are
eventually upgraded to regular schools and are handed over to the care of the
Education Department for absorption into their regular program. By the time of
project closing, 32 schools had been graduated. An important influence of the
schools has been through the "non-formal" education program which teaches basic
arithmetic and Thai language to the community at large. The 1987 Impact Survey
of a sample of nine villages showed an increase in literacy of 1342 over the 1978
rate for the same villages established by the Hilltribe Research Institute Survey
of that year.
3.3       Health Care.  The access roads also facilitated the establishment of
the health care system. In addition to the 21 health posts established, medical
banks of pharmaceuticals were maintained in 84 villages serving 2,646 households.
The clinics were visited by health care workers on a regular schedule and
services concentrated on maternal and infant care, nutrition, hygiene and birth
control which met with increasing acceptance. The impact survey quoted in the
previous para showed that for the nine village sample, 16% of the adult women and
4% of the men had been sterilized and that another 142 of the women used
contraceptives. The 1989 survey of 562 households reported 44% of households
using family planning measures.
3.4       Access Tracks.  The roads have permitted more and faster traffic in
the highlands. Social services, agricultural extension, seed, fertilizer and
traders are now able to come in and surplus labor and products are able to go
out.  Because of this, cropping patterns have changed towards a cash system
(para. 3.18) which in turn has enabled tribals to buy power tillers, motor cycles
and television sets, inducing further change.
Agriculture
3.5       Aggregate Impact.   Although measuring crop areas, production and
yields in systems of predominantly shifting cultivation is subject to a wide
error of estimate, the results of the Extension Surveys and the Paddy Surveys can
be taken as a reasonable measure of project impact. Prior to project start-up,
about 75,000 rai or 12,000 ha, (Table 3.1), were cultivated annually out of a
total area of 172,000 ha with a 10-15 year bush fallow. Taking the 1987 survey
results as an approximation of the situation at project completion, the annual
cropped area had expanded to some 132,000 rai (21,000 ha) gross and to probably
no more than 100,000 rai net of double cropping. Of the total area, 41,000 rai

were directly affected by project investment and much of the balance was
influenced by the project activities.

3.6       Cropping Patterns.  The cropping pattern became more diversified with
the introduction of soybeans and other legumes, mung beans and similar species
which were virtually unused prior to the project,   This influenced soil
fertility, diets and cash incomes (para. 3.5). Introduction of coffee posed many
problems despite a strong technical assistance program (para. 3.26) and only 400
rai were planted. This was because the characteristics of production and sale
were entirely different from those of traditional crops. Soybean on the other
hand was compatible with the existing system and is now processed locally into
soymilk, which is used in the school nutrition program.  Soybean meal is in
demand for feeding animals. Coffee suffered from poor maintenance during the
pre-harvest phase, poor appreciation of the need for pruning, the long wait for
a return, and the need for outside buyers. However, now that the early crops are
yielding, there is an upswing in interest and the area is expected to triple
within four years.
3.7       The 1987 swidden area was reduced by 24,612 rai compared with the
estimated "without project " 1987 swidden area. This is equivalent to about the
area required to produce the quantity of rice grown as project-financed paddy.
While this is plausible, there remains the fact that during the project period
the area under shifting cultivation - within the project area - continued to rise
and the fallow continued to shorten, lending weight to the view that agricultural
development, unless accompanied by a net reduction of population, is unlikely to
solve the land use problems of the region.
3.8       Conservation.   A key project objective was soil, water and forest
conservation (SAR 4.01 (c)). The SAR projected a release of 26,000 ha from



:- xviii -
shifting cultivation, which would be returned to forest.. Under the project.
4.700 ha of this would be planted to woodlots and forest reserve plantation.
Soils remaining in farming would be protected by terraces. As shown above, the
project did not stop the general expansion of shifting cultivation, but appears
to have slowed it down (by 24,612 rai or about 4,000 ha only), and may have
redn^ed it in localized labor-short areas. Woodlots were not successful because
of the accessibility of forest wood, and the plantation areas were small (para.
3.23).
3.9       The introduction of bench terraces for rainfed fieldcrops was an
outright failure and was dropped early in the project. These were expensive in
relation to production increases. Field trials by the project indicate that soil
loss with terraces, on the trial sites, was 1.7 tons/ha/year, while losses with
much cheaper grass strips were marginally lower at 1.3 tone/ha/yr.  The follow-
up mission in 1991 found little evidence of farmer interest in these practices.
All grass strips, alley crops, and other variants on farmland had been
established at project initiative and cost and generally were not being
maintained. In their absence, yield declines could be compensated by expansion
of swidden.   Land pressure does not yet compel such intensive land use as
terracing.
3.10      Nevertheless, gradual awareness of and small but steady improvements
in soil c8nservation are being made through extension-induced changes in farming
practices. These include legume based rotations to keep soil cover, contour line
planting and other measures.
Agricultural Services
3.11      Credit and Input Supnpl.  No provision was made in the project design
for credit and marketing. It was assumed that existing arrangements worked well
and would continue to be used (para 6.01 SAR). This assumption proved incorrect
early on. Formal credit was unavailable because of collateral problems in the
absence of titles, and beneficiaries were reluctant to use informal credit at
high interest on innovation, with perceived high risks.   Improved seed,
fertilizer and other purchased inputs were to be supplied without cost recovery
(SAR Para 7.21). During implementation, project management decided that use of
village revolving funds was preferable, and these were tried.  The approach
proved successful, and in 1986 only revolving funds were used.   By Credit
closure, 207 different revolving funds were operating in 98 villages with 2.074
members and having a capitalized value of Baht 735,320. The funds were extended
to cover purchase of simple medical supplies at village level. The approach is
generally working well and functions in a manner similar to the Grameen Bank-type
credit schemes.   Training is given to village bookkeepers and repayment is
generally adequate to sustain the funds.
3.12      Marketing.  Marketing of output has not presented problems, except in
the case of coffee where the sale of small amounts of beans of mixed quality in
dispersed locations was difficult at first. This appears to have been overcome,
but assistance is needed on marketing development. On-farm fermenting and drying
results in a halving of the weight sold but in a quintupling of price. Four year
old trees yield 400 grams per year of green cherry sold at Baht 10/kg, whereas
the same beans fermented and dried yield 200 grams sold at Baht 50/kg.

Gn-XaM Development
3.13      An  important  finding of the  1989 Baseline Survey of 562 farm
households is that almost 50X claimed that they were not aelf sufficient in food
production. This indicates the importance of cash cropping, livestock rearing,
cottage industry and oft-farm work. The survey revealed the most co,mon farm
type was based on an average of 1.5 rai of paddy, supplemented by 9 rai of
hillrice and 4.5 rai of maize for stockfeed or sale (table 3.2). Only 71 of
farmed land had titles or use permits, and only 21 was rented from others. With
the project, beneficiaries' paddy area doubled to 3 rai and yields rose from 350
kg/rai to 450 kg/rai. mainly as a result of investment in water control
structures.  One-third of the paddy area was planted to a follow-up crop of
soybeane where moisture made this possible.  Because of the increased labor
needed for the paddy, the area of hillrice that could be grown fell from 9 to 7
rai, or less.  Yields of those adopting recommended practices rose from 210
kg/rai to 400 kg/rai as a result of extension efforts to encourage use of
improved seed. fertilizer and cultural practices. Similarly, maize yields for
adopters were about 400 kg/rai, compared with 320 kg/rai for non-adopters. Small
amounts of coffee, tea, fruit trees and other permanent crops were established
depending on local circumstances.   The annual value of output -rom this
representative farm rose from Baht 8,197 to Baht 15.075 in 1991 prices. Food
production rose from 2,415 kg to 4,150 kg, enough to turn a food deficit
household into one of self-sufficiency, and the casb crops were diversified from
maize to soybean/maize/coffee.
3.14      How significant is all of this in achieving the project's poverty
alleviation goal?   The Thai National Statistical Office estimates that the
average contribution of cropping to total farm household income from all sources
for the Northern Region for 1990 to be Baht 18,000 per year.  Based on the
representative model, it seems fair to conclude that the income effect of the
project was to bring adopters from very much below the average up to almost
average for the Region, the second poorest in Thailand.

B.   Uplands
Agriculture
3.15      In contrast to the difficult social and ecological conditions of the
highlands, development of the uplands was relatively straightforward and needed
to concentrate on transfer of agricultural technology. Upland slopes and soils
are generally more favorable for permanent farming ard the requirement was to
adapt known technology from overseas  to local conditions.   International
development assistance began in the uplands in 1967, some 12 years before the IDA
project, under the Thai-Australia Land Development Project (TALD).   The IDA
Credit expanded and built on this experience. By the time of Credit closing, the
project could be considered "completed" whereas highland technology is still
evolving. Nonetheless, there is still a long way to go in terms of adoption by
farmers of measures that ensure long-rua eustainability. This requires further
adaptation of the technology to local circumstances and vice versa, best
exemplified by the mixed results with bunding and contour plowing (para 3.20).
3.16      Uplands are generally farmed as supplementary areas to irrigated
lowlands competing with other activities (e.g., non-farm employment) for surplus
household labor. The land use and yield surveys conducted by Project management
indicate that the most common pattern is a household farming about 7 rai of
irrigated paddy lowland and about an equal area of rainfed upland. Following
clearing of the bush fallow, a crop of maize is usually grown until the soil
nitrogen drops. This is followed by hillrice with yields declining until the
field is returned to fallow. Many of the farm operations are carried out by
villagers as a group, even though individual families retain the traditional
usage right. Most of the land is in the forest reserve, used without permit, and
is generally devoid of forest cover.
3.17      Under the project, the LDD identified land suitable for permanent
agriculture. With the agreement of the community using the land, a 30 year lease
was obtained by the LDD from the RFD and the land cleared, raked and contoured.
Large earth bunds were construLted along the contours and the land ploughed and
prepared for planting. The community then planted with improved seeds according
to LDD extension recommendations and were expected to follow rotations to
overcome the usual pattern of yield decline. After development and stabilization
of y'elds, the LDD lease was to have been converted to land-use permits or titles
for the individual traditional users.
3.18      The main impact has been in increasing the area planted through
decreasing the annual fallow and through a change in the cropping pattern. A
Land Use and Yield Survey (Yee and Sujanil) of 784 project beneficiary farms (52
sample) was made to measure the impact of project activities by comparing the
1980 pre-project situation, as a proxy for "without project", with the 1985 post-
development situation. Annual data for intervening years were also collected.
Following development, the cropped area increased from 3,820 rai to 4,508 rai,
while the fallow area fell from 3,405 rai to 390 rai (table 3.3). On the face
of it, these figures indicate that shifting cultivation on a two year cycle, in
the aggregate, virtually ceased and that farmers are cropping the cleared and
bunded land annually.

3.19      Crooping Pattern. Following development, the cropping pattern became
more diversified and shifted towards cash crops and sway from rice.  The area of
rice fell by 54%, from 2,469 rai to 1.127 rai. The largest increase was in maize
and mung beans, with other crops such as sugar cane, ginger, soybeans, peanuts,
and treecrop3 depending on specific location and market opportunity.
3.20      Yields. Nine villages were selected as demonstrations of the benefits
of adopting the package of consarvation measures being promoted by the project.
These villages were given special attention in terms of project assistance.
Yields of rice, maize and peanuts rose substantially over the without project
levels (Table 3.4). However, Yee and Sujanil's yield survey (para. 3.18) could
find no statistically significant yield increase following development on
beneficiary farms not part of the demonstration program. The explanation for
this appears to be that farmers have not adopted recommended practices. Field
inspection commonly showed that bunds were partially or fully destroyed, land was
not being plowed on the contour but straight up and down with evident erosion,
and the complex rotations were not being followed. While the technology itself
seems correct from the land management point of view, it appears to be
incompatible with the institutional setting. First, bunding required control
over the natural drainage unit as a complete whole. The pattern of many small
independently managed  farm fields did not permit this control.   Second,
contractors charged much more for contour plowing, and farmers were not willing
to pay the extra. Third, farmers were not prepared to outlay cash for green
manure cover crops that generated no saleable output. In addition, planting a
second crop reduced family labor available for more remunerative off-farm work,
contributing an average of almost half the farm household income.

Land Use and Yield Surveys
3.21      IngcmeLEW)Hect.  The Borrower's PCR (Annex Tables 4 - 6) indicates the
income gains from adopting project recommendations (Table 3.5). On the basis of
the models' assumptions, for a typical 9 rai holding accepting the full
technology package the gross value of production would rise from Baht 2106 to
Baht 9432 in Year 1 after clearing. ThiG would result mainly from expanding the
cropped area from 2.7 rai. By Year 7. the gross value would be expected to fall
to Beht 7776 and stabilize at that level. For partial adoption, the fall is
shown as even more serious since the return to labor at Baht 17/day is less than
the without project return to labor of Baht 36/day. and this wotld help explain
why adoption of recommendations has met with rather mixed success.   This
perception by the Borrower's implementing agency deserves empirical validation,
as it is central to the soundness of the technology being promoted. The Land Use
and Yield Survey of 1985 looked at this apparent problem, but concluded that "...
no consistent yield pattern can be derived for any crop in a project site
following development."

3.22      The "Post-Develoament Evaluation" survey of a sample of project sites
compared inflation adjusted incomes for the same households before and after
development (Table 3.6). Incomes generally rose substantially and fall within
the range of net production value shown in the previous table. The contribution

of upland farming to total household income, 1% - 182, rose to 72 - 34Z.
However, even with the project, income from upland farming remained minor in
comparison with that from off-farm work. This supports the view that upland
farming may be a residual activity not likely to receive the necessary priority
investment of time and money, and would help explain slow adoption. Again,
further field research is needed.

C.   Forestry
3.23      The basic objective of the forestry component was to establish a
replicable model for forest rehabilitation following release of land from
shifting cultivation and to promote woodlots as a village operated asset valuable
in itself and as a hedge against forest destruction for fuel. The impact 4n both
these regards was minor, other than as a test demonstration. About 10,412 ha of
the targeted 11,750 ha of trees were planted. While this represents an 862
physical achievement, it did not develop into a replicable strategy.
3.24      The woodlot program suffered from an "ownership" problem.  No farmer
interest was generated (PCR, para. 33) and institutional respons.bilities were
not settled. The RPD, understandably, took the poeition that woodlots within the
Forest Reserve are illegal and treeplanting outside the reserves is not its
responsibility. The LDD Woodlot Section established 1432 ha of upland trees in
five years. It was unable to establish any woodlot associations and the component
was curtailed at this level. In the highlands, the experience was similar. The
woodlot planting target was met in the highlands only because the RFD and the PWD
carried out the tree planting directly. The main reason for lack of beneficiary
interest is the proximity of wood in standing fJrest and scrub regrowth and the
absence of any mechanism to prevent its use.
3.25      The plantation program to reforest 4.600 ha of former shifting
cultivation land was succeseful, in that it established 5,580 ha. However, this



- uiv -
was vell within the competence of the ongoing replanting program of the RFD, and
it io difficult to assess the contribution of the project, either to institution
building within the RFD or to developing a strategy to reclaim degraded forest
from shifting cultivators. The program vas, and continues to be, plagued by
friction wit} cultivators over land use with consequent fire and cattle damage
to replanting. The forest planting program Was to have been part of a logical
sequence that identified arable land and gave it in secure tenure to farmers,
with the rest to be kept in forest reserve by informed consensus. As discussed
above, this sequence did not occur and land use conflict remains an unsettled
issue.
TebnicalAssistance
3.26      In retrospect, the project proved to be essentially a technical
assistance effort. Ito major gains have been in the development and transfer of
institutional skills in research, extension and program management from the
foreign consultants to counterparts. Implementation difficulties were usually
due to technical assistance problems. The long implementation period was largely
due to the underestimation of the magnitu6e of the technical assistance task at
appraisal, both in terms of the readiness of the technology packages and of the
beneficiaries to adopt them.
3.27      The SAR Was rather ambivalent in this regard, claiming that technology
development was suitably advanced to form a satisfactory basis to proceed with
a major project (para. 4.08, 4.22), while supporting research because "... while
some preliminary research findings on raising productivity are beginning to
emerge. generally they have not been tried at farm level" (para. 4.51). Although
the cost of technical assistance was only 102 higher than expected (Table 2.2).
this was mostly expenditure on extension and other local staff activities.
Provision for foreign experts was made at about US$ 0.9 million, whereas actual
cost proved to be about US$ 6.0 million.   Without the major increased
contribution from the Australian Government for this component, the project would
clearly have suffered a serious setback. The treatment of technical assistance,
and ispecially that to be given by the foreign consultants, is rather diffuse in
the SAR. No terms of reference, brief job description, quantity required or
other specification is provided, possibly because financing was not being
provided by IDA.
3.28      Extension and Applied Research.   The project used a modified T & V
system of extension. In the uplands, a joint program was run by the LDD and the
DOAE, using a system of demonstration villages vhere farmers received special
attention and subsidy assistance to motivate acceptance of recommendations. In
the highlands a similar approach was used, with the DPW taking the lead with the
key villages receiving special attention. In both areas the project was able to
bring a greater concentration of extension resources. Under the project, the
ratio of extension workers to farmers was 1:160, compared with 1t:O00 under the
National Extension Program.   It was expected that at project completion
responsibility for extension mad applied research would revert to DOAE alone and
that the task would be esseatially one of maintaining a regular program extending
proven technology to a generally receptive farmer community.
3.29      By project completion, it became clear that this would not eventuate.
Despite major gains there are still unresolved problems with the approach being
used, the technology being promoted and farmer receptivity (Report on
Conservation Villages, 1985), leading to reservations about the replicability on



-xxv-
a large scale and the sustainability once the high concentration of extension
services was finished. This led to a continuation of the Australian Government's
involvement in highland development after the closure of the IDA project. For
the upland component. the Borrower's PCR states (para 109) that the transfer of
about 501 of LDD field staff from the project following project closing is a
major risk for the sustainability of project gains. No agreement has been made
between LDD and DOAE on post-project extension arrangements.   The marginal
involvement of DOAE during implementation does not indicate that there is a high
likelihood of continuing the project approach through the regular extension
program. While using the specialist LDD and DPW agencies for extension during
the project would have been advantageous from the implementation point of view.
there has been a cost for long run continuity.
3.30      Farm Credit.   A similar situation exists for agricultural credit.
During the project, credit was supplied by the project either from the revolving
funds or from grants. The BAAC was generally not involved because of collateral
problems  in the absence of tenure security.   In theory,  group credit is
available, but BAAC's absence from the project poses a problem.
Provincial Planning and Training
3.31      This activity undertaken by the Office of the Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Interior (OPS MOI) was important in assisting RTG in the
decentralization of rural planning activities and was particularly helpful to the
National Rural Development Project (Ln. 2402-TH). A total of about 7,000 staff
from all over the country were given training and training materials developed
for sub-district, district and provincial analytical problem identification, and
planning. Studies were commissioned to explore alternatives in local planning
from which an operational guideline was developed and is utilized in on-going
rural developmeat management.
Project Preparation and Studies
3.32      A total of 17 studies recommended by various groups were commissioned
by NESDB (Borrowers PCR Table 2). The resultd of some were helpful to government
(more to NESDB than to line agencies) in determining macro-policies, developing
area specific development projects, and assist'ng in implementation of rural
development program.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.33      At appraisal it was determined that project inputs, project outputs,
and project impact would be monitored and information provided to project
managers for information and to policy makers and donors as guidance in future
project design and policy formulation. M&E base monitoring was supervised by
NESDB; performed by the line departments; and evaluated by consultants from
Thammasat University (TURA). In-depth studies of highland and upland agriculture
were also conducted by the implementing agencies, technical advisors and AIDAB.
The highland agricultural and social studies were used in formulating the follow-
on project supported by AIDAB.
3.34      The Borrower's PCR (para. 38-40) is critical of TURA performance in
failing to provide in-depth evaluation of social, financial and economic impact
of the sub-projects and guidelines for future projects. In general, however, the
system was operational and pointed out targets which were not met.



- xxvi -
Unfortunately, the system was not accepted by the line departments as an aid to
management, nor as helpful in providing guidance to modifications of activities
which could have been made more effective.
Pilot Rainfed Ocerations
3.35      Two sites were selected (and developed by LDD) for testing and
demonstration of rainfed land management and crop production practices in the
North and Northeast. under the administration of the Office of Agricultural
Economics (OAR). The initial concepts of rainfed farming systems were taken from
research results obtained in India at the International Crops Research Institute
for Semi Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). However, land, climate, farm enterprise and
social conditions are significantly different between India and Thailand. In
addition in the beginning, without the involvement of Thai research specialists
in the pilot scheme, and because of constraints in communication between OAK and
the Agricultural Land Reform Office (ALRO) and DOA. DOAE and others who should
have been involved, planning for the pilot scheme was delayed. A visit by an
outside consultant pointed out the need for: (a) assignment of full time senior
researchers; (b) experiments to be made simple and involve yes-no questions
rather than developing models; and (c) more use of Thai experience. IDA also
cautioned OAE about plans to make unnecessary investments in equipment, civil
works and processing facilities. The absence of agreement on the implementation
of various recommendations resulted in the decision not to extend the closing
date for this activity beyond 1985. although OAE later revised some activities
and considered results beneficial.
Sustainabilitv
3.36      Project sustainability, defined as the likelihood of a continuing
stream of benefits flowing from the incremental investment made during the
project implementation period, was uncertain at the time of the IDA Credit
closing in December 1988. For the upland component, the special attention given
to the project area began to be scaled down after Credit closure. The Borrower's
PCR draws attention to the adverse sustainability implications of transfer of 50S
of LDD field staff, the shortage of budgetary support to maintain project works,
the uncertainty of institutional responsibilities with regard to extension and
credit, the diffidence of farmer adoption of recomendations and the questions
raised about the soundness of some of the recommendations themselves (para. 110).
To this must be added the difficulties of trying to promote technical and
institutional change among part-time farmers (para. 3.22).
3.37      On the positive side, the access gains of the tracks are likely to
remain and important changes were made in cropping patterns. Follow-up surveys
should be made to confirm the findings of the Land Use Surveys during
implementation, that the shifting cultivation area had been reduced. This would
be & major achievement.   A highly important unresolved issue for project
sustainability in the uplands is the apparent continuation of yield declines
following development. Thie, too, deserves further investigation.
3.38      At  the time of Credit closing the highland  component was not
considered completed and the Thailand and Australian Governments have continued
to support project infrastructure and activities in the nine zones of the project
area and to expand the area to include another 14 zones. The project proved to



- xxvii -
be an effective mechanism for delivery of services and infrastructure to the
hilltribes and involvement of villagers in planning and implementation of
activities, such as revolving funds, has fostered confidence in agency staff.
Despite the various shortcomings the approach evolved by the project appears to
be the most satisfactory available and has been adopted as Government policy for
hilltribe development. Important innovations in cropping patterns have been
introduced. In some instances, at least, the area of shifting cultivation may
have been reduced, but this is difficult to lubstantiate.
3.39      Under standard land use capability classification systems, much of the
highlande is not suitable  for agriculture because of slope,  and project
technology has not demonstrated that this limitation can be overcome.   The
agricultural gains have generally been made on the lower slopes. In this regard,
farmer rejection of expensive terracing and bunding is correct. Giving farmers
permits to farm the lower slopes would legitimize their presence without
guaranteeing that they or others would not continue to use higher slopes and
would make any subsequent land use rationalization even more difficult. On the
other hand, much of the gazetted forest reserve has not had substantial forest
cover for many years and is not likely to in the future, and some rationalization
appears logical.
Economic Performance
3.40        The SAR rate of return at economic prices was estimated at 14% for
the upland agriculture, 12% for highland agriculture and 13% for the forestry
component. The post-project recalculation showed   generally higher rates of
return, though they are not strictly comparable because some of the asesumptions
made are not explicit.   The upland agriculture ERR is recalculated at 12Z
assuming partial adoption of the technology package and 50% assuming full
adoption. For this component it seems reasonable to conclude that the realized
rate of return is above the opportunity cost of capital and probably at least
equal to the appraisal forecast. For the highland component the post-project
rate of return is given as 18%.   This  is considerably higher than that
anticipated mainly bec&use the post-project analysis postulates declining yields
in the without-project situation on the basis of the yield surveys made. For the
forestry component, the rate of return is recalculated as 6% for the woodlote and
15% for the forestry plantation.

3.41        The validity of rates of return for area development projects with
wide variation in soil types, farm practice and inter-year rainfall variation is
always open to question, and the estimates are influenced by assumptions about



- xxviii -
weightings. In this case, project management amassed a strong empirical basis
for assumptions on yields, costs, prices etc., and the methodology used is
correct. The long implementation period would be expected to bring down the
rates of return, but expenditures were also delayed as well as benefits, giving
no net change in the basic return. Except for the small amounts of coffee,
benefits came from improvements in annual crops not requiring a long gestation
period.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
IDA
4.1       At least some of the early difficulties in project implementation are
traceable to vagueness in the project design. This led to delays as agencies
sought to identify specific activities to be carried out. In many respects, the
project as appraised was more a concept or a stratagy than an operational plan
of action based on adequate preparation. Assumptions of how the target group
would react to the project proved superficial.   Design and costing of most
components proved inadequate and a large amount of consultant time was required
to rectify this weakness. In the case of highland agriculture, the SAR provided
for 120 months of consultant time in coffee and general agronomy, whereas a total
of over 500 months has been required in many specialties including rural
sociology.
4.2       Whether the project would have been substantially improved by more or
better preparation is not entirely clear. In the case of access tracks, more
detailed design would definitely have helped implementation. A large part of the
project, though, dealt with some basic changes being promoted among traditional
hilltribes not fully comfortable or familiar with government initiatives. Even
today, the 1989 Socio-Economic Survey reveals hilltribe attitudes ranging from
enthusiastic to hostile to outside programs.
4.3       The upland component, too, seems to have required a little more
knowledge about the target group. The farmer rejection of the terracing and
bunding approach, including use of grass strips, has been clearly established yet
this approach was adopted on the basis of 10 years experience ove, 8,500 ha in
the upland project area.
4.4       Four components, the pilot scheme for rainfed technology development,
monitoring and evaluation, provincial planning and project preparation assistance
were added to the project at a late stage with little preparation and were of
marginal value.
4.5       The Borrower's PCR expresses satisfaction with the 23 supervision
missions. Their technical advice proved helpful, as was the assistance received
in better defining the work program and in preparing the add-on components.
Early in the supervision cycle, missions emphasized the need for implementing
agencies to concentrate on low-cost soil conservation techniques rather than to
persist with the earthworks. The one reservation expressed was the insufficiency
of civil engineering expertise to help with the access track program.



- xxix -
Imnlementing Agencies
4.6       The implementing agencies exhibited enthusiasm and dedication. They
persevered over a long implementation period and where the task was clearly
defined and feasible the job was well done. The resources they required are
generally made available to them on time.   The necessary coordination at the
level above that of individual agencies was weak.  Provision was made for a
Project Executive Committee (PEC) for apex management and coordination between
the MOI, the MOAC and the NESDB.  The PEC never really functioned effectively.
The principals did not meet to resolve inter-agency issues, such as land release
from the forest reserve by the RFD for access tracks being constructed for the
PWD. The secretariat of the PEC was the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE).
which had neither the resources nor the stature needed.
4.7       While better coordination was necessary, there were already in place
suitable mechanisms to improve it substantially. For example, the LDD, DOAE and
the RFD are all in the same Ministry; the MOAC. The programs of the LDD and the
PWD are sufficiently separate to operate independently for the most part beyond
information sharing. The problem of releasing forest reserve for roads and land-
use certificates is not one of coordination but of high level policy. Experience
with inter-agency project coordinating committees, in general, has not been such
as to suggest that adding resources to the OAE would necessarily have led to a
better result.
Consultants
4.8       The consultants have generally performed well and contributed in a
major way to technology development, institution building and project
implementation.   The introduction of crop rotations and soil conservation
measures, as well as general improvements in farming practices, are to a large
extent due to their expertise and adaptive experimentation with local conditions.
Staff of LDD and PWD benefitted from working with the consultants and are able
to train others accordingly.   The consultants were particularly helpful in
further defining details of project content in the early years of implementation.
4.9       Two related observations may be made on the performance of the
technical assistance program.  The first relates to the shortcomings on data
analysis. The consultants introduced a needed empirical approach to development
in the project area. Field trials were established and results recorded, land
use and crop yield surveys were made regularly, and ad hoc reports on special
topics, such as the extension study, were made. The analyses, though, did not
usually go beyond primary processing of data. The failure to follow through on
analysis has rendered much of the data of limited value. Main problems are that
time series are too short to correct for rainfall variability, inconsistency and
irreconcilability of observations, and are of little use in hypothesis testing.
It may be argued that statistical tasks were the responsibility of the monitoring
units in the implementing agencies, supervised by NESDB and evaluated by
Thammasat University - a complicated system that never really functioned.
However,  it  is  disappointing  that  the   volume  of  data  amassed  during
implementation has not been better utilized.



xxzc 
4.10      The second observation concerns an apparent reluctance of the team to
adapt the technology being promoted to field experience, which may be a result
of the above analytical shortcomings.  The core of the conservation farming
package has been bunding, terracing, contour plowing, upland rice-based
rotations, cover crops and double cropping.   The team has had 20 years of
experience with this in at leaet part of the project area. Yet there are still
major professional disagreements with key parts of the strategy, and there is an
obvious problem with farmer acceptance. These problems have been recognized by
project experts for many years, yet the package remains virtually unchanged. For
example, the major project publication, "Thailand Northern Upland Agriculture",
reported in 1985 that field experiment "...results indicate that the present
technique of land clearing and management (clearing and bunding) can lead to a
higher soil loss (than swidden) for a statistically insignificant yield gain"
(pp. 100-101). The runoff tank experimentation begun in 1986 has confirmed these
results, yet the LDD is still persisting with bunding, for which there appears
to be no farmer demand. Other technical assistance reports (Conservation
Villa_es, Pfanner,D. 1985), discuss problems of suitability and acceptability of
double cropping and upland rice rotations in specific locations. It is not clear
why the implications of the team's own findings do not appear to have been
highlighted, followed up and incorporated into a revised development strategy.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
4.11      Proiect Feasibility.   The project, appraised in the late 1970's, was
a variant of the standard Integrated Rural Development Project model being
promoted at that time. Its performance was similar to many in that group (World
Bank Experience With Rural Development, OED, Report No. 6883, 1987). The project
concept and objectives were simple enough, but the resources and mechanisms
provided were not commensurate with those needed to fully achieve the goals. The
problems being addressed by the project were not so much agronomic as social and
institutional, and a five-year implementation period to effect fairly radical
change was not realistic. Incomplete appreciation of the magnitude of the task
was evident in the underpreparation and undercosting of components, which caused
problems for implementation.
4.12      Land Issues.    Land matters proved to be among the most difficult.
The land classification survey was not detailed enough to provide a basis for
delineating and alienating land suitable for farming. This was particularly
troublesome in the highlands. where arable land occurs in small, scattered
pieces, not identifiable by large scale or satellite imagery. Project design
provided for land classification surveys of 172,000 ha in the highlands and
50,000 in the lowlands, to be followed by issuance of 6,500 land-use permits to
highland farmers and an unspecified number of land titles to upland farmers. No
analysis of the practicability, recent experience, procedural difficulties or
legislative adequacy was presented. Land issues are particularly vexing in the
highlands, which is all watershed and generally not suitable for intensive
agriculture. Providing land-use certificates to patches of highland would in no
way restrict poaching, logging, and shifting cultivation in the adjacent forest
reserves (Conservation Forest Area Study, 1991).



- xxxi -
4.13      It is doubtful whether the FD would be willing or able to restrict
customary land use practices. In any case, land-use certificates in areas of long
established customary use in Thailand have not been shown to have a significant
impact on farmers' economic performance (The Implications of Land Reaistration
and Titlina in Thailand, Feder, G. 1988). Regardless of project success in
raising output in the highlands, the population has risen faster than the
carrying capacity of the land, and some provision for populetion outflow together
with establishment of a means to effec.ively protect critical watersheds appears
warranted.
4.14      Beneficiary Environment.  A better understanding of the target groups
would  have  been  advantageous  in  project  preparation  and  subsequent
implementation. To the credit of project management and the agencies, the use
of villager participation in planning and project execution was beneficial in
adjusting project design.   The beneficiary environment of the two groups,
highlanders and uplanders, proved to be so different as to lend support for two
separate projects. Upland farmers appear to be from mainstream Thai society and
use the hills for supplementary cash cropping. Upland development benef'tted
from almost a decade of pre-project experience with technology development.
Hilltribe communities were,  and remain,  to a large extlit isolated both
geographically and socially.   The PCR prepared by the consultants for the
highland component points out that the technical information for highland
development was inadequate at project start-up. Possibly, highland development
should have been restricted to support for preparation of a separate project.
4.15      Suitability of Technology.   The technology package was essentially
that used for similar landforms in Australia, where farmed units were larger than
drainage units, bunds were used for water collection, farmers plowed their own
land on the contour, only slopes below 12X were plowed annually, and shifting
cultivation was not practiced. It proved early on to require adjustment to the
different socio-economic circumstances in Northern Thailand. Project management
appears to have resisted adjusting the package and to have treated low
acceptability as a problem of adoption rates to be increased by more persuasion.
Project benefits from agricultural development have come from simple clearing.
extension, demonstrations, introduction of improved varieties, use of village
revolving funds, and other relatively low cost measures leading to changes in
crop composition and cropping intensity. It seems fair to conclude that the
expenditure of UJS$ 4 million on earth structures added little to these benefits,
and the construction of new structures should be discontinued. Farmers are not
willing to pay for them, but are willing to allow construction at government Cost
since this is accompanied by clearing, stick raking, deep plowing and subsidies
on crop establishment for three years, after which the structures are not
maintained.
4.16      Forestrv.   Village woodlots were unsuccessful because no mechanisms
were in place to restrict supply availability from the forest.   Woodlot
associations were not formed because of weak interest from expected beneficiaries
and the planting achievements were a result of government expenditure. Here
again, the program should have been curtailed earlier. The forest replanting
program was small and of marginal value, highlighting the land use conflicts even
on this small scale. Of more importance for forest protection is the apparent
reduction in swidden area in the uplands following development. if substantiated.

jointly financed with Governments of Australia (US$0.90 million) and United
Kingdom (US$0.34 million). Project implementation was completed in December
1987 and the IDA credit was closed on March 31, 1988, while the Australia's
technical assistance for the highland areas was terminated in June 1988.
2.        Although the PCRs of individual components were prepared by the
implementing agencies, they were not consolidated. This main PCR combining
all components was assembled by the office of the Agricultural Economics (OAE)
of MOAC with assistance from the FAO-World Bank Cooperative Programme (FAO/
CP). The report was based on the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2269-TH); IDA
Credit Agreement dated June 28, 1979; the Bank's Supervision Reports and
reports and working papers and project files; draft PCRs of implementing
agencies and various reports of consultants and the Australian Technical
Teams.
II. Proiect Oriain. Obiective. and Descrintion
Project Origin. Preparation and ApDraisal
3.        The project developed out of discussiona with the Government
initiated by a Bank Forestry Reconnaissance Mission which visited Thailand in
July/August 1975. It was later identified more specifically by a Bank
Forestry/Resettlement Mission in June/July 1976 for which the basic focus of
NADP was established. Subsequent project preparation works were undertaken by
Government's concerned agencies with assistance from FAO/CP which sent teams
to Thailand in February/March 1977, in May/June 1977 and in January/February
1978. A Bank mission visited Thailand in June/July 1978 to appraise the above
project proposals, which included mainly agriculture. forestry and social
infrastructures, and in October 1978 to finalize the new proposals of the
provincial planning and the rainfed pilot operation.
.
4.        The overall objectives and proposals of the project were
technically sound and in line with Government's policy in rural development.
However, objectives and descriptions of some components were not well defined
and formulated. Moreover, physical targets and their phasing for
implementation of all components except the highland forestry component were
too ambitious. The former caused considerable delay in start-up of the



-2-
project and affected the quality of works particularly the provincial
planning, the monitoring and evaluation, the project preparation and the
rainfed pilot operation components. The latter was due to lack of thorough
assessment of the existing capacity of implementing agencies, particularly
trained staff and budget, and the substantial amount of preparatory works
required to be completed before start-up of the project suWhi as land use
survey, selection of project sites, design of civil works. Farmers acceptance
of new technology packages including crop rotations and new crops of coffee
and tea as well as the requirement of intensive extension and training were
other factors which were not incorporated into project design.
Project Objectives and Description
5.        The main objectives of the project were to:
(a) raise the standard of living of ethnic Thai and hilltribe families
by increasing incomes and by providing minimal social services in
upland and highland areas;
(b) expand agricultural production through intensification involving
,the progressive replacement of shifting with stable agriculture;
(c) conserve soil, water and forest resources, with consequence for
agricultural production in the central plain as well as in the
north;
(d) assist Government to establish a system to decentralize central
planning and implementation to provincial level in order to
overcome some of the institutional constraints to rural development
improve coordination of Government activities and ensure that
programs were responsive to the needs of rural people; and
(e) identify and test technology packages for rainfed areas.
6.        The project involved agricultural development in upland areas
(30,000 ha and 750 kms of access tracks), forestry development in uplands
(4,050 ha of village woodlots, agricultural and social development in the
highlands (800 ha of rainfed rice, 1,300 ha of terraced coffee (later reduced
to 800 ha), 1,300 ha of terraced rainfed crops, 80 schools, 32 health posts
and 500 km of access tracks), forestry development in highlands (4,600 ha of
forest rehabilitation, 3,100 ha of village woodlots, 1,730 km of firelines,
345 km of access tracks), strengthening project monitoring and evaluation and
provincial planning, and provision of fund for preparation of high priority
projects for future rural development activities and the rainfed pilot
operation.
7.        Total project cost was estimated at Baht 949 million (US$47.5
million) with external assistance of Baht 524.8 million (US$26.2 million from
IDA and the Governments of Australia and the U.K. The implementation of
individual components was to be carried out independently by line agencies.



-3-
The Project Executive Committee was to be established in MOAC to deal with
policy making and overall project coordination.
III. ImDlementation
A. Overall Implementation
8.        The start-up of all the project components except the highland
forestry was delayed by one year. Implementation actually commenced in 1981.
Initial delays were caused by considerable amount of time taken for
preparatory work (para. 4) and difficulty in defining and preparing objectives
and scope of research works, studies and priority agricultural and rural
development projects. Major problems encountered during implementation were
the cumbersome procedures for tendering. The unauyailability of land for
agricultural and social infrastructural development, lack of adequate
coordination among implementing agencies and farmors interest in and
acceptance of woodlot, tea, coffee, soil conservation and conservational
farming systems as well as changes in the organizational structure (mainly the
Land Development Department (LDD)). Project implementation was, thus,
completed in December 1987, or two years later than the appraisal schedule,
except the monitoring and evaluation, the rainfed pilot operation and the
upland forestry which were completed in 1985. The project preparation
provincial planning and the highland forestry were completed in 1986. Upon
completion, most of the physical targets, with a few exceptions, were achieved
and even exceeded the appraisal estimates (Table 1). Achievements of the
contour banks, the upland woodlots, the field crops, tree crops and access
tracks were between 40 percent and 60 percent below the appraisal estimates.
B. TImplenentation of Individual Components
(a) URpland Agriculture and Forestrv
Agriculture
9.        The main objectives of this component were increasing the income of
the upland farmers through progressive replacement of shifting cultivation and
monoculture of upland rice by stable agriculture, and meantime, introducing
sustainable measures for conservation of soil, water and forest resources.
Project components for achieving these objectives included land development,
research and development of appropriate production technology, land use
management advisory services, socioeconomic surveys and institutional
strengthening with emphasis on staff training.
10.       This component was implemented by the Land Development Department
(LDD). Physical targets were mostly achieved for the various subcomponents
during implementation, with a few exceptions. A number of adjustments,
including lower targets for some of the civil works, were made. While land
clearing targets (30,000 ha) and construction of access tracks (750 km) at
appraisal were achieved and even exceeded (30,850 ha and 933 km respectively).



-4-
The construction of contour banks for erosion control fell short of appraisal
expectations (4406 km vs 7,500 km), mainly due to the time consuming process
of assuring farmers' interest and acceptance and modification of terrace
spacing by adding 25 percent for slope land lower than 5 percent. Soil
conservation measures comprising, mainly, contour banks (60 percent absorption
and 40 percent graded types) and associated works have been constructed for
about 18,000 ha (0.25 km/ha). The concept of grass stripping as was strongly
pursued by IDA mission was not acceptable to farmers, and therefore not
adopted.
11.       Other subcomponents concerned with development work have been
carried out reasonably well. Under the Research and Technology Development
subcomponent, major achievements have been made in introducing suitable
varieties for different crops and cropping patterns based on cereal/legume
rotation in replacement of the pre-project monoculture of upland rice with
declining yields. A mix of crops (corn, peanuts, upland rice and blackbeans)
have been planted in the project area where soil conservation measures have
been adopted.
12.       Technical services to project beneficiaries were concentrated on
land use planning and management, as well as on training of both technicians
and farmers. A total of 24 demonstrations involving upland rice and the
rotation of rice/legumes were conducted in different project sites. Average
yield increases of about 50 percent were reported for rice when cropped in
rotation with mungbeans. In addition to regular field days, a total 41
workshops were organized from 1982 to 1986 in which about 1,700 farmers
representing different areas participated. By 1986, nine "demonstration
villages" were established in four different regions where project recommenda-
tions were tested on a full-village basis. Results were very good in most of
them.
13.       The training of staff was emphasized throughout project
implementation. This included five overseas fellowships for post-graduate
degrees (1 Ph.D. and 4 M.Sc's), as well as three incountry (1 M.Sc. and 2
B.Sc's) financed by the Australian bilateral assistance. Project financed
training activities included 17 overseas study tours and conferences for 57
local technical staff and advisors, as well as many similar ones conducted
locally. The latter included 18 conferences and 57 formal inservice training
workshops.
14.       The socioeconomic activities included baseline survey and studies,
land use and yield monitoring (for 33 sites) and development of feasibility
studies for the follow-up phases.
15.       The adopted criteria and procedures for land selection were
generally appropriate, however, the mission of the already cleared areas in
the lower parts of the upland placed a major constraint on the rate of land
selection for development. Besides, a preparatory period of about two years
appears to be needed prior to the actual development work in order to complete
surveys, mapping, planning and tendering. The time allocation for these pre-
requisites was not sufficient under the project.



-5-
16.       The acceptan.-e by farmers to allocate part of their land to contour
banks was a slow and time consuming effort. A wider range of development
techniques (e.g., possibilities of terracing for upland paddy where
appropriate) should be examined for soil conservation measures.
17.       Maintenance of the contour banks beyond the initial three years of
project responsibility was, and continues to be, a major problem. Farmers
simply have not participated in maintaining the contour banks. With the
termination of project, the LDD is finding it more and more difficult to
obtain sufficient funding for the maintenance work. Various measures (e.g.,
minimum tillage, grass stripping, planting of fruit and other trees, etc.) are
being considered for statilizing the contour banks and therefore reducing the
maintenance requirements.
18.       While supervision and the conduct of the contracts for civil works
were generally satisfactory, however, the costs were too high, and problems
were encountered with regard to authority and responsibility for the work
undertaken in different regions. Appointment of competent engineers with
sufficient authority is essential to prevent similar problems in the future.
19.       Insufficient inter-agency cooperation and coordination was also a
major concern, particularly during the initial years of project
implementation. Attempts in working out practical cooperation with the
Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in the project area did not fully
succeed. The need for better coordination among different agencies for the
implementation of multi-discipline projects cannot be over estimated.
Forestrv
20.       The appraisal document contemplated a separate component for the
development of upland forestry in the project area. This component was to be
implemented by the Royal Forestry Department (RFD). Its main objectives were
to provide the fuelwood and timber requirements (for construction) of the
farming communities, to protect soils that are unsuited to agriculture and to
reduce the pressure on adjacent forests. To achieve these the project was to
establish 90 nurseries (initially 120 were envisaged, but later reduced),
establish 4,500 rai of woodlots, organize 120 woodlot associations and provide
training in planting and management techniques including fire protection and
controlled burning.
21.       At the outset of the project, RFD declined to assume responsibility
for this component on the grounds that the designated areas were generally
outside the forest reserves and too fragmented to enable them to operate
efficiently. Consequently, LDD assumed the responsibility and established a
Woodlot Section for its implementation.
22.       In general, this component did not lend itself to implementation as
expected. The total area planted to the woodlots (mainly Eucalyptus) was
1,432 ha in 5 years (1981-1985) as against the appraisal estimates of 5,400 ha
at full development. The reduced targets were due to the lack of interest and
participation on the part of farmers, who appeared to have, particularly those



-6-
in the higher parts of the uplands, ready access to forests for their fuel and
construction needs. Further, no woodlot associations could be established,
and the component was discontinued prior to the extension of the project in
1985. The current situation is prone to change in the future, as supplies of
wood are becoming more scarce, and greater efforts are being exerted by the
Government in concrolling forest exploitation.
(b) Highland Agriculture, Social Infrastructure and Forestry
Agriculture
23.       The broad objectives of this component were aimed ats  (a) im-
proving the living standards of the hilltribe people; and (b) arresting
degradation of the natural resources of the highlands. These objectives were
to be achieved through: (a) introduction of suitable and sustainable
agriculture to replace the common practice of swidden agriculture (pre-project
situation); (b) provision of social services (health posts, schools and access
tracks) and (c) the integration of hilltribe people into the Thai society
through registration and provision of administrative services.
24.       The Department of Public Welfare (DPW) and RFD were the two
implementing agencies. Physical targets for all aspects of the component
(agriculture, social, and forestry) were achieved and, in most cases, exceeded
those set out at appraisal. As a start, a land classification survey to
define land use, provide a basis for planning and the issuance of land use
permits was completed with considerable delay. Sustainable and replicable
farming systems (upland rice in rotation with legumes) have been developed and
are being applied by farmers. In this connection, paddy development targets
exceeded the appraisal estimates by about 50 percent and incremental
production by 70 percent. Other physical targets were below the appraisal
projections except the water supplies. However, total direct beneficiaries of
the project were 10,340 families compared with 6,500 families estimated at
appraisal.
25.       Though numbers of the small scale irrigation works (weir
construction) were lower, short-falls in coffee planting targets was mainly
due to a somewhat ambitious projections in relation to proven technology and
skills. The successful results which are currently emerging from the initial
planning are expected to expedite the adoption rate by farmers. Some progress
was also achieved in tea production on sloping hills. The fruit tree planting
efforts o a large scale were not well received by farmers due to the higher
priority given to labor and land use for other crops. Emphasis was therefore
shifted to planting trees in home backyards (3 trees per family). In 1986,
seedlings were distributed to 667 families and to a further 3,110 families in
1987. Survival rate is estimated at 80 percent.
26.       The iosuance of land use permits, as envisaged at appraisal, did
not materialize. The reason for this is a lonr standing difference and
continuing confusion in procedural approach between RFD, who is in possession
of land, on the one hand and the LDD and DPW which are on the receiving end,
on the other hand. Of the 230,637 rai (36,902 ha) requested by the LDD for



-7-
the issuance of land use permit by RFD for the 8 zones, only 2,975 rai (476
ha) have been covered by penmit. The overriding reason for this, as pointed
out by RFD, is the inadequacy of the land classification maps prepared by LDD
and DPW. However, it must be pointed out that the RFD and the absence of the
official permits have not prevented the DPW to assign the suitable areas for
agriculture to project beneficiaries based on an informal understanding. The
question of secure tenure has to be settled once and for all if sustainable
development is to be achieved. A recent development involving the National
Security Council for the needed solution should improve the situation.
27.       The project met its targets in satisfying the input requirements
(mainly seed and fertilizers) of the beneficiaries. A total of 25 tons of
seeds and 73 tons of fertilizers were made available to farmers in 1987. No
provision of credit or marketing for production was envisaged at appraisal.
During project implementation, a revolving fund was established in selected
zones and by end 1985, twenty three such funds were operating. Source of
funds was the New Zealand Government. In February 1987, revolving funds
totalling Baht 581,420 were operating in 72 villages with 1,693 members. The
breakdown by commodity were: paddy land development (30) paddy seed (19),
maize seed (18), soybeans development (31), blackbean (14), hillrice (11),
coffee(10) and tea (8). The revolving fund appears to be operating
satisfactorily. It will, however, take some time before operating results are
known.
infrastructure and Social Facilities
28.       Access track construction was completed for 426 km (appraisal
target: 500 km) due to difficulty in obtaining land from RFD. The number of
irrigation weirs constructed was only 41, but covered 2,828 rai, as against
the 160 weirs proposed under appraisal. This was primarily due to the fact
that most of the paddy development was possible with simple diversion
structure, and did not require as many weirs as projected at appraisal.
29.       Assistance for the village water supply commenced in 1982, with the
Australian Government providing the funds. Labor was provided by the
villagers. A total of 117 were completed.
30.       Of the targeted 80 schools, 79 were constructed with a total
enrollment of 2,058 student. By 1987, there was a 134 percent increase in the
literary rate in six zones based on the sample survey of nine villages.
31.       Medical banks were set up in 84 villages serving 2,646 households.
Due to the absence of baseline studies, it is difficult to quantify changes in
the health status of the population.
Forestry
32.       Most of the physical targets set for the highland forestry were
achieved, with very few exceptions, especially for access tracks which were
accomplished to the extent of 83 percent (288 km vs 345 km).  Further, the
construction schedule was delayed considerably and only commenced in year four



of the project (1984) when it should have been completed. Administrative
bottlenecks and complexities in finalizing contracts and engaging consultants
for design and supervision are cited as the main reasons behind the prolonged
delays. RFD believes that the job could have been achieved more rapidly and
efficiently had it been carried out by force account.
33.       The appraisal target of 3,100 ha of woodlot establishment was
achieved 100 percent. as scheduled. Several species (of which six specified,
including Eucalyptus, Arborea, etc.) were planted. Tree survival rates were
good (over 80 percent). However, the major drawback with the woodlots was the
failure in using them for what they were provided. No farmer interest could
be secured, due to easy access to forest sources for their wood requirements.
Some of the woodlots have been established in watershed areas and are,
therefore, not subject to cutting anyway. No continuation of this activity is
planned by the RFD in the near future.
34.       A total of 5,880 ha of plantation was established under the
project's rehabilitation program. The target for the 5-year project period
was 4,600 ha, and the activity was continued for an additional year (1986) for
another 1,280 ha. The main species planted were Penies Kesiva and Gmalina
Arborea accounting for about 70 percent of the areas.
35.       Construction of firelines proceeded as scheduled, and at full
project development it reached 103 percent of the project targets. The lines
were initially 4 meters wide with 2 meters of strips of bare soil in the
middle.  Experience has shown that 4 meter lines were not sufficient for the
purpose, and they were increased to 6-8 meters later. In the strip slope
areas some strips of 20-meters were constructed.
36.       While no systematic surveys were carried out on actual results,
project efforts in forest protection and reduction of shifting cultivation
activities appear to be substantial. Apart from the construction of
firelines, the employment of the hilltribe people for the establishment and
maintenance of plantation and as fire guards helped in providing them with a
regular income. In some project areas (e.g., Mae-Taman) 90 percent of
laborers were from hill tribes. These activities together with the highland
agricultural development efforts have resulted in substantial reduction of
forest destruction through shifting cultivation. No quantitative figures
could, however, be provided.
37.       The project was expected to establish 430 km of boundary lines
between suitable land for agricultural production and forest. This was to be
based on a land classification survey and pegging of boundaries by the LDD.
Unfortunately, the land use survey and mapping by the LDD were delayed and
completed only for the Mae-Taman site in 1982. The other seven sites were
also surveyed and maps of the 1:50,000 scale (landsat maps) were produced.
These maps, while useful for broad planning purposes, could not serve the
purpose for accurate determination of boundary between agricultural land and
forest. However, as pointed out before, the allocation of land for
cultivation purposes has been arranged on an informal basis with DPW and LDD
pending finalization of the needed procedures.



-9-
(c) Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
38.       The purpose of the M&E was to be used as a means to monitor
progress and evaluate impact of the three social and economic subprojects as
well as to identify problems encountered and improve management of subprojects
during implementation. The M&E was to be undertaken by a consultant who would
design M&E systems for the three subprojects and assist the implementing
agencies to utilize the designed M&E.
39.       A M&E Subcommittee was timely appointed by the Project Executive
Committee in July 1979. The Chief of the Project Economic Division (PED) in
NESDB served as Secretariat of the Subcommittee and was responsible for
selection and supervision of consultant. However, due to considerable delay
in the selection and procedural approval of consultant, the Thammasat
University Research Association (TURA) was eventually selected and contract
was signed only in December 1980.
40.       The design of M&E was completed in early 1981 and data were
subsequently collected by TURA's teams and implementing agencies. The first
report came out in late 1981 and its results were discussed in the M&E
Subcommittee and the Project Executive Committee. The designed M&E put
emphasis on monitoring achievement of physical targets and general
implementation problems. However, little effort has been given on how
implementation problems should be overcome or minimized, but suggestions were
made to reduce the physical targets. This created dissatisfaction from all
implementing agencies which regarded such findings as criticisms towards
departmental management. Moreover, the proposed reduction in physical targets
was not accepted by implementing agencies which considered such changes as a
failure to their departments. Thus, the M&E had not been fully utilized as
anticipated. Its use was limited to only some project staff at field levels.
However, despite disagreement from implementing agencies TURA continued its
data collection and produced periodic monitoring reports during 1981-1985.
Simultaneously all implementing agencies had also designed various reporting
systems for their own use.
41.       TURA also conducted base line survey in 1981 and two socio-economic
surveys in 1982 and 1985 which formed the basis for impact evaluation of
subprojects. However, these socio-economic surveys contained only general
information of physinal achievements, implementation problems and few socio-
economic indicators. It failed to evaluate in depth social, financial and
economic impact of individual subprojects as well as replicable models for
planning and management of future similar project activities.
(d) Provincial Planning
42.       The strengthening of provincial planning had been placed highly
important for successful development and implementation of future rural
development programmes. Its purpose was to assist Government to decentralize
planning and implementation activities to provincial Government and to
accelerate rural development. It consisted of three subcomponents: the
evaluation study of provincial planning; preparation of pilot planning



- 10 -
studies; and training. The office of the Under Secretary of the Ministry of
Interior (OUSMI) would administer this component on behalf of the Central
Provincial Development Planning Board (CCDPB). The implementation would be
undertaken by consultants.
43.       Although the Subcommittee for the Provincial Planning was appointed
and the Project Implementation Office was set up in the Personnel Division
(PD) in a timely manner, implementation was seriously delayed. Implementation
started in mid 1981 and completed in mid 1986. Initial delay was caused by
difficulty in the preparation of terms of reference for the above two studies
due to lack of a clearly defined objective and scope at appraisal, and the
considerable amount of time taken between Government and IDA regarding
revision of condition of credit agreement on hiring foreign consultant which
was later changed to local consultant. NIDA was then selected to undertake
the evaluation of provincial planning. The study commenced in August 1981 and
the final report came out in August 1982. The result was found useful. It
identified problems of province in carrying out planning and implementation
includiikg lack of development objectives, trained manpower, budget and
coordination. Recommendations were formulated to strengthen the capability of
the provinces and these were incorporated into the study af provincial pilot
planning.
44.       The study of provincial pilot planning was carried out in 4
pzovinces in the northeast and north. The Thai Group Consulting Firm was
selected for studies in Chiengmai and Roi-Et province while CUSRI and the
Thailand Technological and Scientific Research Institute were selected for
studies in Pichit and Surin provinces respectively. All the studies started
in November 1981 and were completed in December 1982. The outcomes of studies
were satisfactory though some recommendations were too theoretical. The four
studies prepared similar models for provincial planning and implementation but
using different approaches and methodologies including area approach and
mapping techniques, socio-economic survey and macro-economic planning
approaches. All the models with different approaches in planning were
consolidated and manual wac subsequently prepared by PD and approved for use
by provinces as operational guideline during project period.
45.       The training to strengthen capability of province, district and
subdistrict in planning was first conducted at the end of 1981 in Roi-Et
province by utilizing some of the preliminary findings of the base two
studies. However, upon completion of the two technical studies a local
consultant training specialist was recruited and training curricula were
developed and an intensive training programmes were drawn. Difficulty was
experienced in undertaking such an intensive training programme due to
shortage of trainers. During initial period trainers were borrowed from
virious agencies. The project foresaw this shortcoming and has successfully
overcome by undertaking an intensive training for trainers programme for staff
from the four kay ministries involved in rural development at both national
and provincial levels. Throughout project period about 7000 officials were
trained by the project. Moreover, 14 officials from various ministries were
sent for overseas study tours on rural development planning and training.



- 11 -
(e)  Project Preearation
46.       The aim of this component was to assist Government in identifying
and preparing feasibility studies and high priority projects, particularly in
the field of rural development which would involve local Government
participation and benefit rural poor, consultants would be engaged in
conducting these works. Funds would also be used for the analysis of problem
identified under the provincial planning studies.
47.       The PED of NESDB was responsible for preparation of a list of
potential studies and projects, selection and supervision of consultants. The
works actually started in 1981. with one year delay, and were completed in
1987. Initial delays were caused mainly by difficulty in preparing a list of
potential studies and projects, selecting and signing contracts with
consultants. All the selected consultants were university research teams and
quasi-governmental agencies as shown in Table 2. No private consultant firm
was engaged. Submission of potential studies and projects were from mainly
NESDB, universities, the Cabinet, and to a lesser extent from ministries
involved in agricultural and rural development activities. Moet of potential
studies and projects selected were to support NESDB in formulation of the
Fifth and Sixth National Agricultural and Rural Development Plan. A total of
17 studies and projects were prepared during project period, of which 5 were
macro-policy studies, 10 area specific for agricultural, forestry and rural
development projects, one interministerial coordination and data management
and a training course for project preparation and analysis. Only one out of 5
macro-policy studies led to WB's financing for poverty eradication, and few of
area specific development projects led to implementation with external
financing (IFAD and OECF and multilateral donors) such as the agricultural
development in both lower and upper north and the rehabilitation of large
scale natural water resource and the Kula Ronghai in the northeast. The data
management study was partially used to improve the H&E of the National Rural
Development Project.
(f)  Pilot Rainfed Operatiumae
48.       These operations were aimed at testing and demonstrating
sustainable technology for increasing rainfed agricultural production in the
North and Northeast using the techniques developed at ICRISAT, India. These
techniques focus on improved soil/water management under rainfed conditions.
49.       Project implementation was undertaken on two sites, 400 ha (2500
rai) each: Chom Tong in the North and Khon Kaen in the Northeast. Civil
works consisting of the establishment of broadbed and furrow system, contour
bunds, drainage systems, farm ponds and 02 km of access tracks were carried
out with substantial delays and institutional problems involving staff
appointment and insufficient coordination. Field trails were carried out on
farming systems, fertilizer tests and draught resistant crops (safflower,
chickpeas. etc.). In addition, 10 rai of fruit trees and 450 rai of woodlota
were also established at Chom Tong.



- 12 -
50.       Project site was at Chom Tong surveyed and classified into 8
categories, based on soil type, slope, and drainage. Broadbed and furrow
systems were established in Category 1 soils with 31 slope or less heavy black
soils. Farming (crop/pasture rotation) on category 2 soils with slopes of 3-
72 was experimented with contour bunds for erosion control. Category 3 with
10-20S slopes and high degree of erosion was planted to woodlots or pasture
using some contour bunds and grassed waterway. Other land categories (4-8)
were mainly, allocated to various protection measures and infrastructure
(houses and offices).
51.       Cropping system research in the Khon Kaen site indicated that
improvements in farmer income were possible through replacement of
monocropping of peanuts with safflower and intercropping of peanuts with
cassava. The supplementary irrigation (from ponds) was used for high value
crops such as tomatoes, chili, and papaya. Additional benefits were from fish
production in farm ponds. In Chong Tom. the dominant cash crops were shallot
peanuts and in wet season. Cultivation of salt over has proved quite
successful in recent years.
52.       For soil and water conservation farming system, the results so far
obtained from the pilot operations are not yet finalized and inconclusive to
provide the concrete basis for the full applicability of the ICRISAT
techniques to the rainfed areas of Thailand. Indeed, the project has not yet
convincingly illustrated anything apart from the feasibility of the basic
physical elements of watershed management (BBF's, contour bunds and ponds).
In view of this, additional work should be carried out. Upon completion in
1985 these activities have been continued under Government's regular budget
which is also earmarked up to FY 1991.
(g) Procurement
53.       In recognition of the widely dispersed project sites and the small
amount of works and purchase value of equipment, no international competitive
bidding was contemplated at appraisal. The Government's existing procedures
for local competitive bidding, prudent shopping or force account for
miscellaneous civil works were adopted in the project.
54.       Selection and recruitment of consultants for civil works, studies
project preparation and training and purchase of equipment and vehicle were
undertaken by individual implementing agencies. Equipment, vehicle and
recruitment of consultants were undertaken by the concerned departmental
divisions in Bangkok except for the selection of contractors for DPW's civil
works which were undertaken by the Provincial Hill Tribe Centers. No major
problem was encountered during implementation except some delays and
availability of the qualified contractors for civil works (in the highland
areas).
55.       For recruitment of consultant and procurement, it was experienced
that not all the lowest bidders had adequate capability to undertake the
required works (particularly soil conservation civil works) or supplied the
appropriate equipment and spare parts. The implementing agencies are of the



- 13 -
opinion that the above regulation should provide some flexibility for direct
recruitment or procurement to obtain qualified contractor and appropriate
supplier. Delay in the recruitment of consultant and supplier was due to the
lengthy procedures of both the Government and IDA in the selection and
approval. Delay in the recruitment of contractor for DPW's civil works was
caused mainly by the shortage of qualified contractors due to attempt of DPW
to recruit contractor in each province during initial implementatior. period.
However, this problem was later overcome by the introduction of nation-wide
local bidding.                                                        &
IV. Project Cost and Financing
56.       Total project cost at appraisal was estimated at Baht 949 million
(US$ 47.5 million) over a five-year period, of which external financing was
estimated at Baht 524.8 million (US$ 26.2 million), or 55Z including US$ 25
million from IDA and US$ 0.90 million and US$ 0.34 million from Governments of
Australia and U.K. respectively. Project actual cost over a eight-year period
excluding ADAB assistance for the Upland component, was about Baht 1092
million, or 15 cost overrun compared with the appraisal total project cost.
(See Table 3 Eor comparison between estimated and final costs of project.)
Major factors conitributing to cost overrun included:
(a; the underestimates at appraisal of quantity, unit cost and standard
of civil works;
(b) the substantial increases in training (local and overseas) and
technical assistance requirements;
(c) the increased unit costs of contractor for civil works and studies;
(d) the slightly higher physical achievements of many subcomponents
(see Table 10) except for the upland forestry and the highland
field crop and tree crop expansion subcomponents and access tracks
and;
(e) the increased costs of project management due to the extended
implementation period of 3 years.
Cost overrun would have been much higher if ADAB technical
assistance for the upland was included.
57.       In terms of USs, due to local currency depreciation by about 151
over project implementation period, the actual cost was 45.7 million or 96S
compared with the total appraisal cost estimates of US$ 47.5 million.
58.       Total external financing excluding ADAB assistance for the Upland
was about US$ 27.5 million, or 60S of total project final costs which was
about 51 higher than the appraisal estimates of US$ 26.2 million despite of
the depreciation of local currency. However, due to the reduction of some
physical targets and reallocation of the proceeds of credit, total IDA
financing including the estimated disbursement of about US$ 0.1 million for



- 14 -
DPW building in Chiangmai which is scheduled for completion in September 1
was US$ 21.5 million, or 142 lower than the appraisal estimates. The U.K.
assistance for coffee advisor (190 mm) was about US$ 0.5 million while
assistance from Australia for the highlands increased significantly to about
US$ 5.5 million resulting from the substantial increases in technical
assistance from about 120 man-months at appraisal to about 410 man-months on
the closing date of June 30, 1988. Contribution from Government was about US$
18.2 million, or 152 lower than the appraisal estimates of US$ 21.3 million.
59.       IDA disbursement was slow during initial implementation years due
to delayed implementation of all components. The other factor which further
slowed disbursement was delayed in compilation of project expenditures due to
work loads in the finance divisions of the implementing agencies.
V. Institutional Performance
(a) Overall Project Manautement and Coordination
60.       It was designed at appraisal that the overall project management
and coordination would be the responsibility of the Project Executive
Committee (PEC) which would be established under the project. The
Subcommittees for overall coordination and supervision of individual
components would also be established while implementation would be carried out
by the primary departments.
61.       The PEC and Subcommittees were established prior to commencement of
project in July 1979 (see Appendix A-G). The functions of PEC consisted of
approval of annual plan and budgets, overall project management and
coordination. However, the PEC carried out the above functions partially and
irregularly. Many implementations were left unsolved. The most serious one
was the allocation of land which seriously jeopardized progress of the
development for agriculture and access track. Coordination among implementing
agencies (RFD, LDD and DPW), and between them and the Department of
Agricultural Extension (DOAE) and the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperbtives (BAMC) were weak. The latter seriously hampered sustainability
of project. Two main reasons were the improper structure of PEC and an
absence of a permanent secretariat. PEC was chaired by a Deputy Minister of
MOAC who was overloaded with various ministerial activities. Moreover,
several changes in the Cabinet had also taken place during project period
which affected project implementation. Though the Planning Division of the
Office of the Agricultural Economics (OAE) had been assigned as secretariat of
PEC, it neither had the permanent staff nor the required facilities to perform
the above tasks satisfactorily.
62.       The performance of all the Subcommittees was adequate.  Meetings
were held regularly for approval of annual plan and budget. Coordination for
implementation and monitoring of project activities between project offices in
Bangkok, different regions, provinces, and project units was quite
satisfactory.



- 15 -
(b) Land Develovment De8artmenr (LDD)
63.       Under the initial arrangements, the upland development subproject
was developed on an autonomous basis within the LDD, with its own management
and budget. This was not considered appropriate since it created a double
standard of operation within the LDD and isolated the project staff from the
rest. This situation was corrected later and the project was fully integrated
into the nearstream of the LDD (para. 61). Likewise, the regional sub-
divisions of the project and its infrastructure were merged with those of the
Department, resulting in much more effective operations.
64.       Staff allocation to the project, while initially short of
expectations (104 against 186), reached a total of 256 after the integration
of the project into regular operations. Staff motivation and commitment to
work was generally good.
65.       Operating performance for various project activities including land
development, surveying and planning, woodlot establishment research and
advisory services were generally adequate. There were, however, cases where
the allocated for a given activity was insufficient (e.g. survey and meeting
timetables took precedence over the satisfactory performance). Likewise,
supervision of contractors was insufficient due to unavailability of competent
engineers. Some problems were also experienced due to the lack of
coordination and cooperation from other government departments (e.g. DOAE).
66.       One of the moet notable achievements of the LDD in cooperation with
the Australian management team was the development and publication of a
comprehensive manual entitled, "Thailand Northern Upland Agriculture". This
manual serves as an authoritative and useful reference for technicians,
extentionists and selected farmers on a wide range of subjects related to land
use and management in the upland areas.
67.       In summary, the LDD's performance in implementing the project can
be rated quite satisfactory, with sufficient evidence to its commitment to
continue with the project direction in the future.
(c) Degartment of Public Welfare
68.       The Hilltribe Division (HD) of the DPN had the direct
responsibility for the execution of the Highland Agriculture Component of the
project. In doing so, the HD was assisted by a team of Australian experts
under the project management arrangements.
69.       The overall performance of DPW in implementing the project was
satisfa'ctory. The project initiated development work has been mostly adopted
by the HD as its norms of operation. A large number of staff have gained
experience in planning, implementing and monitoring of project activities. A
nucleus of project management, administration and technical staff exists to
follow on project activities after the termination of external assistance.
Considerable support for the provincial centers and staff training has



- 16 -
resulted in the strengthening of field management practices. The degree of
interdepartmental coordination and head office staff participation in project
activities were also quite satisfactory.
70.       An underlying difficulty arose from the field staff being
responsible to the provincial chiefs rather than to project management. The
interest of the provincial chiefs in project matters varied and on occasion
project staff were not available at crucial periods due to being assigned to
other tasks. The problem was, however, partly remedied through better
coordination between DPW and provincial chiefs.
71.       Difficulties were also experienced with regard to accommodations at
the field level. Field offices were accommodated in temporary structures, and
staff housing was inadequate. A partial solution is expected through the
construction of a regional development center in Chiang Mai.
72.       The most important problem faced by DPW was unavailability of land
for development activities and the non-issuance of land use permits by the
RFD. This is largely a conceptual problem facing RFD on the one hand and LDD
and DPW on the other hand. This has been, and continues to be, a main issue
to be resolved (See para. 26).
(d) Royal Forestry Department (RFD)
73.       RFD performance for the Highland Forestry component was
satisfactory. Most project targets were met as scheduled with the exception
of access tracks and the establishment of agricultural boundary lines (See
Chapter III). Staff allocation fell short of appraisal targets (102 against
138), but this apparently did not affect project implementation.
74.       The main shortfall in the performance of RFD were in two areas:  a)
its refusal to get involved in the forestry development of the upland areas
(See para 21) and b) the non-issuance of the land use permit required by DPW
for the allocation of agricultural land in the Highlands. This issue has been
discussed in sufficient length in the previous chapters (See para 26).
75.       RFD also failed, perhaps not totally by its own fault, to execute
the sub-component for the establishment of the agricultural land boundary in
the forest areas. Much of the blame has been placed on the unavailability and
inaccuracy of the required maps from LDD - the same argument for the non-
issuance of land use permit.
76.       The performance on reforestation and watershed rehabilitation,
establishment of firelines and woodlots has been excellent. The reforestation
schemes have been carried out involving the local hilltribes people for
planting and maintenance. Infrastructure established under the project are
the envy of other departments.



- 17 _
(e) NESDB
77.       The Project Economic Division (PED) of NESDB was responsible for
the implementation of the M&E and the Project Preparation components through
consultants. Although there was delay in the commencement due to some
difficulties in defining and preparing objectives and a list of priority
projects and studies, most of the required studlhs and investment project
preparations were completed and proved to be useful particularly for the
formulation of the Fifth and Sixth Five-Year Social and Economic Development
Plan. The choice of various reputable Government institutions and private
consultants for short-term studies was appropriate. However, the selection of
TURA on a partial participation basis was not the best choice for regular
monitoring works. This considerably affected the quality of work as well as
the acceptance by the implementing agencies.
(f) Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE)
78.       OAE's responsibilities comprised the overall coordination of the
different project components, as well as the administration of the rainfed
pilot operations. On the former, the OAE mostly provided logistical and
administrative support to the various implementing agencies. It had direct
responsibility for project execution through a multi-agency committee, a
project director, a project manager and a project coordinator - all OAE
appointees. Field operations involved 6 departments, each assigned with
responsibilities in line with their mandate.
79.       Institutional performance at the OAE level, as well as at the level
of implementing agencies was less than satisfactory. Delays in budget
allocations and lack of commitment from various participating institutions
created substantial problems. The end results were lack of a coherent and
timely operations leading to inconclusive results (See Chapter III).
(g) MiLiistry of Interior (MOI)
80.       The personnel division (PD) of MOI was responsible for the
implementation of the provincial planning component under the guidance of the
Subcommittee. The overall performance of PD was commendable. It put a lot of
efforts in preparing well defined objectives of the provincial planning
evaluation and the pilot provincial planning studies. The choice of
experienced local consultants was appropriate and saved considerable amount of
time and financial resources. Supervision of consultants and coordination
between PD and consultants and the Central Provincial Development Planning
Board was also satisfactory. The manual for planning, implementation, and
supervision of rural development activities of province, district and
subdistrict, based on findings and recommendations of consultant's studies,
was also prepared by PD and it was approved for operational guidelines during
project implementation. Finally, it had initiated a training program for
trainers from key ministries involved in rural development to overcome the
shortage of trainers.



- 18
(h)  The Australian Technical Teams
81.       The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB)
provided substantial technical assistance to the two major agricultural
components of the pro)ject (upland and highland development) for the entire
period of the project (6 years). Specialists were provided in different
fields on a long and short term basis, the total of which varied during
different stages of the project. The total man/month provided for the
highland component was 410, including a team leader (69 m/m).
82.       The performance of the technical assistance teams was quite
satisfactory. In addition to providing direct assistance in the
implementation of the project, they were instrumental in introducing and
pursuing a number of technical innovations in farming systems. They were well
integrated with their local counterparts, and their contribution to the
achievements of the project was quite substantial.
(i) Co-Financier
83.       The performance of both ADAB and the Overseas Development
Associatipn (ODA) was adequate. ADAB was flexible in adjusting assistance in
line with needs and the revised targets for both the upland and highland
agricultural and social development activities. ADAB has eventually and
considerably enlarged its assistance for technical assiLtance, particularly
research, extension and training. It also financed the construction of
village water supplies in the highland areas. In recognition of the
importance of agricultural and social development in the highland, ADAB
continues to provide assistance to sustain the activities completed in NADPI
and expand into new areas under phase II in the next five years (para 107).
84.       ODA had also been instrumental in providing technical assistance
for the development of coffee and tea in the highland. As a result, coffee
and tea productions have been established and nearing production. It is
reported that demand for developmen. of coffee and tea has been increasing.
VI. Impact
(A) Intended ImDact
85.       The main focus of the project was to raise incomes of about 21,500
poor families in the northern region (15,000 upland Thai families and 6,500
hill tribe families). The project would increase agricultural production
through intensification by the progressive replacement of shifting with stable
agriculture in 33,400 ha (30,000 ha in upland and 3,400 ha in highland areas).
A total of 7,150 ha of woodlot would be established to provide fuelwood, and
timber for construction. About 4,600 ha of degraded forest areas would be
rehabilitated for Watershed protection and wood production, and firelines
would be constructed to protect 138,000 ha of natural forest against fire. At
full development, it was estimated that annual incremental production would be
42,600 tons of grains and grain legumes and 2,100,000 m3 of forest products.



- 19 -
86.       The project was also intended to improve the standard of living of
rural poor families through provision of social infrastructures and services
including health, education and better access for communication. The other
secondary benefits included the establishment and improvement of conservation
and management of natural resources, strengthening of rural development
institutions for a greater decentralization in planning and implementation and
finally the testing of technology packages appropriate to raise incomes of
farmers in rainfed areas. The project would also generate significant
employment particularly under the upland and highland agricultural and
forestry development.
(B) Actual Impact
(a)   Agricultural Production
V
(i) Upland Areas
87.       Upland areas orior to project intervention were subject to
monocropping based on swidden cultivation. The project area earmarked for
land development and improvement of farming system comprised about 30,000 ha
(187,500 rai). Agricultural production, without project, would have been
limited to the cultivation of upland rice on roughly 40% of the area, with the
remaining 60X in fallow. Yields would have been low and declining (by more
than 502 for average soils and by 362 for good soils in 5 years).  Therefore,
total production would have amounted to about 16,725 tons of rice at full
development (with a yield average of 223 kg/rai for average and good soils).
88.       Under the project, 30,000 ha have been cleared of which 18,000 ha
have b;en fully developed by levelling and construction of contour banks for
prevention of runoff and soil erosion. The proposed production package
consisted of corn, legumes (peanuts and mungbeans) and upland rice in a 3-year
rotation. Farmers adopting the project cropping system increased their
production and income substantially. Upland rice yields in rotation with
legumes were doubled on good soils, as compared with pre-project situation.
While a substantial niunber of farmers appear to have benefitted from the
project's recommended cropping system, however, reliable data is not available
on the total production after project completion. What is, nevertheless,
clear is the proven feasibility of the land deve' opment and the cropping
technology which have been introduced by the project, and their replicability
in other similar areas.
89.       Farm models have been prepared to illustrate yields, production,
cropping intensity and farm income for the pre-project (same as without
project) situation and with project situation assuming different scenarios.
In all cases, the results are in favor of the with-project situation. With
project situation implies 762 to 90% of area to be utilized as against 342 in
average soils in the without project situation (Tlble 4-6).



- 20 -
(ii) Highland Areas
90.       Agricultural production in the highland areas has shown a marked
improvement with project activities. A significant decline appears to have
taken place in shifting cultivation in favor of stable agriculture. Yields of
principle crops (paddy, hillrice and maize) have increased, and introduction
of legumes (soya and others) and tree crops (mainly coffee and tea) have
substantially improved farmer income.
91.       Paddy production under the project exceeded the appraisal estimates
by over 60Z, with the total area stabilizing around 23,100 rai (3,696 ha) and
a production of 10,765 tons which is expected to rise to 12,312 by 1995.
Paddy development has been associated with a substantial reduction in swidden
cultivation. A survey by the project indicated that 7,525 rai of paddy
developed with project assistance in 1986/87 was correlated with a reduction
of about 30,000 rai of swidden farming, assuming a 3-year cycle and therefore
reduction of 10,000 rai per year. By 1986, 36Z of paddy farmers were also
growing a second crop of soybeans on 31Z of the paddy land - a major
breakthrough by the project. Interest in double cropping of paddy with
soybeans is high and conservative projections point to 50? of all paddy areas
to be double cropped.
92.       Gradual increases are taking place in the production of rainfed
crops (mainly hillrice, maize and wet season legume). While the total area
and production of these crops under the direct influence of the project fell
short of appraisal expectations, however, this short-fall was more than
compensated for by the adoption of project recommendations by other farmers
who did not receive direct project support. It is estimated at full
development that the yield of non-project hillrice fields would be about 132
kg/rai as compared to 239 kg/rai and that with the project 505 kg/rai.
93.       Production of tree crops comprising coffee, tea and fruit trees
have lagged behind appraisal expectations, due to perhaps ambitious planning.
Increased interest is, however, being shown by the highland farmers for these
crops on steep slopes. The initial plantings (635 rai of coffee and 397 rai
of tea) are just beginning to yield and show good potential production.
94.       Project proposed technology package is based on improving the
cropping system by including grain legumes in rotation with hillrice or relay
crops (blackbean) planted with maize. Recommended conservation systems
include contour grass strips, contour line planting, subtle retention and
minimum tillage to reduce runoff and erosion. The adoption rate for various
measures by farmers have varied from area to area, but generally, it has been
slow, due to the difficult social conditions of the highlands.
95.       Crop budgets and farm models are prepared for all project crops for
without and with project situations. Farm models are presented for three
points in time: 1979/82 (being basically pre-project situation), 1987 (with
and without project) and 1995 (with and without project at full development).
Tables 7-11 give the details of yields, area, farm income and other related
information for five different situations.



- 21 -
96.       The annual incremental production of coffee and tea is small. At
full development in 1991, these are estimated at about 152 tons and 240 tons
for coffee and tea respectively.
(b) Forestry Production
97.       A total of 1,432 ha of the upland woodlots, 5,880 ha of
reforestation for protection and 3,100 ha of woodlots in the highland areas
were established under the project. The actual areas of the upland woodlots
were only 352 of the appraisal targets, while the actual areas of the highland
reforestation and woodlots were 1212 and 10OZ of the appraisal targets. Due
to the extremely low survival rate at 502, a lack of maintenance and the
substantially reduced areas of the upland woodlots, the re-estimated
production is 147,405 m3 (about 120,830 m3 fuelvood, 13,410 m3 construction
pole, and 13,165 m3 of sawlogs), or 152 of the total production of about
994,000 m3 estimated at appraisal.
98.       As a result of the high survival rate (estimated at about 80X) and
good maintenance, the mean annual growth of the highland reforestation and
woodlots is re-estimated at about 8.7 m3/ha, or about 242 higher than 7 m3/ha
estimated at appraisal. Based on the higher mean annual growth and the
planted areas, total production is estimated at about 1.6 million m3 (903,000
m3 fuelwood, 589,000 m3 construction poles and 78,000 m3 sawlogs, or 45Z
higher than the appraisal estimates of 1.1 million m3. The above production
excluded additional benefits from fire protection and construction of access
tracks which are difficult to quantify with accuracy.
(c) Miang Tea and Poppy
99.       According to the survey conducted by DPW, the introduction of miang
tea and coffee did not substitute for existing miang tea. Thus, production of
miang tea remains unchanged. Moreover, there were only small areas of poppy
grown in the project areas during implementation.
(d) Other Indirect Benefits
100.      The indirect benefits of the project are improving the quality of
life for highland families through provision of facilities for health,
education, water supply and access track. About 33,700 families have been
benefitting directly and indirectly from the project, of which about 24,600
families (702) are upland Thai farmers and 9,100 families (302) are hilltribe
farmers.
(i) Social Benefits
101.      Several socio-economic indicators based on TURA's baseline survey
in 1901 and final survey in 1985 are discussed briefly below:
(a)  Si6e of Household - There was no major change in the highland
areas where the average size of household is 6 persons. However, due to the



- 22 -
increasing pressure on land, the average size of household in upland areas was
decreased from about 5.3 persons in 1981 to about 4.7 persons in 1985.
(b) Land Tenure - There was no significant change in the upland
areas where the majority of farmers (90Z) cultivate their own land. In the
highl&Ad areas, over 60? of farmers still have no official land title or land
use permit.
tc)  Farm Size   The size of cropped areas in the highland areas
have significantly reduced from about 50 rai in 1981 to about 30 rai in 1985
due to changes from shifting cultivation to stable agriculture. In the upland
areas the size of cropped areas were reduced from about 7 rai for the same
reason stated above (a).
(d) Indebtedness - Changes in status of indebtedness were minimal
in both upland and highland areas. Number of households who were indebted
reduced from 402 in 1981 to 372 in 1985 in the upland areas, but slightly
increased from 25? to 292 during the same period in the highland areas.
Moreover, the increasing expenditures were for non-economic activities such as
religious ceremony, health, etc.
(e) Education - There was significant change in the highland
areas. Numbers of school-age children who have received formal education
increased from 65? in 1981 to 80? in 1985.
(f) Health - Number of households who received medical treatment
from health posts increased considerably and reacned about 80Z in 1985.
(g) Local Participation - Participation of villagers in coimmunity
activities (villages, school and medical banks) has been increasing. Number
of households participating in community activities increased from 50X in 1981
to 70X in 1985.
(ii) Employment
102.      Employment generated under the project is significant.  During
implementation period employment was generated mainly from project civil works
including soil conservation works, access tracks, the reforestation and the
establishment of woodlots. Moreover, about 70? of laborers currently employed
by RFD in the project area are hilltribe people. A bulk of employment was
also generated through crop intensification and the Improved cultural
practices.
e) Environmental Impact
103.      Impact on the enviroranent is reported to be significant and
favorable. It reduced soil erosion and degradation, siltation downstream and
forest encroachment. Although it is difficult to measure the above impact,
some parameters for quantifying the avoided losses and cost saving, based on
the recent LDD's survey and research findings, have been established. Under



- 23 -
the continuous cropping soil losses are estimated to range from 70 tons to 250
tons depending on soil type and slope. Exploitative use of the upland soil
leads to soil degradation (depletion of organic matter and physical changes)
resulting in reduction of production. For example, rice yield due to soil
degradation declines about 502 over three years and about 67X over five years.
The annual sedimentation of 9.3 million m3 in Phumipol Dam and of 10.55
million m3 in Sirikit Dam are estimated each at 0.06Z of the total storage. A
similar argument applies to depletion of hydro-electric capacity. A decrease
in storage capacity means less water available for hydro-electricity.
Degradation of drainage and consequent flooding are caused by sedimentation
and degradation of river. In Chiangmai about B 1-2 million were spent in 1985
and 1986 for dredging and removing sediments. The Harbour Authority of
Thailand spent about B 420 million annually to dredge about 19 million m3 of
sediments deposited in the first 18 km of the Chao Phaya River in order to
maintain the channel for navigation. The arrangements for stabilizing
agriculture under DPW's program and for employing hilltribe people for
laborers under RFD's reforestation program have considerably reduced shifting
cultivation and forest encroachment.
f) Farm Incomes
104.      The estimated farm incomes in the pre-project, without project and
with project situations based on the upland and highland indicative farm
models are presented in Tables 4-11. Farm budgets are given in Tables 4-6 and
12-18. The estimated net annual incomes are summarized below:

105.      The average annual net incomes per family in the with project
situation (WP) range from B.3445 for the land development alone and B.4625 for
the land development and conservation farming in the upland agriculture to
B.13745 for the highland agriculture, or between 70Z and 1001 higher than
those in the without project situation. The estimated incremental annual net
incomes range between B.1405 and B.7100, or the incremental per capita income
betwe( B.280 and B.1180 based on the average family size of about 5 persons
and 6 persons in the upland and highland areas respectively.

g) Economic Re-evaluation
106.      The economic re-evaluation has been undertaken for the components
of the highland agriculture, the urland forestry and highland forestry. Due
to lack of adequate information on total benefitted areas and adoption rates
in the upland areas, the analysis has been undertaken for the indicative farm
model basis. The analysis was carried out in 1988 constant price. The actual
project costs of individual components were restated in 1988 constant prices
by using the wholesale price index indicators. The foreign exchange cost was
expressed in local currency value at the prevailing official exchange rate of
US$l = Baht 25.5. The local costs and all the non-traded goods and services
were converted into border prices by using the standard conversion factor
(SCF) of 0.92. Specific conversion factors (CF) for civil works and
transportation of 0.88 and 0.87 respectively were also used in the analysis.
The prevailing market wage rates of unskilled labor at 35/md in the highland
and upland areas has been assumed to reflect the opportunity cost of labor.
The economic wage rate has been based on the above market rate adjusted by SCF
of 0.92. For the traded commodities, the World Bank's Commodity Price
Forecasts for 1995 in 1988 constant value have been used as shown in Table 19.
A summary of economic price of outputs and inputs is presented in Table 20.
107.      Cost and benefit streams of individual components and the two
indicative farm models in the uplands are presented in Tables 21-24 and 27.
The re-estimated economic rates of return (ERR) are, except the upland
woodlot, acceptable and favorable which range from 122 and over 50Z for the
two upland agricultural farm models, 282 for the highland agriculture
component. The ERR of the upland woodlot is re-estimated at 6Z.
VII. Sustainability
108.      Among the three agricultural, social infrastructural and forestry
development components, the highland agriculture and social infrastructure
component has been sustained and expended with assistance from the Government
of Australia. Activities similar to phase I and technical assistance would be
expended to 14 new zones and funds would also be provided for sustaining the
completed infrastructures, extension and training in 9 zones under the phase
I. Total project cost for phase II is estimated at about Baht 357 million
(USS 14 million), of which 50% would be financed by Australia. The project is
scheduled to commence in PY 1988/89 for a period of five years. In addition,
under the phase I the project has successfully introduced a revolving fund
system to many villages under which funds would be lent to farmers for cash
inputs (para 27). The medical banks were also established to sustain medical
supply. It was reported that the system has been operating satisfactorily.
109.      The infrastructures and plantations established under the highland
forestry component have been maintained under the regular budget at adequate
level. RFD has also continued its normal reforestation programs in the
watershed areas throughout the country including the NADP areas. The annual
reforestation target of RFD is about 24,000 ha.



- 25 -
110.      The upland agriculture and woodlot posed serious questions
regarding its sustainability. About 50X of staff assigned for project at
provincial and regional offices have already been transferred to other
provinces and regions for implementation of the LDD regular soil conservation
program of about 7,500 ha/year (Baht 200 million) including the village soil
conservation demonstration (30 ha/village). However, at present there is no
budget. provision for maintenance of the completed contour bund. Though it is
reported that the Budget Bureau is currently considering to allocate annual
budget for maintaining part of the completed contour bund, the amount of
annual budget allocation has yet to be fixed. The other issues which need
further consideration are: (i) who should be responsible for maintenance
works of contour Bank (LDD or farmers) and (ii) the possibility to introduce
capital cost sharing system in the long run.
111.      Farmers' adoption of the project recommended crop rotations appears
to be constrained by a lack of regular extension services and credits. During
project implementation period, participation from DOAE and BAAC have been very
little. At present, no agreement between LDD and DOAE and BAAC exists to
provide these services.
112.      After completion of the rainfed pilot operation in 1985, the
operation in the two sites have been sustained under Government's regular
budget which has been earmarked up to FY 1991. However, the current budget
provision is about Baht 1.2 million, or only 25Z of the required amount
reported by OAE. Moreover, participation of LDD has been reduced while there
was little input provided by DOAE and BAAC. OAE and the consultants are of
the opinion that many research findings remain unclear and need further
investigation, thus these operations should continue for longer period (See
para 51).
VIII. IDA Performance
113.      A total of 23 supervision missions (including six missions which
were mounted separately during initial implementation period to supervise
specifically the provincial planning, M&E and project preparation components)
were mounted with an average of eight-month intervals. Mission composition
were generally adequate except for civil engineer whose input was minimal when
project encountered serious problems on contraction of access tracks.
114.      Overall, the performance of IDA was satisfactory.  Missions were
instrumental in providing recommendations to and assisting implementing
agencies to overcome/minimize implementation problems and to achieve the set
objectives and development targets. Missions were successful in directing
implementing agencies to concentrate their priority on low cost soil
conservation technique and simple crop rotations and cultural practices to
ensure farmers' acceptance and sustainability in the long run. The above
recommendations have been adopted by LDD and DPW and have been implemented in
the highland areas. Although missions put a lot of efforts in persuading RFD
to allocate reserve forest areas for development agriculture and access tracks
and to issue land use permit particularly in the highland areas, these two
issues were unresolved during project period and they likely to remain so in



- 26 -
the future . The regulations on reserve forest associated with .pa the recent
regulations on the watershed protection laid out by the National Environmental
Board are the two major causes. Missions also make efforts in persuading DOAE
and BAAC to provide snore participation for supportive services. However, due
to limited staff and budget, participation from these two agencies was very
limited.
IX. Lessons Learned
The following lessons can be drawn:
i)   The start-up of the project was held up by delayed organization
arrangements and a substantial amount of preparation works including land use
survey, site selection, design of civil works and tendering as well as
defining objectives and scope of research works and studies. The assumption
that development works would commence in year 1 was, therefore, not realistic.
ii) Basically, good project design and supervision with sufficient
flexibility for the needed adjustments during implementation, as well as
Government's commitment to the set objective have been the main contributing
factors behind the relative success of the project, with few exceptions.
iii) Land Development and Conservation structures, were well received by
farmers so long as the capital and maintenance costs were met by the project
or by Government. Maintenance of contour banks by the beneficiaries after
project completion proved to be a main problem. Other alternatives or
measures should therefore be explored in the future in order to ensure farmers
compliance with the maintenance requirements.
iv)  Imp3oved land use and management in the rainfed areas of North and
Northeast is crucial for conserving the natural resources in one hand, and
improving the livelihood of the farming opportunities on the other hand.
Project implementation and achievements towards these goals have been, on an
overall basis, successful. The project has successfully introduced land
development and conservation techniques, as well as improved cropping systems
in selected rainfed areas which could be readily replicated in other similar
areas. The rate of uptake by farmers, although quite slow during the initial
periods, is expected to be accelerated given the required continued Government
support.
v)   Virtual failure in the anticipated utilization of woodlots
confirmed the previous experience in other countries. Expectations for the
maintenance and utilization of woodlots in areas where forest sources are
readily accessible are not realistic. Meantime, the problem of land tenure
insecurity places a further limitation on committing the farmers for this type
of development.
vi) The introduction of new crops or new technology package to farmers,
particularly the hilltribe people, proved to be extremely difficult without
intensive extensicn services and training.



- 27 -
vii) Effective measures in transformation of the exploitative swidden
cultivation into a more stable and productive agriculture called for active
participation of the beneficiaries in the process of on-site development
planning and execution. For example, involving hilltribe people as hired
laborers in the establishment of forest plantations and maintenance not only
provided them with an additional source of income, but acted as an educational
measure for the needed forest protection. This was certainly a major lesson
learned through the project.
viii) The choice of the reputable Government institutions, and private
consultants for short-term studies was appropriate. However, the selection of
those institutions on a partial participation basis for regular monitoring was
not the best choice.
ix) The structure of the Project Executive Committee, which was chaired
by a Deputy Minister who was overloaded with various minutia and frequently
replaced due to changes in politics associated with a lack of adequate
secretariat support, limited the functions of the overall project management
and coordination.
x)   While the Government appears to be quite keen to continue with the
project activities as an integral part of its development efforts, however, as
has been experienced in many other projects, the required resources for this
purpose fall substantially short of the actual needs.
xi) The unavailability of land for agricultural and infrastructural
development had drastically delayed and reduced project progress and impact
particularly in the highland areas. Despite strong commitment from the
Government at negotiation (Table 29), it failed to resolve this problem due to
the cumbersome legal procedures for degazetting forest reserve. This was
further complicated by the watershed protection regulation. Therefore,
issuance of land use permits could not be undertaken during project period
except in small areas. Forttuiately, this did not jeopardize the agricultural
development activities significantly. However, it would likely reduce the
rate of development and farmers' acceptance in the long run.

/a   Some farmers now grow a wet season crop to protect seed.  Yield varies
widely but they always get their seed back. The chance of a high yield
gives a chance for a windfall cash gain. The practice also preserves
seed viability over the wet season. A few farmers grow two such wet
season crops sequentially.
/b   Allows purchase of seed 1 year in 3.

La  Based on estimates of the Planning Divisions RFD, by using the appraisal assumptions. However, tahe man
onnual growth over 20 years period Is 8.7 m /ha, or 24% higher than the mean annual growth of 7 a /he/ha
estimated at appraisal.
Lb  Economic atumpage value for fuclwood, pole and sawlog Is given !n Table 28.
The actual project costs were- adjusted Into 1988 constant prices by using the wholesale prlce Index
Indicators during 1980-88 as follow - 116, 106, 104,102,10E,104,10S,108 and 100. For estimates of economic
costa it has been assumed that about 203 was foreign excbtng  co; and 80X was local cost which was further
adjusted by SCF of 0.92.
Cost after year 7 have ben estimated below:
-    Prctection for fire and illcit cutting 65 laborere per tm  x S team  x 880 days x 8 86 per day a
SCF of 0.92
Flrellne maintenance   B 1,600/km/yr for 1,780 km x SCF of 0.92.
-    Maintenance of access tracks a estimted at 10X of Investment costs (e 6,275/kn x CF of 0.88).
-    Administration * Estimated at 20X of the actual costa during project period (3 2.2 miliIon x SCF of
a.92).
-   Plantation mintenance over 6-years period (weeding): a 1,100/ha x 0.92) were Included during years

Dear  Mr. Cuddihy,
This is with reference to your letter dated July 2, 1991 concerning
the draft project completion report prepared during your last follow-up visit to
Thailand.
In general, I ara in concurrence with points which have been discussed
in the paper. However, T would like to add further comments as follows:
1. Development for the hilltribes as provided by DPW involves changes
in the way of living and attitude of human beings which is a painstaking and
time-consuming process. Therefore, it is inappropriate to compare the achievement
our project has made with the one carried out by RFD or LDD which is something
that has to do with such inanimate objects as land and forest. If the report
could clearly provide recommendations for each line agency concerned, it would be
very useful for future   plementation.
2. DPW has introduced proper planning techniques focusing on active
participation from the hilltribes who are mostly less developed, illitirate
and different in both culture and nature of existing problems. Fortunately,
our effort to deal with such difficult task meet with success especially in
the project area.
3. It takes tine for the hilltribes to adopt modern agricultural
techniques.  They often carefully observe the outcome of experimenting new
oractices by nilot farmers prior to actual practice in their own fields.  After
beina accepted, new practices extend very rapidly. Such case also applies to
F     coffee which has been widely grown expecially in these past few years.  As for
contour grass strip, our support is still needed to provide farmers with more
confidence.  Besides, conservation farming practice require more budget than the
normal one which is the reason why additional support is necessary.
4. In order to sustain project activities after the project's phase-out,
DPW has planned and Frepared to provide supporting budget. Besides, we have also
established a regional-level organization with office oeing located in
Chiangmai. Although it is now funded by the Australian government, plan has



7;3
already been worked out in advance to ensure that the hilltribes become
self-reliant in the Iona run throuqh the improvement of organizational
mechanism and village revolvint. funds.
v. I_ is micntioned in tha report that shifting cultivation has been
increasingly found in the project area. The reason is that there are hilltribes
outside project area who wish to have access to government services similar to
the project keneficiaries and, therefore, make an attemp,t to move in. The pro,ect
and involved line agencies have tried to extend their service coverage to those
new arrivals as much as possible although it might need some more time.
Considering the fact that these hilltribes have abandoned their land mostly
destroyed by the traditional slash-and-burn practice, this means forest and
watershed areas to be developed should also be increased.
6. HASD Project funded by the World Bank has contributed significantly
towards highland development.  The project has developed a model which is
practical and widely extendable especially when being a-plied with men and
environment.
Comments from the report or any reconmendations to be further
rrovided would undoubtedly be very useful for DPW's performance focusing on
highland development
Thank you very much for your kind and continued cooperation.

Doar  Kt.Donaldson,
Please  refer to your letter dated September 27, 1991,  asking for  my
comments  on  the  evaluation  report  prepared  by  the  Operations   Evaluation
ospartemnt .
We mostly agree with your comments on the main lesson6 learned through
iiploeentation of the project, particularly, in the context that time should be
allowed for the magnitude of social and instttut1onal change. From our experienoe'
with other similar projects, it is pointed out that a short perlod of time is
infeasible to change attitude of local family.
Regarding the implementation delay anI the long impleaintation period.
It is understandable that time for project preparation should be taken into
account at  the begining ot the project.  It was,  however,  not notified in this
projev*.   In  addition,   it  Is  advised  that  the  project  took  nine  years
of impiementat1on  instead  of  five  years  was  resulted  from  not  only   the
ioplemontation  delay but also the two year project ewpantion.
Please accept my Vrateful thank for your concern In this matter
Your. sinooe'ly,

Dear Mr. Donaldson,
This is with reference to your letter dated September
27, 1991 concerning the project completion report (PCR) for the
Northern Agricultural Development and your welcoming our comments
on the reports.
In general, I am in concur2ence with the conclusion  of
the report. However, I have some remarks for your considerations
as follows:
1. Project achievements were quite satisfactory in
relation to targets. Although some of physical targets such as
woodlots, contour banks,terraces, earthen bunds were not achieved,
but many important targets such as affected farmers, forest
replanted area surpassed the targets. Furthermore, the project
has  performed  as  the  first  step  of  feasible   agricultural
development  in less deve,Loping areas in the upcoming days.  Some
works such as access track and irrigation have facilitated
further agricultural development in the area. Experiences on
technology  transfer  have  been a valuable  lesson  for  further
i)       research and development to be promoted in these areas.
2.    The long implementation period was partly due  to
underestimation  of  difiiculties in  technoliogy  transfer  sincu
target   farmers,  who  used  mostly   traditional   agricultural
technology such as slash-and-burn practice, tended to slowly
adopt modern agricultural technology such as conservation farming
package,  They   often  carefully  observed   the   outcome   of
experimenting modern practice by pilot farmers prior to actual
practice in their own farms. Therefore, in spite of their longer
time consuming and higher expense, developing-model experiments
have still been necessary because they have been able to provide
much more confidence than yes-no question experiments for tgrget
farmers to adopt recommended technology.

3. In term of income effect, the project was successful
in   increasing  agricultural  income  of  target  farmers   with
achieving a narrower gap between their income and northern
farmers' average income. However, in many target areas, farmers
still have less agricultural income than non-agricultural income.
This resulted in low interest of target farmers to accept
recommended cash crops in dry season since the agricultural
income received co.uld not compensate non-agricultural income.
This   should  be  a  lesson  learned  for   othier   agricultural
development projects, research on cropping pattern with less
labor-intensive dry-season crops should be paying attention to
solve such a problem.
4. The implementation of Pilot Rainfed Operations was
new for Thailand at that time. Overseas experiments could be
lessons learned but with caution of some different environment.
It took time for the Operations to experience and solve expected
and unexpected difficulties occurring during implementation that
affected the progress in the early period. However, after 1985,
the Operations have further been implemented as regular work by
focusing on improvement and extension of rainfed cropping pattern
rather than establishment of facilities. Models of rainfed
cropping pattern and soil & water reservation which have been
gradually improved from the Operations have been considered to be
beneficial to farmers and extended to other rainfed areas in the
northarn and northeastern regions of Thailand.
Your continuing cooperation will always be appreciated.
Your sincerely,
