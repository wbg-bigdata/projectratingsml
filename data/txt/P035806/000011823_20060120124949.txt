3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

        The objective of the Agricultural Reform Support Project (ARSP) was "to increase
agricultural productivity in Armenia by supporting the development of private sector farming,
agro-processing, and strengthening of agricultural institutions and services." The intermediate
goals were to "develop a sustainable rural finance system, facilitate access of agro-industrial
enterprises to existing lines of credit, and address key knowledge constraints in agricultural
technology." This was to be achieved by: (a) providing training and consultancy assistance in the
preparation of business plans, (b) developing a network of village credit associations and
providing credit through participating financial institutions (PFIs), and (c) downsizing agricultural
research and extension and increasing their focus on small farmers' needs.

        The development objective reflected critical priorities in the agricultural sector in Armenia
in the wake of Independence. It was consistent with the Government's and the Bank's strategic
approaches in the sector and emerged from a substantial body of prior analytical work and
expertise. In particular, the sector review "Armenia: The Challenge of Reform in the Agricultural
Sector," prepared by the Bank in 1993/94, assessed the status and outcome of the early years of
agricultural and land reform in Armenia and provided policy recommendations for the next phase
of the transition to a market-based agricultural sector led by private enterprise. During the
discussion of this review, the Government of Armenia (GOA) requested financial assistance for
investment activities that would support the policy measures targeted to revive production and
exports. The ARSP was in line with the Bank's lending strategy for Armenia. It was IDA's
second rural sector project in Armenia, following the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (which
became effective in mid-1995), and it built on the experiences gained with this operation.

3.2 Revised Objective:

        The project objectives remained valid throughout the implementation period, but they
were re-phrased after the first supervision mission to make them more specific and monitorable.
As re-stated, the objectives of the project were to: "(a) support the development of private sector
farming and agro-processing; (b) improve and expand credit in the farming sector; and (c)
increase the efficiency of providing agricultural services relating to research, education,
information and extension." Specifically, the project was to provide: (i) loans for working capital
and investments to small rural farms, enterprises and businesses; (ii) agribusiness training and
technical assistance to private agricultural processing and marketing enterprises to assist them in
post-privatization restructuring; and (iii) the initiation of the restructuring of public services in the
agricultural sector by focusing on research and extension involving small farmers.

3.3 Original Components:

        Originally, the project comprised three components:

        · Component 1: Agribusiness Development Center (ADC) ­ designed to address the
            lack of knowledge among agribusiness enterprise managers in post-privatization
            restructuring. The ADC was intended to be the focal point for technical assistance and


                                                   - 2 -

            training to the agro-industrial sector, assisting entrepreneurs and managers in
            upgrading their financial management, strategic planning and marketing skills,
            including the preparation of feasibility studies, business plans and loan applications.

        · Component 2: Credit to Farmers ­ intended to provide increasing access to credit for
            farmers, rural enterprises and businesses and to facilitate the development of a
            sustainable rural finance system. Through a line of credit, it was to provide critical
            access to long-term financial resources for the Agricultural Cooperative Bank of
            Armenia (ACBA) and other Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) which were then
            facing great difficulties in mobilizing medium- and long-term deposits.

        · Component 3: Strengthening of Agricultural Institutions ­ designed to finance critical
            investments needed to make adjustments in key agricultural technology, knowledge
            and information institutions. This component focused on services directly relevant to
            the newly emerging private farmers and included sustained support in the areas of rural
            advisory and information services as well as short-term assistance for research and
            higher agricultural education institutions.

        During the preparation stage the project was envisaged to include also a title registration
component, and PPF funds were used to prepare it, but at negotiations in December 1997 it was
agreed to make this a stand-alone project. The Armenia Title Registration Project (Credit 3135)
was subsequently approved and successfully implemented from 1999 to 2004 (see Implementation
Completion Report No. 28931, dated June 22, 2004).

3.4 Revised Components:

        The need to respond to the severe frost damage of December 2002 led to several changes
in project scope and the de-facto addition of a fourth component, Frost Damage Rehabilitation.
As an immediate emergency response measure, the Bank agreed in early 2003 to reallocate
US$1.3 million of Credit funds for the procurement of fertilizers to help restore the health of trees
and grape vines weakened by the frost. This was followed, in May 2004, by Bank approval of a
Supplemental Credit in the amount of SDR 1.2 million (approximately US$1.75 million) to
restore project funds reallocated to import fertilizers and to provide additional funding for the
rehabilitation of smallholder vineyards and orchards devastated by the frost. At the same time, the
closing date was extended from June 30, 2004, to June 30, 2005. A first extension of the closing
date, from December 31, 2002, to June 30, 2004, had been approved in 2002, in view of the
satisfactory implementation performance and the Government's increasingly strong commitment
to the Project, to allow the completion of the essential project activities.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

        Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project was not subject to a QER or to a QAG
assessment. Project objectives were consistent with the CAS presented to the Bank's Board in
February 1995. The project was to support the overall goal of making the private sector the
engine of growth and of reorienting the role of the state to one of strengthening the general
framework for market development by providing public goods (market information and research



                                                  - 3 -

results), as well as increasing the supply of undersupplied services (agribusiness education and
agribusiness restructuring skills). It also specifically targeted the CAS objective of developing
financial markets in the agricultural sector. Project preparation adequately covered financial,
social and institutional aspects and fiduciary requirements. Key project risks were properly
identified: (i) lack of experience in handling broad based and multidisciplinary projects in Armenia,
(ii) continuation of the economic blockade, (iii) delays in functioning markets and financial
institutions, and (iv) inadequate budgetary resources.

        Issues raised by peer reviewers and management included: (i) ARSP complementarity with
other projects in the lending program; (ii) project complexity and a possible split into two separate
operations; and (iii) using more than one on-lending channel (i.e., ACBA). Links with the then
ongoing Enterprise Development Project (Line-of-Credit operation) and the Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project were highlighted. Reflecting these concerns, the project was eventually
divided into two separate projects, the ARSP and the Title Registration Project (see Section 3.3).
It was also agreed that other commercial banks, in addition to ACBA, should be given the
opportunity to satisfy qualification criteria and access the rural credit line.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

        Project objectives and outputs were substantially achieved, and project outcome is
satisfactory.

        Despite a long delay in project effectiveness and serious delays and shortages in
counterpart financing in 1999-2002, project activities envisaged at appraisal have generally been
implemented successfully (albeit with some delays), performance targets met and objectives
achieved. About 17,500 loans, totaling US$20.2 million have been made to farmers,
agro-processors and rural enterprises, and some 20% of total lending to agriculture from 1998
through 2004 was provided by the project. 678 village-level credit associations have been
established and effectively serve their members, and all 915 villages of the country are now
covered by the agricultural advisory service. Through its continuous and expanding provision of
credit, technical and business advice, and market information to private farmers and agri-business
enterprises, the project successfully supported the development of a post-Soviet private farming
and agro-processing sector and helped spur rapid and sustained growth in agricultural production,
processing and exports and significant gains in rural incomes.

        In the area of supporting the development of private sector farming and agro-processing,
the Agribusiness Development Center (ADC) provided extensive assistance, training and
consultancy services to farmers and agro-industry managers in business planning, financial
management and marketing as well as continuous market information statistics to farmers, traders
and processors. It organized and managed trade fairs to promote Armenian agricultural exports,
and it effectively organized the formation of a national agro-chemical suppliers' association.
Successfully privatized in 2003, the ADC now operates as a private consulting company and
provides its public-good market information service under an annual contract with MOA.




                                                  - 4 -

        The objective of improving and expanding credit in the farming sector was also achieved.
US$20.2 million (including from revolving funds created by reflows) have been on-lent under the
rural credit component. These funds comprised a significant share of overall lending to
agriculture, on average accounting for about one fifth of annual lending to agriculture over the
project lifetime. This injection of liquidity into agriculture and agro-processing had a substantial
positive impact, helping to restore strong growth in grape, tomato and fruit production,
processing and exports. Moreover, it was instrumental in establishing a credit culture and
retail-level credit institutions (credit associations) in the rural areas and in bringing about the
development of direct contractual relationships between processors and thousands of small-scale
primary producers, thereby helping to provide a considerable degree of certainty to both sides
concerning their annual production planning. Although five of the participating banks were
liquidated or restructured during the 2001-2002 banking shake-out, the overall program remained
on track.

        To achieve the third objective, increasing the efficiency of providing agricultural services
relating to research, education, information and extension, a decentralized national extension
system has been established and is providing information and advice to smallholders, farmers are
now directly involved in determining the work priorities of the rural advisory service providers,
and the knowledge management system of the restructured research system was modernized.
Researchers, extension agents and farmers collaborated in a needs-oriented technology assessment
program (TAP), and competitive research grants were provided to help reorient research activities
towards farmers' needs.

        Project-financed activities had a substantial positive impact on agricultural development,
diversification and growth. Agricultural production and producer prices have increased, pulled by
rising demand from the processing industry. Exports of key products such as tomato paste, wine,
cognac, eggs, processed fruits and fruit juices have grown substantially (see Table 4.1).
Smallholders, who in the early post-reform period had focused much of their efforts on
subsistence production, have responded to the opportunities provided by the revival of the
processing industry and the availability of credit by diversifying again into high-value products
(grapes, tomatoes, fruits) and were helped in this by the technical advice provided by the
extension service. The project, thus, contributed significantly to achieving very high agricultural
growth, with crop production growing particularly well (see Table 4.2). The simultaneous
rehabilitation and modernization of the irrigation system, with considerable support under two
other IDA projects, obviously was another essential element contributing to this sectoral revival.

        The sustained and rapid growth in agriculture has been one of the drivers of Armenia's
remarkable overall economic performance, and the growth in agricultural production, processing
and exports led to rising rural incomes, with very positive impact on rural poverty levels. With
well over half of total income in rural households derived from farming activities, growth in
agricultural incomes has been and will remain the key determinant of rural living standards.
Overall rural poverty rates dropped from 48 percent in 1998/99 to 34 percent in 2003, while the
incidence of extreme rural poverty declined from 18 percent to 4.5 percent over the same period.
The project contributed in considerable measure to these positive developments.

4.2 Outputs by components:

4.2.1 Agribusiness Development Center

        This component is rated satisfactory. It was designed to address the lack of business
know-how among agro-industry enterprise managers in the post-Soviet setting. This lacuna was
to be addressed through general and special training courses for managers and entrepreneurs,
specific consulting in preparing business plans and feasibility studies, and the provision of
commercial advice. The Agribusiness Development Center (ADC) was expected to become the
focal point for technical assistance and training to the agro-industrial sector and for establishing
direct linkages with banks participating in various lines of credits. These objectives have been
successfully achieved.

        The ADC was established in February 1999 on the basis of the existing Agricultural
Marketing Enterprise under MOA. In the early years of the project, when adequate knowledge of
business planning and marketing was scarce and the consulting industry in Armenia was nascent,
the ADC played a critical role in filling this gap and providing much needed business advice and
training in financial analysis, strategic planning, and marketing to agro-processors and larger
farms. It also became an important collaborator for other donor-sponsored initiatives, notably
the USDA Marketing Assistance Project (MAP), in support of agri-business development. From
1999 through 2003, it prepared about 175 business plans and feasibility studies, conducted some
150 seminars and presentations and 145 training courses for agro-processors and farms on
management, marketing, financial and investment analysis, and strategic planning. Until 2000, this
assistance was provided free of charge, but from 2001 onward the ADC charged cost-covering
fees for its business consulting services. With the private consulting industry steadily developing
and commercial banks gradually including business planning in the range of services provided to
their clients, this competition led to a decline in the ADC's business planning consultancy work.

        To foster the creation of new and the revival of traditional external trade links, the ADC
also organized, frequently with the assistance of the MAP, the participation of Armenian

processing enterprises at international exhibitions and trade fairs in Russia, China, Latvia, the
USA, etc. The publicity and business contacts thus generated resulted in a number of export
contracts. Starting in 2001, the ADC has been organizing annual food industry fairs
("ArmProdExpo"), regarded in Armenia as major events facilitating agribusiness development and
agricultural and processed food exports.

        The ADC was instrumental in establishing, in 2000, a national agro-input dealers
association ("AgriInput") which was intended to improve the availability of safe and effective
high-quality agro-chemicals and thereby help to eliminate the use of outdated, adulterated and
counterfeit products. The members of the association borrowed, through PFIs, ARSP credit
funds to finance the purchase and import from western companies of pest control chemicals, and
the ADC collaborated with the MASCs to promote their use. Together with the Institute of
Geology and Plant Protection the ADC has organized over 300 seminars, as well as numerous
farmer field days and demonstrations, to promote effective and safe plant protection techniques.
Cooperation with AgriInput continues to be one of the ADC's major activities. Efforts to
replicate this effort for fertilizers have not borne fruit, because of the entrenched market
domination of a state-owned and subsidized fertilizer supplier and the transport difficulties caused
by the blockade. Better prospects exist for veterinary drugs and vaccines, and the ADC is
currently working to establish a dealer association in this field.

        One of the core activities of the ADC has been the collection and dissemination of
essential agricultural and food market information, thereby facilitating the growth of market links,
transparency and efficiency. Through its Center for Market Information Collection and
Dissemination and collaborating closely with the Marz Agricultural Support Centers (MASCs),
data are collected on agricultural production, areas under different crops, yields, agro-inputs used
and/or required, market prices of agricultural products and foodstuffs, etc. Together with data on
external trade, these are compiled and provided twice monthly to processing enterprises, banks
and other interested clients as well as to the MASCs who in turn disseminate this information to
their rural clients.

        The ADC was privatized in October 2003, an example of the successful transformation of
a project-supported governmental entity into a sustainable private operator. It now operates as a
private business consulting company. Under an annual contract with MOA, it continues to
provide an essential public-good service by collecting and widely disseminating market price
information to farmers, traders and processors. In future, this contract is to be awarded annually
on a competitive basis, and the ADC is well placed to win these contracts and continue this work.

4.2.2 Rural Credit

        This component is rated satisfactory. It was designed to improve and expand credit to the
farming and agro-processing sectors. After the collapse of the centralized system for financing
agriculture in the early 1990s, credit to farmers was virtually nonexistent. Commercial banks
provided only short-term loans at very high interest rates, predominantly to trade. In 1995, the
Government decided to establish a cooperative agricultural bank, based on similar models
elsewhere in Europe. The Agricultural Cooperative Bank of Armenia (ACBA) was established in



                                                   - 7 -

1995, with support from the European Union and TACIS technical assistance through Credit
Agricole of France, and was just beginning its operations when identification and preparation for
ARSP started. Its actual lending operations started in May 1996. Initial plans were for the ARSP
credit component to work exclusively with ACBA, but the design was revised at appraisal to
allow other qualifying banks to become PFIs.

         A pilot rural credit operation was initiated during project preparation, funded with
US$650,000 provided to ACBA from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). (The PPF
agreement for US$1.5 million was signed in August 1997.) This amount was fully disbursed by
the end of 1998, and the pilot successfully tested and established essential institutional
infrastructure and operational experience.

         Aggregate Achievements and Impact. The project targets and objectives were
successfully achieved. The project had significant outreach: the total number of loans issued as of
June 30, 2005, was about 17,500, far above the appraisal target of 11,130, and the number of
village credit associations (VAs) established by ACBA has now reached 678, compared with the
target of 450. A total of US$7.4 million of project funds (including funds disbursed from the
PPF) was on-lent by nine PFIs ­ US$4.2 million for short-term seasonal credits to farmers and
US$3.2 million for medium-term credits to agro-processors, with the total number of beneficiaries
of the first round of on-lending reaching more than 4,900. As of June 30, 2005, credit reflows
into the PFI revolving funds had been used for an additional total on-lending of US$11.9 million
in short-term loans and US$0.88 million in medium-term loans (see Table 4.3).

        In total, thus, US$20.2 million of critically needed financial resources were provided to the
agricultural and agro-processing sectors, where production and export volumes continue to grow
at an impressive pace, boosted in part by the liquidity provided through the ARSP credit line.
From 1998 through 2004, the project provided 16 percent of the total resources for agricultural
lending in Armenia, with a peak in 1999 when project funds accounted for more than one fourth
of all lending to agriculture (see Table 4.4). Because Central Bank data do not identify lending
for agro-processors separately and do not include them in statistics on agricultural lending, only
short-term lending under the ARSP (which essentially represents lending for farm activities) is
used here to illustrate the project's importance. Since a sizeable portion of medium-term credit
provided to agro-processors was used by them to pre-finance essential inputs for their contract
growers, the real share of ARSP credit line funds in total lending to farmers was in fact even
higher. Nevertheless, the impact of the project's rural credit program could have been
significantly larger had not five of the eight original PFIs failed during the shake-out of the
Armenian banking industry in 2000-2002 (see pg. 10).

        Average loan size dynamics followed the overall economic trends and conditions
prevailing in 1998-2005, including in the agricultural sector. This is especially evident in the case
of short-term lending. After starting at around US$950 in 1998, the average short-term loan size
declined to US$778 in 2000, as the economy had slowed down, before gradually recovering to
US$971 in 2003 and then rising sharply to US$1,550 in 2005. Increasing average loan size may
indicate improving creditworthiness of small rural borrowers as well as growing confidence of the
PFIs once they get to know their clients better.

        Use of Credit Line Funds. Eight PFIs received funds under the ARSP rural credit line,
and one of them subsequently sold its portfolio to a ninth. The funds made available for rural
lending from the PPF were entirely pre-allocated for ACBA, since its eligibility had been assessed
and established at that time. After project effectiveness, funds were made available to eligible
PFIs on the basis of competitive tenders. This was done with the aim of promoting competition in
the provision of loans to farmers and agro-processors. The main decision criteria for awarding
Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) contracts to bidding PFIs were: (i) the interest rates that the
PFIs intended to charge for sub-loans to ultimate borrowers; (ii) past loan recovery performance;
(iii) availability of branches in rural areas; (iv) number and volume of past loans, (v) credit
procedures; and (vii) deposit creation.

        The first tender was held at the end of 1998, and US$3.5 million were allocated to five
PFIs. In 1999 the Bank reallocated US$2 million from other expenditure categories to the rural
credit component, and two more tenders were held in July and September 2000, when three more



                                                    - 9 -

PFIs joined the project. In total, project funds provided for SLAs totalled US$7.43 million, and
they were fully disbursed by July 2001. Since then, the PFIs have on-lent reflows recycled
through their respective revolving funds established under the SLA conditions. ACBA, the only
cooperative bank among the PFIs, uses a combination of group lending methods based on mutual
responsibility and peer pressure and conventional collateralized lending.

        Participating Financial Institutions. As noted above, eight banks meeting the eligibility
requirements were selected as PFIs through the tendering process. However, five of them failed
during the project period, mainly in 2001-2002 when the Armenian banking sector experienced a
major shake-out and consolidation. Fifteen commercial banks went bankrupt during this time, and
the total number of banks declined from 40 in 1996 to 20 in 2005. Among the factors
contributing to this consolidation were the increase in the required minimum capital to US$5
million and, with the adoption of new banking legislation, the strengthened ability of the Central
Bank of Armenia (CBA) to supervise banks effectively and to intervene if necessary.

        In July 2001, before the extent of the difficulties faced by some PFIs had become
apparent, a supervision mission had tentatively agreed to a further increase in Credit allocations
for the rural credit component, provided that several conditions and provisos concerning
counterpart funding and PFI operations would be satisfied. However, noting that the PFIs'
liquidity situation had become problematic, that three of them were already under CBA
administration or in receivership, that the CBA was not in favor of proceeding, and that GOA had
not satisfied the counterpart funding conditions, the January 2002 mission did not consider it
advisable to allocate additional Credit funds. Based on its recommendation, the tender launched
(somewhat prematurely) in August 2001, but not yet submitted to the Bank for review and
approval, was cancelled. No further Credit funds were provided for this component.

        One of the PFIs, Armenian Development Bank, fully prepaid its subsidiary loan and
withdrew from the project in order to focus on other strategic priority sectors. Another bank,
ArdshinInvest, purchased the assets of ArmAgro Bank, including its US$600,000 portfolio under
the ARSP credit line. This left three active PFIs at the time of project closing. The Ministry of
Finance and Economy is currently collecting the approximately US$1.7 million in loan repayments
outstanding from the five failed PFIs (ArmAgro Bank, Ardshinbank, Credit Service, Credit
Yerevan, Trust Bank).

        Loan Portfolio Composition and Quality; Repayment Performance. The PFIs issued
mostly small short-term loans to farmers for seasonal working capital and small investments, as
rural borrowers were building credit culture and establishing credit history. ACBA is still making
only short-term loans. While the ratio of short-term loans to medium-term loans fluctuated during
the project's lifetime, overall it averaged about 4 to 1 (US$16.2 million vs. US$4.1 million).
Some 46 percent of total lending was for fruits, vegetables and horticulture, 19 percent for cattle
breeding and milk production, 8 percent for wine making, and 6 percent for processing. The
remaining 21 percent was for a variety of different or mixed activities (see Table 4.5).

           Portfolio quality, repayment rates and loan provisioning by each PFI were monitored by
the PIU and the project team throughout. Portfolio quality and repayment rates varied among the
PFIs and at different stages of the project. ACBA consistently had very high repayment rates,
around 97-99 percent. Credit Yerevan Bank was the first bank where portfolio deterioration
became evident, at the time of the project mid-term review in November 2000. At that time, 31.8
percent of its short-term loans extended under the project were overdue. Soon after that, four
more banks also were experiencing serious deterioration of their portfolio. Table 4.6 illustrates
the rise in overdues during 2001-2002.

           Since the closure of the five failed PFIs, the three remaining PFIs have maintained strong
portfolios under the ARSP credit line. The repayment rate by final borrowers is over 97 percent,
and as of June 2005, only 1.2 percent of sub-loans at the three PFIs were overdue.

           Subsidiary Loan Terms and Conditions. All project funds were provided to PFIs as
subsidiary loans from the Government of Armenia (GOA). In total, 17 Subsidiary Loan
Agreements (SLAs) were signed, the last of them in 2000. The SAR envisaged that PFIs would
have the option of borrowing project funds in either US dollars or Armenian Drams (AMD).
Maturities were expected to be 10-15 years. Dollar-denominated subsidiary loans were expected
to be at a floating LIBOR-based interest rate, to be adjusted semi-annually, plus a spread of up to
1.5 percentage points. Interest rates on AMD-denominated borrowings were envisaged to be
fixed on the basis of the average weighted interest rate for 30-day funds auctioned under the CBA
credit auctions. Interest rates on AMD-based subsidiary loans were expected to be adjusted
quarterly. The SAR also stated that interest would be paid semi-annually and the loan principal

would be paid at the end of the loan period. PFIs were not required to contribute to the
sub-loans, as the project financed 100 percent of their disbursements for eligible sub-loans.

        All actual SLAs were denominated in US$ (because of GOA reluctance to bear the
exchange risk), with a maturity of 10 years. The repayment schedules are as envisaged in the
SAR: interest charges are paid semi-annually, principals are due as a lump-sum payment at
maturity. Interest rates vary. The first SLA with ACBA (under the PPF) had a floating interest
rate equal to LIBOR. The first set of SLAs awarded by tender (in 1998) as well as the last set of
SLAs signed in September 2000 had fixed (non-adjustable) 6.5 percent interest rates, roughly
equal to LIBOR at the time. For the SLAs signed in July 2000, a floating interest rate of LIBOR
plus 1 percent was accepted. Positive real interest rates were charged on SLAs throughout
project implementation, equal to or greater than LIBOR. The average SLA interest rate was
generally higher than the inflation rate, except in 1997 and 2003. Lending rates to PFIs were
consistent with the interest rates that other development agencies (IFAD, EBRD, IFC) established
under similar credit line operations in Armenia; interest rates under their programs ranged from
LIBOR + 0% (IFAD rural lending project) to LIBOR + 3.5% (IFC general leasing project).
Table 4.7 shows the SLA interest rate dynamics in comparison with LIBOR and inflation rates.

        Terms and Conditions of On-lending to Ultimate Borrowers. Sub-loans to farmers and
private enterprises in the rural sector were expected to have maturities of up to five years for fixed
investments and working capital, and interest rates charged were to be market determined. The
financial rate of return on proposed sub-projects eligible for credit-line financing was required to
exceed 15 percent in real terms. Sub-projects were expected to demonstrate a collateral coverage
ratio of at least 1.2 over the life of the sub-project. Maximum loan size was expected to be
US$50,000. The currency of the sub-loans was not predetermined.

        In reality, most sub-loans were US$-based, with interest rates ranging from 12 to 24
percent. Despite repeated efforts by the PIU and the Bank's project team to encourage PFIs to
offer sub-loans either in hard currency or in AMD, the banks were reluctant to issue
AMD-denominated loans, citing: (i) problems with predicting future exchange rate movements,
(ii) potentially detrimental effect on borrowers of quoting different interest rates, and (iii) the
peculiar foreign exchange situation of Armenia. While, generally, on-lending in foreign currency
to unhedged borrowers may result in increased vulnerability and credit risk, the situation in
Armenia was not typical because of the high level of "dollarization" of its economy and the high



                                                  - 12 -

volume of remittances from abroad, and these factors mitigated to a certain extent these general
vulnerabilities and risks.

        Interest rates to final borrowers were effectively capped, as GOA insisted that the PFIs
had to maintain the on-lending rates they had proposed as part of their bid submissions. Fixed
interest rates at the original bid level were maintained despite the project team's frequent
reminders that on-lending interest rates should be market-determined. Yet even with these fixed
rates and low margins, on-lending under the ARSP credit line remained profitable for the
remaining PFIs due to their increased operational efficiency. Over the project's life, the PFIs'
margins varied from 5 to 20 percent, depending on the PFI and the terms of the specific SLAs
(see Table 4.7).

        A few modifications to program parameters were agreed to during implementation.
Starting in 2000, on an exceptional basis and with IDA's prior case-by-case approval, waivers of
the maximum size limit for medium-term sub-loans were granted in six cases. The largest actual
sub-loan was US$500,000 for the procurement of grapes. The maximum maturity for short-term
loans, initially limited to 12 month, was subsequently revised to reflect better the actual cash flows
from investments and the life of the typical sub-projects. Similarly, the maximum period for
which reflows could be held in PFI revolving funds without penalty payments becoming due was
increased twice, from initially 45 days to 90 days (in 2000) and then to 120 days (in 2004), to
reflect the actual cycle of ST borrowing by primary producers and reduce the pressure on PFIs to
lend merely to avoid the penalty charges.

4.2.3 Strengthening of Agricultural Institutions

        This component is rated satisfactory. It provided substantial and sustained assistance for
the development of agricultural extension and information institutions that would be responsive to
the changing needs of Armenian agriculture, as well as some immediate investment support for
the restructured agricultural research and education system. Four sets of institutions were to be
aided: the Agricultural Scientific-Technical Policy Council -- or Agricultural Research Council
(ARC) -- and the five reorganized research institutes under the MOA; the Armenian Agricultural
Academy (AAA) and its Agricultural Advisory Service (AgroGitaSpure); the MOA information
service AgroPress; and the Agricultural Support Centers in the regions.

4.2.3.1 Agricultural Research

        Before the project became effective, the country's 14 agricultural research centers were
combined into five by ministerial directive in 1998, and the number of staff members, mainly from
the administrative and support segments, was reduced by 32%. (In 2004 the MOA created a new
research center for biotechnology, which increased the number of research centers to six.) This
restructuring was largely an administrative exercise, with little thought or support given to
stabilizing the new set-up, providing it direction and improving management. Drastic changes in a
long established research system with many senior researchers are difficult to achieve and require
substantial prior consultation and planning as well as sustained attention and support during and
after the restructuring. This was not the case. Although cost reductions were achieved through



                                                 - 13 -

support staff reductions and abandonment of buildings, little was done to align the cadre of
scientists with the changing national research needs, to formulate a meaningful national research
strategy or master plan, to develop a sustainable arrangement for prioritizing research funding, or
to consolidate the system in a few well-equipped locations. Serious efforts to accomplish these
objectives were only made in 2001/02 with substantial technical assistance from the FAO, but had
insufficient local ownership and were not implemented on any meaningful scale.

        The project did not have a direct role in this reorganization, but supported the reorganized
system by financing essential building repairs, furniture, office and laboratory equipment and
subsequently funding priority research activities through a system of competitive research grants.
It also aided the Agricultural Scientific Technical Policy Board (or Agricultural Research Council,
ARC), established in 1997 and comprising representative of all major institutional stakeholders in
agricultural research, by funding a small executive unit ("AgroScience") to facilitate the Council's
prioritizing, coordination, monitoring and evaluation work and to implement its decisions. This
limited assistance was not sufficient to compensate for years of under-funding or for the lack of a
longer-term strategy for this subsector. The ARC met only a few times. Difficult institutional
relations between the AAA and MOA, compounded by the eventual transfer of the AAA to the
Ministry of Science and Education (MSE), complicated matters considerably, so that AgroScience
essentially was limited to managing the project's research grant system. As the AAA and the
MOA research institutes succeeded over time in accessing funding through other donors and
international institutions, attempts by the ARC to set the research agenda became largely futile. A
positive aspect of this was that the paucity of governmental budget support caused the Armenian
research community to develop the capacity to tap into outside funding.

        The competitive research grant scheme funded by the project proved to be essential in
keeping core research functions alive and scientists motivated when budgetary support was barely
enough to cover salaries and facility maintenance. 45 research grants were awarded between
1999 and 2004, for a total of US$745,000. The scheme also introduced a welcome measure of
competition and accountability. However, it never acquired sufficient strategic focus that would
have turned it into the driving force of agricultural research in the country. Program management
could have been more effective in ensuring that activities funded were of significant relevance to
the changing needs of Armenian agriculture and primary producers, and that more attention were
paid to farm-level economics or the institutional, legislative and regulatory parameters influencing
agricultural development.

        The project was instrumental in introducing integrated pest management (IPM) practices
into the Armenian plant protection system, which used to be based mainly on blanket spraying
recommendations without taking into account economic thresholds. Especially in vineyards and
orchards the recommendations have been adopted by the advisory services. A proposal to
establish an IPM laboratory, for which ARSP funds and cofinancing from the USDA Marketing
Assistance Project (MAP) were made available, did not materialize because the AAA and MOA
could not reach agreement on its location. As a result, IPM has not yet found a true institutional
base in Armenia and continues to depend on the personal interest and knowledge of the limited
number of scientists and extension agents trained under the project.

4.2.3.2 Higher Education -- Armenian Agricultural Academy

        The Armenian Agricultural Academy (AAA), created in 1994 by merging the agricultural
and veterinary universities and associating the four agricultural colleges with it, received project
support for upgrading its library, including the purchase of books and journals, the provision of
computer facilities and internet access, and printing facilities. The objective was to improve
access to scientific and technical information for students, teachers and researchers and to
upgrade the capacity to produce educational materials. These investments were made and the
first-generation objectives achieved. In addition, essential repairs were made to the buildings in
which the library, printing house and AgroGitaSpure are housed. 26 scientific books and
handbooks were published and printed with project support. Unfortunately, whereas the
upgraded facilities were intended to be accessible to and serve all research centers, this did not
materialize due to the transfer of the AAA to the Ministry of Science and Education (MSE) in
April 2002. With a simultaneous USDA project as the main provider of support for the
institutional development of the AAA, additional IDA assistance was not needed.

4.2.3.3 Agricultural Advisory Services -- AgroGitaSpure

        AgroGitaSpure, the agricultural extension service established in 1992 under the AAA,
received project support to upgrade its communication and support capacity for the field staff
deployed at the MASCs (see section 4.2.3.6). With the bulk of ARSP assistance targeted at the
field level (i.e., the MASCs), this comprised vehicles, computer and other office equipment,
operating expenses and training. All of this was provided and used to achieve the intended
objective of facilitating effective links between the head office and the MASCs. However, when
the AAA (with AgroGitaSpure) was transferred to MSE, MOA was compelled to establish a new
coordination point, the Republican Agricultural Support Center (see section 4.2.3.5).
Nevertheless, AgroGitaSpure continued to develop training and advisory materials and to
organize field days and other training events for extension agents.

4.2.3.4 Agricultural Information -- AgroPress

        AgroPress was established by MOA in 1996 to lead the effort of disseminating agricultural
information to all relevant clients in the country through print and broadcast media. The project
provided equipment to allow the in-house production of papers, brochures, magazines and TV
and radio broadcasts. One bi-weekly agricultural newspaper (5,000 copies) and two monthly
journals (500 copies each) are published regularly, and 14 topical agricultural technology fact
sheets and a large volume of instructional pamphlets have been published and distributed.

4.2.3.5 Republican Agricultural Support Center

        In August 2002, after the move of the AAA to the Ministry of Science and Education,
MOA decided to combine AgroPress with AgroScience into the new Republican Agricultural
Support Center (RASC). The RASC also assumed the oversight function over the extension
service, previously performed by AgroGitaSpure, and over the market information collection and
dissemination tasks of the ADC in the marzes. This institutional rationalization resulted in better



                                                 - 15 -

support being provided to the MASCs and the field agents as well as in significant cost savings.
The RASC has developed into a competent service provider for the MASCs and MOA. It has
now the capacity to produce television and radio programs, its printing press is functioning, it
maintains the FAO-supported AgroWeb website for Armenia, and it supports the MASCs to
develop their own websites (three are already running), accessible through a portal managed by
the RASC. It also manages a small consultancy fund through which short-term specialists can be
hired to address specific needs that may arise in the course of the year at the MASCs or the
RASC itself.

4.2.3.6 Marz Agricultural Support Centers

         The centerpiece of the Agricultural Institutions component was the extension of the
concept of Marz Agricultural Support Centers (MASCs), started by USDA in 1997 in three
marzes, to all ten marzes in the country. They were to be the institutional focal points for four
support services -- AgroGitaSpure, AgroPress, the ARC, and the ADC -- in the rural areas and
the point where these services would directly interact with their clients. The project funded office
facilities and equipment, staff salaries, training, and operating expenses with the objective of
strengthening the capacity of these four services to carry out their functions.

         Over the project's lifetime the MASCs have developed from being primarily focused on
transferring technology to farmers into service providers in various fields to a broad range of rural
stakeholders (see Section 10, Table 10.1). They have been involved in executing government
planned and financed activities (e.g., promotion of artificial insemination for cattle, or assessment
of frost damage, distribution of 50,000 advisory pamphlets on "Maintenance of orchards and
vineyards damaged by spring frost", national inventory of frost-resistent varieties, etc.). They
cooperate with international organizations such as WFP and UNDP and have developed good
collaboration with the scientists and institutes participating in the TAP program (see below).
Initially somewhat top heavy, the MASCs now have significantly more field staff than
center-based specialists, and even these are now spending more than half of their time working
with farmers. To strengthen client responsiveness, each MASC is supported since 2002 by an
advisory council in which representatives of local governments, farmers and private agri-business
discuss the annual work program and contribute towards setting priorities. Likewise, each field
agent is now aided by an advisory group of 5 to 7 farmers in each village. The MASCs have
begun to cover some (now approaching 20%) of their operating costs through various means:
some have entered into contractual relations with community councils for the provision of
advisory services, others generate revenue through the sale of publications, and some earn income
from the provision of individualized services such as assistance in preparing business plans.

         In 2005, a further refinement was introduced, with a pilot program in 50 rural
communities, to expand outreach capacity by introducing community extension agents. A farmer
survey in three marzes in November 2003 had suggested that farmer-to-farmer advice is the most
frequently used source of advice, that village experts are widely considered an important source of
advice and information, and that willingness to pay for advisory services is positively correlated
with the frequency of contact with an adviser. The new community extension agents are
experienced farmers with some prior formal training in relevant fields (agronomy, animal



                                                  - 16 -

husbandry, horticulture, etc.), residing in the community and willing and able to function as
part-time extension agents within their own community. They are selected jointly by the
community administration and the concerned MASC. They are employees of the community, but
work closely with MASC field staff and receive special training, information materials, etc. The
community administration pays them a small monthly fee (established by the community), and the
project provides a matching grant to the community to help sustain this service. The matching
grant is channeled through the MASCs and amounts to AMD 10,000 per community agent per
month. It is paid to any given community only for the first two years; thereafter it will be the
community's decision whether to continue to employ an agent. The minimum contribution from
the community is AMD 5,000/month, but most pay two or three times this amount. The pilot
program was very successful and popular and is now being extended to the entire country under
the Rural Enterprise and Small-Scale Commercial Agriculture Development Project (RESCAD).

        An important activity funded by the project was the program of small, topical, locally
relevant technology assessment projects (TAPs). Initiated in 2001, it provided a very practical
mechanism for on-farm comparison of current and new farming technologies by farmers,
extension staff and researchers. Individual TAPs are based on specific requests from farmers,
channeled through the MASCs to the research institutes. The program was cofinanced by USDA,
with farmers contributing 20% in labor and material inputs. 717 TAPs were implemented from
2001 through 2004 by 121 different research scientists collaborating with extension agents and
farmers. The TAPs brought the scientists to the farms and produced results that were useful for
farmers and in most instances led to increased income, providing tangible evidence for farmers
that the advisory service is more than not mere talk.

severely damaged about 10,000 ha of vineyards and more than 13,000 ha of orchards in much of
the Ararat Valley. In response to an urgent Government request, IDA agreed to amend the DCA
so as to facilitate the use of US$1.32 million to finance the import of nitrogen and phosphatic
fertilizers for distribution, on a grant basis, to affected smallholders for strengthening and
revitalizing trees and vines not irreparably damaged. The FAO had provided agronomic expertise
which recommended this treatment. A detailed list of affected farmers was prepared in each
community, and farmers operating less than 2 ha were to be allocated 150 kg of urea plus 100 kg
of DAP per hectare affected. 3,480 tons of urea were imported and distributed in 2003, providing
much needed and welcomed help to small farmers whose fruit trees and vines had been damaged.
Due to a poorly managed procurement process, the contracted 2,320 tons of DAP could not be
shipped in time and the order was eventually cancelled by MOA. A new tender for phosphatic
fertilizer (ammophos) was subsequently issued, and this was distributed in May 2004 to the
previously identified smallholder beneficiaries. Although much delayed, it helped restore vitality
to vines and trees weakened by the December 2002 frost and again by a severe frost in April 2004
that destroyed most of that year's apricot blooms.

        While the procurement process was not well managed, the process of compiling the lists
of eligible beneficiaries was very well handled, with direct involvement of the communities
themselves. The distribution to the communities and beneficiaries was also managed very ably.
The impact of this emergency assistance was excellent. Vines and trees responded vigorously to
the treatment, and the thousands of small farmers who benefited from the program enjoyed a
significant production and income effect. The provision of phosphatic fertilizer, for the first time
in 14 years, was much welcomed, and farmers also greatly appreciated the superior impact of urea
(46% nitrogen) compared to the silitra (34% nitrogen) commonly available in the country.

        Grape Vine Seedling and Fruit Tree Sapling Distribution. In response to an October
2003 request by GOA for additional funding to help finance the rehabilitation of smallholder
orchards and vineyards damaged by the 2002 frost, IDA approved a Supplemental Credit for
US$1.75 million equivalent in May 2004 to finance 954,000 grapevine seedlings and 256,000 fruit
tree saplings for the rehabilitation of 367 ha of vineyards and 590 ha of orchards (see Table 4.9)
and the continued operation of the rural extension service, the TAP and IPM programs, and the
market information service until June 2005 (the Closing Date was extended at the same time).

        Unfortunately, the Supplemental Credit did not become effective until late October 2004,
and this greatly delayed the implementation of the program. Only the grape vine seedlings could
be procured that fall and distributed to the beneficiaries identified in the communities. The
contracts for fruit trees were only signed in late November 2004, and distribution to the target
beneficiaries did not take place until the spring of 2005. This was a somewhat disappointing
outcome of an effort that was intended to provide rapid assistance to thousands of small farmers
-- but the 11,700 recipients, all being among the poorer members of their communities, did
eventually receive tangible help to restore part of the capital stock they had lost. On average,
each beneficiary received 245 seedlings under the grape vine program and/or 33 saplings under
the fruit tree program (see Table 4.10). Regrettably, the opportunity to introduce, even on a trial
basis, new frost-resistant grape varieties was not realized, as all contracts were awarded to local
suppliers of traditionally grown varieties. All peach and apricot procurement was also from
domestic sources, but plum and apple varieties were obtained from Ukraine and Moldova. The
total cost of the seedlings and saplings provided to farmers was US$0.86 million.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

        A full economic analysis to determine Net Present Value and Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) was attempted neither at appraisal nor at the ICR stage. However, ERRs were estimated
for the ICR for several specific project activities. Given the absence of significant price
distortions, ERRs would be in line with financial rates of return, and a standard conversion factor
(SCF) of 1.0 was used. ERRs were estimated for replanting of frost-damaged vineyards, for the
fertilizer distribution program (see Annex 3), and for a number of TAPs. Replanting vineyards
was taken as a proxy for the entire seedling and sapling distribution program since grape seedlings
amounted to about 80 percent of the total. The ERR for replanting vineyards is estimated at 38
percent, somewhat higher than estimated during the preparation of the Supplemental Credit. The
estimated ERR for the fertilizer distribution program is 72 percent. Promoting the use of
improved farm technologies through the TAP program also demonstrated high ERRs: a number
of typical TAPs were assessed during the recent preparation of the RESCAD project, and their
ERRs ranged from 24 to 267 percent (RESCAD Project Appraisal Document, Report No.
32351-AM, Annex 9).

4.4 Financial rate of return:

        The project supported a wide variety of activities and a large number of diverse
sub-projects, and an aggregate analysis of the project's costs and benefits was not attempted at
the ICR stage. Financial rates of return for the project activities are in line with economic rates of
return. Under the credit line component, only sub-projects with a financial rate of return
exceeding 15 percent in real terms were eligible for financing. At closing, the credit line had
achieved high repayment rates, confirming that the activities funded were feasible and generated
adequate returns to allow for timely repayments. Consequently, a farm model analysis was not
deemed necessary to reconfirm the viability of investments.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

        Overall, the project had substantial institutional development impact, although not in all
areas envisaged at appraisal. The Agricultural Marketing Enterprise under the MOA was
successfully transformed into an independent, sustainable, private institution, the Agribusiness
Development Center. The project provided essential institutional development support to the
ADC to establish its capacity to meet training and consultancy needs of agro-processors and
farmers in business planning, financial management, and other areas necessary to function
successfully under market conditions.

        The still active PFIs gained valuable experience in agricultural and rural lending and were
able to develop and introduce new products and methodologies, both in short-term and
medium-term lending. The development of a sizeable network of village credit associations has
been a considerable achievement, although this was accomplished with the support of other
donors as well. Supported by the project, ACBA was able to improve and expand its
group-based lending through village associations. The target for establishing VAs was
substantially surpassed, their number now having reached 678, and this has facilitated much
broadened coverage and improved credit access for many previously underserved rural clients.

        The extension system was substantially reorganized and strengthened, with the result of
much improved outreach and effectiveness. A decentralized and strongly client-oriented national
system of service support centers was established, comprising the ten MASCs and the RASC and
operating with some 145 field agents backed by specialists in the MASCs. Each center and each
agent is now backed by an advisory council composed of client representatives. The recent
introduction of community agents, partly funded by the communities themselves, is a further step
towards increased coverage and cost-sharing by clients. The TAP program, jointly implemented
by scientists, extension staff and farmers, has been instrumental in bringing scientists to the farms,
making adaptive research more client-driven, and demonstrating to farmers new varieties, crops
and practices. Integrated pest management (IPM) practices have been introduced, although the
institutional impact has been modest to date as IPM has not yet found a proper institutional base.

        The institutional development impact has been rather less evident in agricultural research
and education. This is due in part to the project's limited objectives and investment in these two
areas, but also to the persistent institutional rivalry between the AAA on the one hand and the
MOA and its research institutes on the other and to the eventual transfer of the AAA to the


                                                   - 20 -

Ministry of Science and Education. Out of necessity, then, the eventual creation of the RASC
was a significant institutional development, representing an appropriate rationalization of
previously separate institutions and providing a central focal and coordination point for several of
MOA's rural support services. Still, the support provided to the AAA was effective in providing a
well-equipped knowledge access system through its upgraded library and the provision of
computer links with the world at large.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

        Several external factors had an impact on the project.

        First, the economic and transport blockade, especially during the early years of project
implementation, had considerable negative impact on external trade, including that in agricultural
inputs and exports and, thus, on agricultural incomes, on the ability of farmers to adopt
input-intensive production methods, and on people's willingness to switch out of subsistence
production. It also affected the state budget, explaining at least partially the serious deficiencies
in counterpart funding for the project in the first several years of implementation. Mechanisms for
transiting goods through Georgia, and to a lesser extent through Iran, were eventually established,
however, and the negative impacts of the blockade thereby considerably mitigated.

        Second, the 1997-1998 Russian crisis seriously affected the overall economic conditions in
Armenia, especially in the agriculture sector, with subsequent effects on the project. The
agricultural GDP growth rate declined to merely 1.3 percent in 1999 and was a negative 2.5
percent in 2000 before rebounding to double digits in 2001 (11.6 percent).

        Third, the shake-out in the Armenian banking sector in 2001-2002 caused five of the eight
PFIs to go into liquidation. Had they continued to operate, and had they averaged the same
gearing ratio for the ARSP funds received as the two non-ACBA PFIs still operating (i.e., 3.01),
the ARSP credit line would have extended about US$24.9 million to Armenia's rural economy by
June 2005 -- some US$4.7 million (or 23%) more than was in fact accomplished. (The ACBA
gearing ratio is excluded here because its lending is exclusively short term.)

        Fourth, the rising inflow of remittances from abroad helped fuel consumption expenditure
and provided a helpful impetus to agricultural production and diversification out of subsistence
crops. Food consumption patterns gradually embraced more variety and higher-value products,
an opportunity seized by the more astute farmers. At the same time rural producers began to have
access to some cash to pay for inputs and small investments, so that the advice provided by the
extension agents found increasingly willing and able adherents.

        Finally, extreme and prolonged frost in late December 2002 severely damaged vines and
trees on about 10,000 ha of vineyards and more than 13,000 ha of orchards in much of the Ararat
Valley. This had a major impact on the agricultural economy and on small owner-operators of
vineyards and orchards in particular, causing Government to request emergency assistance and the
Bank to reallocate project funds and to provide a Supplemental Credit in response.



                                                     - 21 -

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

        Long drawn-out governmental procedures caused lengthy delays in attaining effectiveness
of both the original Credit and the Supplemental Credit. This was particularly problematic in the
case of the frost emergency response program, where IDA's quick response to the Government's
urgent request for help was not matched by equally expeditious government action and farmers
had to endure a long wait before they received their replacement seedlings.

        Until late 2002, the project -- along with the entire IDA project portfolio in Armenia --
experienced serious difficulties in receiving counterpart funding, which caused considerable delays
in payments being made and negatively affected implementation performance in various
components and activities. This problem reflected the Government's fiscal management problems
from 1997 through 2002 and its efforts to deal with poorly performing utilities and state
enterprises and with non-concessional external debt obligations to Russia. Furthermore, tax
administration needed considerable adjustment. Once these problems had been addressed, the
counterpart fund problem for the entire portfolio disappeared. IDA's agreement, in December
2002, to continue financing, with retroactive effect from July 2001 onward, all ARC research
contracts and the operating costs of project institutions at 40 percent, rather than at 20 percent as
originally envisaged, also helped ease GOA's counterpart financing obligations, and from 2002
onward the counterpart contributions were made according to the agreed financing plans.

        The institutional transfer of the Armenian Agricultural Academy (AAA) from the
ministerial oversight of MOA to that of the Ministry of Science and Education (MSE) in 2002
caused project activities targeted at the agricultural extension department (AgroGitaSpure) of the
AAA to lose much of their impact. Although AgroGitaSpure continued to interact with the
MASCs on extension methodology and content and on staff training, this collaboration suffered
from considerable institutional friction because of a persistent failure to agree on the role of
AgroGitaSpure in the evolving national rural extension system. The expectation that the
decentralization of extension activities through the MASCs could be harmoniously combined with
adequate central guidance and oversight by AgroGitaSpure was not fulfilled, especially once the
latter had moved to a different ministry. The differences in institutional vision between the AAA
and its USDA technical assistance team on the one hand and MOA on the other proved virtually
insurmountable -- with the former envisaging a model patterned after the American Land Grant
Universities and the latter a public-good service provider operating under the oversight of MOA.
As the MASCs gained increasing operational autonomy, it proved difficult to reconcile a strong
role in personnel selection and evaluation by AgroGitaSpure, and with the newly established
RASC and MOA's Department of Education, Science and Extension both claiming oversight and
coordination functions for the extension activities of the MASCs, the responsibilities of
AgroGitaSpure became very blurred.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

        Overall, project management was effective. PIU management and staff demonstrated
dedication and professionalism and took proactive positions with regard to issues arising during
implementation. Procurement arrangements, financial management, accounting and auditing, and



                                                    - 22 -

other aspects of project management were handled effectively. There were, however, several
instances where management could have been better, including the following two notable cases:

    (i) Contrary to the SAR provisions, an international rural credit advisor, to assist the PIU in
         examining PFI eligibility and in monitoring credit program, was never recruited. This may
         have contributed to the failure to detect sufficiently early that some PFIs were
         encountering liquidity problems and would eventually have to be shut down.
    (ii) The fertilizer procurement under the frost emergency response program was not handled
         very well. Problems in contract implementation were not addressed effectively and in
         time, and important changes in contract management were neither recorded in contract
         amendments nor communicated to the Bank.

5.4 Costs and financing:

         At appraisal, total project costs were projected at US$19.81 million. Actual project costs,
including the additional activities funded from the Supplemental Credit, were estimated at
US$20.13 million. They were financed by IDA funds totalling US$15.88 million, government
counterpart funds of US$3.62 million, donor cofinancing of US$0.22 million, and farmers' own
contributions to the TAP program, estimated at about US$0.18 million. Both IDA Credits were
almost fully disbursed, with only about SDR 65,000 remaining undisbursed at the Closing Date.

         For several reasons, including the failure to provide adequate cofinancing for salaries and
other operational expenses in the first few project years, GOA's contribution to total project
financing was substantially below the appraisal estimate of US$5.32 million. During the Credit
ratification process Parliament had already insisted on sizeable reductions in investment and
training expenditures for the ADC, and the new Government that took responsibility in 1999
decreed further cuts in expenses that would have required a major local contribution, notably at
the research centers. The long delay in project effectiveness and the decision early on to
emphasize close interaction among the agricultural institutions necessitated significant revisions in
the training and technical assistance program, and the reductions in study tours and TA meant
sizeable reductions in the need for counterpart funds. The USDA-funded Market Assistance
Project (MAP) assumed a 40% share of the cost of the TAP program, thus easing the burden on
Government. Finally, IDA's agreement, in December 2002, to continue financing research grants
and the operating costs of project institutions at 40 percent, rather than to lower its financing to
20 percent as originally envisaged, further reduced the need for Government counterpart funds.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

         Sustainability is rated likely.

         The privatized agro-processing sector in Armenia has overcome the post-reform
slowdown and is now vigorous and internationally competitive, with most of its output being
exported (see Table 4.1). Much business experience has been gained, and the outlook is for
continued strong growth. The ADC itself has successfully diversified its business activities and
achieved financial self-sufficiency and will continue to operate in future as an independent private



                                                 - 23 -

provider of services to agro-processors, farmers, input dealers and other rural businesses. It is
very well qualified to continue managing the country-wide market information service, but it
remains to be seen whether MOA will in fact contract this essential public-good service to the
most qualified bidder on a competitive basis or not.

        The project contributed substantially to the development of credit awareness, knowledge
and skills and to building a credit culture in the rural areas. ACBA in particular expanded its
branch network and its lending to small rural clients, including through the large network of
village credit associations established over the project period, and is in excellent position to
continue to expand its business. The two other remaining PFIs have gained valuable experience in
rural lending and built good-quality portfolios under the project with high repayment rates, and
both are likely to continue successful rural lending in future. The growing profitability of
agro-processing and of primary production supplying the processing industry, combined with the
experience gained by borrowers, portends well for sustained growth in agricultural crediting.

        The MASCs, as institutional focal points for farmer support services, have significantly
expanded their range of activities and their client coverage. They have gained much operational
autonomy, and by involving advisory councils of their clients in work programming have
considerably improved their client orientation and acceptance. This has allowed them to increase
their cost recovery ratio over the past two years to about 20 percent. Partnering with rural
communities in engaging community extension agents is a further step towards expanding client
coverage and simultaneously lowering unit costs; this approach will be substantially expanded
under the RESCAD project. Nevertheless, continued public funding will be needed to ensure that
the essential public-good services managed by the MASCs continue to function, and the
RESCAD project will provide further support aimed at making the system sustainable. Bank
recommendations to change the legal status of the MASCs, so as to permit them to bid for paid
contracts and engage in commercial activities that complement their current services, have not yet
found acceptance in MOA. Such a change would allow the MASCs, especially the more
entrepreneurial ones, to increase revenues and cost recovery ratios and, thus, their financial
sustainability.

        Project support to the research institutions was limited and was neither aimed, nor can it
be said to have contributed much, at bringing about longer-term sustainability of the agricultural
research system. It did, however, provide critically needed funding to keep research going and
researchers motivated when there were virtually no other finances available. The competitive
research grant system provided a new operational framework, and the experience gained with this
approach has been very valuable. Indeed, most research institutes have now developed the
capacity to tap into outside funding from international research organizations. But the research
establishment as such remains in need of real modernization, rationalization, purpose and focus.
Although the number of institutes (and of administrative and support staff ) was reduced, there
has been little perceptible change in their management and operations, and the envisaged
improvement in scientific output through synergy and cost saving have been elusive. In some
sense the institutional consolidation took place merely de jure, while in practice the formerly
independent institutes continue to be located at their original separate sites and to operate as
semi-autonomous units.



                                                 - 24 -

         The investments in upgrading and modernizing some of the knowledge management
facilities (library, computer networks, internet connectivity) at the AAA did have immediate and
longer-term impact and are sustainable, provided the budgetary resources to maintain them are
forthcoming.

         Finally, the orchard and vineyard rehabilitation investments made under the frost damage
rehabilitation program are sustainable, with the smallholder beneficiaries themselves looking after
these investments that for them represent significant long-term income sources.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

         Different transition arrangements for various project components are in place. The ADC
is successfully operating as an independent service provider; its future plans involve, among
others, development of its agricultural and food export promotion line of business, continued
cooperating with the agricultural input dealers association, and possibly replicating this experience
in the seed industry. The remaining PFIs are continuing their on-lending from the revolving funds
created by credit reflows. The first set of subsidiary loans to PFIs will reach maturity in 2008,
when principals will fall due. The new RESCAD project will support the further development of
small rural businesses and agro-processors through enhanced rural financial services and the
promotion of rural business linkages through a program of small grants to introduce and
demonstrate innovations that could improve market access and linkages between producers and
processors. The ADC and the three project PFIs are well-positioned for potential participation in
RESCAD. Further strengthening of the agricultural extension system will be also supported by
RESCAD. Building on the accomplishments achieved under the ARSP, the rural support services
system centered on the MASCs and the RASC will be further strengthened through training and
technical assistance, the implementation of expanded cost recovery mechanisms, and increased
use of cost-sharing agreements with the rural communities. The technology assessment program
(TAP) will be continued on a similar basis as initiated under the ARSP.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

         The Bank's overall performance during identification, preparation and appraisal of the
project was satisfactory. Early progress was very slow. It took 2.5 years to move from
identification (April 1995) to appraisal (October 1997), but submission to the Board for approval
(January 1998) was managed relatively quickly. Contributing to the slow pace of preparation
were: (i) the relative inexperience of the Borrower (the ARSP was only the second WB-financed
rural sector project in Armenia); (ii) the complexity of the original project concept and scope (in
addition to the finally agreed project components, title registration was also envisaged to be
included, but was eventually separated and implemented as a stand-alone project); (iii) the need to
take into account other major donors' evolving plans for support to Armenian agriculture; and (iv)
the differing pace of preparation for various project components. The Bank mobilized substantial
financial resources for the Borrower to help fund preparation activities: a Japanese grant of 55.6
million yen was used between June 1995 and December 1996, and subsequently a Project


                                                  - 25 -

Preparation Facility (PPF) in the amount of US$1.5 million was approved in July 1997 (although
it was not fully utilized).

         The project was consistent with Government and Bank priorities and the CAS. Project
focus and design took into account the findings and recommendations of the 1995 sector review
"Armenia: The Challenge of Reform in the Agricultural Sector", which had identified the most
critical issues then facing the sector. Lessons learned from the pilot phase of the project, which
started during preparation, were adequately reflected in the final project design. The
well-recognized need for capacity building in the banking industry was already being addressed
under a US$3.1 million component of the Enterprise Development Project approved in 1996.

7.2 Supervision:

         The Bank's supervision performance was satisfactory. Supervision missions took place at
intervals of approximately six months, with considerable continuity in team composition (the task
team leader changed only once). Fifteen supervision missions were undertaken during the
seven-year project implementation period, including a mid-term review (MTR) in November
2000. Mission composition in terms of skill mix and expertise was appropriate, with consultants
mobilized for specific needs. Increasing capacity in the Bank's country office was effectively used,
especially in fiduciary management and in ongoing interactions with MOA, the PIU and the
various project institutions. Implementation progress was carefully monitored and appropriately
reported and recorded. At different points in time, several project aspects were rated
unsatisfactory: the provision of counterpart funds was rated unsatisfactory or highly
unsatisfactory much of the time until the end of 2002; the agricultural institutions component was
given unsatisfactory ratings in 2000-2002; and the rural credit component was rated
unsatisfactory during the period when PFI performance was problematic in 2002-2003. These
issues were followed up vigorously until improvements were achieved and the problems
overcome.

         The Bank responded effectively to changing conditions and needs, by providing
implementation assistance as required and by reallocating Credit funds in response to evolving
project circumstances and requirements. Institutional realignments and the growing involvement
of other major donors in the research, education and extension field were effectively dealt with by
adapting the original institutional reform blueprint and adjusting project interventions accordingly.
Reallocations were effected in 1999 and 2002, and again in May 2003 as an immediate response
to the frost damage emergency. This was followed by the provision, in May 2004, of a
Supplemental Credit to replenish funds previously reallocated for fertilizer imports and to provide
funding for the partial replanting of smallholders' orchards and vineyards destroyed by frost. At
the request of Government, IDA also agreed in December 2002 to continue financing research
grants and operating costs at 40 percent for the remainder of the project implementation period,
rather than to lower its financing percentage to 20 percent as originally envisaged.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

         Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.




                                                - 26 -

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

         Borrower performance during the preparation was satisfactory. GOA was highly
committed to the project and stayed closely engaged in the design and preparation process. The
authorities provided competent and experienced counterparts for the Bank's preparation team
who contributed effectively to project preparation. GOA matched its commitment with important
financial support by providing, during the preparation and piloting phase, US$2 million as a
capital contribution to ACBA.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

         The performance of Government during implementation is rated satisfactory. Overall,
GOA was committed and supportive, notwithstanding some problems. Project effectiveness was
delayed by about six months due to complex ratification requirements and procedures in Armenia.
Similar delays were encountered in attaining effectiveness of the Supplemental Credit, which
caused long delays in getting seedlings and saplings to farmers after the destructive frost of
December 2002. During the first years of the project, counterpart funding was provided only
after long delays and fell well short of requirements for effective project implementation, but from
2003 onward this was no longer a problem.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

         The overall performance of the implementing agency is rated satisfactory. MOA
remained fully committed and provided strong and dedicated oversight of the project. The PIU,
which evolved out of the Project Preparation Unit, carried out its coordination and oversight
activities professionally and effectively, notwithstanding some shortcomings (see section 5.3).
Initially unfamiliar with Bank procurement, disbursement and other procedures, the PIU rapidly
acquired full working knowledge of these policies and procedures. Its well qualified management
and staff were diligent and dedicated in their project management and implementation endeavors.
Record-keeping and reporting were timely and accurate, accounts were complete and up-to-date
at all times, procurement was well managed (with the exception of the DAP fertilizer contract),
and audit reports were prepared and submitted in timely fashion.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:


         The Borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

l The need for very careful and hard-nosed assessment of the health of potential PFIs is crucial,
    and is highlighted by the project's experience. With the Armenian banking industry still poorly
    developed and undergoing considerable (and necessary) change, the tender process should
    have included a more detailed prudential examination of the possible PFIs. The need to
    ensure rigorous monitoring in a credit program is equally essential, and the involvement of an
    experienced international expert, as envisaged at appraisal, would have been very helpful at a
    time when such expertise was still scarce in Armenia.



                                                 - 27 -

l The inclusion, at the insistence of GOA, of the proposed interest rate for sub-loans as one of
  the major bid selection criteria led to unduly rigid interpretations at later stages, especially by
  GOA, limiting the PFIs' ability to adjust on-lending terms to changing financial market
  conditions. Establishing a fixed interest rate for some of the SLAs and maintaining it
  unchanged throughout the subsidiary loan period had a similar effect.

l More flexibility should be allowed regarding the terms, maturities and grace periods for
  sub-loans; they should reflect actual cash flows from investments and the economic life time of
  the investment.

l Imposing very short limits, combined with penalty payments, on the time permitted before
  reflows must be on-lent again from revolving funds may have exerted undue pressure on PFIs
  to extend or refinance non-performing loans and/or to make loans merely to avoid the penalty.

l It is essential to have in place an agreed overall strategy and target outcome for the reform of
  a national agricultural knowledge and information system (AKIS), subscribed to by
  Government and donors, and a coordinated approach to its implementation. Without it,
  different actors tend to intervene on the basis of differing policy and strategic objectives,
  causing confusion or even conflict and a suboptimal use of scarce resources.

l Few agricultural scientists schooled exclusively in the collectivist tradition of agriculture are
  equipped to devise solutions for the issues facing small-scale farmers in an evolving market
  economy. The project's research grant system, by funding only university and institute
  researchers, in effect focused mainly on technical issues considered important by these
  individuals, whereas economic and socio-economic problems were hardly considered,
  although Bank missions repeatedly urged more attention on these aspects. The research grant
  system might have been more responsive to these concerns if it had been open also to
  non-governmental institutions and individuals with their different perspectives..

l Financial sustainability of advisory services in a setting with many small and poor farmers can
  only be achieved if Government acknowledges its responsibility to provide these citizens with
  appropriate and effective advice and information to improve their productivity and incomes
  and considers this as a public-good task, even if it is contracted out to private providers. In a
  setting where agriculture is predominantly a smallholder and subsistence activity, farmers are
  still learning how to be farmers and rural incomes are very low, pressing ahead too quickly for
  user-financed extension services is not realistic.

l Institutional development takes time, and especially so in a newly independent transition
  economy attempting to move from central planning to a market economy. A time horizon of
  only four or five years to establish viable service provider institutions is not necessarily
  realistic.

l The experience with the fertilizer distribution to smallholders suggests that one-time
  interventions with a highly visible immediate production and income effect, effectively
  targeted at large numbers of beneficiaries, can be extremely effective in demonstrating the
  benefits of improved technology.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

I. Ministry of Agriculture

                                               Comments
                              On Agricultural Reform Support Project

                                                                                         December 13, 2005

I would like to express my gratitude to WB management and staff for the provided professional support
in ensuring successful completion of agricultural reform project and in implementation report preparation.

Particularly, I would like to remark Mr. M. Lundell's support for project preparation during the first phase
and Mr. G. Schreiber's support in project implementation and effective completion. At the same time I
would like also to thank WB Armenian office staff and all the persons and organizations that provided
professional assistance during the project preparation, implementation, monitoring and completion.

Summing up all the activities carried out within the framework of Agricultural Reform Support Project
(ARSP), I would like to note that privatization of Armenian economy, land and other means of
agricultural production, supporting infrastructures and agricultural production providers and processing
organizations substantially hardened the initiation of market relations in agro food system. The use of
production capacities as well as of production volumes substantially decreased during 1991-1997.
Therefore, it became necessary to make reforms with additional investments and support of international
organizations in order to develop market infrastructures and improve farming traditions. Therefore, it
became possible to start and successfully complete this process due to the signed Development Credit
Agreement (ARSP) between the Republic of Armenia and International Development Association.

The project goals were.
    ·   Support rural collective farms and agro-processing enterprises in resource usage and
        implementation of development projects.
    ·   Increase credit resources of participatory financial institutions of the RA and enlarge credit
        capacities of rural farms and agro-processing enterprises.
    ·   Strengthen scientific-research, educational, informative, extension institutions within the
        agricultural system and increase the efficiency of these infrastructures by structural reforms and
        technical modernization.

The abovementioned objectives were achieved through the components of Agribusiness Development
Center, Subloans and Strengthening of agricultural institutions. Project activities did have positive
impact, outputs, as well as several shortcomings that because of some objective and subjective reasons
were impossible to correct during the reporting period. Realistically assessing the current situation in the
republic, agrarian reforms would be implemented in the future and they would provide firm basis for the
continuation of the process.

However, I would like to pay more detailed attention on several factors that I think still have significant
importance and have to be implemented in the coming future for the insurance of sustainable
development.

1.      Activities implemented within the Subloans component were very positive and had effective
impact on rural farms and enterprises with legal status. About 17,500 loans, totaling US$20.2 million
have been made to farmers, agro-processors and rural enterprises, but it has to be taken into
consideration that the improvements would have been more significant if problems with rural on-lending
and risk insurance were solved completely. Though there is a year-to-year increase of credit resources
provided to agriculture through commercial banks, micro-financing organizations and, partially through



                                                    - 29 -

credit deposits it covers only 8% of the total demand.

2.       It was possible to record some progress in extension, educational and scientific spheres due to
the use of WB purposeful means in a short period of time. As a bright example of it is that it was the very
first time that technologies tested in scientific-research centers were implemented in farms. Cooperating
with USDA MAP 717 projects and 14 demonstrations on the "Implementation and assessment of agrarian
technologies" were implemented.

However, in the sphere of rapidly developing agriculture it is time to prepare a policy that would bring an
opportunity to push the national agrarian science to a new dimension. From this point of view it is
necessary to undertake the following practical steps:
     ·   Resource mobilization in primary research needs. It is more purposeful to use the resources of
         several projects for the needs of one or two significantly important projects which will help to
         make more thorough and detailed research;
     ·   Establishment of a separate fund, inclusion of alternative financing sources and the
         centralization of the existent resources in primary fields for the implementation of
         scientific-research programs;
     ·   Enlargement and cooperation development with foreign agrarian scientific organizations and
         regional scientific centers.
The abovementioned aspects were reflected in "Implementation of advanced agrarian technologies and
development of extension system (2005-2010)" concept note that was approved by the December 30,
2004 RA Government decree.

3.       Currently the agricultural extension system of the RA involves 10 "Agricultural support marz
centers" (MASCs), "Agricultural support republican center" (RASC), Armenian Agricultural University and
"Agrogitaspyur" department that were created within the ARSP scope and functioning under the RA
Ministry of Agriculture.

The RA Government decision N1363-A, dated September 23, 2005 on "Improvement of agricultural
research, extension and information systems with the support of poverty reduction credit project" is
directed toward the improvement of extension and informative systems and growth of rural farm
incomes. On this base a technical work group was created which supports the agricultural modernization
process and growth of rural farm incomes. As a result of it, the prepared strategy would be supportive for
the effective performance of agricultural support republican and marz centers.

In the coming years it would be possible to signify extension activities that would allow to separate
public-oriented extension activities which will be provided free of charge and the clients of which would
permanently be state institutions, particularly RA Ministry of Agriculture. Step by step the extension
system would involve also the system of payments (partially or completely).

4.       During the reporting period were achieved not only the abovementioned goals but also the RA
Government decision N349-A, dated March 27, 2003 on "Frost Damage Rehabilitation Program" was
implemented.

Prehistory of the RA Government decision is in the following. Severe frost during the December-January
of 2002-2003 caused major damage to rural farms. The Government of Armenia requested financial
assistance of the WB for the implementation of planned activities in order to mitigate the situation.

I would like to express my gratitude to WB management that urgently responded and provided RA
Government with Supplemental Credit (1.2 million SDR) in a very short period of time. With the use of
these credit resource it was possible to continue the implementation of activities under ARSP until June
30, 2005. Also, 3,480 tons of urea (first time during the last 15 years) and 2,320 tons of Ammophos were
imported and distributed to farms. As a support to Armenian horticulture development, 954,000
grapevine seedlings and 256,000 fruit tree saplings were financed from Supplemental Credit resources
and distributed free of charge to 11,700 beneficiaries.




                                                      - 30 -

Thus far, significantly important steps were implemented and created an opportunity to diminish the
damage size, which was assessed about US$25 million.

Summarizing, I would like to bring your attention to another aspect also. Parliament of the RA in October
2005 approved new "Rural Enterprise and Small-scale Agricultural Development" credit project that can
be viewed both as a new project, as well as a continuation of the ARSP. Therefore, works done within the
framework of ARSP seem to be guarantors for new project design and implementation. I hope that the
new credit project would also have successful start and completion.
