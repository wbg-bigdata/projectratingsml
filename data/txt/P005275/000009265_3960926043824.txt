SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Introduction
1.01     The Government's energy policy and strategy were reviewed by the
Bank as part of the Energy Sector Study 1/ in February 1983 and during the
preparation of the Energy Development Project (Loan 2371-JO) in 1983 and the
Sixth Power Project (Loan 2710-JO) in 1986.  Subsequent Bank energy missions
have also reviewed the sector strategy with the Government.  Since Jordan is
entirely dependent on imports to meet its commercial energy needs, the policy
is aimed at improving the efficiency with which energy is supplied and
consumed so as to reduce the relative impact of the oil import bill on the
country's balance of payments.
1.02     The Government's strategy focuses on:  (a) efficient use of energy
tlhrough  demand  management,  energy  conservation  and  pricing  measures;
(b) providing economic and diversified energy supplies; (c) adopting pricing
policies that would ensure economic efficiency and financial viability of
energy  sector  entities;  and  (d) improving  sector  management  through:
(i) streamlining responsibility for overall er,ergy policy formulation; and
(ii) strengthening technical capabilities for energy planning consistent with
macro objectives of the economy.  These are being pursued by the Government
under the ongoing Energy Development Project (Loan 2371-JO) and the current
Five-Year Plan.  The following section presents a brief overview of recent
developments in the sector.
Resource Base and Development Prospects
1.03     Jordan's modest energy resources consist of oil shale deposits, some
tar sands, a small hydropower potential (87 GWh per year), and a few low
temperature geothermal sources.  To date, no commercially exploitable coal,
lignite, uranium,  or oil and gas reserves are known to exist.   Although
hydrocarbon structures have been found to exist in a number of areas where
geological surveys have been carried out, drilling results up to date have
been rather disappointing.  Recent discoveries in the Hamza field indicate
potential production levels o, 700 barrels per day compared to Jordan's
present requirement of crude oil of about 60,000 barrels/day.
1.04     Unless Jordan discovers oil or gas  in commercial quantities, the
prospects of indigeneous energy supply appears bleak in the foreseeable
future.   Preliminary  efforts  undertaken  jointly by  the Natural Resources
Authority (NRA) and Lurgi and Klockner Anlagen of Germany have established
1/ Jordan Energy Sector Study (ESS) Report No. 4012-JO, February 1983.



oil shale reserves of over I billion tons each at El Lajjun and the Sultani
deposits.  However, with current and projected levels of international oil
prices the extraction of oil from shale deposits is uneconomic at the current
level  of  technology. 1/   The  full  development  of  the  small  remaining
hydropower potential of 83 GWh per year 2/ is hampered by issues of riparian
rights.  Despite  Government's  efforts  to promote  solar and i%Lnd energy,
rei. .iable energy is not likely to make a significant contribution to meeting
domestic, agricultural, and commercial energy requirements.
Energy Sector Institutions
1.05     The energy sector is under the  jurisdiction of  the Ministry  of
Energy and Mineral  Resources  (MEMR)  created in November 1984.  The main
energy sector institutions are the Natural Resources Authority (NRA), Jordan
Petroleum Refining Company, (JPRC), Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA),
Jordan Electric Power Company (JEPCO), and the Irbid District Electricity
Company (IDECO).
1.06     MEMR is responsible for formulating overall energy sector policies,
including the development of indigenous energy resources, the diversification
of energy supply and the rationalization of the use of energy by appropriate
pricing policies and promotion of energy conservation measures. MEMR is also
responsible for coordination within the energy sector. Each subsector entity
prepares its  own development  plan.   For  the power  subsector,  least-cost
generation and transmission investment programs are prepared by JEA, while
JEPCO, IDECO, and JEA prepare distribution investment plans for their
respective  supply  areas.   The generation,  transmission, and distribution
programs are consolidated by MEMR into a power subsector plan. NRA prepares
development plans for domestic energy resources, and JPRC prepares plans for
refining,  transportation,  and  distribution  of  petroleum  products.   The
individual subsector plans are then aggregated into a plan for the energy
sector as a whole by MEMR. The sector plan is reviewed by the Ministry of
Planning (MOP) as part of the overall national plan preparation process.
Since MEMR is still in its formative stages, the Government recognizes the
need to strengthen its capabilities, and a program of training and
recruitment  is under way  to strengthen  the  Ministry.   As  the  Ministry
develops, policy formulation and coordination of sector institutions is
expected to improve.
Energy Demand and Supply
1.07     Over the last decade,  Jordan has experienced  a relatively high
growth in energy consumption.   Gross  energy consumption  increased at an
average annual rate of about 14.6% p.a. from 1975 to 1983 (Annex 1.1). The
1/ MEMR is currently examiining the possibility of undertaking a Pilot Plant
Test program which would assess the technical feasibility of using
Jordanian oil shale.
2/ Currently, only about 4 GWh per year on the Zarqa River is developed.



- 3 -
high growth of commercial energy consumption is attributable to rapid
population   growth,   increased   access   to   public   electricity   supply,
establishment and expansion of large energy-intensive industries, such as
cement, potash and phosphate, growth of transport, and rising incomes
stimulated by remittances fromi Jordanians abroad. However, between 1983 and
1985 the rate of growth in energy cnnsumption declined to 4.42 p.a.  Energy
intensity - energy consumption per unit of GDP - declined to 1.5 in 1985,
compared to 2.3 in 1975 partly reflecting effective demand management and
conservation measures  and  partly  the  slowdown  in  economic  growth.   The
Government's major objective in the current plan (1986-1990) and thereafter
is  to  continue  to  achieve  increasing  efficiency  in  energy  use.   The
Government has already completed preliminary energy audit programs in the
industrial and transport sectors and has also drawn up an action plan to
undertake detailed energy audits and implement energy conservation measures
during  the  1986-90  plan  period.   Consequently,  with  GDP  growth  rates
projected to average 52 p.a. between 1986-95, and with implementation of
energy conservation measures, energy intensity is projected to continue to
decline to 1.1 by 1995 and energy consumption is expected to increase slowly
at about 3.0% p.a. to 1995.
1.08     Over  the  last  plan  period  (1981-1985),  the  cost  of  imported
commercial energy amounted to more than 65% of the total merchandise export
earnings. Dependence on imported energy would continue in the future unless
a significant discovery of oil or gas is made through the ongoing exploration
programs.   Consistent with energy demand projections in para. 1.07 above,
energy imports are projected at about 3.3 million toe in 1990 and at
3.9 million toe in 1995 compared to 2.8 million toe in 1985.  Table 1.1 shows
commercial energy balance projections.

Electricity Consumption
1.09     During  the  period  1975-1980,  total  consumption  of  electricity
increased at arn average rate of 26% p.a.   Industrial consumption grew at
131 p.a. while domestic and commercial consumption grew very quickly at
26.51 p.a.   However,  between  1980  and  1985,  the  overall  rate  of growth
declined to 19% p.a. Due to programs of rapid industrialization, consumption
of electricity in the industrial sector grew rapidly at a rate of 24% p.a.
during this period, while the growth rate of consumption in the domestic and
commercial sectors declined to 16.6% p.a.

Electricity Demand Forecast
1.10     The forecast of electricity demand for the interconnected system was
prepared  by JEA,  in consultation with MEMR, JEPCO and IDECO.   Electricity
consumption was projected using a model of consumption by sectors and end
use.   The  Bank  reviewed  the  forecast  of electricity  demand and  found  it
satisfactory.

1.11     Consistent  with  projected  rates of growth  in GDP and  industrial
production  and  with  Government's  energy  strategy  focussing  on  demand
management and conservation measures, the average rate of growth of
electricity consumption is projected to decline trom the historical 19% p.a.
in 1980-1985 to about 8% between 1986 and 1990, and 6.2% during 1991-95.
Electricity consumption in the industrial sector is forecast to increase at
12.4% p.a. during 1986-90 and only 4.9% p.a. during 1990-95, reflecting
partly  more  efficient  energy  use  and  partly  the  absence  of  major  new
industrial  plants.   The demand forecast  and projected sectoral shares are
shown in Annex 1.2.

Energy Pricina
1.12     Petroleum products pricing.   Economic pricing has been one of the
main thrusts of the Government's strategy in tihe energy sector.  As of July
1986, all petroleum products were priced above their economic levels as
detailed in Table 1.2 below.  This was due to a reduction in the subsidy on
fuel oil and mainly to the recent fall in international oil prices.
Furthermore, the currert situation, where prices of petroleum products are
above their respective economic cost, prevails despite the Government's
decision in June 1986 to pass on to selected consuaers a reduction in oil
prices.  Tihese selective reductions concerned mainly the large industries and
the  power  subsector  and  were   implemented   to  promote   international
competitiveness   of   local   products.    Although  we  consider   that   the
Govetrnment's approach is sound, given the uncertainty surrounding the
international oil prices and the possibility of their increase, the
Government agreed during negotiations to exchange views with the Bank with
regard to its policy on petroleum products retail prices (para. 6.01 and
confirmed its policy to maintain these prices at their economic levels.
Annex 1.3 indicates the structure of petroleum products prices.

Electricity Tariffs
1.13     Tariff structure.  The current tariff structure consists of demand
rates and time-of-day kilowatt-hour rates for bulk supply to the distribution
companies and large and medium industries, increasing block rates for
domestic consumers and public buildings, flat kilowatt-hour rates for
commercial consumers and a declining block rate for small industrial
consumers.   In addition, a fixed charge per month is levied on domestic and
small industrial consumers. For large and medium industries, there is also a
penalty for poor power factor in addition to the rates.  The current tariff
structure is provided in Annex 1.4.
1.14     In June  1986,  the Government also decided  to  reduce  electricity
tariffs to certain consumer categories, in parallel with its decision to pass
on to consumers some of the benefits of declining oil prices and to reduce
the price of fuel oil to JEA by about 21%. These adjustments in electricity
rates led to an average reduction of about 13Z in the average revenue per
kilowatt-hour sold to final consumers. As a consequence, the overall average
retail price is about 30.0 fils/kWh, which is close to parity with the
estimated economic cost of supply as shown in Table 1.3 below.   However,
because of the effect of uncertain future fuel prices on the power utilities'
finances, during negotiations the Government agreed to exchange views
periodically with the Bank regarding electricity pricing (para. 6.01) and
confirmed its policy to authorize the power entities to take timely actions
to reflect changes in the fuel prices in their tariffs.

1.15     Electricity prices to bulk consumers and medium industry, and small
industry are about 75% of their respective economic cost.   This situation
could lead to uneconomic use of electricity. MEMR is currently initiating an
energy pricing study being financed by USAID that includes: (i) a review of
the economic cost of electricity supply; and (ii) the design of tariffs
taking into consideration economic efficiency in electricity consumption,
financial viability of the power entities and Government's s-cial policy.
The Bank has assisted in drafting the terms of reference.  Unaer the Sixth
Power Project (Loan 2710-JO), the Government has agreed to submit to the Bank
for its review the results of the study by December 31, 1987 and to provide
an action plan for implementing the recommendations.
Energy Investment
1.16     The   1986-1990   investment   program   of   about   JD 228 million
(US$651 million) reflects the emphasis on improving the efficiency of use of
energy, while continuing efforts to increase the supply base in the most
economic manner.  In addition, the program reflects the Government's plan to
rely increasingly on the private sector in oil exploration activities. As in
the past, power subsector investment would constitute about 662 of total
sector investment and would include investment for additional generating
transmission and distribution facilities as well as rehabilitation and
expansion of the existing distribution system.  Table 1.4 below summarizes
the content of the revised investment program which has been reviewed by the
Bank and found satisfactory.

II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Subsector Organization
2.01     Several  entities  including  MEMR,  JEA,   JEPCO  and   IDECO  are
responsible for the development and operation of Jordan's power subsector:
(i) as detailed in para. 1.15, MEMR is responsible for the development,
coordination and ricing policy formulation for the subsector arnd for
regulating the operation of the private enterprises in the power subsector;
(ii) JEA, a financially and administratively autonomous Government-owned
utility, created in 1967, is responsible for the formulation of plans for the
overall development of the power subsector, the construction and operation of
generation and transmission 'facilities for virtually all the publicly
supplied electricity, bulk sales to large industries and the distribution
companies and for the distribution of electricity in the areas under its
jurisdiction.  JEA is also responsible for the formulation of the national
rural electrification program in consultation with the Ministry of Planning
(MOP) and MEMR; (iii) JEPCO, a private company owned by investors, JEA and
the municipalities, distributes electricity in the city of Amman and its
surrounding areas and accounted for about 70% of total electricity sold at
the medium- and low-voltage levels in 1985; and (iv) IDECO is a semi-private
company owned by JEA, the municipalities of Irbid governorate and private
investors.   IDECO's service  covers  a concessionary  area encompassing  the
governorates of Irbid and Mafraq with the exception of the Jordan Valley area
which is entrusted to JEA. IDECO's sales in 1985 amounted to about 15% of
total electricity sold at the medium- and low-voltage levels.
The Beneficiary
2.02     The  General  Electricity  Law  provides  that  JEA  should  be  both
financially and administratively  independent.   JEA has a board  of  eight
directors six of whom are appointed by the Government, with the Minister of
Energy and Mineral Resources as the Chairman of the Board.   JEA is well
organized and properly managed and has already proven its competence in
carrying out its responsibilities.   Its organization structure is based on
the   recommendations   of   the  management   consultants   appointed   under
Credit 386-JO (First Power Project). The Authority has a total staff of 1580
of which 130 are graduate engineers and 920 are other technical staff.
Manpower Development and Training
2.03     JEA pays due attention to the training of its staff to improve its
technical, financial and administrative services. The training is being done
overseas or locally at JEA's Training Center located in Amman South.
Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive training facility for the power
subsector, which would cover all the required services, JEA is currently
initiating, with the assistance of the Japanese Government, the construction
of a much improved training center to be made available to the three power
entities: JEA, JEPCO and IDECO. This training center would enhance training
of new recruits and would provide improvement and upgrading courses for the
existing staff in the power entities.



- 10 -
2.04     In line with its policy to further develop the technical capability
of its staff, and in relation with the Project's specific needs, JEA has
included in the packages to be procured for the Project a training component
which would ensure that JEA's personnel is well trained and knowledgeable in
the safe and efficient operation and maintenance of the project facilities.
This training component provides for an estimated 60 man-year of training and
consists   of   interrelated  activIties:    (i) formal   classroom   training;
(ii) off-site training at manufacturers' shops and at a plant operationally
similar to the Aqaba Power Station; and (iii) on the job training.
Power Subsector Development
2.05     Jordan's  power subsector grew very rapidly between 1970 and 1980
mainly in response to the economic boom experienced during that period.
Installed generating capacity increased from about 30 MW in 1970 to about
298 MW in 1980 and 952 MW presently. The distribution system has expanded in
unison with the growth in generating and transmission capacities.
2.06     The private sector in Jordan has played a significant role in the
development of the subsector.   JEPCO and  IDECO are  participating  in  the
development of the power distribution systems.  Some large industries have
their own generating plants, with a total capacity of 84 MW, which have now
been connected to the national grid. In addition to meetivu their own demand
these industries supply electricity to the public system during peak periods
when JEA supply is inadequate to meet total system demand.
2.07     Rural electrification has also expanded rapidly.  Access to public
electricity supply has increased from about 25% of rural population in 1975
to about  85%  at  present.   Within the next five years, access to public
electricity supply is expected to reach about 90% of the rural population.
General Characteristics of the Electric Power System
2.08     Generation:   In December 1986, JEA's installed generating capacity
was 862 MW of which 72.3% (623 MW) was oil-fired steam units installed a. the
Hussein Thermal Power Station (HTPS) and Aqaba Thermal Power Station (ATPS),
21.1% (182 MW) was gas turbine plant firing heavy fuel oil and installed at
HTPS, Amman South, Marka and Karak, and the remaining 6.6% (57 MW) was diesel
generator plants installed at Marka, Karak, Tafila and Aqaba. Three diesel
generator units with a total installed capacity of 6 MW are owned and
operated by  IDECO.   Industries  own a  total  of about 84 MW of installed
capacity in steam and diesel units which are connected to the public supply
system.
2.09     Transmission:   Also  in  December  1986,  the  transmission  network
consisted of (i) 1,640 circuit-km of transmission lines, compAising 320 km of
400-kV line between ATPS and Amman-South 1/, 1,286 km of 132-kV lines and two
tie-lines with Syria of 17 km each at 230 kV and 66 kV; and (ii) substation
capacities totalling 1,370 MVA.
1/ This line will be operated at 132 kV until the commissioning of the
proposed project.



- 11 -
2.10     Distribution:    The  distribution  networks  at  the  end  of  1986
consisted of 3,480 km of 33-kV, 1-kV and 6.6-kV networks, and 8,960 km of
0.4-kV network with substation capacity of 1,850 MVA.
2.11     Power  System  Losses:   Total  power  system  losses  are  presently
estimated at about 14%, and are expected to show a slight decline in the
future. Losses in the distribution system are about 10% which is slightly
higher than the economically achievable levels of about 82. As part of the
general power system efficiency improvement program, and under the on-going
Energy Development Project, the Government has initiated a Load Research and
Management  Study,  with  the assistance of  consultants.   The draft report
submitted in June 1986 has identified the sources and nature of power system
losses, provided recommendations and an action plan to reduce them.   The
apFraisal mission reviewed the draft, provided comments, and the report is
currently being finalized.   During negotiations,  the Governmeiut agreed to
submit to the Bank by June 30, 1988, an action plan for reducing power system
losses over the next five years and to implement the agreed action plan
thereafter (para. 6.01).
Power System Planning and Investment Program
2.12     Generation and transmission system planning is done by JEA with the
assistance of consultants.  JEA has presently acquired the WASP III 1/ and
MAED 2/ computer models to improve its planning capability.   Assistance  in
the use of these programs is being provided by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) art the Bank through training and technical advice.
Distribution system planning is carried out by each of the power entities
seL.arately for their various concession areas at standards which are in most
cases, comparable to those found in the industrialized countries.
2.13     JEA's total investment program for the period 1986-1995 is estimated
to be about  JD 250 million  (US$720 million).   The  investment  program  is
reasonable in relation to the demand forecast. It is expected that JEA would
be able to finance internally up to 35% of its long-term investment program.
The Government regularly reviews the investment requirements for the
construction programs of power utilities and arranges to secure the necessary
financing from external and internal sources.
sole of IDA/Bank
2.14     The World Bank Group has been involved in seven operations in the
power subsector. The first two were made in the form of credits (386-JO in
1973 for US$10 million and 570-JO in 1975 for US$5 million) to support the
Government's efforts in initiating the first stages for the development of
generation facilities with 3x33-MW steam power units and lx13-MW gas turbine
at the Hussein power station, the reconditioning of the Marka diesel power

station, and a study for the formulation of a plan for the development of the
transmission and distribution grids  in the southern region.  The combined
projects completion report for the two Credits (June 1982) states that the
projects exceeded the expectations of the appraisal.  Loan 1688-JO (1979) of
US$15 million financed the development of the national transmission network
and the extension of public supply of electricity to 33 villages in the areas
served by JEA.  The related completion report (June 1984) indicates that the
Project   fully  accomplished   its  objectives.    Loan  1986-JO  (1981)  of
US$25 million covered parts of the development programs of JEA and JEPCO for
the 1981-1984 period.  The Project has been satisfactorily completed and a
Completion Report is being prepared by the Borrower.  Loan 2162-JO (1982) for
US$35 million, with co-financing from a number of bilateral and multilateral
institutions, assisted JEA in covering the foreign exchange cost of the first
stage of the Aqaba thermal power station which involves the installation of
two oil-fired units of 130 MW each, with a total cost of about US$250
million. First operation of the two units took place in May and July 1986
after  only  minor  delays.   Loan 2371-JO  (1984)  of  US$30 million  with
co-financing from USAID and EEC covered the foreign exchange cost of parts of
the development programs of JEPCO's and IDECO's power distribution system,
and  other  operations,   particularly   in  petroleum  exploration,   energy
conservation and energy planning, that would contribute to the improvement of
Jordan's overall energy efficiency.   Implementation of the Project is now
proceeding satisfactorily after a slow start due to the Government's delay in
meeting   the   effectiveness   conditions.    Loan 2710-JO   (June 1986)   of
US$27.5 million would continue the Bank's efforts to assist the power
subsector entities in their development programs through the implementation
of some major investments in the distribution system that would contribute to
the improvement of Jordan's power system efficiency. The procurement process
has been initiated and the loan became effective on December 1, 1986.   The
proposed Project would assist the Government in serving Jordan's future power
demand while meeting its objectives of reducing the country's dependence on
imported oil, and enable the Bank to continue its efforts to achieve the
institutional building objectives set under the previous loans and the Energy
Sector Study.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Obiectives
3.01     Jordan is virtually totally dependant on imports for meeting its
needs for primary energy. The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(i) to meet the future power demand at least cost to the economy, and
(ii) potentially to reduce the country's dependence on imported oil in power
generation by introducing the possibility of substituting oil with coal
should the latter prove more economical.  The project's further objectives
are the improvement of the quality of power supply services and the
continuation of the institution-building efforts to further develop JEA as a
technically efficient entity.
Pro3ect Description
3.02     The proposed project is part of JEA's development program for the
period 1988-1995, and would involve:
(a) the expansion of the existing bea-water-cooled steam power plant at
Aqaba by the addition of 2x130-MW units, initially firing heavy fuel
oil and with the boilers and the power station layout suitable for
future coal firing (paras. 5.03 and 5.04);
(b) upgrading the substations at Aqaba and Amman-South to 400 kV; and
(c) the consulting services associated with (a) and (b).
Annexes 3.1 and 3.10 give a detailed description of the project and the
layout of Aqaba Power Station respectively.  Map IBRD 19882 indicates  the
location of the main project components.
Project Cost
3.03     The estimated cost of the proposed project including physical and
price contingencies is about JD 96.6 million (US$242.5 million).  The total
financing required, inclusive of interest during construction, is about
JD 102.7 million  (US$257.8 million)  of  which  JD 87.5 million   (US$219.1
million) would be in foreign exchange. The cost estimates do not include
custom duties and taxes from which JEA is exempt.   Details  of  the  cost
estimates are given in Annexes 3.2 and. 3.3 and summarized in Table 3.1
below. These estimates are based on estimated January 1987 prices derived
from bids received for the project and being evaluated by JEA. Given the
advanced stage of project design, and given the fact that the project is an
extension to an existing power station, physical contingencies are assumed at
102 for the civil works and 71 for the equipment and materials.   Price
contingencies have been computed assuming an implementation period consistent
with the relevant Bank standard profile and specific annual increases for
domestic and international prices as follows:

lowever, according to the agreed load forecast and to enable JEA to meet the
electricity demand more efficiently (para. 4.09), the project would be needed
in early 1992. This explains JEA's efforts to expedite the construction of
the  project.   Our  past experience with JEA would indicate that,  if JEA
maintains the same degree of diligence, the project could be completed by
early 1992 at a saving of about US$6.5 million.

Proiect Financing Plan
3.04     In line with the procedure used for the first stage of Aqaba Thermal
Power Station, the Government approached official and commercial sources of
financing.   Two co-financiers'meetings were held in Amman in May 1985 and
April 1987. 1/ These meetings were attended by representatives of the Kuwait
Fund (KF), the Arab Fund (AF) also representing the OPEC Fund and the Islamic
Development Bank (IDB).  In addition, representatives from Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW-Germany) and the Government of Switzerland attended the
first donors'  meeting and expressed  strong  interest  in co-financing  the
project ahould firms from their respective country be awarded a contract.
Other official and/or suitable export credits have also been explored by the
Borrower and the bids received and opened on March 31, 1987 indicate a great
deal of interest among official agencies and suppliers in co-financing the
project.
3.05     During the April 1987 meeting, the representatives of KF, AF, OPEC
Fund and IDB confirmed their contributions. The KF committed the equivalent
of US$24 million, the AF also committed the equivalent of US$24 million, the
OPEC Fund US$5 million and the IDB US$14 million. Allocation of these funds
was also finalized during this meeting.
3.06     Table 3.2  below  gives  the  project  financing  plan  agreed  during
negotiations and Annex 3.4 gives the detailed project financing plan and
official allocation of commitments from the lending agencies.

3.07     The proposed Bank loan of US$70 million would finance about 29% of
the total estimated project cost and about 34% of its foreign cost.  In order
to ensure timely execution of the proposed project, signing of loan
agreements  with  the  co-financiers  for  an  amount  equivalent  to  about
US$85 million to secure the financing of the civil works and boilers
contracts will be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.04).
Lending Arrangement
3.08     The  proposed  Bank  loan would be  made  to  the  Government  which
coordinates all foreign financing for public sector projects through MOP, and
on-lent to JEA  on  the  same  terms  as  the  Bank  loan.   Execution  of  the
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and JEA will be a condition
of loan effectiveness (para. 6.04).  The foreign exchange and interest rate
risks would be borne by JEA.
Engineering and Consulting Services
3.09     JEA has appointed Chas T. Main (CTM) of the USA as consultants for
project engineering, management and construction coordination for the power
station.  Specifically, CTM is assisting JEA in:  (i) the preparation of the
specifications and bidding documents for the equipment and works ; (ii) the
evaluation of bids; (iii) the finalization of the design proposed by the
selected bidders with the objective of ensuring close coordination between
the different packages; and (iv) the supervision of equipment manufacturing,
erection, testing and commissioning of the power station. CTM has undertaken
similar assignments for the implementation of the first stage of the power
station and has developed a good working relationship with JEA. Contrary to
previous practices, CTM is increasing the part of engineering tasks to be
performed locally, in close collaboration with JEA's staff, and it is
expected that this will develop further JEA's staff capabilities in the
engineering of thermal power stations.
3.10     JEA has also appointed Preece Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the UK as
consultant to assist in the design of its transmission network to accommodate
the load foreseen in the early 1990's. JEA's interconnected system has been
planned and designed on the basis of studies carried out by JEA's staff
assisted by PCR.  These studies involve load  flows,  short-circuit  study,
transient  and  steady  state  stability,  switching  surges  and  dynamic
over-voltages. The results of these studies have been reviewed by the Bank
and found satisfactory. PCR is also assisting JEA's Transmission Department
in: (i) designing the 400-kV Amman South substation; (ii) preparing the
bidding   documents;   (iii) evaluating   bids;   and   (iv) supervising   the
construction of the substation and its commissioning.
3.11     The  proposed  project  would  therefore  include:    (i) about  630
man-months of consulting services for the power station at an estimated total
cost of about US$10.4 million, of which about US$8.2 million would be in
foreign exchange; and (ii) about 28 man-months of consultancy services for
Amman-South substation at an estimated total cost of US$0.33 million, of
which about US$0.22 million would be in foreign exchange.

3.12     As stated in para. 3.02 (a) the power plant contained in the project
will be initially firing heavy fuel oil and provisions have been provided for
to ensure a successful conversion to coal, should the switch to coal be
decided.  A jetty would then be required in Aqaba for importing coal.  This
jetty would be built under the responsibility of the Aqaba Port Corporation
(TPC). To assist TPC in the design and engineering of the jetty, consultancy
services will be required.  Draft terms of reference for such services have
been provided by the Bank to the Government, TPC and JEA and are detailed in
Annex 3.5.   These  services  are  expected  to  be  financed  by  Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA).  To ensure timely execution of the
jetty in relation with the possible future conversion of the power station to
coal firing, the Government agreed during regotiations to continue processing
of the required consulting services and to submit to the Bank the technical
design of the jetty by December 31, 1988 (para. 6.01).
Project Preparation and Implementation Schedule
3.13     The proposed project, which will be implemented by JEA assisted by
its consultants, is in an advanced stage of preparation.   The consultants
prepared the basic design and the bidding documents.  Bidding documents for
the boilers, turbo-generators, switchyard and civil works were released in
October-December 1986 and all related bids were received and opened on March
31, 1987.  JEA is currently evaluating the bids with the assistance of CTM.
Major contracts,  in  particular  for the boilers,  turbo-generators and the
civil works would be awarded by October 1987.  Project completion is expected
in 1993. Annex 3.6 gives the detailed project implementation schedule.
Procurement
3.14     JEA  has  grouped  the goods  and  services  to be procured for the
proposed project into nine packages.  Annex 3.7 gives the detailed list of
these  packages  and  their  estimated  procurement  schedule.   The  packages
proposed for Bank financing are listed in Table 3.3 below.

Item (a) is being procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with Bank procurement guidelines; item (b) which relates to
consulting services for the power station has been procured in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines  for the use of consultauts.   To complete  the
project JEA would ensure effective international competition by procuring the
remaining major items (civil works, boiler island, Switchyard Island and
Amman-South Substation) through international competitive bidding. Table 3.4
below summarizes the procurement arrangements for the project.

Disbursements
3.15     The proceeds of the Bank loan are expected to be disbursed over
seven years  (Annex 3.8).   The disbursement schedule reflects  the  relevant
Bank standard disbursement profile which is based on the Bank's experience in
similar projects. Annex 3.9 gives a comparison of disbursement profiles with
the actual disbursements of Jordan Third Power Project (Loan 1688-JO) and
Fourth  Power  Project   (Loan 1986-JO),   and  with   the  actual/estimated
disbursement of Jordan Fifth Power Project (Loan 2162-JO), which relates to
the first stage of Aqaba Thermal Power Station.
3.16     Proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed against:
(a)  100%  of  foreign  expenditures   for  equipment,   materials   and
installation for the turbine island; and
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for engineering services for the power
station.
3.17     Disbursement requests will be fully documented except for claims for
expenditures under contracts whose value is less than US$200,000 equivalent.
These claims will be subject to presentation of a Statement of Expenditures
(SOE) for which the supporting documents will be retained by JEA and reviewed
periodically by the Bank. Also, during negotiations, the Government agreed
to open and maintain in US Dollars a special account of US$5.0 million in a
major Commercial Bank or in its Central Bank on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.01).
3.18     Retroactive financing of up to US$1.5 million is proposed for ^osts
incurred after June 30, 1986 for consultants' services for the power station.
Environmental Impact
3.19     The site for Stage II of the Aqaba Thermal Power Station is adjacent
to the first stage and is located on a sloping alluvial plain in an area
called Wadi 2, about 12 miles south of the port and city of Aqaba and about
0.6 mile inland and east of the shoreline of the Gulf of Aqaba. The Wadi 2
area is bounded on the north and south by rugged sandstone mountains, on the
west by the Gulf of Aqaba and on the east by the joining of the two '2) arms
of the mountains which bound the area on the north and south.  The site is
almost totally devoid of vegetation.
3.20     As was the case for the first stage of the Aqaba Thermal Power
Station, the impact of pollutants from the power station on the environment
has been very carefully examined by JEA's consultants using the US
Environment Protection Agency's air quality and emission limitation standards
and assuming the use of heavy fuel oil with an ash content of about 0.1S and
a sulfur cortent of about 4X. The major pollutants would be air and water
pollutants, originating mostly from stack emissions, discharge of residuals
and liquid wastes.  In order to reduce the ground level concentrations of
potentially harmful constituents the design of the power plant would



- 20 -
particularly provide for one common chimney 175 m high connected to the two
boilers. In the event of future conversion to coal firing, the design of the
project would be completed by the installation of electrostatic precipitators
which would remove about 992 of the entrained fly ash particles; in addition,
fugitive dust from handling and storage of coal would be controlled and kept
at an acceptable level by providing dust control equipment on the coal
unloading and conveying systems.
3.21     Peak  ground  level  concentrations  of atmospheric  pollutants  were
determined, along with the contribution of Stage I of the power station.
Calculated ground level concentrations for nitrogen oxide and particuiate
matter are well below internationally acceptable levels. For sulfur dioxide
the maximum 24 hour average concentration is estimated to be about 65 jig/m3
when both Stages I and II are burning heavy fuel oil and only 50 ug/m, when
Stage I units are in operation.   This value is well below the acceptable
level of 400  gg'm3.  The effect of thermal impact on the coral reef in the
Gulf of Aqaba has also been thoroughly investigated by the consultants and
the temperature rise will be reduced by dilution after discharge sufficiently
to limit the temperature at the edge of the plume to 29°C which is allowable
for the protection of the marine life and particular coral reef in the Gulf.
3.22     In view of the above, the power station is not expected to cause any
significant  environmental  problem.   In addition to what has been already
undertaken during the first stage of the power station, further personnel
training  and  pollution  monitoring  stations  would  be  provided.   During
negotiations, JEA agreed to maintain pollutant levels below internationally
acceptable levels and to take corrective actions if necessary (para. 6.03).
Project Risks
3.23     The project is an extension of an existing thermal power station and
an existing 132-kV substation. The sub-soil investigations indicate similar
conditions should be encountered, therefore, no special project risks are
expected. However, a possible delay could be experienced in the decision of
converting  the power station to coal firing.   This would lead to higher
operating cost.  The Project Agreement provides for periodic joint reviews
with regard to fuel prices in order to continue to ensure the most economic
operation of the power station (para. 5.04).

IV. FINANCE
Accounting
4.01     JEA maintains its accounts uncier a uniform system of accounts as
recommended by consultants (Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.) and similar to the
accounts used by U.S. electric utilities. JEA has computerized the accounts,
and  management  is  provided  with  timely  monthly  financial  reports.   A
simplified corporate financial model is also on JEA's computer and is
utilized by the Planning Department, JEA's management, and the Government.
JEA, JEPCO and IDECO were not using a standard uniform system of accounts;
under the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1986-JO) it was recommended that the
three power entities standardize their accounting systems. As a consequence,
a committee of representatives from JEA, JEPCO and IDECO meets periodically
and reviews the measures required to standardize the utility accounting
systems used by each of  the electric  utilities  in Jordan.   Consultants
(Management Resources International) have been appointed by JEA to implement
procedures beginning in January 1987 that "ould enable JEA, JEPCO and IDECO
to standardize on the same utility accounts as of January 1, 1988. Funding
for the consultant is being provided by USAID.
Accounts Receivable
4.02     In April 1986 it was discovered that a meter registering JEA's sales
to JEPCO had been billed in error since October 1984 and that JEA had
underbilled JEPCO by JD 1.6 million due to the underreading.  Consequently,
due to the error, JEA's accounts receivable as of December 31, 1985 amounted
to 95 days' billings. 1/ JEA and JEPCO have agreed on measures of repayment
over the next three years to settle the large underpayment by JEPCO to JEA.
Other measures (such as reviewing of agency budgets to ensure availability of
funds) are being taken by Government and JEA to collect arrears from
Government agencies and industrial accounts that have resulted from the
downturn in Jordan's economy. During negotiations Government and JEA agreed
to repeat the existing covenant to take all necessary actions to ensure that
JEA's accounts receivable do not exceed 45 days billings (para. 6.02)
Past Performance and Present Position
4.03     JEA's  financial  statements  for the years 1983-1986 are given in
Annexes 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. Its self-financing level was 42% in 1983, 291
in 1984, 20% in 1985, and 23S in 1986 compared with the covenanted levels of
252 for 1983 and 35% for 1984 and 1985 and 25% for 1986 under existing Bank
Loan Agreements; this timeframe includes the major construction program of
the Aqaba I  power  plant.   Given  the  lumpy  investment  program  and  the
relatively high rate of inflation during the period, JEA's financial
performance  is satisfactory.   The  following  table  summarizes  JEA's  past
financial performance.
1/ Without this error, JEA's accounts receivable would have been equivalent
to 45 days billings, which is within an acceptable level.

Revenue Covenant
4.04     JEA  is  maintaining  stringent  controls  on  expenditures.   With
improvements  in  efficiency  expected  from  JEA's  ongoing  rehabilitation
programs, JEA's power losses would be lowered in future years (para. 2.09).
Under the Sixth Power Project (Loan 2710-JO) it was agreed to set the
self-financing levels of 252 for fiscal years 1986 and 1987, 302 for fiscal
year 1988 and 35% for fiscal years 1989 and thereafter. These levels of
internal cash generation would be adequate to cover the local cost components
of JEA's investments after meeting operating expenses and debt service, and
JEA's financial position would remain sound. During negotiations, Government
and JEA agreed to repeat the self-financing level covenant agreed under the
Sixth Power Project (Loan 2710-JO) (para. 6.02).
4.05     Due to the financially sensitive effects of fuel prices,  exchange
rates, operating expenses, costs involved in construction, and inflation in
general, the financial projections should be kept under annual review.
During negotiations Government and JEA agreed to repeat the covenants under
existing Loan agreements to:  (i) review, at least three months before the
end of each fiscal year, and on the basis of forecasts satisfactory to the
Bank, the adequacy of JEA's revenues to meet the agreed self-financing level
for the following year; and (ii) on the basis of the above review, take all
actions required to achieve the agreed self-financing level (para. 6.02).
JEA's Financial Plan and Funds Statement
4.06       The construction program for 1988 through 1995 (including interest
during  construction)  is  estimated  at  about  JD 218.1 million.   JEA's
construction program and financing plan for 1988 through 1995 are summarized
as follows:

Future Financial Performance
4.07     JEA's sales of electricity are estimated to grow on average about 7%
annually from 1986 through 1995 (para. 5.01). Under the Sixth Power Project
JEA is undertaking measures to maximize its efficiency through loss reduction
and cost control (parf.. 2.11).  The forecast financial statements are given
in Annexes  4.1,  4.2,  4.3 and  4.4.   The  assumptions  for  the  financial
forecasts are given in Annex 4.5. They assume tariff increases of about 10l
in 1990 to cover projected fuel price  increases.   Customer  contributions
include Government contributions of JD 9 million as compensation to JEA for
the capital costs of the highway lighting program, services for future water
pumping installations and service to Government-owned industries.



- 24 -
4.08     JEA's debt/equity ratio as of December 31, 1986 is 61/39.  During
1987-1995 the ratio would average about 55/45 and would improve by 1995 to
47/53, which is acceptable.  JEA's liquidity, as reflected by the current
ratio, would be at acceptable levels at an average of 2. Through 1995 the
rate of return would average about 8%, which is adequate.  Fixed assets are
recorded at book value which, in the case of JEA, corresponds to current
replacement cost (about $900 per kW of installed capacity).  The assets are,
therefore, fairly valued.  Provided that JEA can control its expenses, its
financial performance through 1995 would be satisfactory.  It would meet all
of  its  annual  operating  expenses  and  debt  service,  and  provide  a
self-financing level of 35% of its long-term investment program, which
includes the completion of Aqaba II and part of the investment for the next
future power station.
4.09     The financial projections in paras. 4.07 through 4.08 are Based on
the Aqaba II extension being completed in late 1991 for the first unit and in
early 1992 for the second unit.  This is one year earlier than the assumed
completion date consistent with the relevant Bank standard disbuxrsement
profile.  This could be achieved if JEA shows the same degree of diligence as
for  previous  Bank-financed  projects  (para. 3.03).   If,  however,  Aqaba II
would not be completed until mid-1993, and the same projected load forecast
had to be met, JEA would be required to generate electricity with less
efficient generating equipment including higher priced fuel for the gas
turbines.   This  delay  in adding  the more  efficient  generation  units  of
Aqaba II would be very costly to JEA in additional fuel costs and would
require additional tariff increases of about 52 to meet the revenue covenant
(para. 4.04).
Debt Service Coverage
4.10     JEA's debt service coverage in  1986  is  1.47;  by  1988  the debt
service coverage would fall as low as 1.05 but would steadily improve from
1989 to a level of 1.45 by 1995.  Under the Sixth Power Project JEA agreed to
obtain the Bank's prior approval for any new long-term borrowings exceeding
the equivalent of US$1 million in any year unless the net revenues for each
year during the term of the debt is at least equal to 1.5 times the projected
debt service requirements for such year on all its debt, including the debt
to be incurred.   This covenant provides a measure to keep JEA's long-term
debt under review; during negotiations JEA agreed  to repeating  the debt
service coverage covenant (para. 6.03).
Auditing
4.11     Under the Sixth Power Project (Loan 2710-JO), JEA agreed to appoint
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank to audit its accounts,
including the audit of the Statement of Expenditures (SOE), and submit to the
Bank its audited financial statements and audit reports not later than five
months after the end of each fiscal year. The accounts of JEA are audited by
Shair  &  Co.,  a  local  firm.   The  auditing  arrangements  are 'generally
satisfactory and the reports in previous years have been submitted Wit1fin the
covenanted timpf fame. However, for the year 1985 JEA encountered translation



- 25 -
problems and consequently delayed submitting the audit report to the Bank by
about one month.   This matter was discussed with JEA's management during
appraisal and measures would be taken in 1987 to present the audit to the
Bank within the agreed five months after the end of the year.  Under the
Sixth Power Project, the auditing covenant was amended to cover the Special
Account and provided for the auditing of the Statement of Expenditures
(SOEs).   During  negotiations  JEA  agreed  to  repeat  this  covenant  which
requires JEA to: (i) appoint independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank to
audit its accounts and submit to the Bank its audited financial statements
and audit reports not later than five months after the end of each fiscal
year; and (ii) include a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the
proceeds of the special account and the amounts withdrawn from the loan
account on the basis of the SOEs have been used for the purpose for which
they were provided (para. 6.03).
Insuranee
4.12     JEA's insurance coverage arrangements are satisfactory.   Insurance
coverage for its assets is provided by local insurance companies operating
under Government regulation. JEA engages qualified inspectors to make annual
inspections of boilers and generating equipment.  Insurance against risks has
been in such amounts as considered consistent with sound utility practice.
During negotiations JEA agreed to repeat the existing covenant relating to
insurance (para. 6.03).
Performance Monitoring System
4.13     Tpe comprehensive set of key performance indicators agreed under
previous loans has been satisfactory for purposes of monitoring JEA's
technical  and  financial  performance.   During  negotiations  JEA agreed  to
continue reporting to the Bank on these key indicators (para. 6.04).

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Load Forecast
5.01     JEA's  actual  and  projected  electricity  sales  for  the  period
1975-1995 are presented in Annex 1.2. The forecast of electricity demand for
the period 1986-1995 was reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory.
According to this forecast, demand is expected to grow at an average rate of
about 7Z per annum from 2243 GWh in 1986 to 4127 GWh in 1995.   The major
contributors to the growth in demand would be the industrial and commercial
sectors.  ThIs reflects the Government's objective to promote the industrial
and services sectors for export and job creation purposes and also the impact
of the return of Jordanian workers from the Gulf countries and their efforts
to promote the commercial sector.
Least-Cost Analysis
5.02     In 1984, with the assistance of a consulting firm (Merz & McLellan,
UK), JEA prepared a comprehensive  least-cosZ power generation development
plan for the period up to the year 2000. The study examined inter alia the
prospects for introducing a new type generation plant (combined-cycle) and
for using imported coal in order to diversify the sources of primary enexgy
supply. The study concluded that the extension of the Aqaba Thermal Power
Station by 2xl3O-MW dual-fired units to come on stream in 1991/1992 and with
coal as the primary fuel, offers the least-cost means of meeting the future
demand  on  the  system.   This  was  confirmed  in  1985 by a  further  study
undertaken by JEA with the assistance of IAEA. Following the 1986 decline in
oil prices and using revised load growth projections, JEA has undertaken
extensive sensitivity analysis which has continued to demonstrate the
economic  viability of  the  proposed  project.   The  Bank has  reviewed  the
studies and agrees with their findings.
5.03     To further review its decision on the basis of actual capital cost,
JEA required the prospective bidders for the construction of the power
station to submit not only a base tender for 2x130-MW dual-fired units with
coal being the primary fuel, but also an alternative option with heavy fuel
oil being the initial fuel, with provision for ready conversion to coal in
the future (option 2). This option would include all necessary coal firing
design parameters, particularly for the boilers, but coal handling, storage,
additional firing equipmen. and construction of the jetty could be procured
in the future. On the basis of the bids received and at 1987 fuel prices
assumed to remain constant in real terms JEA has reevaluated the fuel choice
decision.   JEA's  analysis  concluded  that  option 2  (oil)  would  be  the
least-cost  option and has  decided  in favor of this option.   The Bank's
detailed review of JEA's analysis showed that there is no significant
difference between the two options if present fuel prices remain constant in
real terms. However, in the event that fuel prices increase in line with the
Bank's latest projections, option 1 (coal) would be the least-cost solution
by a considerable margin compared to option 2 (Annex 5.1).



- 27 -
5.04     During negotiations the Government acknowledged that the coal option
may be cheaper in the future. However, the S-overnment did not wish to commit
itself to the additional investment at this time in dual firing and
maintained its proposal to proceed with oil as the initial fuel, given:
(i) the uncertainty of future fuel prices; (ii) that provision will be made
for easy conversion to future coal firing should that become more economic;
(iii) its decision to continue processing the study for the coal unloading
jetty (para. 3.12); and (iv) that the difference between the two options at
current fuel prices is marginal. Moreover, JEA agreed during negotiations to
exchange views with the Bank with regard to the alternative uses of fuel in
order to continue to ensure the most economic operation of the power station
(para. 6.03).   On  the basis  of  the  above  the  Government's  decision  is
considered acceptable.
Rate of Return
5.05     Since  the  project  is  part  of  Jordan's  1987-1994  power  system
expansion nrogram, the economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated on the
required poier investment program for the incremental demand met by the
project.
5.06     The  measurable  costs  comprise:   (a) the  capital  cost  of  JEA's
expansion program for 1987-1994; (b) operating and maintenance costs; and
(c) the fuel cost. The measurable benefits include the incremental revenue
attributable to the program based on the prevailing average revenue of
30 fils/kWh (US 8.6 cents/kWh). The results and assumptions of the analysis
are given in Annex 5.2.
5.07     The calculated ERR was about 19%, compared with the opportunity cost
of capital of 92. It reflects the fact that the present tariffs are close to
the estimated economic cost of supply and also that the proposed project is a
relatively low cost extension of an existing power station; the capital cost
dGes not include certain sunk costs related to facilities which have been
built during the first stage of the power station, including the 400-kV
transmission line to Amman.
5.08     Sensitivity analysis was done by:  (i) increasing the capital cost
of the project by 10% and 25%, and (ii) reducing the sales of electricity by
10% and 25S.  Under the worst scenarios (increasing capital cost by 25% and
reducing sales by 252), the ERR drops to 13.4Z and 11.22 respectively which
are  still  greater  than  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (Annex 5.2,
Attachment).

year; and (ii) on the basis of the above review, take all actions
required to achieve the agreed self-financing level (para. 4.05).
6.03     During negotiations JEA agreed to:
(a) maintain pollutant levels below internationally acceptable levels
and to take corrective actions if necessary (para. 3.22);
(b) obtain the Bank's prior approval for any new long-term borrowings
exceeding the equivalent of US$1 million in any year unless the net
revenues for each year during the term of the debt is at least equal
to 1.5 times the projected debt service requirements for such year
on all its debt, including the debt to be incurred (para. 4.10);



- 29 -
(c) (i) appoint independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank to audit
its accounts and submit to the Bank its audited financial statements
and audit reports for each year not later than five months after the
end of the year; and (ii) include a separate opinion by the auditors

(paras. 3.07 and 3.08).
6.05     With the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$70 million, for a term of 17 years at the standard variable interest
rate, including a four-year grace period to the Government of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
Description of the Prolect
A. The Power Station
1.       Stage  I  of  the  Aqaba  thermal  power  station,  which  has  been
commissioned in July 1986, consists of two (2) oil-fired units of 130 MW
each. Stage II of the power station, the proposed project, will add two (2)
units also rated at 130 MW each initially firing heavy fuel-oil but with
provisions for future coal firing should coal become more economical. These
provisions relate particularly to the boilers and the power station layout.
The project is scheduled for operation early in 1993.
2.       Each  steam  generator  in  Stage  II  will  be  capable  of  dual
coal/oil-fired, balanced draft water-tube type connected to one  (1)  steam
drum, with superheater, reheater and economizer. The unit will be of welded
wall construction, top supported from the steel structure, and will be of the
outdoor type, furnished with regenerative air heaters. The steam generator
output will  be based on supplying  steam to  the  turbine with  the  cycle
conditions of 141 kg/cm2 gauge (2,000 psig) and 5381 (1,000°F) reheat, back
pressure of 6.35 cm (2.5 inches) Hg abs, and seven (7) feedwater heaters, two
(2) high-pressure heaters, one (1) generator, and four (4) low-pressure
heaters all in service.   The turbine back pressure  is based on an  inlet
cooling water temperature of 28°C (821F). The water for the condenser cooling
will be once through and obtained from the Gulf of Aqaba. The temperature
rise will be 10.5°C (19°F) and the heated temperature will be reduced by
dilution after discharge sufficiently to limit the temperature at the edge of
the plume to 290C (84°F), which will protect the coral reef from thermal
impact. To reduce the impact of chlorine on aquatic systems, a mechanical
cleaning device will be included to control biofouling in the condenser tubes
with chlorine injected to control biofouling in the remainder of the
circulating water system, thus minimizing the use of chlorine. The system
wiil be "shock" treated to maintain U.S. Environmental Protection Agency water
quality discharge criteria for residual chlorine.  Service and potable water
will be obtained from the Water Authority distribution system.   Wastewater
will be treated either for reuse or for discharge to the sea.
3.       Generators will be  rated 160.5 MVA, 50 Hz, 3,000 rpm with a 0.85
power factor. Generator voltage will be stepped up to 400 kV to deliver power
to the switchyard on the site, feeding two (2) existing 400-kV transmission
lines to the north and terminating in Amman.  The existing two (2) 132-kV
lines to Amman will be changed to 400 kV during Stage II. A 33-kV substation
will be fed from the 400-kV switchgear for feeding the plant start-up
transformers.   Room for six (6) future additional 400-kV circuits will be
provided in the switchyard.

5.       The station presently includes a workshop, maintenance and employees
facilities building, administration building, storage, water treatment, fuel
oil pumping, wastewater treatment facilities, sodium hypochloride generation,
hydrogen generation,  reboiler and other  miscellaneous  buildings.   Certain
buildings  - such  as  the  closed  storage  building,  sodium  hypochloride
generation building, wastewater treatment building, hydrogen generation
building, reboiler building and other buildings - will either have to be
expanded or duplicated to accommodate Stage II requirements.
6.       All station systems will be either digital or analog controlled.  The
steam turbine will have its own electrohydraulic control system. The analog
control  will  direct   the   interface   requirements   of   the   coordinated
boiler-turbine control system.  Burner management controls and furnace safety
instrumentation will be supplied with the steam generator.
7.       Computers will also be provided to handle data logging and system
calculation. A separate sequence-of-events recorder will be provided.
8.       An availability/reliability program will be performed.  One (1) of
the major objectives of this program will be to ensure a mature plant
availability of 85% or higher. This level of availability will be achieved by
utilizing  proven  design  concepts  and  fully  demonstrated  systems  and
components.   Additional  methods  to  achieve  higher  reliability  will  be
(a) redundancy of components, (b) diversity of accomplishing vital functions,
and (c) high quality of components.
B. Amman South 400-kV Transmission Substation
9.       The 400-kV substation will be of the indoor gas insulated switchgear
type of a double busbar design.  The substation will be designed to provide
switching facilities and protection for the transmission and interbus
transformer  circuits  associated  with  the  bulk  supplies  to  the  132-kV
subtransmission system and its interconnection with the 400-kV grid.  This
substation will be interconnected with a 400-kV double circuit line 320 km
long routed south to the Aqaba Thermal power station.
10.      The layout and rating of the 400-kV substation will be suitable for
future extension to meet eventual developments of the Aqaba Thermal Power
Station.   The  switchgear  will  be  of  a  40 kV  breaking  current.   The
transmission system's reactive compensation scheme will be installed at Amman
South and will comprise 2 x 50 MVAr static shunt reactors connected to the
400-kV overhead line.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for Technical
Assistance to Design the Multipurpose Jetty
OBJECTIVES
A new jetty would be required at Wadi 2 near Aqaba to import and
supply coal for the expansion of the Aqaba Thermal Power Station should coal
become more economical; this jetty would also be used for the export/import of
other commodities.
Coal is vot available in Jordan and it is proposed that coal will be
imported using bulk carriers of up to 50,000 dwt.  The Stage II expansion of
Aqaba Power Station will consume about 650,000 tons per annum with coal demand
rising  as  further  generating  capacity  using  coal  is  added  to  about
2,500,000 tons per annum by the year 2000; by this time the jetty would
probably be fully dedicated to coal unloading.
The study is to determine the economic design of the jetty to cater
for such needs, and also for further power station expansion, and the
technical services will provide for detailed engineering and design of the
agreed jetty.
The study and technical services will concern two organizations,
namely, Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) who is responsible for the
construction, operation and maintenance of power generation and transmission
systems in Jordan, and the Aqaba Port Corporation (TPC) who is responsible for
the development, operation and maintenance of jetties, stevedoring and other
services related to the working of ports in Jordan.
SCOPE
The required technical services will be undectaken in two phases:
Phase I is to be commenced as soon as possible and will include the
carrying-out of a site survey to determine the location of the jetty and
related soil and other design criteria, and examination of the various factors
as outlined in Section 3 in order to define the cost options available and the
recomuendations for the economic design of the jetty, culminating in agreement
of the final recommendations by all parties involved.
Phase 2 will comprise the carrying-out, based upon the agreed
recommendations from Phase 1, of the detailed engineering design and the
preparation of all necessary drawings.

ANNEX 3.5
Page 2 of 3
PROCEDURE
The study to determine the basic parameters upon which the jetty
should be designed to provide the most economically viable solution should
take into account the following factors:
(a) the expected coal consumption per year and stockpile capacity
required;
(b) the types of coal required and the available world-wide sources;
(c) the method of coal delivery - either directly by ship from source to
Aqaba, or transshipped from a convenient transshipment location to
Aqaba in smaller vessels (say 20,000-25,000 dwt);
(d) the economic sizes (dwt) of bulk carrier which would be used.
(e) the optimum rate for unloading such vessels at Aqaba compatible with
the rate of coal consumption and the "free" time to unload the vessel
(before demurrage charges would be applied), the types of coal
unloaders to be used (bearing in mind the necessary freedom of coal
(from the sources referred to in (b) above) from "tramp iron" and
other extraneous materials, and the problems such "tramp" could cause
to unloading equipment), the conveyors required from the jetty to the
bunkers or main stockpile, and the stockpile capacity.
(f) the size and design of jetty required to handle such vessels under
Stage II and under subsequent coal-fired power station development,
and the capital cost of constructing the jetty (including supply and
installation of coal unloading equipment and associated conveyors);
(g) the relatively low utilization of the jetty for handling coal, and of
the  associated  equipment  during  the  initial  period,  and  the
feasibility of using the jetty, when not required for handling coal,
for  export  or  import  of  other  commodities  (such  as  bagged
fertilizer), the modifications required to accommodate the handling
of such commodities, and whether such modifications would be
financially viable in relation to the revenue from such commodity
traffic; and
(h)  the  cost  implications  and  inter-relation  between  each  of  the
foregoing.
Consequent upon such review, final recoumendations are to be prepared
and clearly defined.
(a) the costs of the various options;
(b) the recommended solution and the proposed further development in line
with the forecast power station extensions;

ANNEX 3.5
Page 3 of 3
(c) the parallel costs for incorporating in the design facilities, the
capability of landing fuel oil should it be decided to change over
from coal-fired to oil-fired operation;
(d) a realistic program for carrying-out the detailed engineering and bid
documentation for the jetty and connecting trunkway, the ship
unloaders,   and   associated   conveyors   from   jetty   to   power
plant/stockpile;
(e) the estimated landed cost of coal per ton at the stockyard under the
Stage II development if the jetty is used:
(i) solely for handling coal; and
(ii) for handling coal and also the other commodities as determined
during the study.
(f) the estimated charge per ton for each commodity, as ascertained above
based on the estimated quantities of traffic, which would be payable
to TPC by users to provide adequately for cost recovery, depreciation
and maintenance of the jetty.
Following discussions among the parties of the final recommendations and
agreement on such recommendations as are to be implemented, the next phase
shall be proceeded with.
STAFFING AND WORK PROGRAM
The consulting firm invited to submit proposals to undertake the
services shall provide details of similar studies and services undertaken
during the past ten years giving dates, duration and scope, the location, and
for whom the work was carried out. A sample of a typical report on a similar
type of assignment would be helpful.
The study is to be carried out by suitably experienced staff and the
CVs of all staff proposed to be employed upon this project are to be provided.
A detailed work program is to be provided showing the time to be
spent  by  each  specialist  on  his  part  of  the  phased  assignments.   The
man-months to be spent in the field and in the home office shall be clearly
shown for each phase.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
I. General
1.       All  financial  forecasts  are given for the fiscal years beginning
January 1 and ending December 31.
2.       Sources of forecasts - JEA's financial model.
II. Income Statements
3.       Sales of electricity are  based  on  the  sales  forecasts  developed
during the mission in July 1986. The sales increases used in the projections
are as follows:
1987    1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993    1994   1995

Sales for 1987 and 1988 include sales to Syria.
4.       Revenues are projected based on tariffs in effect as of June, 1986
and computed on day and night rates with MW demand charges.
5.       Government's fuel prices as of July 1986 were used for estimating
fuel costs as follows:
Fuel Type                JD/Ton
heavy fuel oil           36.5  (Hussein)
heavy fuel oil           39.5  (Aqaba)
diesel                   77.0  (gas turbines and Marka)
and tariffs are projected to increase in line with these projections for
future fuel prices in order for JEA to meet the revenue covenant. Estimates
for fuel price increases were applied as follows:
1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993    1994   1995
5%      5%      6%       7%     11%      11%     11%    112
6.       Wages and salaries and administrative costs are projected to increase
6% in 1987 and 8% annually from 1988 through 1995.
7.       Taxes - JEA is not subject to taxes.
8.       Depreciation is calculated using depreciation rates prescribed under
the laws of Jordan.

9.       IRBID compensation is stated using amounts as agreed by Government,
JEA and IDECO for offsetting tariffs not passed on to the consumers of IDECO.
III. Balance Sheets
10.      Assets are carried at book value.
11.      Accounts receivables in 1985 reflect billing error to JEPCO for the
period of October 1984 to April 1985 and assumes repayment from 1986 through
1989.
12.      Long-term debt is calculated on existing debts at interest rates and
amortization schedules in effect; the proposed financing assumes various
financial terms ranging from 42 to 8 1/22 and amortization schedules from
7 years  to  20 years.   Interest  expense  and amortization are  computed  on
implied exchange rates as of December 31 of each year.
13.      JEA capitalizes  interest to construction on projects  that  require
more than one year to complete.
14.      Customer contributions are based on the estimated costs of customer's
portion of the supply line and includes Government contributions for costs of
service to Government owned and operated installations.
15.      Reserves are based on the statutory requirements and provisions of
the Articles of Association.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
Least-Cost Analysis
1.       Methodology  -  The  WASP  III  computer  model  was  used  to  derive
least-cost generation system expansion programs based on either coal or oil as
the primary fuel for the Aqaba II generating units. The WASP model utilizes a
dynamic programming approach that combines economic factors and the technical
characteristics of the existing power generating system and of the future
generating options to determine a long-term least-cost generation expansion
program. The economic factors include the discount rate (opportunity cost of
capital), fuel costs, unserved energy cost and the capital cost of future
generating options. The technical characteristics include forced outage rate,
number of days of scheduled maintenance, etc.
2.       Since 1989 was assumed to be the starting year of the study all costs
were expressed in 1989 prices. The analysis was carried out with fuel prices
remaining constant in real terms and at escalated fuel prices. The following
are the main assumptions underlying the least-cost analysis:
(i) Load Forecasts. The projected electricity demand to be met by future
generating capacity additions is presented in Annex 1.2;
(ii)  Fuel  Prices.   The  economic cost of fuel  to Jordan  in  1989 was
established on the basis of World Bank fuel price projections.l/
Coal price was based on quotations received by Jordan from potential
suppliers of coal to the Aqaba power station. The fuel prices used
in the analysis are as follows:
Fuel Type                    Price US $/ton
Gas Oil                                 185
Heavy Fuel Oil                          105
Coal                                     53
(iii) Fuel Price Escalation was based on World Bank projections of future
oil and coal prices. These are provided on page 8 of this Annex.
(iv)  Thermal Options for Generation System Expansion.   Capital costs of
thermal generating options were taken from the Aqaba II Feasibility
Study prepared by consultants for JEA and recent bids received by JEA
for Aqaba II. Summary of capital costs of the generating options are
provided below.
1/ The 1989 price is approximately equal to the 1987 price in real terms.

(v)  Discount Rate:  Opportunity cost of capital of 10% was used.
(vi)  Unserved Energy Cost:  JEA's estimate of cost of unserved energy of
US$1.O/kWh was used.
Results
(i) At constant fuel prices (no price increase in real terms), there is
no significant difference in present value system costs between the
option with coal as the primary fuel for Aqaba II (option 1) and the
option with heavy fuel oil as the primary fuel for Aqaba II (option
2).  The cumulative present value of total system cost 1/ over the
life of Aqaba II is about US$6 million lower for option 1 compared to
option 2. Tables 1 and 2 show the least-cost generating program for
option 1 and option 2 respectively.
(ii)  At  escalated  fuel  prices  option  1  shows  substantial  economic
advantage  over  option  2.   The  cumulative  present  value  of total
system cost 1/ up to year 2015 of option 1 is about $2022 million
compared  to  about  US$2158  million.   The  results  of  least-cost
generation expansion for option 1 and for option 2 are provided in
Tables 3 and 4 respectively.

ANNEX 5.2
JORDAN
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
Rate of Return Analysis
Introduction
1.       The rate of return analysis (Attachment 1) was carried out taking the
timeslice of demand to be met by the proposed project in the electricity
subsector's 1987-94 investment program. The program is estimated to have an
economic rate of return of 192 compared to the opportunity cost of capital to
Jordan of 9%. Key assumptions are presented below.
2.       Benefits.   Due  to  the difficulties  in measuring  the benefits  of
electricity supply in an existing market, incremental revenues were taken as a
proxy for the benefits of the time slice of the investment program.
Incremental electricity sales were valued at the system-wide average
electricity price of 30 fils/kWh which is close to the estimated long-run
marginal cost (LRMC) of electricity supply.
3.       Capital and Operating Costs.  Capital cost of the project was taken
from the project cost table (Attachment 1) including physical contingency.
Capital costs of transmission and distribution system expansion required to
supply the incremental generation were taken from Jordan's electricity
subsector investment program.  Operation and maintenance costs were estimated
at  2%  of  cumulative  capital   cost   for  generation,   transmission  and
distribution.
4.       Fuel Costs.   Incremental fuel cost was estimated from the WASP III
optimization output data as the difference in the total system fuel cost in
1992 and in each subsequent year up to 1996, when the total sys.tem's
incremental demand would be equivalent to the total output of Aqaba II (the
project). Fuel costs used in the WASP III analysis are provided in Annex 5.1.
5.       All benefits and costs were expressed in January 1987 prices.  The
life of the program was taken at 30 years.
6.       Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of rate of return to changes  in
capital costs and electricity demand were investigated. Results of analysis
are shown below:
