MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENIDTION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMVNT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECWORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS
PUBLICOS
FOR A SECOND SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos (BANOBRAS) with the
guarantee of the United Mexican States for the equivalent of US$200 million to help finance
a Second Solid Waste Management Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace.
2.    Background. During the last several decades, Mexico has been urbanizing rapidly.
Approximately 61 percent of the population now lives in urban communities with a population
greater thar. 10,000 inhabitants. Urban growth rates h-ave been particularly high in many
intermediate and secondary cities, partly as a response to changes in the location of economic
activities. At the same time, successive Mexican administrations have initiated reforms to
enhance the participation of state and municipal govemments in the provision of basic services
and the protection of the environment. These developments have placed greater demands on
municipalities. Nowhere is this pressure greater than in the solid waste sector.
3.    Collection, transfer and disposal of solid waste are inadequate in most cities in Mexico.
Collection is often erratic, coverage is limited and equipment fleets are antiquated and poorly
maintained. Of total solid waste generated (over 60,000 tons per day), it is estimated that only
15 percent is properly disposed of, primarily due to poor management or absence of sanitary
landfills. Of the 97 existing controlled final disposal sites, only 11 can be considered as
technically functional landfills and these face important operational problems. Uncollected waste
is burned, left in the streets or discarded in open land or waterways. Clinical wastes, including
infectious wastes, are also improperly collected, treated and disposed of, presenting serious
public health risks.
4.    Solid waste services have generally been cffered free to households by the municipalities
although payment of gratuities to collectors is widely pract.-d. Over-staffing of municipally-
managed services is common and operating and maintenance costs are rarely disaggregated from
the costs of other municipal services. One consequence of limited resources is that some poor
and marginal areas do not receive solid waste collection service. Inadequate facilities and
management as well as scavenging for recyclable materials adversely :mpact landfill operations
as well as waste collection. Scavenging also presents serious health risks to the scavengers and
their families. Preliminary estimates indicate that approximately 4,500 persons are engaged in
garbage scavenging in the twenty-three cities expected to be covered under the project. Their
activity is low in productivity and operates in the informal sector without federal or local policy
guidance or planning. Formal sector recycling efforL are minimal. A number of municipalities
have turned to private firms in order to improve service but the municipalities have little or no
experience in arranging service contracts, awarding concessions and monitoring compliance with



-2 -
contract conditions. Consequently, performance standards under such arrangements are neither
satisfactorily established nor adhered to and the expected levels of effic;ency are rarely if ever
achieved.
5.    Development of the legal and regulatory framework for solid waste management is not
as advanced in Mexico as in other sectors such as water and sanitation. At the federal level,
responsibility for sector pianning, policies and enrvironmental regulation and enforcement rests
with the Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL) and its autonomous agencies: the
National Ecological Institute (INE) and the Offlce of the Attomey General for Protection of the
Environment (PFPA). SEDESOL's recent restructuring in early 1993 helped place in a single
organizational unit the primary responsibility for solid waste management issues.
Comprehensive standards for the sector do not exist, with current federal standards limited to
toxic and hazardous wastes and incineration air quality. BANOBRAS, the urban infrastructure
development bank, plays an important role in channeling financing to municipalities and
providing technical assistance. Article 115 of the Mexican constitution, as modified in 1983,
gives municipalities i=ir alia the responsibility for management of public services, iiicluding the
collection and disposal of solid waste. The states, nevertheless, retain authority for approving
tariffs, establishing autonomous operating agencies, granting concessions and other commitments
superseding the three-year period of municipal administratiot-
6.    The extent and quality of solid waste services vary from city to city, but most are
affected by common problems. These inciude: (a) weak institutions at the federal, state and
local levels; (b) limited availability of professional staff with adequate technical, financial and
managerial skills; (c) insufficient service coverage and lack of controlled final disposal which
has led to clandestine dumping and surface and groundwater pollution; (d) little or no cost
recovery which has not permitted sustainable investments; (e) an undeveloped regulatory
framework and inadequate analysis and monitoring of environmental impacts of solid waste
investments; and (f) scavenging by individuals and fiamilies for reusable materials which has
made movement to modern waste systtms difficult because of the inefficiencies caused during
the collection and final disposal processes.
7.    In its broadest form, the Government's strategy for halting environmental degradation and
remedying past problems is articulated in its Plan Nacional de Desarrollo: 1989-1994 and
Prorana Nacional ara la Proecci6n del Medio Ambiente. More specifically, the Government
has decided to embark on a national program of financial ana technical assistance to medium
cities for improving solid waste management and has requested the support of the Bank for this
program. The major elements of the Government's policy towards the sector ir.clude: (i)
development of federal standards and their adequate enforcement; (ii) continued support for the
process of decentralization and encouragement of an integrated approach to municipal
investments in the sector; (iii) increasing local technical and administrative capacity and
developing autonomous operating agencies; (iv) the use of federal grant financing as an incentive
to encourage municipal participation in the national program and offset the impact on tarift of
the high investment cost of immediate movement to complete and integrated municipal solid
waste systems; (v) full cost recovery through tariffs or other user charges adequate to cover



- 3 -
operating and maintenance costs, debt service for solid waste investments and contribution to
future capital needs, with an emphasis on sustainability of investments; (vi) addressing the
problem of scavengers on system efficiency and minimizing the social impact of system
modernization; and (vii) promoting greater private sector involvement in the delivery of solid
waste services.
8.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed operation is consistent with the Banlks
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mexico to be presented to the Board with the Northern
Border Environment Project (Report No. 6287-ME) on June 9, 1994 in parallel with this project.
The strategy aims at assisting Mexico to keep its economic restructuring process on track, while
supporting programs that contribute to poverty reduction, improved environmental management
and long-term sustainable economic growth and development, particularly through investments
in human resources, infrastructure and natural resource management. The strategy also aims
to push the reform process downward to the subnational (state and municipal) level and support
the further devolition of expenditure and revenue responsibilities to these local governments.
The proposed project responds to the Govemment's increased priority for taclding Mexico's
serious environmental problems, especially in the context of greater decentralization of decision-
maling and local spending authority. The project complements and reinforces Bank operations
such as the Environment Project (approved 1992) and the proposed Northem Border
Environment Project in their institutional support for key agencies involved in environmental
protection activities. The project is also closely linked with the Medium-Cities Urban Transport
Project (approved February 1993), the proposed Second Water and Sanitation Project and a State
and Municipality Management Project under preparation which support the strengthening of local
goveinments to design and implement urban infrastructure investments and to develop adequate
management and financial capacity. The Bank is well-placed to provide assistance because of
its failiarity with local government and environmental issues and its past experience in the
sector and its ability to support, through its country dialogue and project financing, the rfborms
needed to improve solid waste services and safeguard the environment.
9.    Project Objective&  The main objectives of the proposed project would be to: (a)
improve solid waste services and extend their coverage in participating medium size and priority
cities; (b) strengthen the capacity of BANOBRAS and SEDESOL to appraise and supervise solid
waste projects and provide technical assistance to municipalities and states; (c) increase
technical, administrative and regulatory capacity at the state and local levels to improve sector
management and operations; (d) improve the legal and regulatory framework and cost recovery
mechanisms of the sector to encourage greater private sector involvement and safeguard the
environment; (e) correct environmental problems and reduce health hazards caused by inadequate
collection and disposal systems; and (f) mitigate the social impact .'n garbage scavengers of the
establishment of modern waste collection and disposal systems.
10.   Project Description. The project would have three main components: (i) strengthening
of federal institutions, local governments and operating agencies which play a key role in
development of the sector; (ii) supporting the investment needs of participating cities through
implementation of comprehensive and integrated solid waste management plans; and (iii)



- 4 -
providing support for scavengers and informal workers impacted by the prqect through a social
component. TWenty-three cities with an aggregate population of about 11 million are expected
to participate in the project.
11.   The Institutional Strengthening Component (US$24.7 million) would finance technical
assistance to improve the capacity of federal agencies involved in the development and
implementation of sector policies and regulations; of states to regulate solid waste services and
of municipalities to strengthen their management and regulatory capacity as well as to fulfill
eligibility criteria for investments subloans. The SEDESOL subcomponent (US$14.2 million)
includes the financing of consulting services and equipment to: (a) strengthen SEDESOL's
capacity to promote, evaluate and supervise subprojects and assist municipalities and states in
system design and operation and preparation of social action plans; (b) implement a
strengthening progrm  for environmental management of solid waste to: (i) develop federa
standards for solid meste; (ii) introduce state and municipal regulations for solid waste through
preparation of model regulations, and technical assistance to three states on a pilot basis; (iii)
develop manuals for state and municipal environmental assessment and control of solid waste
disposal systems; and (iv) strengthen federal environmental enforcement capacity; and (c) carry
o';t studies to: (i) develop a national recycling strategy through analysis of markets, prices and
incentives for recycling, the downstream environmental impact of recycling and a public
awareness campaign; and (ii) prepare integrated solid waste management plans.  The
BANOBRAS subcomponent (US$0.9 million) would finance consultants, training and p'irchase
of equipment to strengthen the capacity of the Solid  aste Subdivision and state delegations to
review the financial and economic viability of subprojects, assist municipalities in financial
management and monitor subproject execution. The local government subcomponent (US$9.6
million) would finance: (a) technical assistance to municipalities or states to improve their solid
waste planning and management capacity and prepare final engineering designs and
environmental impact assessments; and (b) development and implementation of a National
Thining Program (NTP) to increase state and local government technical, environmental,
regulatory and administrative capacity.
12.   The component foi Investment Support for Implementation of Integated Solid Waste
Managmn Plans (US$384.7 million) would finance a line of credit through BANOBRAS for
onlending to participating municipalities or their states for implementoolni of integrated solid
waste management plans. Such plans would support: (i) full collection coverage, including
marginal areas; (ii) waste storage in high density polyethylene containers with lids; (iii) a
modern and appropriate collection vehicle fleet; (iv) least cost final eisposal facilities, including
a minimum life span for sanitary landfills of 10 years when that is the selected alternative; (v)
strict environmental pollution control measures, including landfill impermeabilization, leachate
drainage and treatment, biogas control systems, vegetation buffer zones, separate handling and
treatment of hospital wastes, and monitoring wells and surface runoff collection for water quality
sampling and analysis; and (vi) closing of current dumpsites and their integration into the
surrounding landscape. Th.e component would specifically finance: (a) civil works, such as
construction of transfer stations, landfills, incineration plants, containment cells for hospital
wastes, recycling and composting plants, access roads and dumpsite closing; (b) purchase of



- 5 -
equipment, vehicles and spare parts for collection, transport and final disposal of solid waste,
including hospital waste handled by the municipality; and (c) the construction and equipping of
recycling stations near sanitary landfills to provide a sanitary, safe and efficient environment for
garbage scavengers. Eligibility criteria for investment subprojects would be: (a) the municipaiity
has established within its administrative structure an area responsible for managing solid waste
services with separate accounts with independent auditing; (b) the municipality has committed
to apply service charges to achieve full cost recovery; (c) existence of final engineering designs
and a satisfactory social action plan; and (d) a satisfactory environmental impact assessment.
Iechnical assistance to help municipalities in meeting the above eligibility criteria would be
provided by SEDESOL and through technical assistance subloans, for which the eligibility
criteria are that: (a) the municipality has a population greater than 80,000 inhabitants or has been
identified as a strategic priority; and (b) the municipality has expressed interest in the program
through a letter of intention to comply with project conditions.
13.  The Social Component for Scavengers (US$6.1 million) would finance: (a) training in
basic slklls, specialization in reccling and in other vocational areas, and basic health, nutrition
and child care; (b) provision of basic infrastructure and building materials for self-help
construction for families currently living in dumps which will be closed or transformed Lito
sanitary landfills under the project; and (c) city-specific marlet studies for recycling.
14. Project Costs and ianalcing. The Bank loan is expected to finance about 48 percent
of total project eosts. The remaining 52% would be funded through federal grants and municipal
contributions. HANOBRAS would onlend the loan proceeds to subborrowers in Mexican pesos
at a vanable interest rate not loaer than the Government Treasury bill rate (CETES) or the
banking system's average cost of funds (CPP) plus 2 percentage points, whichever is higher,
with a loan term of up to 15 years, including grace periods of up to three years. To partially
offset the costs of the necessary supervision, BANOBRAS will include in the financing of each
subloan an amount equivalent to four percent of the cost of civil works for each subproject, of
which 70% would be retained by the municipality for supervision and 30% would be aaable
to SEDESOL for the same purpose. Subborrowers would be eligible for separate subloans for
technical assistance and investment.  Funds provided through federal and municipal
contributions, in cash or in kind, would be combined with loan funds and would be allocated
according to a Poverty Index developed by the Government's National Population Council
(CONAPO). Poorer municipalities will receive a higher proportion of funding as grants. The
grants would allow tariffs to be set at a lower level and are reasonable given the high cost of
immediate movement to comprehensive and integrated municipal solid waste systeims. The
financing percentages would be reviewed and adjusted if necessary at the time of the project's
mid term review to improve the project's targeting of federl grants to the poorer municipalities.
Federal grant financing, which is expected to average about 35% of the program, is justified by
environmental benefits arsing from expected improvements in solid waste management which
tanslate in external economies that benefit the community at large. Retroactive financing of up
to UTS$5.0 million is proposed for expenditures incurred after February 15, 1994. It will be used
to finance consulting services for SEDESOL, and BANOBRAS for institutional gtrengthening and
preparation of final engineering designs necessary for initial project start up. The breakdown



- 6-
of estimated costs and the proposed financing plan are provided in Schedule A. The amounts
and methods of procurement and the proposed alocation of loan proceeds are provided in
Schedule R A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are
presented in Schedules C and a. Also attached is the Staff Appraisal Report No. 12848-ME
dated May 16, 1994.
15.   Project Implementation. BANOBPRAS, the borrower and financial agent of the Mexican
Government, would be responsible for carrying out the project. BANOBRAS would review and
approve investment lubloans, be responsible for the financial aspects of procurement and for
processing and negotiating subloan agreements. BANOBRAS would also be responsible for final
evaluation of subpwojects.  SEDESOL would serve as the normative and regulatory
environmental agency and would be responsible for: (i) developing and applying sector policies
and regulations; (ii) assisting municipalities in project preparation, construction and supervision
of works; (J;i) providing technical assistance to municipalities to establish operating entities and
administer newly developed solid waste systems; (iv) developing and implementing the national
training program; and (v) implementing the strengthening program  for environmental
management. SEDESOL would contract the services of a consulting firm to assist in the
evaluation and management of subprojects and technical support to municipalities. An NGO or
consultants would al3o be contracted to handle implementaion of the social component for
scavengers. PFPA would be responsible for initial and annual inspecuon of mnunicipal landfills
with respect to environmental control measures for drainage and treatment of leachates and
biogas venting and for ensuring enforcement of federal environmental regulations related to solid
waste. SEDESOL and BANOBRAS have delegated much of the responsibility for day-to-day
operations to their state representatives. Inadequate technical capacity in the state offices has
been a problem under an oni,oing pilot project (see parm. 17 below). This issue is being
addressed through the NTP to be financed under the project. The project's execution period
would be 1994-99. The Bank would approve la an  the firt five subproj,xts, subprojects with
a total cost greater than US$10 million, subprojects for which states would be subborrowers and
any subprojects wbich affect more than 200 scavengers.
16.  Project Susanabil ty. Project sustainability depends fundamentally on the Mexica.n
Government's continued commitment to environmental protection. It will be achieved by
improved regulatory capacity at the national, state and local level, adopting adequate cost-
recovery mechanisms, and expanding private sector imolvement, which is expected to result in
significantly improved management. The NTP will help increase the technical capacity of local
authorties and professionals involved in the sector. Subproject supervision will cover both
construction and system operation. Service charges adequate to cover operating and maintenance
costs and debt service for inveetments would be both an eligibility criteria for receiving subloans
and a condition of default for subborrowse  Financial and opeaing targets for the operating
agencies vill be included as subloan covenants.
17.  Lessons Learmed from Previous Bank Involvement. The Bank's only involvement in
the sector to date has been the ongoing Solid Waste Management Pilot Project (Ln. 2669-ME
for US$26 million) which was approved in 1986. The main lessons learned from the experience



- 7 -
under the pilot project and a review of PCRs and PARs for urban projects in Mexico and urban
projects in other countries which contain solid waste co-monents are: (a) the importance of
developing integrated plans for municipal solid waste management to avoid a piecemeal approach
to irriestment and ensure satisfactory environmental controls; (b) the need to have full cost
recovery wo promote t!> sustainability of investments and efi :ent service delivy; (c) the
elimination of competing sources of finance for solid wstae investments and provision of
adequate counte!part funding; and (d) the avoidance of complex, multi-sectoral, multi-
institutional projects. These lessons have been incorporated in the project's design, with
particular emphasis on integTated solutions to municipal solid waste management and the use of
full cost recovery and sustainable collection mechanisms.
18.   Actions Agreed. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following: (a)
eligibility cri(eria for participating municipalities and onlepding conditions; (b) the n-ix of credit,
federal grants and local govenment contribution based on the Poverty Index, and the
commitment to provide adequate federal budget finance througbout the project; (c) the general
content, organizational and implementation arrangements of the NTP; (d) the strengthening
program for environmental management of solid waste, including the iming of prepartion and
issuance of federal regulations and the inspection of municipal sanitary landfills by PFPA; (e)
that all federal financing for municipal solid waste investments for medium size and priority
cities would be provided under the same eligibility criteria and financial conditions as the
proposed project; and (f) the project's implementation plan, including objective-oriented
performance indicators.
19.   Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that: (a) the Guarantor and BANOBRAS have
provided to the Bank an executed contract, satisfhctory to the Bank, descrbing
Guarantor/BANOBRAS transfers and relending procedures; (b) completion of final engineering
designs for two non-conurbated cities; (c) hiring of the coordinator for the project's social
component; (d) selection of three states for a pilot program of T.A. to establish and implement
regulations for solid waste management and environmental assessment of solid waste
investments; and (e) preparation of a project operation manual, satisIfctory to the Bank. As a
condition of disbursement of investment subloans, all counterpart staff, including consultants,
for SEDESOL and BANOBRAS, as described in their rewpective strengthening programs, will
need to be in place.
20.   Environmeut  Aspects. The project has an "A" rating. Complete environmental
impact assessments will be prepared as part of the integrated solid waste management plans to
identify and include preventive and corrective actions which may be required in each of the
financed subprojects to mitigate possible negative impacts. Environmental impact assessments
for seven cities and a sectoral environmental assessment were completed and an Evironmental
Assessment Summary was submitted to the Board of Executive Directors on February 2, 1994.
The proposed project would resuilt in substantial environmental improvements in participating
cities, as currently inefficiekit or nonexistent solid waste collection and disposal systems would
be replaced by properly designed and operated ones. The project would introduce federal
regulations governing the construction and operation of sanitary landfills and initial and annual



- 8 -
inspections by the PFPA of environmental control measures. The capacity of SEDESOL and
state agencies to r;onitor municipal compliance with envronmental norms would be strengthened
through training and technical assistance.
21.    Program Objective Category. The project is expected to have a significant impact on
poverty through the extension of service to maginal areas in cities which othervise would not
be able or willing to provide garbage collection. Thie project also includes schemes to improve
the living and working conditions of scavengers, one of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors
of urban socidAy, many of whom are women with children, through: (i) their resettlement from
open dumps or inadequately maintained landfills which will be closed or rehabilitated under the
project; (ii) investments for more orgnied recycling activities; and (iii) training to open up
other employment opportunities.
22.   Project Benefits. The project will improve solid waste services for an estimated 11
million people in the 23 cities which are expected to participate on a first-come first-served
basis. The main benefits of the project will be better collection practices, improving urban
environmental quality, and the replacement of open dumps with controlled sanitary landfills
which will eLiminate leachate contamiation of surface and ground water resources, reduce
possible public health effects and control disposal of dangerous commercial and industrial wastes
in municipal sanitary landfills. Improved management of hospital wastes through specialized
collection, equipment, appropnate disposal and training of municipal personnel will lower publhc
health consequences from uncontrolled disposal of infectious and pathological wastes. The
project will also strengthen the overall framework for solid waste management in the
municipalities, establish norms arnd develop a regulatory and enforcement capacity in SEDESOL
and promote full cost recovery, including operatons and maintenance, resulting2 in the
sustainability of the investments. Private sector participation, which is expected to help to
improve th1 efficiency of solid waste service, wwld be encouraged and supported through the
investments made under the project, an improved regulatory framework, increased municipal
experience with tariffs and concession agreements and the preparation and use of model bidding
and contract documents.
23.   Risks. The technology involved in the investments required for solid waste management
is standard and does not present any unusual risks. The main risks to the project are: (a) weak
institutional capacity at the local government level to op. rate and maintain the investments and
the inherent difficulties which municipalities will face in introducing and maintaining adequate
tariffs where previously none existed; (b) failure by SEDESOL and BANOBRAS to ensure that
subprojects are of good technical quality and that subloan eligibility conditions and covenants
are met in the face of pressures from state and municipal -wemments to lend; (c) resistance
from scavengers in adapting to new solid waste systems; and (d) insufficient annual budgetary
allocations to SEDESOL which would delay subloan commitments and technical support to
municipalities.

24.   The Government's commitment to develop and reform the solid waste sector serves as
the over-arching element for mitigating the identified risks. In addition, these risks have been
reduced through the project's design and the loan's conditionality. To address the risks related
to execution of investments and operation of the new systems by the municipalities, the project
includes a strong technical assistance component, extensive capacity building through the
National Training Progrnam and support to municipalities and states for establishing and
implementing regulations for solid waste under the strengthening program for environmental
management. 'l ensure subproject technical quality and enforcement of eligibility criteria the
project incl- es instituional strengthening progams for SEDESOL and BANOBRAS. The use
of the integi4ted plans that take into account all components of municipal solid waste services,
technical assistance to help municipalities meet the project's eligibility criteria and the operating
and financial parameters to be agreed for sublo3n agreements for each city would all serve to
reduce this risk further. The risk related to the role of scavengers in the new systems is
mitigated by the social action plans to be prepared and assistance to be provided under the
project's social component as well as a strong public participatory process. The risk related to
adequate federal budget for the project will be addressed through annual consultations prior to
the Government's budget cycle to identify federal financing requirements for the following year
and through usage of budget monitoring indicators. Inadequate counterpart funds would be a
condition of default of the Bank loan. Close supervision combined with the annual ana mid term
reviews will permit the Bank to address implementation difficulties and any budgetary issues that
may arise. Given the above actions and loan conditionalities, the above risks are acceptable in
view of the substantial project benefits.
25.  Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Article
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
