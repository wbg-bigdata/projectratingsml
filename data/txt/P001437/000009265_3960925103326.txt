PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LIBERIA
LOFA COUNTY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
CREDIT 1242-LBR
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Lofa County
Agricultural Development Project II in Liberia, for which Credit 1242-
LBR in the amount of SDR 13.3 million (US$15.5 million equivalent) was
approved on May 4, 1982. The Project was co-financed by the African
Development Fund (ADF) which provided a loan equivalent to about US$9.6
million. The Closing Date for the IDA Credit was June 30, 1987.
Earlier a review by IDA and the Government officials in May 1987 had
concluded that the Project (along with a few other on-going projects in
Liberia) was not expected to achieve the desired development impact
under the circumstances then prevailing in the country and that the
Credit should be closed on schedule and the undisbursed balance be
cancelled. However, in order to honor withdrawal applications the Credit
was closed on September 29, 1988, over a year behind schedule.  An
amount of SDR 3.8 million (US$4.9 million equivalent) remained
undisbursed and was cancelled with effect from the above date.
2.    The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III) was
prepared by the Agricultural Operations Division (AF4AG) of the Western
Africa Department in the Africa Regional office. The Borrower was not
sent Parts I and III nor could they provide Part II because the
Government collapsed as a result of the ongoing civil war. Preparation
of this PCR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit
Agreement; supervision reports, correspondence between the IDA and the
Borrower; and internal IDA memoranda.

LOFA COUNTY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
CREDIT 1242-LBR
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.          Backaround:  Agriculture a:c-.nted for about 35 percent of
Liberia's GDP and about 60 percent of employment. Land was not a
constraint for agricultural development. Rice is the main staple and is
largely grown ir uplands areas. The growth in agriculture was estimated
at 4.1 percent per annum for the period 1976-1980. With the collapse of
the Government, the continuing civil war situation is likely to have
serious impact on the agriculture sector.
2.          Obiectives:  The project was intended to consolidate the
experiences and achievements of the first Lofa project and extend
agricultural services to that part of the upper Lofa county not covered
by the first project. The project aimed at increasing production of
rice (upland and swamp) and cassava by improved farm management, new
planting of coffee and cocoa and rehabilitation of smallholder coffee
farms and thereby increasing farmers' income. The project was to
reorganize cooperatives to enable them to take over input distribution,
credit, and primary produce marketing functions. It was to start
integration of project staff with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and
to seek immprovements in the operations of the Liberia Produce Marketing
Corporatior. (LPMC).
3.          ImRlementation Experience:  The IDA supervision missions
found the project management to be good and the staff well motivated.
However, the Borrower's commitment to the Project was not adequate.
Its implementation-was far from satisfactory for a variety of reasons,
some external to the Project such as suspension of disbursement by
donors. Extension activities and agricultural services were carried out
indifferently. While IDA missions detected the need to modify the
technical solutions offered to farmers in light of the implementation
experience and recommended specific changes, the adoption of these
changes was below expectation. Efforts to develop cooperatives as a
viable alternative to LPMC and/or licensed agent activities,
particularly for marketing of crops, were unsuccessful. LPMC was not
effective in fulfilling its market functions due to financial Ss well as
organizational problems and the Government failed to take determined
action to reform LPMC. The Project Unit staff grew disproportionately



- iv -
to its development activities. The Borrower and its agencies remained
poorly coordinated, thus reducing the possibility of taking effective
action to achieve desired results. There were major shortfalls in the
Government's contributions to project funding, particularly in the later
years. The provalence of unethical practices at all levels contributed
to a sense of demoralization, which was not conducive to innovative and
vigorous actions towards achievement of project goals.
4.          Resultss  The Project's primary goal of increasing
agricultural output and farmers' incomes was only partially attained.
Concerning crop area and yield, coffee rehabilitation and upland rice
did well in terms of appraisal targets, but swamp rice, new coffee and
cocoa were well below SAR estimates. The Pi ject's performance with
respect to institutional development (cooperatives and LPMC) was most
unsatisfactory. The Project expenditures were unbalanced with
administrative expenses taking a lion's share. The Ministry of
Agriculture's extension service was weak and witheut links to research.
The aim of integrating project staff with MOA could not be achieved.
Loan recovery from the farmers was poor. The overall result of this
project is unlikely to meet its main objectives because of
implementation problems exacerbated by macroeconomic and institutional
problems. Data for formal economic and financial analysis are not
available since a PCR mission has not visited the country following
completion of the project on June 30, 1987 because of the deteriorating
country situation resulting from the ongoing civil war.
5.          Sustainabilitvt  The project organization as it emerged at
the end of the project implementation period was not cost-effective and
could not be sustained beyond the period of external donor ft,nd
availability. The institutional set-up for extension, input delivery
and outpul marketing required substantial improvements and its
sustenanc, would otherwise have been pointless. The technological
package offered to the farmers needed more testing and adaptation for
further application in the County. The integration of all agricultural
staff in the Ministry of Agriculture, a project objective which was
essential to maintaining coordinated development activities in the
County, was not attained.
6.          Findings and Lessons Learned:
(a)   Follow-up projects can have pitfalls due to ready
replication of earlier projects. Prudence would demand a
more critical evaluation of the results of preceding
projects and designing later projects in light of the
lessons learned (para 7);
(b)   It is often preferable to pause in project development in
order to settle the emerging institutional issues and test
the technological solutions. Outcome in such cases are
slower but surer in the long run (para 9);
(c)   In designing a project, consideration should be given to
Borrower's views to elicit their participation. The



- v -
Borrower's comnitment to the project is critical to its
success (para 19);
(d)   Subsistence farmers with their traditional practices and
cultural barriers are most difficult to change without
adequate incentives--particularly higher output prices.
Attempts to assist them directly and rapidly may encounter
difficulties. It may ofter. be more expedient to strengthen
the cooperatives and assist the non-subsistence farmers.
This would lead to the gradual development of subsistence
farming through institutional assistance. Demonstration
effect of and provision of ready services by enterprising
larger farmers can also be very cost-effective and
beneficial (para 19);
(e)   In the early stages of development, productivity increases
in subsist ace farming could be more easily obtained by
improved husbandry than cash inputs (e.g. fertilizer);
introduction of cash inputs can follow as the farmers get
ready for adaptation (para 13); and
(f)   The farmer could easily lose incentive if he is unable to
readily market his crops at a fair price; all his production
efforts would otherwise be an exercise in futility (para
11) .

PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK PERSPECTIVE
Proiect Identity
Project Name:      Lofa County Agricultural Development Project II
Loan No.:          1242-LBR
WVP Unit:          Africa
Country:           Liberia
Sector:            Agriculture
Subsector:         Food and Tree Crops - Subsistence Agriculture
A.    Background
1.          The main thrust of the Liberian Government economic policy
during the 1970s and 1980s was to expand the country's productive
capacity, especially in agriculture, and to ensure that benefits from
economic growth were enjoyed by an increasing number of Liberians.
Agriculture was the largest productive sector in Liberia's economy,
accounting for 35 percent of GDP. The rate of growth of agriculture was
estimated at 4.1 percent per annum for the period 1976 to 1980. About
60 percent of the total population earned a livelihood from agriculture.
With low average population density, land was not a constraint to
agricultural development. However, there were still constraints on
agricultural development, e.g. lack of ongoing analysis of economic and
institutional aspects, shortage of qualified and experienced
agricultural staff and agricultural support services (e.g. marketing)
and poorly developed farmer's organizations.
2.          The Government gave high priority to agricultural and rural
development, particularly for the benefit of smallholders. The
Government's objective was to improve traditional farming by increasing
on-farm productivity and supporting marketing and processing, as well as
related social and other infrastructure. The land-use policy was to
encourage cultivation of rice in the swamps and to grow tree crops on
the uplands. This was because swamp rice carried much higher yield
potential compared to upland rice and tree crops offered a far superior
monetary return compared with upland rice.
3.          The Lofa Agricultural Development Project II (Lofa II) was
the Bank Group's seventh lending operation for agriculture in Liberia.
Six other projects for a total of US$45.6 million consisted of a pilot
rubber development study and technical assistance, two county
agricultural development projects including the first phase Lofa
Project, and Rubber, Forestry and Oil Palm Development projects. Bank
Group lending for agriculture supported the Government's objectives of
diversifying production and increasing smallholder participation in
development.
4.          The Lofa II project aimed at increasing food production and
farm incomes by extending assistance to smallholder farmers initiated
under the first project (Credit 577-LBR). About 8,000 additional farm



families were expected to earn significantly higher incomes; improvement
in agricultural services, roads and wells were to bencfit a majority of
the rural families in the region. The project was, therefore, in line
with the Government's sector and macro policy objectives. The crop
components reflected the Government's land use preferences.
B.    Proiect Obiectives and Components
(i)   Obiectives
5.          The project was intended to consolidate the experiences and
achievements of the first Lofa project and extend agricultural services
to that part of the upper Lofa county not covered by the first project.
The project aimed at increasing production of rice (upland and swamp)
and cassava by improved farm management, new planting of coffoe and
cocoa and rehabilitation of smallholder coffee farms and thereby
increasing farmers' income. The project was to reorganize cooperatives
to enable them to take over input distribution, credit, and primary
produce marketing functions. It was to start integration of project
staff with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and to seek improvements in
the operations of the Liberia Produce Marketing Corporation (LPMC).
(ii) Components
6.          The Project comprised of the following components:
(a)   the supply on credit of agricultural inputs, such as
fertilizers, to improve production of upland and swamp rice,
cassava, coffee and cocoa;
(b)   expansion and improvement of extension services us.ng the
Training and Visit (T & V) system with female extension
workers to reach women-farmers:
(c)   staff training to improve the extension program and
cooperatives;
(d)   production of improved cocoa and coffee seedlings and
cassava setts, and adaptive research into upland cropping
systems;
(e)   improvement -f cooperatives to enable them to take over
responsibility for input supply, credit an. marketing;
(f)   improvement in the marketing operations of the LPMC;
(g)   schistosomiasis monitoring and control in swamp rice areas;
(h)   construction, upgrading and maintenance of feeder roads and
farm trecks, village wells and latrines; and



(i)   the establishment of a central monitoring and evaluation
section of the Ministry of Agriculture and funding for
evaluation studies.
C.    Proiect Design and Organization
7.          The Lofa County Agricultural Development Project II was a
follow-up to Credit 577-LBR (Agricultural Development-LOFA).
Preparation and appraisal staff replicated the design and organization
of the earlier project. The assessment of the results of the first
project also seemed somewhat more favorable than might be justified.
Consequently, the second project did not fully benefit from all the
lessons of the earlier project. The experience of projects in Liberia,
as in some other developing countries, had already indicated that
traditional agriculture of subsistence farmers (the target group of the
project) was difficult to change. It was more advisable in the
beginning to promote better husbandry through demonstration plots and
extension work, than to introduce new ways of farming involving
significant cash investments. The project, however, attempted to
provide better seeds, credit, fertilizer, etc. without too mucl. success
in improving productivity. Also certain cultural barriers and
attitudinal factors were ignored in emphasizing swamp rice component in
the project. Swamp rice cultivation was regarded as inferior work
reserved for women and was to be practiced where land was scarce and
production for domestic consumption was necessary (not as a cash crop).
it was not surprising, therefore, to find that both in terms of area and
yield, the swamp rice development was a failure. The project included a
technological package which was not sufficiently attractive to the
farmers and in some cases still under experimentation. Naturally,
conflicting advice was sometimes given to the farmers (e.g. the utility
or otherwise of shade trees in coffca farms).
8.          In matters of organization, the project started with a
potential problem.  MOA's agricultural staff (located, but not working
in the project area) received different pay and benefits than Project
staff working in the same county. The marketing issue was identified
early but the Project was launched with Liberia Produce Marketing
Corporation (LPMC) suffering chronically from cash availability, and
problems with procurement, price level and the timing of payments. The
weak cooperatives were to be strengthened by supervision and training,
and a specialist was provided to reorganize the operations of these
societies. Interesting, however, organizational provisions included the
use of village level cooperative units, group meetings undez the T&V
system and other group activities for raising comnitment and
responsibility of the farmers. Also, provision of extension services
was specifically made for independent female farmers and for farmers'
wives who had been somewhat constrained socially from direct contact
with male extension workers.
9.          It would not be correct to say that the appraisal and
supervision staff were unaware of the design and organizational problems



- 4 -
mentiot.ed above.  However, a certain amount of undue optimism about
remedying the deficiencies in design and organiization of the project
could be detected. Quite early in the credit processing stage, the
Bank's senior management had pointed out the need for working out the
LPMC's restructuring and a more critical reappraisal of the experience
of the first Lofa project before proceeding quickly with a follow-up
credit. However, on the ground that continuity was needed in the
operations and staffing of the ongoing development program, the credit
was pushed through and declared effective. It was natural, therefore,
that the project execution period was marked throughout by problems
associated with the identified but unresolved issues. On hindsight, it
appears that it would have been preferable for IDA to delay project
development to permit settlement of identified institutional problems
and technological issues.
D.    Proiect Implementation
10.         In the face of the traditional antipathy of farmers to work
in swamps and the labor requirements of such cultivation, the swamp rice
development program faltered. About fifty percent of the extension
effort was devoted to it. For upland rice, seeds distributed by the
Project had only ten percent more yield capacity than seeds obtained by
exchange from Gther farmers. The proj.ct seeds w.ere also not readily
available in adequate quantities. In fact, labor availability (for
swamp rice) was a constraint in the project area and the upland rice
development had more scope Eor expioitation than the project envisaged.
Also, more adaptive research and evaluation of the results were
necessary before offering particular technical solutions to the farmers.
For example, farmers were encouraged by the project to cut shade trees
in coffee farms in the early years. Substantial project funds were
spent on equipment and staff in this effort. Later, it wAs found not to
be beneficial without benefit of fertilizers, and the shade trees had to
be gradually restored. IDA missions also found the necessity for
coordinating advice by various donor agency officials in such technical
matters. The need for integration in the !.ofa County of MOA staff and
project unit staff was recognized early, but with the exception of the
Chief Agricultural Officer of the Lofa County doubling as the Project
Manager, nothing much happened in this respect during the entire project
implementation period. The project staff members enjoyed greater
benefits than the regular MOA staff, but lack of assurance of eventual
absorption in MOA meant considerable uncertainty as to their future job
security.
11.         At the time of credit closing, costs for the project reached
75Z (about US$21.0 million) of appraisal estimate (about TJZ$28.0
million). However, the performance was not balanced. Admin..strative
costs were about 1772 of appraisal estimates while productive activities
were being underfulfilled. Expenditure on agricultural extension and
training were 73? and 582 respectively of the appraisal estimates.
12.         The unsatisfactory marketing arrangements for inputs and
outputs was a major problem of the project. This was also the main
reason why the credit Closing Date was not extended by IDA and a large



-5
amount of credit funds was cancelled. It was envisaged that the
cooperatives would be developed under the project; this was expected to
alleviate a lot of the input and credit distribution, as well as crop
marketing problems. However, in spite of the appointment of some key
senior staff and increasing the number of the cooperatives, these
organizations never achieved sufficient strength and efficiency. IDh
missions were frustrated with this situation and in 1987 concluded that
even the Cooperative Union Manager in Voinjama, the principal city in
the County, lacked interest, leadership and strong managerial force to
guide and strengthen the cooperatives.  The failure of LPMC to fulfill
its marketing functions compounded the difficulties of the farmers and
the objective of increasing their output and income through incentives
could not be achieved.  A study on LPMC's marketing was carried out with
a view to preparing a plan of action for implementation but until IDA's
last supervision in January, 1987, nothing was done by the Government.
Significant efforts, however, were made under the project to reach
female farmers and farmers' wives and encourage them to improve home
gardening and diversify crops for greater variety in diet. Craft
courses were also provided and the female participation rate for all the
above matters was satisfactory.
E.    Proiect Results
13.         The project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1986,
but since IDA funds were still available, project activities continued
until June 30, 1987, when the Credit was closed. According to the
estimates of the last supervision mission in January 1987, actual new
area cultivated and yields obtained were below appraisal estimates. The
revised appraisal targets were oaily exceeded for coffee rehabilitation
area and nearly achieved in respect of the area for upland rice - seed
exchange. Achievement of crop area targets for swamp rice, new coffee
and new cocoa was only between 40 to 50 percent of the appraisal
estimates. Actual crop yields for upland rice and coffee rehabilitation
were comparable to appraisal estimates, but that of swamp rice, new
coffee and cocoa were below appraisal estimates.
14.         The unsatisfactory results appear to be mainly due to the
inappropriate development strategy, ineffective extension service and
absence of a viable marketing system. Towards the end of the project,
IDA missions had recognized that given the small size of the family
farms (seldom above 2 ha) and their low technological levels, increases
ir productivity could be obtained in the early stages from better
husbandry methods, and without the use of cash inputs such as
fertilizers, pesticides or machinery. The MOA was weak and its
extension service lacked clearly defined purpose. Supervision was loose
and there was no systematic monitoring. The extension eervice had no
links with research activities.
15.         The project had devoted a large part of the available
financing to administrative expenses and vehicle operating costs, to the
detriment of other productive activities. The project's performance in
cooperative development, input supply and credit administration was less
than satisfactory. Recovery of seasonal loans in the years 1983-85



averaged only 51 percent. LPMC had perennial lack of funds which
hindered its ability to buy crops from farmers, disrupting marketing and
credit recovery. IDA's suspension of disbursement of Liberian Loans and
Credits on two occasions during the project implementation period (on
country debt service grounds) compounded the financial problems. The
incentives amongst the farmers that the project was able to develop were
stifled by the problem of inadequate and erratic marketing (through
LPMC). This, however, could not be solved in the context of the
project, particularly since its origins resided in the difficult state
of Government finances.
F.    Proiect Sustainability
16.         The sustainability issue relates to whether the
organization, financing and the activities of the project were such that
these could be absorbed within the regular functioning and financial
abilities of the country. Insofar as the Second Lofa Project (along
with the first phase) was covering the entire Lofa county, and it was
consistent with the Government's decentralization decision to organize
development and administrative efforts on a county basis, project
activities were to be continued into the future. The deficiencies in
the project's strategy and institutional arrangements have been raised
in other sections of the PCR. Here we would raise only the two major
issues of integration with Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and cost-
effectiveness, which are somewhat inter-related. With a semi-autonomous
management unit, the project hired its own staff at salary levels higher
than those of MOA, which also had its agricultural staff in the project
area.   The project also provided its own training facilities and
physical infrastructure which further added to costs. The MOA remained
weak and outside the sphere of the major development efforts under the
project (and similar other projects) which rendered duplication of the
project approach on a national level unlikely, considering the financial
constraints of the Government.
17.         The Project unit remained over-staffed, in spite of some
reductions made with IDA's encouragement. Even in mid-1987, at the time
of credit closing, there was serious imbalance in staffing and operating
costs between administrative and productive divisions. In terms of
expenditures, in the first four years of the project with 75Z of the
project funds utilized, administrative expenditure was about 1762 of the
appraisal estimates, while expenditures on Agricultural extension and
training were 732 and 58Z respectively. The project was not sustainable
at this level of administrative expenses beyond the period of external
donor financing of bulk of such expenditures.
G.    IDA Performance
18.         As has been mentioned in the section dealing with project
design, IDA performance in the early stages of the project cycle was
marked by an approach which, though cognizant of the fundamental
difficulties (e.g. technology, cooperatives, LPHC and marketing) facing
the project, was unduly optimistic about their timely and successful
resolution. The technological (e.g. seeds, swamp preparation) issues



-7-
were not fully assessed until well into project execution. The causes
of inadequacies in the cooperatives and LPMC in respect of input
distribution and marketing were expected to be diagnosed after the
project began and expected to be cured early during the project
implementation. The supervision missions laboriously grappled with
these matters and met with project officials and ministers, introduced
consultants and studies, and attempted to promote action plans. These
efforts, however, were not very successful due to the financial
situation prevailing in the country and the inherent lack of
coordination at the highest levels of the government and its
parastatals.
19.         The cultural traditions in the country, whether in respect
of rice cultivation or use of public funds and resources, were perhaps
not fully comprehended by IDA staff (e.g. public bodies as sources of
patronage). Also, the assessment by successive IDA missions of the
Liberian project management as consistently good and highly motivated
seemed at odds with the project's uneven and unsatisfactory performance.
A sad example of the Project Management's priorities was the increase in
administrative costs while productive activities were being
underfulfilled. During 1986 when staff was reduced by about 100,
reductions in expenditures for Plant Production, Civil Works, Health and
Commercial Services were between 24 and 45 percent. At the same time,
administrative staff increased by 29 percent. The Project Management
could have benefitted by closer attention and guidance from the IDA
missions. This might have allowed significant mid-term changes to
project strategy and action plans.
H.    Borrower Performance
20.         Towards the end of the first phase of tha Lofa project and
before the preparation of the Second Project, the Liberian Government
had changed as a result of an army coup in April 1980. It was
interesting to note that this change did not materially affect the
commitment of the Liberians to the two Lofa projects. The ministers in
the new government took interest in the projects and were regularly
accessible to IDA missions. Perhaps more use could have been Liade by
the missions of this level of involvement on the part of the policy
makers in reforming the project and resolving the implementation
problems. Even at the project design stage, the Minister of Agriculture
had suggested that the IDA could concentrate on development of the
cooperatives and assistance to non-subsistence farmers, while the MOA
would deal with the subsistence farmers. It appears that IDA staff did
not sufficiently consider this suggestion and proceeded to replicate the
first phase in designing the second project. In retrospect, it may have
been more prudent for IDA to first concentrate on strengthening the
vital input delivery, credit and marketiag functions through
cooperatives which would later have permitted more efficient assistance
to the subsistence farmers. Weakness of the cooperative system was a
serious handicap of the project. Also, IDA staff could avoid the
obsession of directly reaching the subsistence farmers. Often the
development of the non-subsistence sector is a surer way to assist the
subsistence farmers because of the considerable demonstration effect.



Also, cost-effective and timely services and inputs can often be
provided by the non-subsistence sector.
21.         On the other hand, lack of financial support by the
Government was a major problem for the project, particularly during the
later years. The shortfall in Government's actual funding of the
project from appropriations during the years 1983-84 and 1984-85 (first
two quarters) was 50 percent and 99 percent respectively. The project
activities were then grinding to a halt due to inadequate counterpart
funds. The Government also dragged its feet in preparing LPHC reform
plans, and perhaps against the best judgement of IDA management, the
study and restructuring of LPMC was agreed to be done during the project
period instead of preceding it. Again, the LPMC's marketing performance
or the lack of it was the most serious constraint faced by the Project.
In June, 1985, an IDA mission observed that the marketing problem was
due to the physical shortage of cash and to LPMC's weak financial
situation and that the farmer producers and cooperatives were having to
bear the heaviest burden. In order to market farmers' produce, many
cooperatives had to borrow heavily at high interest rates from
commercial banks; the only way they could break even or make a profit
was by rapid turnover of sales. Since LPMC was unable to pay when crops
were delivered, most cooperatives incurred heavy losses. Farmers had to
sell to whoever would buy at about half the regulated price; this
affected the farmer's ability to repay loans, and was a disincentive to
production. There was, however, no determined effort on the part of the
Government to streamline LPMC's operations and speed up payments.
Revocation of licenses of licensed buying agents who were found to be
paying less than minimum prices was also not made. The Government was
advised by IDA to encourage the private sector to play a wider role in
marketing, in parallel with LPMC. Not much attention was paid to this
suggestion by the Government possibly because LPMC was a major source of
patronage of the senior officials who had drained off LPMC's surplus of
funds (or equity) years ago.
I.    Consultina Services
22.         Project consultants provided valuable assistance to the
Project management in project implementation including training of local
staff. A good relationship existed between the consultants and the
Project management and the Borrower.
J.    Proiect Documentation and Data
23.         The documentation for the project was adequate.  The Credit
Agreement was quite adequate for achieving project objectives. The
appraisal report provided a useful framework for review of project
implmentation.

Comments:
(a)  These figures are based on the January 1987 Supervision Mission Report and
need to be vi*ewed with caution since it appears the sampling procedures
used by the Project Monitoring & Evaluation unit is heavily biased towards
higher yields. However, it should be noted that the farmers in the project
area traditionally grow rice usually under rudimentary systems. While not
all parts of the project area was suitable for coffee and cocoa, area
planted and their yields were affected by improper choice of land and
inadequate agronomic practices, difficulties with obtaining credit support
to finance the development activities and market the production.
(b)  The project was completed in June 1987.  A PCR mission has not visited the
project to obtain relevant data to complete economic and financial impact
and other tables.
I/   Includes 705 tons of swamp rice.
B. ECONCMIC IMPACT
The economic rate of return for the project is not available since the PCR
mission has not visited the country following completion of the project on June
30, 1987 because of the deteriorating country situation.
