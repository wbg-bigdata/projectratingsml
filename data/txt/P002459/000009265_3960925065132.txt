PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report presents the results of a review of the completion of
the Mogadishu Second Water Supply Project, for which Credit 1236-SO of
US$ 15.0 million was made to the Government of Somali, to be relent through
a subsidiary loan agreement to the Mogadishu Water Agency (MWA). The
Credit Agreement was signed on May 26, 1982 and became effective October
12, 1982. The original closing date was December 31, 1985, but it was
first extended to December 31, 1986 and finally to December 31, 1987. The
date of final disbursement was June 13, 1988.
Attached is a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the
Infrastructure Operations Division of the Eastern Africa Department.
Regional division staff undertook a project completi.-ln mission in January
1989 to gather information for the PCR and recviewed the Appraisal and Loan
Documents, the President's Report and other information in Bank Group
files. A completion report was provided by MWA.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on April 6, 1990, for comments by May 21,
1990, but none were received.

MOGADISHU FSCOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(Credit 1236-SO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Project was prepared under Credit 822-SO (first project)
which was only an interim measure to improve the water supply in Mogadishu.
Under the Project the production capacity was increased from 17.8 m m3lday
to 48.5 million m3/day (to meet the demands up to year 1986). It also
provided technical assistance to strengthen the Mogadishu Water Agency's
institutional and operational effectiveness. The major highlights of the
Project are as follows:
(a) Physical
(i) the physical implementation was generally satisfactory.
The new scheme was completed on time and within the cost
estimate (para 3.08, 3.18 and 3.23).
(b) Institutional
(i) the management of the Mogadishu Water Agency (MWA) and the
MWA's Project Management and Planning Unit was
increasingly efficient in handling the procurement,
supervision and disbursement matters of the physical
project components (para 3.37);
(il) the technical departments of MWA have made significant
efforts to keep the water supply running at maximum
capacity despite the severe shortage of spare parts (para
6.04); and
(iii) MWA's institutional development and strengthening was not
fully achieved. This is mainly due to inadequate staffing
and discipline of the staff, which cannot be improved
unless MWA's salary and wage structure is revised. This
has now been recognized both by the Ministry of Mineral
and Water Resources and MWA and it would be made as a
precondition for further training and technical assistance
to MWA envisaged under the Infrastructure Development
Project presently under preparation (para 4.06).



vi
(c) Technical
(i) Government's reluctance to increase the water tariffs as
required and the low billing and collection performance
caused severe cashflow problems during the implementation
period. The latest tariff increase in December 1988, and
the first step towards a progressive tariff structure is
expected to improve the situation in the future (para
5.10); and
(ii) MWA's cash position is further adversely affected by the
high accounts receivable which varied widely depending
mainly on the payments by government institutions which
account for about half of the water sales revenues (para
5.05).

I. INTRODUCTION
Country Background
1.01   Somalia is a large, sparsely poiilated country.  Its varied
topography includes a hot and arid coastal plain, rugged mountains and
plateaus, and lowlands of varying fertility and rainfall (50 mm to 600 mm
annually). Its population in the mid-eighties was estimated at 5.8 million
with a growrh rate of about 3.1% per year. The urban population was
estimated at 1.3 million, 52% of which were living in Mogadishu. The
population growth in the urban areas has been significantly above the
country's average (about 5% per annum) amounting to about 6Z per annum in
Mogadishu.
1.02   Somalia is among the poorest countries of the world; its anrnual per
capita income is estimated at about US$280. The mainstay of the economy
has long been nomadic pastoralism. Over 60% of the population depend on
livestock for their livelihood; about 20% are farmers and 20% are engaged
in various agricultural operations. Due to the country's limited natural
resources, Somalia's prospects depend upon agricultural and livestock
development, whose progress will depend upon careful management of the
scarce land and water resources.
Proiect Background
1.03   Water supply studies for Mogadishu date back to 1963 when, with
USAID assistance, investigations to supplement inadequate local sources of
supply had begun. These, and succeeding investigations carried out in the
late 1960's, culminated in the construction of the Balad Road wellfield and
the replacement of Mogadishu's deteriorating water distribution system in
1973. These improvements, also financed by USAID, were designed to meet
Mogadishu's water requirements through 1980 but, due to failure of several
production wells and the decreasing capacity of other production wells at
the Balad Road wellfield, and increases in water demand, additional
capacity was urgently required by the late 1970s.
1.04   The first Bank Group financed project was planned as an interim
measure in response to this desperate situation. Commissioned some two
years behind schedule in 1982, the first project comprised additional
source capacity in the form of a new wellfield on the Afgoi Road together
with an associated transmission system. By 1982, water demand in Mogadishu
already exceeded the combined capacities of the deteriorating original
wellfield at Balad Road and the new wellfield at Afgoi Road.
1.05   The Government first expressed interest in Bank Group financing for
the follow-up second project in 1980, by which time it was clear that
additional capacity was required as soon as possible to keep pace with the

demand.   The second project bad been prepared and designed under the first
project. This design took due account of the first water resources
investigation, also undertaken by the consultant under the first project.
The second project included full development of the Afgoi Road wellfield,
by constructing additional wells, a service reservoir within Mogadishu and
major extensions to the reticulation and distribution works. As was
previously the case, the second project was also to include water resources
investigations to identify future sources together with the design of the
next stage of expansion. The consultants also provided services under the
second project for water quality studies, water auditing, mapping, asset
valuation and technical assistance.
1.06   The physical works covered by the project were substantially
completed by end 1985 and by this time about 80S of the Credit was
disbursed. In order to continue technical assistance to MWA (including
valuation of assets) and a water audit study, the credit closing date was
extended twice (to December 31, 1986 and December 31, 1987). The date of
final disbursement was June 13, 1988 when the remaining amount of SDR
12,186.32 was cancelled.
1.07   This project completicn report is based on information obtained
from the Staff Appraisal Report (No.3252-SO), President's Report (No.P-
3260-SO), supervision reports and a project completion report prepared by
WA with assistance by their consultants.
The Sector
1.08   At the time of the appraisal of the Project, approximately 201 of
the rural population and 60% of the urban population (represented by the
cities of Baidoa, Berbera, Burao, Hargeisa, Kismayo, Merca and Mogadishu)
had reasonable access to safe water.
1.09   In Mogadishu about 801 of the population were served from public
supply (81 through individual connections and 72% from public taps and
vendors). More than 501 of the water supplied was used by Government and
public institutions, consequently the level of Aervice for the larger part
of the population was very low.
1.10   Public sewerage exists only in Mogadishu where service is
restricted to offices, hotels and relatively small residential population
(about 3,000) located in the central part of the city. Sanitation
facilities elsewhere consist of individual disposal systems (septic tanks
and pit latrines) serving an estimatee 352 of the rural and about 771 of
the urban population.
1.11   Somalia's Five-Year Development Plan (1982-86) was based on a
macro-economic framework, relatively detailed sectoral studies and
provision for regional and local development. Generally, the economic
crises of 1979-80 led to a more pragmatic approach to planning and resulted
in annual reviews of the Plan within the budget process. The Ministry of
National Planning has been responsible for the preparation of the Plan and
any subsequent development strategy reviews, and for drawing up the Public



- 3 -
Investment Program (PIP), which includes the approved plan projects,
showing external as well as Government contributions.
1.12   Coordination of the sectoral investment program at the national
level between sectoral ministries, the Ministry of National Planning and
the Ministry of Finance is carried out by the ministerial-level National
Economic Committee.
1.13   The 1982-86 Five Year Plan emphasized improving urban water supply
and sanitation and stated that urban water supply should become self-
supporting. Because of Mogadishu's high rate of population growth, its
importance as Somalia's center of government and its conspicuous
deficiencies in water supply, particularly high priority was placed on
sector improvements in Mogadishu.
1.14   The planned sector expenditures in the Five Year Plan period
amounted to US$116 million equivalent. Donor assistance was committed to
about 70% of the total program cost. The Second Mogadishu Water Supply
Project was part of the sector program (total expenditure about US$40.0
million equivalent). A rural water supply program (including secondary
towns) was also carried out based on borehole and shallow well programs.
Detailed breakdown by sectors and subsectors is not available, but
expenditures during the period remained below the planned levels and the
overall objectives were only partially achieved.
1.15   There has been no change in the sector organization during the
Project's Implementation period. However, efforts have been increased
recently to achieve better coordination in the field of water development
both within the sector and related to national planning.
1.16   At the Central Government level, two organizations have key roles
in the sector:
(a) the National Water Committee (NWC, previously known as Water
Resources Development Committee), reinforced by the recently
established National Technical Committee (NTC); and
(b) the Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources (HMWR).
1.17   The National Water Committee (NWC), chaired by the Minister of MMWR
is the highest policy and decision making body in the sector. Committee
members include Ministers of the Ministry of National Planning, the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development, the Ministry of Livestock, Forestry and Range and
representatives of two autonomous agencies, the Water Development Agency
(WDA) and the National Range Agency.
1.18   The National Technical Committee (NTC) includes representatives of
the same organizations, supplemented by representatives of the Ministry of
Health, WHO, FAO and the German Agency for Technical Corporation (GTZ).
1.19   The Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources (MMWR) is entrusted
with the mandate of providing water tfr both human and livestock



- 4 -
consumption, which is at present derived mostly from groundwater resources.
MMWR is responsible for the collection and assessment of
hydiometeorological data, hydrogeological studies, design and
implementation of groundwater exploration projects and advising on water
legislation. Many of these functions are carried out through four
autonomous P _ies under the MMWR.
1.20   The Water Development Agency (WDA) provides technical assistance to
rural and urban cemiunities through regional offices (recently increased
from 7 to 16) and its headquarters is in Mogadishu. WDA is partially
funded through Government budgets and partially through revenue producing
activ,ities (drilling and engineering).
1.21   The Mogadishu Water Agency (MWA), which has been the executing
agency of the Project, is responsible for Mogadishu's water supply.
Although MWA is still subsidized by the Government, the intention is to
make MWA a self-supporting public corporation, through increased tariffs
and improved institutional efficiency. The Government also intends thut
MWA would eventually take over the responsibility for sewerage and drainage
in Mogadishu, presently under the Mogadishu City Council.
1.22   The Hargeisa and Kismayn Public Utilities are responsible, as
autonomous agencies, for the wbrcer supply in their respective territories.
1.23   Other institutions active in the sector include the Ministry of
Agriculture, carrying main responsibility for surface water development,
and the Ministry of Livestock. Forestry and Range, through the Livestock
Development Agency and the National Range Agency, which is also committed
to well drilling programs. The Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development is active in rural water supply and sanitation.
1.24   The responsibility of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the sector
has been limited mainly to exercising control and surveillance over water
quality and advising urban and rural communities on environmental
sanitation. Although MOH is attempting to assist in improving water supply
and sanitation in rural areas where hygiene officers are posted, its
efforts are largely confined to primary health care and control of
communicable diseases.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01   The Project is a follow-up to the first Mogadishu Water Supply
Project which was implemented as an interim measure under IDA Credit 822-
SO, and also provided for the preparation of the next extension phase. The
formal request by the Somali Government for a development credit to help
finance the Second Project was made in 1980 (see also para 2.03).
2.02   At the time of the Government's request, Mogadishu's existing water
supply was based primarily on the Balad Road wellfield, financed by USAID



and commissioned in 1973, and the associated transmission main, service
reservoirs, disinfection and distribution facilities, including some 100 km
of pipework. The first project was also under construction and comprised a
new wellfield on the Afgoi Road together with associated transmission main
and disinfection facilities. A prime objective of the first project was to
inurease source capacity, with no provision for additional reticulation.
In the event the first project was commissioned in May 1982, thus reducing,
but not eliminating suppressed water demand in Mogadishu. It is estimated,
that in 1980 consumers were served through some 11,982 individual
connections and by up to 300 public fountains.
2.G3   The design capacity of the Balad Road wellfield was 31,000 m3/day,
although the maximum output ever achieved was 24000 m3/day at the time of
commissioning in 1973.  By 1980, production from the Balad Road wellfield
had fallen to some 16,700 m3/day. The design capacity of the new Afgoi
Road wellfield, constructed under the first project, was 11,520 m3/day.
Thus in 1980 the existing facilities and those under construction had a
combined aapacity of 28,222 m3/day, marginally less than the estimated
average water demand of 28,767 m3/day for 1983. In order to avoid major
water shortages in the following years, the Government requested and was
granted Bank Group assistance for financing of the second project. The
second project had previously been designed by MWA's consultants under the
first project.
Preparation and Justification
2.04   As the .-oject was prepared as part of Credit 822-SO, no separate
preparation mission was necessary. The Project was appraised in March
1981.  Two post-appraisal missions were required to review the project
scope, financing arrangements and procurement issues in April and September
1981.  Negotiations were held in early March 1982 and the Staff Appraisal
Report (No.3252-SO) was issued on March 26, 1982.
2.05   At the time of the Project appraisal about 510,000 persons (or 87%
of the population) were estimated to be served by public water supplies in
Mogadishu - about 50,000 persons (10%) of these through individual
connections and an estimated 460,000 persons (90%) directly from public
taps or from water vendors. The balance of the population had to rely upon
private well supplies. This situation and the rapidly growing population
and water demand had been recognized and the Project was designed to meet
Mogadishu's water requirement until 1987, providing additional source
capacity (wellfield extension) and increasing the distribution network from
a gross service area of 20 sq.km. to 45 sq.km. All consumer groups
benefited from the extension and it had a substantial beneficial impact on
the urban poverty group (about 37% of Mogadishu's total population in 1987)
as a large proportion of them could obtain water directly from public taps
(in larger quantities, good quality and at a lower unit price).
2.06   The Project also provided for technical assistance to improve MWA's
operational and financial performance. The hydrogeological investigation
and engineering design carried out under the project had been necessary for
the preparation of the follow-on extension phases, and ensured that the



least cost solution was found for the long term water supply extension
program.
2.07   The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) on the project was estimated at
5.62 based upon the estimated investment cost and the estimated 1985
average tariff level of 9.40 SoSh/m3. The ERR, as calculated, is an under-
estimate of project benefits since the consumer surplus is not reflected by
using revenues as a benefit proxy. The recalculation ERR was 2.6% (eee
para 7.03).
Pro1ect's Role in Long-Term Plan
2.08   The Project had a very significant role in the long-term plan
through:
(a) providing the technical Jase for the further extension of
Mogadishu's water supply; and
(b) contributing to the institutional development of MWA and
starting the process towards the target of making MWA
financially self-supporting.
Project Description
2.09   The physical elements of the Project, as appraised comprised:
-  extension of the Afgoi Road wellfield to full capacity
(increase from 8 to 24 wells with design output increased from
11520 m3lday to 34560 m3/day);
-  service reservoir in Mogadishu (capacity 14000 m3);
-  elevated storage and associated pumping station in Mogadishu
(capacity 450 i3);
-  extensions to the reticulation system in Mogadishu (68 km of
pipework);
-  additional diesel generator installed in the existing wellfield
power station (200 kw).
2.10   During the implementation period additional physical components
were added to the Project:
- a new diesel generator station (installed capacity 4x480 kw);
- extensions to the reticulation system in Mogadishu (38 km of
pipework);
-  a district and bulk metering system (35 district meters, 3 bulk
meters).

2.11       Consultancy services provided under the Project included:
-  supervision of construction;
-  a second water resources investigation;
-  engineering design of the next stage of development;
-  water quality studies;
-  mapping;
-  a water audit;
-  preparation of a fixed asset registar; and
-  technical assistance.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. OPERATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-Up
3.01   The Credit Agreement was signed on May 26, 1982.  Cofinancing was
provided by the European Development Fund (EDF) (US$5.0 million equivalent)
and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AF) (US$17.5 million
equivalent). MWA contributed US$3.3 million equivalent from its internal
cash generation and Government's contribution was US$0.6 million
equivalent.
3.02   EDF financed most of the supply and installation of the mechanical
and electrical equipment for the project. The bid documents for this
component required extensive revision to reach a form acceptable to EDF, a
process which delayed the issue of these documents. AF suspended
disbursements in Somalia during the Second Project. The various
contractors and consultants continued with implementation despite non
payment by the AF. Some advisers' time was ultimately paid under IDA
financing (para 3.07).
3.03   Project appraisal was based upon the consultants 'Feasibility Study
for Mogadishu Water Supply Expansion - Stage 2 Final Report; July 1980.
The recommendations in this report were based upon the findings of the
first water resources investigation, which were also reported in 1980,
under the first project. Two new wellfields were proposed, one as an
extension to the Afgoi Road installation constructed under the first
project and the second as a new installation on the Balad Road, some 7 km
inland from the original Balad Road installation. The extensions to the
Afgoi Road Wellfield, and associated transmission, storage and distribution
works are often referred to as the Stage 2A Project, and are the subject of
this PCR. The proposed new installation on the Balad Road has since been
named the Garras Bintow Wellfield and forms the basis of the Stage 2B
Project, now overdue for implementation.



3.04   The engineering design and preparation of bid documents for the
Stage 2B Project was included in the Second Project. The design horizon
for both the Stage 2A and Stage 2B developments was reported in the
consultants 1980 study as the end of 1989, and a second regional water
resources investigation was recommended to identify additional future
sources. The second water resources investigation was also included in the
Project.
Revisions
3.05   The scope of the Second Project was extended to take account of
physical changes. A limited amount of mechanicallelectrical equipment was
provided under one of the civil works contracts to increase the level of
water supply prior to the completion of the delayed EDF contracts. Three
out of the twenty four wells included in the Project were equipped early on
this basis. Additional diesel generating facilities, and associated stores
and workshops were also provided, all of which became essential as the
National Power Authority, ENEE, proved unable to furnish the permanent
power supply to the Afgoi Road Wellfield, as had been assumed i.l the system
design (see also para. 3.06). The final permanent power supply has yet to
be provided. The scope of the Second Project was further extended to
provide some additional reticulation within rapidly developing areas of the
city. This additional reticulation was previously included in the Stage 23
Project. Other physical additions to the Project included the supply and
installation of a system of bulk and district water meters required for a
water audit.
3.06   The additional power generation facility was financed from the
proceeds of the IDA Credit 1236-SO. An amendment to the Credit Agreement
to this effect was issued on May 22, 1986.
3.07   In order to maintain the financing of the advisers (originally
financed by IDA and Al (402 and 60% of the foreign cost, respectively), a
second amendment to the Credit Agreement was issued on March 1986, after
the suspension of disbursements by AF, whereby IDA agreed to finance 1002
of the foreign costs of the advisory services.
Implementation Schedule
3.08   The Project Management and Planning Unit (PMPU) set up under the
first project, remained in place throughout the Project. The PMPU
performed successfully meeting its objectives to monitor project
implementation and to participate in the planning, design and supervision
of construction of the various Project elements. MWA continued to employ
consultants for construction supervision for the second water resources
investigation and for the preparation and design of the follow-up Stage 2B
Project. A close and productive working relationship was maintained
between the PMPU, the consultants and the Bank's supervisory team.
Implementation of the physical project components, in general, were
completed on schedule (Annexl).



- 9 -
3.09   The civil engineering works were all undertaken on a timely basis
with the original contract components all being substantially completed
according to schedule by the end of 1983. Bidding for the
mechanical/electrical supply and installation works was delayed by the
revision of the bid documents, until April 1983. The contracts were
eventually awarded in August, 1983 and were substantially completed
according to the revised schedule.
3.10   By mid 1983 it was apparent that water shortages were imminent in
Mogadishu as demand exceeded the capacity of the first project. In
response to this situation three of the Second Project wells were equipped
in advance of the delayed mechanical/electrical supply and installation
Contracts. A variation order was issued accordingly under one of the civil
works contracts, in November 1983, and the first three wells were
commissioned in January 1984, providing immediate benefit.
3.11   Early in 1984 it became apparent that the power supply to be
provided by the ENEE for the Project to the Afgoi Road wellfield would be
considerably delayed. In response to this situation a new 1.92 MW diesel
generating station was designed and included in the Second Project. Civil
works were constructed under a variation order to one of the ongoing
contracts. These civil works commenced in June 1984 and were completed in
April 1985. Mechanical/electrical plant was supplied and installed under a
new contract. This contract was awarded in December 1984 and completed on
schedule in November 1985 at which time the Second Project became fully
operational.
3.12   The implementation schedule provided in Annex 1 shows the program
achieved for the Second Project. The benefits of the Project, in terms of
water availability were delayed firstly by the required revisions to the
EDF financed electrical/mechanical supply and installation contracts and
secondly due to the inability of ENEE to provide power. These delays were
recognized at an early stage and counter measures taken to equip three
boreholes early and to provide an additional diesel generating station. In
the event Project benefits became available in stages:
- January 1984, three additional boreholes,
- November 1984, seven additional boreholes,
- December 1985, twenty four additional boreholes.
With the commissioning of the new wellfield in 1984 and 1985 at the given
level of service there was no water shortage in Mogadishu for the first
time since 1976. However, the steadily growing demand for water and the
declining yield from the old Balad-Road wellfield led to water shortages of
increasing severity since end-1986 (see para 4.04 and Annex 4).
3.13   It has already been recognized at the time of the Project
preparation and appraisal that the next extension phase should immediately
follow the physical completion of the Project. Therefore, the Project
provided for the preparation and detailed engineering designs for the next
(Stage 2B) development phase. This work was completed on schedule by
February 1985 and a Third Mogadishu Water Supply Project was technically
ready for Bank-appraisal, when the decision was made to utilize grant



- 10 -
financing foL this Project offered by the Italian Government. The
commencement of implementation of this extension phase is presently
expected in early 1990.
Procurement
3.14   The consultants were first retained by MWA in late 1976 and
continued to provide services throughout the first project which included:
(a) the Feasibility Study for Mogadishu Water Supply Expansion;
(b) the Source Investigation;
(c) the Design, Documentation and Supervision of the Stage 1
Project; and
(d) the Design and Documentation of the Stage 2A Project.
3.15   Under the Project, the consultants were retained for the
supervision of the Stage 2A Project under an Agreement signed on May 5,
1982. On the same date, a second separate agreement for the Design,
Documentation and Supervision of Stage 2B was also signed, in order that
implementation of the Stage 2B Project could immediately follow Stage 2A as
planned. A third separate agreement was signed on 15th July 1982 and
covered the Second Water Resources Investigation. Later in the Project the
Consultants' services under the Stage 2A Supervision agreement were
extended to provide various additional services. On December 24, 1984,
services for a Water Audit, a Water Quality Study and a Fixed Asset Record
and Evaluation were accepted. On January 20, 1986, services for Technical
Assistance were accepted.
3.16   The Contraets originally prepared under the first project,
comprising Stage 2A, were:
(a) Contract No.4: Well Drilling and Construction
(b) Contract No.5: Pumping Plant and Associated Equipment
(c) Contract No.6: Power Plant and Electrical Equipment
(d) Contract No.7A: Civil Engineering and Building Work
(e) Contract No.7B: Distribution System Extension.
These Contracts were modified, during the implementation period, to take
account of actual requirements:
-  Contract 7A was extended by variation order to include the
early equipping of three of the second project boreholes, in
response to the delay to the mechanical/electrical supply and
installation contracts.



- 11 -
- Contract No.4 was extended by variation order to include the
civil works for a new diesel generating station and associated
store and workshop facilities.
- Contract No.6A was a new contract prepared for the supply and
installation of a diesel generating plant.
- Contract No.7B was extended by variation order to include
additional reticulation within rapidly growing areas of the
city.
- Contract No.7C was a new contract prepared for the supply and
installation of the hardware required for the Water Audit.
3.17   Description of procurement and works carried out under the various
contracts are summarized in Annex 2, and the performance of the consultants
and contractors is described in paras 3.28 through 3.35. It should be
noted that the physical implementation was satisfactory, only minor delays
occured and there was no cost overrun on the Project.
Cost and Disbursement
3.18   The timely start-up and implementation, coupled with the
outstanding performance of the contractors and efficient supervision by the
consultants and NWA's Project Implementation Unit resulted in a cost
underrun of 5.2Z in US dollar terms. Due to higher than anticipated local
inflation, there has been a cost overrun of 2.1% in So.Sh. terms. 11
Payments due by the AP were suspended during the second year of the
implementation of the Project. These AF commitments have yet to be met and
give rise to an increasing interest liability under the various Contracts
and Agreements so affected. A detailed project cost estimate is attached
as Annex 3, and is summarized as follows:

3.19      Cumulative disbursements are shown on the Basic Data Sheet
(p.(v)). US$ 13.65 m. equivalent was disbursed by the revised closing date
of December 31, 1987. The last disbursement was made on July 13, 1988.

3.21   The SAR disbursement profile was 4 years, custom made for the
project. Ninety percent of the total amount was disbursed by the original
closing date. The actual length of disbursement was 5.5 years, still well
below the Eastern Africa average of 7.5 years for similar projects.  The
graph of disbursement on p.(v) shows that the actual disbursement rate in
the first 3 years followed the estimated profile reasonably well (main
construction period), reflecting the good performance in physical
implementation. The additional time covered the maintenance period and
extended studies and technical assistance.
Operations
3.22   As discussed under the previous sections of this report, the Second
Project was planned as a follow-on to the interim first project.
3.23   Physical project components were completed in stages, with the
first additional water reaching Mogadishu in mid January 1984. A second
increment of additional supply was achieved in November 1984, when an
additional diesel generator was commissioned. The full capacity of the
Second Project was realized in November 1985 when a new diesel generating
station was commissioned.
3.24   The actual and forecast water demand, production and consumption,
as given in Annex 4, clearly show the impact of the first and Second
Projects in improving the water supply situation in Mogadishu. The
completion of the first project provided improved supply in 1982 and 1983.
The partial commissioning of the Second Project provided some relief in
1984.  The full commissioning of the Second Project in 1985 provided
surplus source capacity for the first time. This surplus source capacity
wac fully utilized by increases in demand in 1986. The Stage 2B project,
due for commissioning in 1986 has been delayed by lack of finance, and has
still not proceeded beyond the design stage reached in 1984. It must now
be anticipated that this delay will lead to a steadily worsening suppressed



- 13 -
demand situation which will surpass that which prevailed before the first
project.
3.25   The production capacity of the Afgoi Road wellfield is currently
averaging some 34,375 m3/day which is some 4% above its design capacity.
3.26   The power supply to the Afgoi Road wellfield is provided by two
diesel generating stations, constructed under the first and Second Projects
respectively. The first station houses four 200 kW sets, one of which was
added under the Second Project, and was originally designed as a standby
station. The second station houses four 480 kW sets, all supplied under
the Second Project. The generators have all been operated and maintained
successfully by MWA, with specialist contractors being called in for major
overhauls. There is still no prospect of the ultimate 33 kW permanent
supply being made available by the ENEE. It is however understood that a
limited 15 kW supply will be made available soon. It vill however, be
necessary for MWA to continue to operate and maintain vhe diesel plant for
the foreseeable future.
3.27   A detailed mapping exercise was carried out by tile consultant as a
part of the water audit. 1:2000 scale layout plans 4-r Mogadishu were
prepared from aerial photography. These plans were e..dorsed to show the
reticulation.
Performance of Consultants. Contractors and Suppliers
3.28   MWA's consultants were retained to carry out all engineering
required under the Project, and their performance can be rated Above
average. The timely completion of the various contracts and the low level
of claims awarded fully justified the decision to retain the first project
consultants. In this respect, valuable experience gained during the first
project, together with continuity from design to supervision played
beneficial roles. The design of the Stage 2B project was also carried out
to schedule and concluded with the production of draft sets of contract
documents. The water quality studies concluded by identifying options for
treatment of the highly mineralized water. Implementation of water
treatment options are now of lower priority than urgently required system
and source expansion. A valuation of MWA's fixed assets was also carried
out and handed over in card index form, together with instructions for
annual revisions, both on an historical cost and revaluation basis. The
water audit provided a detailed analysis of water distribution throughout
the town from July 1987 until March 1988, at which time data collection
ceased due to financial restrictions. The technical assistance program had
great impact while it was in place. Stores records together with billing
procedures were all brought up to date and put in line with the MWA's
accounting manual.
3.29   The performance on Contract No.4 (Well Drilling and Construction)
was generally satisfactory with all production wells being completed on
program. Of the twenty four production wells, five were rejected by the
engineer for reasontt varying from unsatisfactory performance to damaged
construction. These five wells were all redrilled at the contractor's,
expense and performed satisfactorily. The employment of the drillers from



- 14 -
the previous project by the contractors who had detailed local knowledge
and experience, proved to be beneficial. In some cases the time taken for
well development was significantly longer than expected. The test and
exploratory wells for the second water resources investigation were also
successfully constructed and tested under the contract. All the works were
substantially completed to program and in advance of the delayed equipment
Contracts. A major variation order was issued under the Contract for the
civil works for a new diesel generating station. This work was also
successfully completed within the extended Contract period.
3.30   The performance on Contract No.7A (Civil Engineering and Building
Works) was generally satisfactory with all construction work being
completed on program. Testing and disinfection of the new service
reservoir was delayed due to the lack of available water arising from the
delayed equipment contracts. This situation was quickly rectified as soon
as water became available. A major variat'on order was issued under the
contract for the early equipping and temporary power supply to three of the
production wells completed under Contract No.4. This was successfully done
and made urgently-required additional source capacity available some two
years ahead of the delayed equipment contracts. The contractors continued
to fulfil all obligations despite default on the Employer's side, arising
from non-payment by the AF.
3.31   The performance on Contract No.7B (Distribution System Extensions)
was generally satisfactory with all construction work being substantially
completed on schedule. The construction of public water fountains was
delayed pending the selection and acquisition of suitable sites by the MWA.
Problems were also experienced with the calibration of recording flow
meters. These problems were ultimately solved under Contract No.7C, which
was undertaken by the same contractor. A major variation order, and
associated extension of time, was issued under this contract to construct
reticulation in the rapidly developing southwest area of Mogadishu. The
contractor continued to fulfil all obligations and accepted the variation
order despite default on the employer's side, arising from non-payment by
the AP.
3.32   The performance on Contract No.5, Pumping Plant and Electrical
Equipment was generally satisfactory with all installations being completed
to program.
3.33   The performance on Contract No.6, Power Plant and Electrical
Equipment was generally satisfactory with all installations being completed
to program.
3.34   The performance on Contract No.6A, Power Plant and Electrical
Equipment was generally satisfactory with all installations being completed
to program.
3.35   The performance on Contract No.7C (Bulk and District Meters) was
less than satisfactory with works being completed some five months behind
program, thus delaying data availability for the Water Audit. The
contractor experienced difficulties with the delivery periods for all



- 15 -
metering equipment and with the installation and calibration of recording
bulk meters.
Performance of the Borrower
3.36   The Borrowe- is the Somali Democratic Republic and the Minister of
Finance has been designated as the Borrower's representative. The
executing agency for the Project was the Mogadishu Water Agency (MWA).
3.37   The Borrower's performance was generally satisfactory.  The Project
Fund Account, set up in the Ministry of Finance for the first project was
replenished from time to time and no major payment delays occur-ed.
Similarly, MWS's performance In handling the physical execution of the
project was generally satisfactory. The Project Management and Planning
Unit's performance improved further since the first project and can be
rated as excellent. The financial and institutional performance of MWA is
dealt with under Chapters V and VI.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Market
4.01   Water requirements in terms of annual consumption, demand and
production are shown in Annex 4. The available data on compoc4t:ion of
annual consumption is shown by consumer category for the years 1976 to 1987
in Annex 6. The data indicates that the trend for increasing residential
consumption by individual connections continues, with a consequent
reduction in the proportion used by other categories. The proportion of
water supplied through public fountains has halved since the commissioning
of the first and Second Projects. This situation was predicted in the PCR
report of the First Project. Water shortages are now being experienced in
Mogadishu as a result of the delay in the Stage 2B Project implementation.
4.02   Data on new connections maq'e to the distribution system since the
completion of the original system are presented in Annex 5. The rate of
new connections increased with the completion of first project and has
continued to grow at an average annual rate of 20% thereafter. This rapid
increase in the number of individual connections confirms the reduction in
the proportion of water supplied through public fountains (see Annex 6) and
the underlying trend for improved standards of living.
4.03   Cross correlation between data from the water audit and the
technical assistance programme indicates that in 1987  15.2 million m3 of
water was produced at source of which 10.65 million in was available to
consumers. Billing records for the same year show sales of 7 million m3,
indicating a 362 shortfall in billing.
Project's Role
4.04   The Second Project achieved its major objective upon commissioning
in 1985, when there was surplus source capacity at the level of service for



- 16 -
the first time since the original project was identified in 1976. The
continuing decline in yield from the Balad Road Wellfield, together with
delays in implementation of the Stage 2B project, led to physical water
shortages beginning to occur again in 1987, the year in which Stage 2B
project was scheduled for completion. The Project also served as a vehicle
for the preparation of the follow-on third project (Stage 2B).
Pro1ect Spin-Off
4.05   As the Project evolved under difficult country conditions, the
envisaged institutional development was only partially achieved. However,
MWA's management and the Project Management and Planning Unit (PMPU),
established under the first project, have both become increasingly
efficient in handling project implementation matters which has resulted in
smooth and successfu: physical execution of the Project.
4.06   At the appra 'al of the Project, it was assumed that the
introduction of cor rcial accounting would be fully carried out parallel
with the physical i.11ementation.  This objective has not been achieved,
despite intensifieu technical assistance. However, evaluation of MWA's
assets and the store's records were carried out, together with steps taken
towards the introduction of commercial accounting.  Additional technical
assistance and training for MWA is required to improve its institutional
and financial performance. It is now proposed that additional support to
MWA, together with the preparation of extension stage III of Mogadishu's
water supply scheme w'll be provided for under a proposed Somalia
Infrastructure Project, presently under preparation.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Advisory Assistance
5.01   Under the first project, a financial advisor was appointed to
support the Director of Finance and Administration and this assistance was
continued under the Second Project. The financial advisor was expected to
be primarily responsible for advising and assisting in the implementation
and operation of a commercial accounting system, including training of MWA
accounting staff. During the period of the project, two financial
advisors, each serving three year terms, assisted MWA in these efforts.
However, from the end of the term of the first advisor (May 1983) and the
beginning of the term of the second advisor (January 1984), MWA experienced
a serious breakdown in financial reporting, pointing to the need for
continuous support and supervision of the operations of the Finance and
Administration Department.
5.02   As foreseen during Project preparation, two additional accounting
advisors were needed to assist in the accounting effort in the areas of:
(a) billing, collection and receivables; and (b) stores and purchasing.
These advisors began their duties in April 1986 and continued until March
1988 when funds in the credit account were insufficient to extend their
services any further. MWA management support for the accounting advisors



- 17 -
was somewhat limited, the day-to-day execution of the commercial accounting
systems in billing and receivables, stores and fixed assets were basically
left to the advisors to manage without strong involvement of the Somali
staff. In addition, counterparts assigned to the advisors were frequently
assigned to other duties, and this limited the ability of advisors to train
the staff. As a result, many of the achievements gained under the Project
have been lost with the completion of the advisory support.
Introduction of the Commercial Accounting System
5.03   The efforts of these various advisors have resulted in some
improvements in the financial operations of MWA, although the commercial
accounting system (double-entry, accrual basis) has not yet been fully
adopted. Notable achievements were made in a number of areas,including the
updating and reconciling of cash accounting records and in introducing
reporting of sales on a commercial (rather than ca4h) basis. MWA's stores
were reorganized, new stores set up, inventory stocks were valued by end
1984 and again by end-1987, and additional consultants were retained to
value MWA's fixed assets, an exercise which was completed in April 1985. A
stores' records and issues system was introduced, although collapse of the
stores shelving it. November 1986 caused a setback in its operation for
about six months. Consumption reports and collection lists at the district
offices were also introduced thereby enabling customer cards to be
maintained. Income statements (replacing receipts and payments reports)
and balance sheets (newly introduced) were prepared from 1985, although it
is apparent that further attention is required to ensure consistent
reporting of all sources of income, proper annual revaluations of fixed
assets and that the concept of accrual accounting is better understood.
5.04   In retrospect, introduction of the commercial accounting system
devised in 1980 was beyond the capability of the Finance and Administration
Department. This is due to a variety of factors including the very low
skills levels of its staff, limitations imposed by working practices (high
absenteeism and low morale due to low wages), limited understanding of
commercial practices and a general overall lack of direction and control.
Insufficient effort is presently devoted to the operation of the fairly
simple system of financial administration and accounting which exists, and
maintenance of fundamental financial records is erratic and inaccurate.
Inadequate billing and cash collection have also continued to create
significant problems. Consultants are currently reviewing MWA's operations
as part of preparation of a possible follow-on project and indicate that
technical advisors will be required over the medium-term along with
extensive training at all leitels in order to rehabilitate and develop the
finance and accounting systems to an acceptable level of operation.
Financial Results
5.05   MWA's income statements for 1982-87 and balance sheets for 1985-87
are presented in Annex 7. While some indicators of financial performance
have been improving more recently, MWA's financial position over the
Project period can be characterized as suffering from cash flow
difficulties caused by inadequate tariff levels, poor billing and
collection performance (particularly of government receivables) and high



- 18 -
fuel increases (an increase of 400% was noted for one year alone between
August 1984 and September 1985). During a significant period of the
Project, MWA's cash generation was only sufficient to cover its salary and
fuel expenses which required it to cutback on maintenance expenditures and
replacement of stores as well as to default on its debt service
requirements. This situation deteriorated even further during mid-1986
when the physical Project was substantially completed, but the available
additional capacity was not able to be fully utilized as MWA did not have
enough funds available to purchase diesel fuel needed to increase its
production. The tariff increase introduced in 1986 contributed to
improving this difficult situation such that at end-December 1987, MWA had
a positive cash balance of about SoSh 38.4 million.
Rate of Return
5.06   As per Section 4.04(a) of the Project Agreement, MWA was expected
to maintain its tariff at levels sufficient to provide a minimum annual
rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets of not less than 2S in
1983 and 1984, 3% in 1985 and 1986, and 42 thereafter. While MWA did not
produce balance sheets until 1985 and did not properly value and revalue
its net fixed assets, estimates prepared by Bank staff indicated that MWA
was consistently below the required performance targets.  The three-fold
increase in tariffs introduced in December 1988, however, is estimated to
generate an acceptable rate of return of 4% beginning in 1989.
Billiing and Collection
5.07   During implementation of the Project, MWA's meter reading and
billing capabilities did not Increase in line with the increase in new
customers such that only about 452 of water produced was being billed as of
mid-1987. In certain fast growing districts (Wadajir, Yaqshid, Wardigley
and Hodan) billing was as low as 20-302 of consumption at the same time.
It was estimated then that about 15,000 new customers for which connections
had been installed during the prior 3-4 years had not received a bill
resulting in a backlog of billing of about SoSh 100 million. The reasons
for the poor billing performance can be attributed to the inadequate number
of meter readers, billing clerks, district collection personnel and poor
supervision in both numbers and quality.
5.08   In an effort to address this poor performance, MWA hired 40
personnel (primarily meter readers and clerks) at end-June 1987. The
increased attention to billing started to show some improvement in August
and September 1987 when 10,000 bills per month were processed as compared
to 8,000 bills per month during the April-June 1987 quarter. However,
given that there were about 41,000 connections at that time and that bills
should be processed at least bi-monthly, over 20,000 bills per month should
have been processed. Billings is an area requiring further attention, and
requirements to improve billing performance are currently under review by
consultants as part of preparation of a follow-on project.
5.09   Due to concern about the high level of overdue accounts,
particularly by government ministries and parastatals, Section 3.04 of the
Development Credit Agreement required the Government by September 30, 1982



_ 19 -
to reduce and thereafter maintain its overdue accounts at a level not
exceeding 60 days of total water sales. While this condition was
approximately complied with initially, when goversment receivables were
reported at 65 and 70 days of water sales in November and December 1982,
respectively, performance thereafter deteriorated. Government receivables
fluctuated between 150 and 280 days of water sales during the Project
period and reached a high of about 360 days by October 1987 but declined to
188 days or about SoSh 39.5 million by end-December 1987. Poor payment
performance by the Government has reduced MWA's cash available to permit it
to pay its debt servicing obligations on loans arranged by the Government
(mainly USAID) during 1985-87 and is estimated to continue to affect its
ability to service its debt if this situation persists. While the number
of collection staff increased recently, greater attention to follow-up of
overdue government and other accounts is required and is currently under
review by consultants.
Tariffs
5.10   In compliance with Section 5.01 (c) of the Development Credit
Agreement,the study to be carried out of MWA's tariff structure and level
of charges was completed in June 1982. Various block tariff structures
were analyzed in the study and compared with the prevailing uniform rate
tariff system. The issue of introducing a progressive tariff structure,
whereby lower-income households, particularly those purchasing water from
kiosks, would be charged lower rates, was repeatedly discussed with
Government during the course of the project, but was judged by Government
not to be practical until December 1, 1988, when a differentiated tariff
structure was introduced for the first time. The following table shows the
tariff rates during the Project periods
Tariff Rates
From - To                     SoSh/m3
May 1981 - Aug 1983                 4.5
Aug 1983 - Jul 1984                 5.0
Aug 1984 - May 1985                10.0
May 1985 - Oct 1985                14.0
Oct 1985 - Apr 1986                18.0
Apr 1986 - Dec 1988                25.0
Dec 1988 - present:
Public fountain kiosk users  25.0
All other users               75.0
5.11   These rates represent the actual selling price in all the various
consumer categories. However, the concessionaires of the public fountains
(kiosks) receive 50% commission of the selling price. Therefore, the
actual average tariff received by MWA varied during the course of the
Project depending on the ratio of sales at the kiosks to the total sales.
Total consumption at the kiosks has been fairly consistent over the project
period -- at about 20% of total consumption.



- 20 -
Auditing
5.12       MWA's accounts were expected to be audited by the Magistrate of
Accounts (MOA) and submitted to the Association not later than four months
after the end of each fiscal year. However, during the Project period, no
audit reports were received by the Association. When this matter was
discussed with the MOA at project completion, the Magistrate indicated that
his office was unaware of the agreement between the Government and the
Association requiring annual audits and that MWA had not submitted any
annual accounts for audit. While the MOA did carry out audits of a limited
nature on selected MWA items during Project implementation, it was hampered
from carrying out a full audit during recent years due to other MWA audits
being performed by the Somali Democratic Socialist Party. The MOA audit of
MWA's accounts is currently scheduled to be carried out during mid-1989 and
is expected to cover all years of implementation of the project (1982-88).
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Manaaement and Organizational Effectiveness
6.01   The Mogadishu Water Agency (MWA) was established in 1967 to provide
public water supplies in Mogadishu. In April 1970 it was merged into the
National Water Agency (NWA). In 1971, NWA was replaced by the Water
Development Agency (WDA) and MWA was reestablished as an autonomous agency
in 1978 under the Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources. MWA's annual
budgets are approved by the Ministry of Finance subject to the prior
approval of MMWR.
6.02   MWA's organizational structure has not changed substantially since
the appraisal. However, the establishment of the Project Management and
Planning Unit as a condition of Credit effectiveness proved to be very
beneficial in implementation of the First Mogadishu Project and in the
preparation and implementation of the Second Project. The Unit has been
efficient in monitoring the physical implementation and project financing.
Less satisfactory has been the compliance with project reporting
requirements. Quarterly reports were frequently not submitted on time and
the quality of the reports fluctuated.
6.03   A Sewerage and Drainage Department was established in 1981 under
the Assistant Gereral Manager, and a separate Training and Statistics Unit
was set up answering directly to the General Manager.
6.04   Substantial weaknesses have been experienced in MWA's financial
administration during the implementation period of the Project as described
in Chapter V. However, it should be noted that MWA has made significant
efforts to keep the physical supply system running at maximum capacity in
spite of severe shortages of spare parts.



- 21 -
Staff Recruitment, Manpower Development and Training
6.05   In the past, MWA has been troubled by high staff turnaround.  To
remedy the situation and to improve low morale and discipline, MWA
indicated that a review of the salary and wage structure will take place
during the proposed follow-on project, which would also provide additional
training and advisory services.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Proiect Achievement
7.01   The physical target, i.e., to increase production to about 48,500
m3/day and to extend the distribution network was achieved for a short
period in 1985 when the supply met the demand. However, shortages occurred
already in 1986, due to the decline in yield from the Balad-wellfield. The
follow-on capital investment (Stage 2B) which was prepared under the
Project did not take off until 1989 (under Italian grant financing) which
resulted in the worst shortages ever experienced in Mogadishu.
7.02   The second objective, i.e., strengthening the water sector through
the improvement of MWA's institutional and financial performance was only
partially met. The introduction of a commercial accounting system was not
fully achieved and it is obvious that additional technical assistance and
training is required to improve MWA's performance and make it a self-
reliant institution. This input is now designed under the Infrastructure
Development Project under preparation. It is planned that this will also
provide for the preparation and detailed engineering design for the next
phase extension of Mogadishu's water supply.
Rate of Return
7.03   In order to assess the economic value of the actual Project, the
economic rate of return on the investment was recalculated and was found to
be about 2.6%, as against to the originally estimated 5.6% (Annex 8). This
is mainly due to the delays in the required tariff increases. In spite of
the reduced rate of return, the Project was economically justified taking
into account the unquantifiable benefits.
7.04   It is worth noting that the rate of return on average current net
asset has been recently estimated at about 4% (after the latest tariff
increase in December 1988). Prior to this increase, the rate of return on
MWA's current net asset was fluctuating and was consistently below the
required level.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01   The Project was implemented in a economically difficult period for
the country which also reflected in MWA's performance. In order to achieve



- 22 -
financial solvency and the covenanted rate of return on HWA's current net
assets, the Bank consistently emphasized the need for tariff increase,
improvement in billing and collection and intensified technical assistance.
The Bank missions also voiced the need for a review and substantial
increases in wages and salaries as a prerequisite to improve discipline and
performance of MWA's staff.
8.02   As the overall economic situation In Somalia worsened, MWA's
financial and operational performance declined despite the effort of Bank
staff to suggest improvements in the water sector. Some success was
achieved in the last years of the Project's implementation when tariffs
were finally increased to an appropriate level. The institution-building
effort was clearly inadequate; the training and technical assistance
program was underdesigned, particularly for an agency expanding its
operations. A more intensive institution-building effort is being prepared
for the proposed Infrastructure Development Project.
8.03   The relationship with MWA's management and the Project
Implementation Unit was good and the issues were discussed in an open and
cooperative manner. The interval between supervision missions graduslly
decreased during implementation.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01   The Project was successful in achieving the physical targets.  The
recent water shortages are due to the delay in the implementation of the
next phase of Mogadishu water supply extension (Stage 2B) and the rapid
decline of the yield of the old Balad-Road wellfield. The Bank has agreed
to finance additional power generating capacity at Afgoi wellfield as ENEE
failed to provide the required power supply.
9.02   The institutional performances of MWA was less successful than
anticipated, specifically in improving financial administration, and
billing and collections. MWA's asset valuation was completed and a water
audit was carried out as part of the Project. The Project Implementation
Unit operated efficiently and no major problems occurred regarding
procurement and disbursement. The need and scope of further training and
technical assistance was identified and it is now proposed that it would be
provided under the proposed Infrastructure Development Project. MWA's
management made great efforts to maintain the maximum water production
despite its financial difficulties and the shortage of spare parts.
9.03   The Project was instrumental in increasing the water supply in
Mogadishu and, in spite of its shortcomings in promoting the operational
and financial performance of MWA. The engineering design for the next
(Stage 2B) extension phase was also financed under the Project.
