MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  iii
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:            Islamic Republic of Mauritania
Implementing         Ministry of Planning
Agency
Credit Amount        SDR 8.7 million (US$12 million equivalent)
Terms:               Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity
Cofinancing          France, EC, Germany, WFP and UNDP expressed support. Their expected
contribution is about US$4.8 million.
Project Benefits
and Risks:           The project will have several benefits:  a) direct benefits: employment
creation, high economic return of rehabilitation operations, and positive
impact on the environment; b) long term benefit: enhancing the efficiency of
the public sector--(it could have a spill-over effect on other IDA projects
(such as education) and improving the efficiency of the construction sector);
and increasing sustainability of future infrastructure and urban projects
through better use of municipal resources. The project will have three main
components: a) an investment component aimed at protecting existing
infrastructure from decay and at developing some additional urgently needed
social infrastructure; this component includes four types of operations: i)
road maintenance and rehabilitation with a significant effort on sand dune
fixing;  ii)  urban  infrastructure  rehabilitation;  iii)  school
construction/rehabilitation; and iv) waste collection; and b) a package of
training and technical assistance aiming at: i) enhancing the capacity of
domestic construction contractors and consultants; ii) improving the
management of public infrastructure by local governments, emphasizing
maintenance over new construction; iii) increasing grassroots participation in
urban infrastructure maintenance; and iv) project monitoring; and c) a
package of technical assistance and sectoral studies aiming at: helping the
Ministry of Equipment and Transport set up appropriate programming and
funding procedures for road maintenance; ii) enhancing urban infrastructure
management; and iii) setting up an action plan for developing the capacity of
the domestic construction industry.
The implementation arrangements of the project will be similar to that of
previous AGETIP-type projects. A non-profit organization has been set up
and will act as a contractual owner's representative to manage the various
sub-projects. The Agency's statues, by-laws (agreed with the Government)
and Manual of procedures will give the agency a broad freedom to manage
swiftly many small contracts with small and medium-size contractors and
consultants. Quarterly audits will ensure that the agency actually abides by
these internal regulations.



iv         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
Project Benefits
and Risks:            The project will have several direct benefits: a) employment creation, b)
high economic return of rehabilitation operations, c) positive impact on the
environment; d) the long term benefit of enhancing the efficiency of the
public sector--(it could have a spill-over effect on other IDA projects, such
as education, by improving the efficiency of the construction sector); and e)
enhanced sustainability of future infrastructure and urban projects through
better use of municipal resources.
The risk of slow implementation will be reduced by the setting up of an
AGETIP-type agency and by promoting the delegation of contract
management. The risk of supporting unsuitable operations will be reduced
by closely monitoring the implementation of the manual of procedures with
strict selection criteria. The risk of poor execution of works will be reduced
by the development of the training program and through the quarterly
technical and financial audits.
The Economic rate of Return (ERR) will be 12% at least for economically
justified subprojects; social subprojects (i.e. building of classrooms) will be
justified on the same criteria used for large projects in the same sector.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURIrANIA
CONST'RUCTION CAPACtTY AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPOR
SECTION I - SECTORAL BACKGROUND
A.    Population and Urbanization
1.1.         Mauritania has experienced since independence the most explosive urbanization in
West Africa. In 1960, 60% of Mauritanians were nomads. In 1992, nomads amount to only 7% of
the 1.8 million Mauritanians. This considerable change in the living conditions of the people has
been pushed by rapid growth of a modem mining sector, climatic shocks (droughts), which severely
reduced crops and pastoral resources, and also by inadequate agricultural and macro-economic
policies. Although rainfalls have improved during the last two or three years, this is not likely to
reverse the trend of ongoing migration from most rural areas towards cities and particularly
Nouakchott.
1.2.         Rapid sedentarization is leading to urban concentration. One million Mauritanians
live in 24 urban centers of over 5,000 inhabitants. The largest urban centers are Nouakchott, the
capital (550,000 inhabitants), Nouadhibou, the main industrial center (60,000 inhabitants), Kaedi
(40,000 inhabitants) and Akjout, Atar, Kiffa, Rosso, and Zouerate with more than 30,000 people
each. Nouakchott is growing at 11% per annum, while the total population is growing at 2.9%.
1.3.         Declining economic prospects in many of Mauritania's rural areas explain this
substantial migration to urban centers from all parts of the country, except the Senegal valley region,
where some potential for growth exists. In addition, most of the 180,000 repatriates from Senegal,
after the 1990 riots, have also come to the cities. A majority of the inhabitants in urban areas suffer
from extremely low standards of living, as reflected in recent poverty surveys (for instance, access
to water among the population of Nouakchott decreased from 53% to 30% during the period 1986-
1991).
B.    Macro-economic Background
1.4.         Macro-economic policy followed by the Government of the Islamic Republic of
Mauritania (GRIM) since independence has severely affected the economy. Poorly managed, over-
staffed public enterprises have become increasingly inefficient and have accumulated heavy financial
losses. Poor selection of public investment resulted in projects with low or negative rates of return.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Government embarked on a large public investment program
financed almost entirely with external borrowing. The program channeled resources toward low-
yielding projects and resulted in large external debt. At the same time, price distortions and regulated
markets for agricultural and industrial products discouraged the development of viable small-scale
activities in the secondary sector and hampered agricultural development as well.
1.5.         Since 1985, GRIM has embarked on a policy of gradual opening to the world market
and a return to macro-economic equilibrium, but results have fallen short of expectations. Actually,
the financial situation has worsened during the last three years and imbalances increased in 1990-1991
with regard to Government's budget, exchange rate, and foreign trade.



2          MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
1.6.         During the period 1986-1989, real GDP grew at an average rate of 3.5% compared
with 0.2% in the 1982-1984 period. The inflation rate fell from 9.8% in 1985 to 6.2% in 1988 but
rose to 7.9% in 1989. The consolidated budget deficit was reduced from 8.0% of GDP in 1986 to
3.0% in 1989, while the external account deficit (excluding official transfers) declined from 35% of
GDP to 14%. The country benefitted also from an important debt reduction package.
1.7.         In 1990-1991, external and internal shocks and inappropriate policies inflicted
damages on the economy. Drought and unfavorable institutional conditions reduced the production
in the agriculture sector. The mining and fishing sectors experienced modest growth. At the same
time, financial disequilibrium increased, with an accumulation of external debt and monetary
expansion. The overall balance of payments deficit reached SDR 87 million in 1991, compared to
45 million in 1989.
1.8.         From 1986 to 1991, the Government carried out a number of important structural
reforms. The Government pursued its price liberalization policy. Import licenses were abolished and
petroleum product marketing and urban transportation were deregulated. A new investment code and
new customs tariffs were adopted. In addition, in the context of the Public Enterprise Sector
Adjustment Loan (PESCAL), seven nonviable enterprises were closed, others were reorganized, and
the rice monopoly granted to the import-export agency (SOMINEX) was eliminated.  The
Government also privatized all rice mills as well as the marketing of grain products. The private
sector rapidly replaced the public sector in land development, agricultural production, and marketing
activities.
1.9.         In the financial sector, the legal and institutional framework was improved with the
promulgation of new banking legislation, the implementation of a new accounting system, the
definition of prudential ratios for banking operations, and the institution of reserve requirements, as
well as the strengthening of the Central Bank's supervisory functions. The Central Bank has
simplified the interest rate structure, and granted commercial banks more latitude in setting their
interest rates to better reflect lending risk.
1.10.        A Fourth Year Policy Framework Paper (PFP) was agreed between GRIM, the World
Bank, and IMF in September 1992, for the period of October 1992 to September 1995. This PFP
aims at:  i) strengthening the budgetary position; ii) promoting private sector activity; iii)
restructuring the banking sector; and iv) implementing an appropriate exchange rate policy.
C.    Urban Labor Market and Employment
1.11.        Serious imbalances exist between labor demand and supply in urban areas:
(a)   the public sector, which used to provide guaranteed employment for graduates, is
being downsized in the context of adjustment programs;
(b)   the formal private sector continues to rely on capital intensive production techniques,
even for tasks which could be carried out manually at a lower cost; and
(c)    many of the newcomers entering the urban labor market are unskilled laborers
lacking the training and education that would make them attractive to employers.
1.12.        The labor force was estimated, in 1989, at 630,000 people (270,000 in urban areas,
360,000 in rural areas); of which 180,000, or 29%, were unemployed. The modern sector employed



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  3
60,000 persons. The informal sector was estimated to provide employment to about 180,000 persons;
a recent estimate increased this number to 250,000. The current average monthly wage is UM 7,000
(formal and informal sectors).
1.13.        At present, unemployment hits young graduates particularly hard. About half of the
university graduates from the last two years are unemployed. They cannot find employment in the
public sector as was possible in the past. At the same time, the modem private sector is not
expanding, and few opportunities are currently offered in the informal sector to take advantage of
their education. Small private businessmen are reluctant to hire "intellectuals", although they need
skilled employees to enhance the management, so far rudimentary, of their firms.
D.    The Highway Sector
1.14.        From independence to the late 1980s, Government policy was oriented towards
allocating resources to the construction of new roads and neglecting periodic and routine road
maintenance. This policy resulted in a general deterioration of the road network, which consists of
1750 km of paved roads, 700 km of modern gravel roads and 5,000 km of earth roads. In addition
to progressive wear and tear on the road network, mobile sand dunes have become a growing threat
to roads and important resources (about UM 200 million or US$2.5 million in 1991, almost half of
the current expenditures for roads) must be used merely to keep roads open to traffic.
1.15.        While road construction and periodic maintenance works have always been carried
out by private contractors, routine maintenance has been a reserved market for force account teams
which have generally shown a limited efficiency (an exception is the sand removal brigade financed
by the European Community - EC). As a result, the limited financial resources allocated to road
maintenance have had little impact.
1.16.        By late 1989, a sectoral reform program started but quickly stopped due to lack of
resources. The Ministry of Equipment and Transports (MET) participated in the Road Maintenance
Initiative Seminar (RMI) in Antananarivo in 1989, and the Government created an interministerial
coordinating committee for road maintenance in 1990. But, as a consequence of the Gulf War, most
donors who had in the past supported the sector have now ceased to do so. In the last two years,
foreign aid has been very limited (only the EC and France have continued their support), most of
which has been used for removing sand from roads. Consequently, MET has stopped its efforts at
setting up a comprehensive road management policy.
E.    The Urban Sector
1.17.        The urban sector could be characterized by four main issues: i) the extremely rapid
urbanization trend which resulted in high unemployment; ii) the growing scarcity of public resources
during the last decade which resulted in a steady decline in per capita urban investment, mostly in
the Nouakchott area; iii) the poor performance of the main government bodies responsible for urban
development and housing, in part because especially advantageous financing conditions were no
longer available; and iv) the poor implementation of the decentralization process, which transferred
the bulk of the responsibility for maintaining infrastructure and services to the local communities,
without increasing their resources and authority.
1.18.        A high natural growth rate (estimated at 2.9%  per year), an extremely mobile
population, and recent sedentarization are the significant features of Mauritania's urbanization
process. In 1991, the urban population represented more than half of the total population (2 million).



4          MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Prject - Staff Appraisa Repoit
Due to the country's institutional heritage, over 60% of the urban population is concentrated in the
Nouakchott area, with a large proportion housed in tents around the city and heavily dependent on
food imports. The capital city continues to grow at a rate of 11% per annum. The remaining
population is partly nomadic (175,000 inhabitants) and partly rural sedentary (825,000 inhabitants)
living in 3,600 villages with less than 1,000 people each, mostly located in the Senegal River Basin.
Although Nouakchott is expanding rapidly, and despite the lack of infrastructure, a few secondary
cities are growing at an equally high rate. This is leading slowly to a more balanced population
distribution through a densification of the urban network.
1.19.        The Government has been unable to secure the resources needed to implement urban
infrastructure and services at a pace suitable to this exceptional urban growth. It has been even less
able to allocate resources in such a way as to attract migrants in selective cities with the best
prospects for regional development. The result has been an unprecedented concentration in the capital
city, where more than 75% of at least 550,000 inhabitants live in unserviced areas, particularly in
spontaneous settlements (kebes) which occupy more than 50% of the built-up area.
1.20.        The squatter settlements are characterized by very low quality housing (mostly shacks
and tents) located in the desert surrounding Nouakchott, and lack water supply, sanitation, and
garbage disposal facilities. When it is available, water is purchased at very high prices under
unsanitary conditions from water vendors who transport it in drums on donkey carts. Recent surveys
show that access to water among the population of Nouakchott in fact decreased from 53% to 30%
during the period 1986-1991.
1.21.        Generally, sanitary conditions are poor in urban areas. Of the total urban population
approximately 18% have direct access to clean piped water and the remaining 82% obtain their water
from public standpipes or water vendors who resell water purchased from privatized standpipes. The
service levels for sewerage disposal are considerably lower; only 4% of urban dwellers in Nouakchott
are hooked up to a water borne sewerage system; the remainder rely on pit latrines, septic tanks, or
have no disposal system at all. This inadequate availability of safe water and sanitation facilities
contributes to a high rate of disease among the population.
1.22.        The financial difficulties that have faced Mauritania during the past few years have
led the Government to redefine its sector strategy and objectives. The most noticeable urban policy
initiative that the Government launched in recent years was the creation of municipal governments
in 13 regional capitals as a first step in August 1986, amplified by a "fine tuning' (roilettage) in
October 1987 which set up municipalities with legal status, financial autonomy, and gave operating
powers to municipal councils and mayors. This was followed by a second wave of 31 new
"communes" in 1988, and finally by a generalization of the municipal status of every city and town
(228 municipalities) in 1990.
1.23.        This political initiative is still raising numerous unresolved problems pertaining to
municipal finance, administrative organization, and human resources. The municipal management
subsector is characterized by low service levels, poor tax collection, significant dependence on
government financial support, numerous and often unqualified manpower, inadequate maintenance
and operations practices, and weak control procedures.
1.24.        Acting against this background, the current Government's strategy emphasizes the
need for the promotion of a new urban management system. As a result, GRIM is eager to
withdraw, at least partially, from direct support to urban services, urban infrastructure development
and provision of shelter. These functions should be taken over, to the extent possible, by the local



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report S
governments and the private sector. Within the overall objective of laying the foundation for
sustained growth through development of private initiatives, the Government strategy for the urban
sector aims to improve the support that efficient cities can give to the creation of economic activities
and to the generation of employment opportunities.
F.    The Construction Industry
1.25.        The domestic construction industry, which had developed reasonably well since
independence, has been deeply hurt by both the sharp drop in funding of the investment program and
the 1990 conflict with Senegal. In addition, all but a few of the foreign construction firms (French
and Brazilian) which carried out most of the major works have left the country.
1.26.        Domestic contractors appeared and grew in the 1960s and 1970s. These were mainly
in the building sectors, but also in the road sector.  Domestic contractors took advantage of the
opportunities offered by the construction of the capital city, of the road network, and of the various
construction works for the mining sector. They grew through sub-contracting up to the level of prime
contractors. Three domestic firms have built paved roads; about forty have built modern buildings
(housing programs, ministries, industrial and commercial facilities). In addition, a large but
undetermined number of tradesmen are active in the sector.
1.27.        All firms have been hit by the severe contraction of demand for construction in recent
years. Construction equipment has not been replaced and is generally in poor condition. According
to an equipment supplier, the country's total fleet consists of only 180 heavy construction machines
(bulldozers, graders, loaders, etc.).
1.28.        The conflict with Senegal resulted in the departure of all Senegalese foremen and
specialists who traditionally were the core of the Mauritanian construction industry. Nationals were
either the owners of the firms or unskilled workers. Employers have tried to replace these Senegalese
workers with foreigners (Moroccans, Malians, Guineans) and with nationals. So far, the result has
not been satisfactory and both employers and their customers complain about low quality work and
low productivity. The hiring and employing of nationals is hampered by the fact that few training
schemes are offered in the construction sector. But, under the current harsh economic conditions,
there is no reluctance on the part of national workers to accept hard labor-intensive works, and
businessmen are available to contract these works.
1.29.        Recently normalized relations between Senegal and Mauritania may result in a
progressive and partial return of Senegalese specialists. Senegalese workers' fear and Mauritanian
authorities' reluctance will likely slow the process. The need and potential for educating/training
Mauritanians in construction trades remains considerable.
G.    IDA's Previous Role and Lessons learned
1.30.        Highway Sector. The Bank has assisted the highway sector through four projects:
the First Road Project (Cr. 0069-MTA), the Second Highway Maintenance Project (Cr. 0159-MTA),
the Third Highway Project (Cr. 0519-MTA), and the Fourth Highway Project (Cr. 123 1-MTA). The
Project Completion Report (PCR) of this last project concludes that, after a slow start, and despite
poor coordination with co-donors, the project achieved its goals. The main lessons learned through
these projects are consistent with the recommendation of the Road Maintenance Initiative of the Sub-
Saharan Africa Transport Program and can be summarized as follows: a) appropriate resources
should be allocated to road maintenance on a regular and timely basis and efficient programming of



6         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
works should be based on sound economic considerations; b) resources should be used more
efficiently by involving the private sector; and c) the road authority should be strengthened and
appropriate contract management practices should be adopted.
1.31.        Urban Sector. Previous Bank involvement in the urban sector has been minimal;
available data is limited and understanding of the issues of the sector needs to be broadened. The
municipal component of the Development Management Project (Cr. 1865-MAU) tried to monitor the
setting up of municipal governments and to ensure that these governments would operate in a suitable
legal framework with clear delineation of responsibilities, but this is far from being achieved. Other
Bank involvement in the urban sector includes the financing of: (a) a comprehensive study of the
housing sector, intended to provide the basis of an effective housing strategy; (b) a Regional Planning
Study ("Schema National d'Amenagement du Territoire"), of which the third phase has provided
guidelines for a strategy of regional development where the urban network has a preeminent role to
play. With the First Water Supply Project (Cr. 2389-MAU), the Bank's objectives are to better
satisfy the urban water demand through private connections and the introduction of cost recovery
principles.
1.32.        Lessons Learned from the Senegal AGETIP. A well-selected public works and
services program using labor-intensive techniques is one of the most efficient ways to give
employment and subsistence to unskilled workers, and, at the same time, achieve durable economic
benefits. For implementing such a program in Senegal, a non-governmental organization (AGETIP)
has been set up (see the organization of such a such an agency in paragraphs 2.3 and 2.4, 2.7 to
2.13, and Appendix 1) and has proved to be an extremely efficient project management unit. About
600 Senegalese firms have been prequalified to participate in the AGETIP program; 78 of them, of
which 75 are small- or medium-sized, have won 119 contracts. AGETIP has also prequalified 191
consulting engineers, of which 97 have had at least one contract with the agency. The proportion
of wages in the total cost of subprojects has reached a higher level than expected (22% for road
works, 28% for building rehabilitation, and over 30% for street sand removal and drainage cleaning),
which means that more employment has been provided than anticipated by the project designers.
Finally, AGETIP has proved to be very efficient in managing many small contracts (about 250 per
year, half for works, half for consulting services) and has been able to pay contractors and
consultants within a week.
H.    Justifications for Bank Involvement
1.33.        Unemployment and Poverty Alleviation.   The Bank's deep concern about
unemployment and poverty, especially in urban areas, has found new justifications in the findings of
the recent Social Dimension of Adjustment (SDA) surveys (1990 and 1991) and the draft poverty
profile (1992). In urban areas, on average, 30% of the households are living below the poverty level
(UM 32,000, or US$370 per capita per year, mid 1992). However, there is a clear difference
between central urban areas (21% of households below poverty level) and peri-urban areas (50%).
Accurate data on unemployment in urban and peri-urban areas is not available, but there are clear
indications that a large number of skilled and unskilled workers are ready to accept labor-intensive
low-paid temporary or permanent jobs. Contrary to the cultural reluctance shown in the past towards
labor-intensive methods, there is now a consensus to adopt these methods, when technically
appropriate and economically sound, in order to fight rising unemployment which is felt as a growing
threat to society.
1.34.        Private SectorDevelopment. The project would promote the development of domestic
private operators in the construction industry (see para. 1.37 below). A major element of the country



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  7
development strategy under implementation is aimed at promoting private initiatives in the various
sectors of the economy. This project would complement the ongoing efforts to restructure the
mining, banking and fishing sectors, and enhance the enabling environment for the operators.
1.35.        Highway Sector. During the preparation and pre-appraisal missions, the borrower
expressed repeatedly its wish that IDA take back its leading role in the highway sector. During
appraisal, it was agreed that the project would include a component aimed at setting up a road
maintenance management unit and at developing both a database on the main road network and
procedures for economic programming of road maintenance works (a Highway Design Model or
HDM), which is a preliminary requirement for building a comprehensive transport sector management
strategy.
1.36.         Urban Sector. The municipality of Nouakchott has embarked on a bold program of
reforms which aim to increase the efficiency of municipal tax collection and to enhance the allocation
of resources, particularly reducing the administrative fixed costs of municipal management. The
project will: a) facilitate the reform of the urban sector by financing public works and services which
will enhance the credibility of the municipal authority; b) encourage citizens to pay their taxes, by
showing them that tax revenues are properly used; and c) help prepare future sectoral initiatives by
financing sectoral studies.
1.37.        Construction Industry. Improving the efficiency of the construction industry will help
build/maintain not only roads and municipal infrastructure, but all kinds of infrastructure, in the
country and will promote a sound use of national resources (in particular, labor) by the construction
sector. The project will promote this improvement through: a) demonstrating the cost-efficiency of
labor-based techniques for various types of works; b) enhancing the technical capacity of the many
contractors and consultants to be involved in the project through seminars and training works; and
c) carrying out studies aimed at setting up a comprehensive framework for further development of
the industry.

SECTION II - THE PROJECT
A.    Project Objectives
2.1.          The project objectives are:
(a)    to create, at least temporarily, new employment opportunities in urban areas;
(b)    to undertake subprojects that are economically and socially useful.
2.2.          The development objectives are:
(a)    to demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive projects;
(b)    to test the procedures that will enable the public sector to commission such projects,
and in particular the delegation de mattrise d'ouvrage (delegated contract
management); and
(c)   to improve, through the execution of the works financed by the project, the
individual skills of the workers who will be employed, and the corporate
competitiveness of the firms that will carry out works so as to develop their capacity
to respond to increased opportunities for sustained activity after project completion.
2.3.          Associated objectives include:
(a)    avoiding the need to increase the civil service;
(b)    combining the benefits of implementation methodologies that feature low cost, high
visibility and impact;
(c)    supporting other development programs by efficiently executing (but not financing)
their subprojects related to infrastructure;
(d)    using transparent but expeditious and flexible procedures for subproject proposals,
appraisals, procurement and disbursements; and
(e)    providing sustainable technical and managerial assistance to contractors.
2.4.          Using the concept of delegation de mattrise d'ouvrage, the municipalities want to
promote the construction or restoration of basic infrastructure as a central element of urban
regeneration and of the government decentralization program. Such capital investments would have
primary multiplier effects associated with the construction or restoration phase, while having a
substantial impact on the local economy. Furthermore, the refurbishing of obsolete infrastructure
would have secondary multiplier effects on employment and income associated with the ongoing use
of the restored or newly built facility.
2.5.          After considering the barriers that small contractors face in terms of access to public
contracts, it was deemed necessary to establish a special agency with private legal status to implement
the project. To this end, an organization called the Agence Mauritanienne d 'Execution des Travaux



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
d'Intbr*t Public et pour l'Emploi (AMEXTIPE) has been created, based on the same model already
in place in Senegal, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Benin. AMEXTIPE's structure is described in
paras. 2.7 to 2.13 and in Annex 1.
2.6.          Intended Beneficiaries. The project's intended beneficiaries are divided into four
groups. First, there is the population at large benefitting from better drainage, sanitation, and roads.
In particular, this will benefit the poorest neighborhoods, since project selection criteria give priority
to poorest areas. Second, there are the small enterprises and tacherons from the informal sector who
mostly are in the lowest part of the income distribution. The project will provide them with work
and contribute to making them achieve a transition from the informal to the formal sector. A third
group of beneficiaries consists of the 41 municipalities that will benefit from investments under the
project. Finally, the project benefits a fourth group, the mattres d'oeuvre (architects, engineers, and
consulting firms) that will be engaged in the preparation of bidding documents and supervision of the
works.
B.    Project Description
2.7.          The project components are:
(a)    a program of labor-intensive subprojects consisting of:
(i)      a public works program of public facility and infrastructure
rehabilitation and maintenance, in urban areas as well as on
the highway network, to be carried out under labor-intensive
schemes by local contractors (para. 2.8);
(ii)      a public services program to be carried out under labor-
intensive schemes by local private firms (para. 2.10);
(b)    a package of technical and managerial assistance and training including:
(i)      a package of training services related to work organization,
management, and technical skills training, to be offered on
a voluntary basis to local contractors who will be awarded
contracts under component (a); and a training program for
local engineering firms and individual consultants on the
preparation of feasibility studies and technical project
proposals for component (a) (paras. 2.13-2.19);
(ii)      a training program for potential beneficiaries of subprojects
of component (a), for helping them pre-evaluate the
feasibility and soundness of such subprojects (para. 2.20);
(iii)     a program aimed at increasing grassroots participation in
urban infrastructure maintenance (para. 2.21); and
(iv)      a package of services aimed at project monitoring (para.
2.22);



10         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
(c)    a package of sectoral studies and related technical assistance including:
(i)      studies in the highway sector and assistance to the MET
which will help setup appropriate programming and funding
procedures for road maintenance and enhance MET's
management structure and procedures (para. 2.23);
(ii)     studies in the urban sector and assistance to the Municipality
of Nouakchott (MON), the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and
the Ministry of Interior (MOI) aiming at enhancing city
management through improved collection of local taxes,
adequate matching procedures with funds allocated by the
central government, and through more cost-effective use of
available resources (para. 2.25); and
(iii)     preparation of an action plan for developing the domestic
construction industry (para. 2.32).
a) Program of Labor-Intensive Projects (US$13.6 million)
2.8.          Public Works Program. This program will undertake rehabilitation and maintenance
of public infrastructure in urban areas and on the road network, especially in the field of construction
and public works; i.e., drainage network cleaning, public building rehabilitation, road maintenance,
and urban renewal. These activities will be carried out under labor-intensive schemes by local
contractors in order to create employment. This project component will represent approximately 55%
of AMEXTIPE's activities in terms of total project costs.
2.9.          The activities are most likely to be the following:
(a)    construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of street and road drainage, and
of small bridges;
(b)    construction, repairs, rehabilitation and maintenance of street and road
pavement and shoulders;
(c)    construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of public infrastructure, such as
classrooms and health facilities;
(d)    sand removal operations and dune fixing works;
(e)    water and soil conservation works; and
(f)    construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of recreation areas and sports
facilities, and tree planting activities.
2.10.         Public Services Program. This program will undertake, on a temporary basis, some
public services such as primary waste collection, or the contracting out, for a specific period, of the
maintenance activities mentioned in the previous paragraph. The objective of this program is to
demonstrate the cost-efficiency and the sustainability of labor-intensive schemes, which will lead to
creating durable employment. At the same time, direct beneficiaries of the services will be



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  11
encouraged to participate in their financing. This program will represent approximately 20% of
AMEXTIPE's activities in terms of total project costs.
2.11.         The activities are most likely to be the following:
(a)    cleaning of public facilities and infrastructure such as streets, removal of
waste accumulated over the years, particularly in peri-urban areas, etc.; and
(b)    periodic waste collection and cleaning of public infrastructure. Collection of
waste by non-motorized methods and transport to concentration points will
help MON use more efficiently its heavy equipment (loaders and trucks) by
concentrating on transport from these concentration points to the final
deposits.
2.12.         Initially, labor-intensive activities financed by the project will be concentrated in the
Nouakchott area. But, after about one year, AMEXTIPE will be able to undertake similar operations
in other urban and peri-urban areas. But, when expending its operations on a broader geographic
zone, AMEXTTPE will have to keep management costs under control, which may lead to start several
operations in the same region at the same time, in order to reduce supervision and inspection costs.
b) Package of Technical and Managerial Assistance and Training (US$1,10,OOO)
2.13.         Package of assistance and training of domestic contractors and consultants
(US$700,000 base cost). This component will aim at increasing the technical and managerial capacity
of small- and medium-scale Mauritanian firms in the building and construction trades. The rationale
behind this component is twofold:
(a)    most firms in the target group are expected to show weaknesses, in terms of
management, work organization, and technical skills, which might jeopardize the
successful implementation of the subprojects that they will be commissioned to carry
out. The provision of some technical assistance to contractors is deemed an effective
way of addressing this risk;
(b)    conversely, those firms which are awarded contracts under the proposed projects may
be expected to be comparatively more efficient than others, if the selection process
is effective. Therefore, with a view to strengthening comparative advantages instead
of randomly spreading assistance over the whole industry, these firms deserve to be
supported to improve the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the industry.
2.14.         AMEXTIPE conducted a survey to determine the training needs and the willingness
of the contractors to participate in the financing of these needs. The results reveal that all of the
entrepreneurs interviewed indicated training needs for themselves and their employees in specific
fields (site management, technical training, accounting and finance). They complain that the existing
local training/educational institutions, which exist in both the public and the private sector, do not
offer training modules adapted to the needs. A contractor cannot, for instance, be absent from his
business for several months or even weeks.
2.15.         Several subprograms will be offered under this component, some of which will be:



12         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
(a)    a business administration and financial management program intended for
entrepreneurs and their administrative staff;
(b)    a work organization program primarily designed for foremen;
(c)    various technical training courses to improve the skills of basic workers; and
(d)    training works in the main activities financed by the project.
2.16.         Local resources are available for providing these training programs and the project
will almost completely rely on existing training/educational institutions already in Mauritania, in the
public and private sectors. The project will give these institutions an opportunity to reach a new
demand, through training modules different from what they have been familiar with so far.
Management courses are currently given by the Lycee commercial of Nouakchott, the Institut
Mauritanien des Techniques Comrnerciales, COGEFI, SODEM, FOFANA, SIGMA, RIM-INFO,
ICS. Technical training in building trades is provided by the Lycee of Nouakchott, the Colleges
d'Enseignement Professionnel of Nouakchott, Nouadhibou, and Bogue, the Centre Superieur
d'Enseignement Technique, the Institut Superieur Scientifique, and the private organizations CFPP,
and Sonelec trade school. Agricultural and environmental topics are taught in the Ecole Nationale
de Formation et de Vulgarisation Agricole. All these institutions have agreed to participate in the
organization of specific sessions in their respective fields. In addition, local consultants who have
been, or will be, involved in the provision/organization of training in this project have already, or
will, draw on the experience of other AGETIPs, especially in DAKAR, Bamako, and Niamey.
Finally, the foreign expert on sand dune fixing has prepared a practical guide mainly based on
Mauritanian experience. In that field also, Mauritanians can use their own resources to implement
the activities financed by the project.
2.17.         However, special training modules have to be designed to fit the potential trainees.
These training subprograms would be very practical at the grassroots level and will take the form of
on-the-job assistance and training. Short sessions (four hours per day, over two to five days, for
instance) will be organized to allow the trainees to do their own business on a part-time basis.
Managerial and technical assistance and training will be offered on a voluntary and cost-sharing basis.
Costs per trainee per day are expected to be in the range of US$50-I00 (the average daily fee of local
consultants is US$250).  Contractors (or artisans or communities) who already meet the
prequalification requirements will be free to accept or refuse this form of assistance, and will be
classified as eligible to bid for appropriate nature and size of works. Contractors who do not yet
fully meet prequalification requirements, and who accept this technical assistance, will have access
to training works, after which they will be registered or not as eligible bidders, depending upon their
performance. Firms benefitting from assistance and training programs will reimburse AMEXTIPE
for part of the related costs, preparing the construction sector to participate, in the future, in the
financing of its own training/educational schemes and institutions.
2.18.         The establishment of an effective technical and managerial assistance operation for
the small- and medium-sized firms involved in project execution will be delegated to an outside entity
that will be contracted for this purpose. This assistance will be offered for a limited period of time
(up to six months), will be given by local consulting firms, and will be demand-driven. Terms of
reference have been drafted to solicit proposals of an action plan from a list of local consultants
already identified. A draft action plan for the implementation of the pilot operations has also been
prepared and is under review. Agreement on the Terms of Reference on the training program for
beneficiaries, consultants and contractors for the pilot operations was sought at negotiations (para.



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  13
3.2f). Assurance was sought during negotiations that AMEXTIPE will submit to IDA the action plan
for the 1993 training program for contractors and consultants, no later than three months after credit
effectiveness. The agreed action plan will be updated annually during the fourth quarter to reflect
the needs identified during site supervision of project execution (para 3.4c).
2.19.         A similar program will offer training and technical assistance to consulting firms and
individual consultants (mattres d'oeuvre). The review of the local consulting industry commissioned
during project preparation has shown that the limited number of existing firms suffer, to various
extents, from insufficient technical capacity. In addition, the review has identified individuals who
have the potential to act as individual consultants or to set up their own firms, subject to market
opportunities and the provision of training. Consequently, a package of training and technical
assistance will be offered to individual consultants and consulting firms. It will include:
(a)    a business administration and financial management program  intended for
entrepreneurs and their administrative staff; and
(b)    a technical program on the techniques of works and services involved in the project
activities, and on the organization of effective supervision.
2.20.         Technical Assistance to Beneficiaries (US$100,000 base cost). This component, to
be similarly implemented by local consultants, and drawing lessons from the experience of other
AGETIPs, will provide support to the beneficiaries for preparing feasibility studies and technical
project proposals that would be submitted to AMEXTIPE for funding. It will be organized on a basis
similar to the technical assistance provided to contractors and consultants. AMEXTIPE's submission
of an action plan for the 1993 training program for the beneficiaries is a condition of credit
effectiveness (para. 3.3e).
2.21.         Program  to Increase Grassroots Participation (UJS$100,000 base cost).  This
component would help organize a program to increase grassroots participation in urban infrastructure
project maintenance (Annex 9). This program would disseminate information (using the local
languages, logos, appropriate colors and music) to the chefs de quartier, neighborhood committees
and to the tdcherons and micro-entrepreneurs to increase the level of responsibility that the
community feels with respect to project works. In this framework, AMEXTIPE will organize a
number of activities to increase public awareness and support for the project. The credit will provide
financing for these activities, including an information seminar to distribute documentation and to
sensitize the population on the project, a meeting of the general assembly of the Agency, and a week-
long campaign in the media. The objective of this effort is to improve communication between the
grassroots and local authorities so that the former are consulted on projects that affect their
neighborhood, before the projects are presented to the Agency for funding and implementation. This
is particularly important in the case of garbage collection and sewer cleaning, where grassroots
participation can make a difference in terms of public hygiene. Again, AMEXTIPE will contract out
this component to local consultants and local medias. AMEXTIPE's submission of an action plan
for the grassroots participation program is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 3.3e).
2.22.         Package of Services Aimed at Project Monitoring (UJS$200,00 base cost). Thorough
and rapid ex-post audits must ensure that the agency uses the funds in accordance with the manual
of procedures. Consequently, quarterly technical, managerial, and financial reviews of the agency's
performance will be carried out by an external auditor. This auditor will produce quarterly interim
reports and a complete annual audit report. The auditor will be a financial auditing firm which will
have an agreement with a consulting firm or with individual consultants with technical and managerial



14         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
expertise. It is essential that the audit review together the financial, managerial and technical
performance of the agency (see paras. 2.54 to 2.56). Agreements on periodicity and terms of
reference of fiscal, technical, managerial, and environmental audits and on the short-list of potential
auditing firms or joint-ventures was sought at negotiations (para. 3.2b).
c) Sectoral Studies and Related Technical Assistance (US$1,200,000)
2.23.         Highway Sector. Setting up a Road Maintenance Management Policy (US$500,000
base cost). This component is aimed at resuming the dialogue on road maintenance which was
interrupted in 1990. The objective is to build a consensus with the MET and with other donors on
a comprehensive road maintenance policy, and on the setting up of a sound road management system,
as promoted by the RMI. It may help prepare a highway sector management strategy. This
component will likely include the following:
(a)   the setting up of a road economic management unit (bureau de gestion routiere);
(b)   the adoption of appropriate implementation arrangements to achieve a progressive
shift of road maintenance works from force account to contractors; and
(c)   the setting up of a contractual scheme under which force account teams which would
be financed and paid for on a output-basis, and not for actual costs.
This component will be discussed and carried out in close cooperation with other
donors interested in the highway sector, such as EC and the French MCAC. Agreement on the scope
and time-schedule of the study on the highway management strategy was reached at negotiations
(para. 3.2c).
2.24.         Fixing sand dunes along roads. The project will offer the opportunity to set up a
comprehensive and efficient policy and implementation arrangement to fix sand dunes. Mauritania
is severely threatened by sand dunes which invade arable land, villages and cities, and infrastructure.
In particular, during the long dry season, the main paved roads, and especially the Route de l'Espoir,
are frequently cut by the progress of near-by sand dunes; costly cleaning sand operations have to be
repeated after every wind storm. The Departmental force account teams of the MET have tried
techniques to stabilize the dunes in order to protect the road. A large national project has been
implemented under the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office (UNSO), the Ministere du
Developpement Rural et de l'Environnement (MDRE), and Direction de la Protection de la Nature
(DPN) to set up a program and define techniques to stop, prevent, or alleviate sand invasion of land,
cities and infrastructure. Under this project, various techniques have been tried to fix dunes along
roads. A consultant, financed by UNSO, participated in the appraisal mission of this project. He
reviewed the experiences carried out by MET and MDRE, drew conclusions, analyzed costs and
benefits of sand encroachment operations, and left a practical guide for future operations in the
highway sector. The project will start implementing these recommendations, and will promote the
contracting out of these works to private contractors and communities.
2.25.         Urban Setor (US$S00,0OO base cost). Due to our still limited knowledge of the
issues in this sector, this component will include only highly justified initiatives which bear no risk
of contradiction with further investment programs and will mainly aim at broadening the
understanding of the issues. The component will include short term actions aimed at: a) facilitating
municipal contribution to project financing; b) launching a pilot operation in Nouakchott; c)



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  15
improving the financial and managerial capacity of MON and of other municipalities; and d) carrying
out preparatory studies for a comprehensive urban strategy for the country.
2.26.         Municipal contribution to project financing. One of the major objectives of the
proposed project is to involve municipalities in the financing process. AMEXTIPE will share with
each municipality the funding of each submitted subproject on a matching grant basis. Municipalities'
contribution to subprojects financing will be 10% in 1993, and 20% in the following years. These
contributions will come from several sources: community and neighborhood groups, municipal
budgets, etc. Because some of the newly created municipalities will not have the financial resources
to participate in cofinancing, the 1993, 1994, and 1995 budgets of the MOI will include appropriate
credit lines to complement municipal contributions (see para. 2.51).
2.27.         Pilot operation in Nouakchott. This operation will include the following measures:
(a)    at the Tax Head office level: identify a test zone, carry out a fiscal survey (about
400 tax payers), start updating the property tax base; and establish a Tax Register;
and
(b)    at the Treasury Head office level: design an officer in charge of Local Governments;
intensify tax collection and accelerate tax transfers to municipal accounts; and audit
municipal accounting systems.
2.28.         MON'sfinancial capacity will be enhanced by setting up a program of actions geared
towards a better mobilization of local resources. Drawing on the experience of the pilot operation,
the project will promote broader coordination between MOF and MON for establishing yearly
budgets and work programs, with clear identification of everyone's duties, expected performances
and generated costs. The Central Administration will collect local taxes and will charge MON some
of the related costs. The project will facilitate setting up such arrangements.
2.29.         MON's management capacity will be re-enforced by identifying local responsibilities
and defining competencies in accordance with GRIM's decentralization policy objectives. The
analysis will be conducted in concertation with government and local authorities and will help
facilitate the description of major municipal functions. The terms of reference of the institutional
study will be added to this first document. These two documents will help design future institutional
orientations.
2.30.         Other municipalities'financial and managerial capacities will be similarly enhanced.
The financial and institutional measures taken by the responsible authorities (MOF and MOI), as well
as internal adjustments accepted by municipal authorities, will ease the mobilization of counterpart
funds and enhance municipal investment management. Finally, this active partnership between the
Central Administration and the municipalities will permit a progressive re-establishment of major
services like refuse collection and road maintenance. Progress made in these fields during the
execution of the project will prepare and lead to future actions in the urban sector.
2.31.         Preparatory studies for an urban development strategy. The project will include
preparatory studies to design an urban strategy in Mauritania including the following priorities:
a)    fostering a more balanced distribution of the urban population throughout the
country;



16         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Apprisal Report
b)     developing a more balanced urban network in support of urban-rural linkages and
improving the functioning of urban centers;
c)    improving urban service delivery through the introduction of self-reliant mechanisms
for provision and financing of these services;
d)     developing appropriate procedures to finance priority urban investments through a
policy based on matching the funds raised at the local level; and
e)    implementing a comprehensive housing policy with minimal involvement of public
finance.
The Terms of Reference for these studies will be discussed with the other donors
active in the urban sector, in particular the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique.
Agreement on the scope and time-schedule of the preparatory studies for an urban development
strategy was reached at negotiations (para. 3.2d).
2.32.         Action Plan for the Development of the Construction Industry (US$200,000 base
cost). This component aims at establishing a dialogue between public agencies and the private
construction sector in order to enhance the performance of the industry. This dialogue will lead to
an action plan including measures such as:
(a)   the reform of procurement and contract management regulations, especially for small
contracts for works (unless the on-going civil service reform program is carried out
over the next few months);
(b)   the introduction of institutional arrangements for the provision of technical and
managerial training to contractors on a permanent and sustainable basis;
(c)   the introduction of institutional arrangements for education schemes in construction
trades;
(d)   the reform of the national laboratory of public works and its transformation into a
sustainable and cost-efficient commercially-oriented institution;
(e)   the strengthening of the contractors' association and of the consultants' association;
and
(f)   the setting up of a high-level public/private committee in charge of promoting the
domestic construction industry, and of a small unit to coordinate the task forces to
be in charge of preparing and implementing the actions selected by the committee.
The Terms of Reference for these studies will be discussed with the other donors
active in the sector.  Agreement on the scope and time-schedule of the action plan for the
development of the construction industry was reached ,at negotiation (para. 3.2e).
C.    Status of Project Preparation
2.33.         In an attempt to further mitigate negative effects which might occur from adjustment
program on the economy as a whole and on youth and the urban poor in particular, GRIM is



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisl Report  17
supporting macro-economic growth policies with specific employment generation programs that are
cost-effective. As overall growth cannot take place without the necessary infrastructure in terms of
roads, schools, dispensaries, etc., the construction industry seemed the logical starting point for
intervention. This industry is the fourth largest economic sector in the country after mining,
agriculture, and fishing, and is a sector with major employment opportunities. Therefore, GRIM
informed a Bank mission, in September 1991 that it had decided to undertake a public works and
employment project. A preparation mission visited Mauritania in March 1992, followed by the pre-
appraisal mission in May 1992. The appraisal mission was carried out in June/July, 1992.
2.34.        The preparation of the project has gone swiftly, due to the very active participation
of GRIM, and to the granting of a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). A coordination committee was
set up in late April 1992, following an IDA preparation mission, by the Ministry of Plan, including
representatives of the MOE and of the MON. This committee has taken an active part in the
preparation of the TORs of the various preparatory studies, in the review of the conclusions of the
reports of these studies, and in the identification of acceptable candidates for the position of
AMEXTIPE's General Manager. The committee has also proposed a list of pilot operations and
prepared their summaries, which are in Annex 7. A PPF in the amount of US$125,000 was granted
to GRIM on March 31, 1992 to finance a first tranche of short-term consultant services in various
fields (review of the construction industry, review of the management of the city of Nouakchott and
setting up of an Immediate Action Plan for Nouakchott (IAPN), legal studies of the Agency's by-
laws, and initial operating costs). All of these studies have been carried out and drafts or final
reports have been reviewed. A second PPF of US$700,000 was granted on September 23, 1992 to
finance additional studies (training, participation and involvement of the population, Manual of
Procedures, impact on environment) needed for the project preparation, the agency's operating costs
for six months, and a trial program of five subprojects (see para. 2.52). AMEXTIPE's General
Manager has been selected and the legal creation of AMEXTIPE took place in December. A draft
training program (US$50,000) has been designed, which takes into account all these available
resources and uses them for training local contractors and consultants to be involved in the
implementation of the pilot operations. Finally, the scope of the three sectoral studies (Road
Maintenance Management, Urban Sector Management, and Construction Industry Development) has
been discussed with and designed by the committee. Representatives of the Government, the Mayor
of MON, and the General Manager of AMEXTIPE were part of the delegation that came for
negotiations in December 1992.
2.35.        To enable MON to mobilize its proper financial counterpart and therefore benefit
from programs financed by AMEXTIPE, an IAPN has been drawn in consultation with the local
authorities. During the project preparation phase, MON had already adopted and started to
implement a large part of the reforms proposed by IAPN such as: the reorganization of the Revenue
Division, the restructuring of market fees mobilization, the management of the area tax collectors,
the accountability of the municipal tax collector, and a plan to drastically reduce MON's staff and
to involve the private sector into some municipal activities such as waste collection. However, other
measures identified in the IAPN are under the exclusive responsibility of the MOF. Dialogue
between MON and MOF had already started during project preparation and should be pursued until
efficient procedures and organization are in position to achieve a satisfactory tax collection.
D.    Project and Program Cost, Financing Plan
2.36.        The project cost is estimated at US$20 million equivalent (UM 2,254 million) net of
taxes and duties. The foreign exchange component of the program is estimated at 45% of the total



IS        MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
cost. Base cost estimates, in US$ are in December 1992 prices. Annual inflation rates have been
estimated as follows:
TABLE 1: Local and Foreign Inflation Rates
1993            1994             1995            1996
Local           17.9             3.6             3.3              3.5
Foreign          3.9      J       3.9             3.8             3.8
2.37.        Since the volume of labor-intensive public works will be adjusted according to
available funds, price contingencies have not been applied to the estimated local cost of the labor-
intensive public works and service component (including design and supervision) which amounts to
US$14.7 million and constitutes 73.5% of total base costs. Price contingencies on the remaining
components (US$5.3 million) amount to US$772,000, or 3.8% of the related base costs. A summary
of estimated costs is presented in Table 2 below. Detailed project costs are provided in Annex 10.
2.38.        The proposed IDA credit of US$12 million equivalent will finance 60% of project
costs net of duties and taxes over a four-year period. The local financial contribution will be US$3.2
million equivalent, or 16% of the total project cost. This local contribution will be made by the
beneficiaries for an estimated amount of US$2.2 and by the Government for an estimated amount of
US$1 million. For the sake of comparison, total Government budgetary revenue is estimated UM
26.6 billion (US$236 million) in 1993. The local contribution to each subproject will be made
available to AMEXTIPE by the beneficiary and/or the Government (actually the Ministry promoting
the subproject) at the time of signing the related Delegation de maitrise d'ouvrage. Until the
contribution is actually paid, AMEXTIPE will not start the subproject. The Government's
contribution will be provided to AMEXTIPE from Government budgetary resources (in addition to
those financed by IDA and other cofinanciers).

2.39.           Cofinancing. Cofinancing/parallel financing totaling US$4.8 million equivalent (UM
541 million), or 24% of total project costs, will be assumed by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), the World Food Program (WFP), France, and, possibly, the EC, Germany,
and Spain. These donors have expressed their interest. A UNDP staff member participated in the
appraisal mission. The current estimate of their contribution, to be confirmed in 1993 and 1994, is
as follows (in US$ million): UNDP: 0.5; WFP: 1; France: I to 2; Germany: 2; EC: unspecified;
Spain: 0.4. UNDP and WFP would likely cofinance. France, EC, and Spain would likely enter into
parallel financing. Should these expectations fail to materialize, AMEXTIPE will complete the
project in less than four years.   Should donors come with more money, then AMEXTIPE will
complete the project in more than four years. The project time schedule is based on the absorptive
capacity of both AMEXTIPE and the construction sector (see below). Other IDA funded projects
may also give AMEXTIPE the management of some of their operations. The proposed financing plan
is set out in the following table:

Note:  The table assumes that beneficiaries would contribute financially to subprojects under parallel financing
as they do to IDA financed subprojects.
2.40.         Local Contribution to Financing. One of the objectives of the project is to familiarize
the government agencies and the non-government beneficiaries with the matching of funds for
carrying out subprojects. Asking them to contribute financially is a sure way to give them ownership
of these subprojects. It also creates the conditions for responsible management. Consequently, all
subprojects will be partly paid for by the beneficiaries. The project will be a pilot operation for
establishing appropriate schemes and procedures for fund matching.
E.    Project Implernentation
The Agency
2.41.         The implementing arrangements which are critical for effective fulfillment of the
project's objectives will be similar to those of AGETIP in Senegal, in particular, the extensive use
of contract management (d9lIgation de maltrise d'ouvrage). These arrangements are described in
detail in Annexes 1 to 5, pages 32 to 112. AMEXTIPE is an independent institution, with the legal
status of a non-governmental, non-profit organization. Its board consists of a Director drawn from
the private sector and representatives of large existing non-govermnental, non-profit organizations (the
Mayors Association, the National Labor Union, the Confederation of Mauritanian Enterprises, the
Impaired Persons Association, see Annex 1 and 2). AMEXTIPE has been given the necessary private
legal status and will enter into a agreement (Convention) with GRIM to execute the project (Annex
3). It will follow its own procedures and be able to avoid the cumbersome, slow, and inefficient
procedures that public institutions follow in calling for bids, awarding contracts and disbursing funds,
which result in de facto discrimination against small contractors. Assurances were reached at
negotiations (para. 3.4a) that at all times, the Statutes of Agreement of the Agency and the
Procedures Manual will be acceptable to the Bank.
2.42.         Setting up of AEXTIPE.  The agency was created by its Constitutive General
Assembly, held December 2, 1992, and its General Manager was selected, acceptable to IDA, erior
to negotiations (para. 3.1c). This is being financed by the two PPFs (total amount US$825,000).
Government's agreement on AMEXTIPE's Statutes, By-Laws, Manual of Procedures (para. 3. la) and
the signing the Framework Agreement (Convention) between Government and AMEXTIPE, and the
signing of a decree of Public Interest (utilitepublique) took place prior to negotiations (para. 3. lb).



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  21
The agreement by GRIM to the changes in the Procedures Manual agreed during negotiations is a
condition of effectiveness (para. 3.3a).
2.43.         Pilot Operations. The PPF will finance about six pilot operations to be carried out
before project effectiveness. The operations have been selected as representative of most future
subprojects. They include: classroom rehabilitation, classroom construction, street repair, street
drainage extension, sand dune fixing along a peri-urban road, and non-motorized primary waste
collection. The description of these operations is given in Appendix 12. Their implementation will
help set up AMEXTIPE's working procedures and familiarize beneficiaries, consultants and
contractors with the project. Standard documents will be prepared for each of the activities covered
by these pilot operations.
2.44.        AMEXI7PE's Absorptive Capacity. AMEXTIPE is expected to have the capacity to
implement subprojects for an amount of about US$5 million per year. AMEXTIPE has identified
about 25 consulting firms or individual consultants, and about 45 contractors. This means that there
is a large enough remaining capacity in the field of contractors and consulting engineers to carry out
the works and studies financed by the project. In addition, the technical assistance and training
program (paras. 2.18 to 2.24) will increase this capacity. The total yearly output of the construction
sector, including foreign firms, is estimated to be about US$70 million.
AMEX77PE's Operating Procedures
2.45.         AMEXTIPE's operating procedures and internal organization include: (a) eligibility
criteria for selecting subprojects submitted by local and central administrations for implementation
under the proposed project; (b) procedures for calling for bids, selecting contractors and vendors
(including prequalification if necessary), and awarding contracts; (c) internal organization for work
supervision and control; (d) disbursement procedures; and (e) procedures for handing over completed
works. Accounts will be audited on a quarterly basis, and resources will be replenished only upon
presentation of properly documented records of the use of funds and satisfactory audits. On the basis
of these audits, and of the actual performance indicators (Table 6, para. 2.71), the supervisory
committee of AMEXTIPE will have full authority to propose and implement any measure that would
be deemed useful to ensure actual fulfillment of the project's objectives, including hiring and
dismissal of AMEXTIPE's management and staff. Assurances were reached at negotiations that at
all times during project implementation, the General Manager, the Technical Manager, and the
Administrative Manager of the Agency must be acceptable to the Bank, and the Agency must be
operated in an efficient manner (para. 3.4b).
2.46.         Subproject Identification and Appraisal.  AMEXTIPE will widely advertise the
procedures contained in the Manual of Procedures (Annex 4), especially as they pertain to the
categories of works and services eligible to be financed under the Project. AMEXTIPE will review
the subprojects that are presented by the municipalities and ministries of the central Government and
will verify their eligibility based on certain pre-determined criteria known and published in the
Manual of Procedures. The portfolio of projects identified will be then submitted to IDA for review,
in annual batches. After analysis, the portfolio to be executed for the coming year will be retained
and approved. It is then that consulting firms will be hired to prepare bidding and technical
documents to call for bids. The AMEXTIPE's submission to the Bank of a first batch of subprojects
amounting to a total of at least US$1 million (UM 113 million), for implementation during the first
year is a condition of effectiveness (para. 3.3c). Assurances were reached at negotiations (para. 3.4d)
that the Agency will submit to the Bank the second, third, and fourth annual work programs including
that financed by IDA, the municipalities and co-financiers, totalling at least US$3 million (UM 339



22         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appmisal Report
million) no later than September 30, 1993, US$4 million (UM 451 million) no later than September
30, 1994, and US$4 million (UM 451 million) no later than September 30, 1995 respectively.
2.47.         Subproject Implementation. Once a subproject has been selected, the public agency
which has submitted it ("the beneficiary") will enter into an agreement (Convention de deolgation de
mattrise d'ouvrage) with the Executing Agency, according to a pre-established model which is
attached to Section IV of the Agency's Procedures Manual (Annex 4, pages 80 and 81). This
agreement will include inter alia the following provisions:
(a)   the Executing Agency is substituted for the beneficiary for the entire execution of the
subproject and has full authority, on behalf of the beneficiary, to select the
contractors, sign the contracts, supervise the works, acknowledge delivery, and pay
contractors;
(b)   the subproject is both financed by the Executing Agency, on the basis of the funds
made available to it under the project (and therefore is additional to the beneficiary's
own capital budget or investment program), and financed by the beneficiary,
according to sharing percentages and procedures described by the manual of
procedures; and
(c)   the beneficiary pledges the responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the
subproject; in case of non-compliance with this clause, the beneficiary will not have
further access to the Agency's financial resources until the situation is rectified.
2.48.         Contracting and Supervision. With the support of a management information system
containing files for contractors, consulting firms and subprojects, all of which have been screened
and reviewed by IDA, AMEXTIPE will be able to proceed swiftly with contracting without the long
delays observed in the public procurement system. A condition of effectiveness (para. 3.3c) is that
AMEXTIPE will submit to the Bank a list of preselected contractors and consultants. A roster of
eligible contractors and consulting firms to be set up and maintained by the Agency will always be
open, and newcomers, once they satisfy the requirements specified in the Manual of Procedures, can
be pre-qualified and classified. At the end of the year, the roster will be re-examined and firms will
be reclassified based on performance, with communication to the Bank. Assurances were reached
at negQtiations (para. 3.4e) that AMEXTIPE will periodically submit proposals to the Bank to update
the roster of consultants and contractors. Besides the guidelines delineated in the Manual of
Procedures, AMEXTIPE will implement the subproject with the support of a management information
system which will allow for decision-making to be made without delay. At any time, the managers
of the Agency shall know exactly what the situation is for every project, supplier, payment, voucher,
and bill. Problems shall be identified and corrected immediately. A consulting firm, acceptable to
IDA, was selected to assist the setting up of AMEXTIPE's reporting, and accounting system,
following Terms of Reference, accepted by IDA, prior to negotiations (para. 3. Id). The setting up
of the AMEXTIPE's information and recording/accounting system is a condition of effectiveness
(para. 3.3f).
Procedures relating to Local Financing
2.49.         Origin of the local contribution to projectfunding. Three different cases have to be
considered:



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  23
(a)   the beneficiary is a governmental agency, e.g. the MET, (Direction des Travaux
Publics [DTP]), or the Ministry of Education, (Direction de l'Enseignement
Fondamental [DEF]). In such a case, the local contribution is made from the budget
agency, which may have a special credit line, or at least adequate provisions in its
budget for that purpose, during the three years of the project;
(b)   the beneficiary is a provincial government, a municipality, or a community, a user
association (association de parent d 'eleves) and is willing and capable of paying the
full local contribution. This local contribution is drawn from the budget of the local
authority and/or from voluntary contributions from the users; and
(c)   the beneficiary is the same as in case (b) above, but has access to the financial
assistance of a co-promotor which is a governmental agency, as in case (a), and/or
a donor such as the WFP. For instance the DTP would agree to share with a
municipality the local contribution for street rehabilitation subproject. The two
promoters (the beneficiary and the governmental agency) agree on cost-sharing
percentages and this is reflected in the Convention de de'legation de mattrise
d 'ouvrage.
(a)   this procedure has been designed to ensure the timely payment of tis contribution by
each beneficiary, because the actual implementation of its own subprojects depends
on this payment.
2.50.        Actual Payment of Beneficiary's Contribution. The contribution of the beneficiary
will actually be made at the signing of the convention de delegation de mattrise d'ouvrage for each
subproject. This will ensure that AMEXTIPE receives the money in time to meet its obligation
towards consultants and contractors involved in the related subproject, otherwise the agency will lose
its good credit. The agency will therefore wait until this advance has been fully cashed in before
awarding contracts for consulting services and works related to the subprojects.
2.51.         Size of the local contribution to project funding. For the pilot operations, IDA is
financing 100% (under PPF), because no local funding has been put in place in the 1992 budget. For
1993, the local contribution will be 10% of the estimated total cost of the subproject (maltres
d'oeuvre, contractors and agency fees), because, for the first year, asking more might put off
potential beneficiaries (who have not faced such an obligation before) and consequently delay the
actual start of the project. In 1994 and 1995, the local contribution will be 20%, which means that
every dollar contributed by a promotor is leveraged 5 times. Agreement on the size, budgeting and
payment procedures of the government's and the beneficiaries' financial contributions was reached
during negotiations (para. 3.2g).
2.52.         Subprojects already financed. The beneficiary of a subproject already financed may
ask AMEXTIPE to manage it. The eligibility criteria for the subproject will be determined by the
beneficiary and its donor. In such a case, AMEXTIPE will enter into a convention de delegation de
maitrise d'ouvrage which may have a definition of tasks slightly different from the format used under
IDA financing. The convention will stipulate the management fee to be paid to AMEXTIPE (about
10%). The convention should ensure that AMEXTIPE will have the funding available as needed to
pay consultants and contractors quickly and on time. Here again, a full up-front payment of the
beneficiary's contribution, if any, will ensure AMEXTIPE the availability of funds.



24         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
2.53.        It may also happen that the subproject meets the AMEXTIPE's eligibility criteria, and
that the beneficiary has already received some funding from a donor. In this case, the donor's
contribution will be considered as the beneficiary's contribution for the purpose of para. 2.49 above.
The standard AMEXTIPE procedures and convention format will apply.
Project Monitoring and Review
2.54.        Monitoring and Evaluation. In order to better understand the target groups of
beneficiaries (individuals, firms, municipalities, etc.), AMEXTIPE will commission a number of
studies to monitor the issues of labor ratio, wages, cost overruns, completion delays, unit prices, etc.
The mid-term review, based on a sample of construction enterprises, will compute the labor ratio in
the total cost of standard road works, building rehabilitations, sand removal and dune fixing, and
cleaning of gutters and drainage ditches.
2.55.        Annual Reviews. The project will be implemented over a four-year period. The
project design will include an annual review to check the efficiency of AMEXTIPE's procedures and
management (using performance indicators described in para. 2.71) and adopt adequate changes.
Another key factor to monitor is the actual beneficiaries' capacity to pay their financial contribution.
Consequently, it is proposed that the size of the local share and the fund matching mechanism be
reviewed every year, and that new figures and procedures be discussed by GRIM and IDA for the
following year. The key point is that one knows how much IDA funding is available, but not how
much the beneficiaries/promoters are willing and able to pay (altogether). At the beginning of the
project, rationing access to IDA funds could slow down the take-off. But, later, if the demand
appears to be very large, it may be to feasible to raise the contribution of the beneficiary. Agreement
on the scope and dates for the annual reviews was reached during negotiations (para. 3.2b).
2.56.        Mid-Term Review. A mid-Term review will be carried out at the end of 1994, as a
more in-depth annual review. The review will be another opportunity to evaluate, and,if needed, to
modify some major features of the project, such as the size of beneficiaries' contribution to the
financing of subproject, and the procedures under which this contribution is made available to
AMEXTIPE. It will also be an opportunity to review how the credit was allocated to social and
economic subprojects, and to introduce changes if needed. Finally, the review will create an
opportunity to evaluate the need for including new activities in the project scope in order to better
meet the key project objectives. Agreements on periodicity and terms of reference of fiscal,
technical, managerial, and environmental audits; agreement on the short-list of potential auditing
firms or joint-ventures, dates for the mid-term review was reached at negotiations (para. 3.2b).
F.    Procurement
2.57.         The procurement procedures according to which the Agency will select contractors
and award contracts are another important feature of the project. These special procurement
procedures were designed to address the issue of employment generation, and at the same time ensure
adequate competition. They have been successfully used in other similar agencies in the Region.
They were discussed at appraisal and an agreement was reached during negotiations, as to the
adoption of the Manual of Procedures. Similar procurement experiences in Senegal, Niger, and Mali
indicate that such a manual encourages competition. The reporting on procurement will be done
according to the format outlined in Annex 4.
2.58.        It is anticipated that all the civil works contracts will be under UM 30 million (about
or less than US$283,000). In case any contract is higher than this value, International Competitive



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  25
Bidding procedures (ICB) will be followed for such procurement contracts. When the "Bank Sample
Bidding Documents for Smaller Contracts' is published in French, it may be used as well, as no
contract will amount to more than US$10 million.
2.59.         AMEXTIPE will maintain a roster of contractors eligible for Local Competitive
Bidding (LCB). It will set up a list of eligible contractors and engineering firms and individual
professionals according to procedures acceptable to IDA and spelled out in the Manual of Procedures.
The roster will stay open during project execution so as to allow additional applications at any time.
Large firms, foreign and local, using modem equipment are not likely to be interested by the type
and size of most subprojects proposed, but they will not be precluded from bidding. The purpose
of preregistration will be to determine the contractors who can demonstrate their ability to carry out
the proposed labor-intensive works effectively and will, therefore, be eligible to bid. IDA will review
and approve the new selection and satisfy itself that the procedures agree with the Manual of
Procedures. The actual performance of the contractors who are awarded contracts by the Agency will
provide the basis for the Agency to reassess the contractors' classification, and consequently upgrade
or downgrade them. Reassessment of contractor capacity and capability classifications in the roster
will be transparent and based on actual performance (Manual of Procedures Section III, articles D
and E).
2.60.         The target group of firms expected to participate in project procurement comprises
primarily small- and medium-scale enterprises, which are more likely than large ones to bid for labor-
intensive projects. However, given the low level of sophistication of these firms with regard to
administrative and financial management, they are currently discriminated against by the procurement
procedures in force for public contracts. This is one of the basic reasons why it has been deemed
necessary to establish a special agency, with private legal status, to implement the project. Basically,
the objective of the standard procurement procedure is to ensure fair competition among eligible
contractors without requiring them to prepare a complex proposal, including detailed calculations of
price. The core of the procurement procedure will be local advertisement among registered
contractors of a proposed contract for a given subproject. All contractors registered in the roster for
the category of works and the area concerned by the subproject will be invited to bid, and notices will
be published in local press, as to inform potential bidders who have yet to ask to be registered by
AMEXTMPE.
2.61.         The contract, which will be written in simple language and will describe the scope
and nature of the works, proposes a reference price with some straightforward explanations about its
calculation (unit prices and quantities). Contractors will be invited to bid by way of discounts both
on the total price and on the unit prices. Among eligible bidders, the winner will be selected on the
basis of the proposed discount and other criteria (such as timeliness of performance) -- if any is
specified in the bidding documents - and invited to sign the proposed contract. The contract
awarding committee, composed of the Agency's Director General, Technical and Financial Directors,
will have full authority to select the winner. However, it will have to justify in writing, in the
minutes of the meeting, and in reference to the explicit criteria listed in the bidding documents, any
decision not to select the lowest bid. This may happen when the total bid price is lower than the
estimated price by more than 15% and the bidder is unable to provide a credible explanation, or when
unit prices are erratic. The contracting awarding committee will open the bids to the public and the
bidding firms or their representatives may attend the meeting.
2.62.         For all contracts for which there are less than five bidders or for contracts with an
estimated cost equal to or greater than UM 20 million (about or less than US$192,000), the awarding
committee will submit its decision to IDA for approval prior to notifying the winning bidder.



26         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
Bidding documents and bid evaluations of all pilot operations funded by the PPF, and of the first for
each type of works or activities will be subject to review by the Bank prior to awarding notification
to the winning contractor. A post review of all procurement operations of the first year of the project
will be carried out by the Bank. Quarterly management audits will review AMEXTIPE compliance
with bidding procedures described in the Manual of procedures and (for ICB) in Bank guidelines and
sample bidding documents.

Figures in parentheses show IDA amount.
2.63.         Consultant services for training, technical assistance, and project monitoring will be
procured according to IDA guidelines spelled out in Guidelines "Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrower and by the World Bank as Executing Agency". For the mode of selection of consultant
services, the Agency will use short-listing of firms or individuals. Hiring of individuals will be done
on the basis of adequate advertising and hiring of firms will follow the guidelines (Manual of
Procedures. Section IV, B to E, and Section V, C and D). A summary of the consulting services
in man-months required is given in Annex 8.



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  27
2.64.        Procurement of goods will be done by international shopping. Tariffs published by
the International Agencies Procurement Service Office (IAPSO) will be used as reference. Goods
to be procured are two cars, four computers, and furniture for the agency, at the beginning of the
project; two cars, two heavy duty cars, radio equipment, computers, and laboratory equipment for
the DTP; and computers for MON.
2.65.        These procurement procedures have been used by similar agencies in West Africa and
have worked well. As in the first phase, only parallel financing is envisaged. Should joint financing
occur, it will be done in accordance with IDA Guidelines.
G.    Disbursements
2.66.        Since the project seeks to encourage the participation of small and medium-scale
enterprises, it is crucial that contractors and consultants be paid promptly for the works or services
they execute. The manual of procedures allows the Agency to give an advance of up to 20% against
guarantees. The average payment delay will be a key criterion performance of the Agency. The
legal Status of the Agency will allow its General Manager to order payments, by signing checks and
transferring orders, without being submitted to numerous clearances and without being obliged to
surrender actual execution of payments to the Treasury. AGETIP, in Senegal, has been able to pay
its contractors within a week, and this has resulted in a 15% reduction in bidding prices.
2.67.        To expedite project implementation, a Special Account in UM will be opened at a
commercial bank. At all times, this special account will be maintained and operated on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation will be UM 113 million (equivalent to US$1
million) representing eligible expenditures financed by IDA over a four-month period. The Special
Account will be replenished monthly provided requests exceed US$100,000 equivalent, and will be
accompanied by a Bank statement and a reconciliation statement for the Special Account.
2.68.        All withdrawal applications, after the first one, will be completed on presentation of
monthly accounts. These accounts will be accompanied by full documentation, except for contracts
for civil works valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent (UM 2.25 million) and for goods and
services valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent (UM 2.25 million) for which disbursements will
be made on the basis of SOEs. In such cases, the relevant documentation will be retained by
AMEXTIPE for review by IDA supervision missions and the project's external auditors.
2.69.        The IDA credit will be disbursed on the basis of the categories shown in Table 5.
The closing date will be September 30, 1997. Disbursements will be made on the basis of 100% of
total expenditures for IDA's share of Public Works and Services, related consulting services, and
AMEXTIPE's operating costs and 100% of all other categories. IDA's share of Public Works and
Services, related consulting services, and related AMEXTIPE's operating costs will be 100% under
PPF, 90% in 1993, and 80% in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997. The Govermnent/Beneficiaries will
disburse 100% of their common share of Public Works and Services, related consulting services, and
related AMEXTIPE's operating costs. This share will be equivalent to 10% (in 1993) and 20% (in
1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997). The 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, the Government's budgets
will include appropriate lines of credit to finance its financial assistance to beneficiaries. The
estimated cumulative contribution of the Government/Beneficiaries for each subproject will be paid
to AMEXTIPE at the signing of the respective convention de delegation de maftrise d'ouvrage. This
procedure has been selected to ensure the independence of the Executing Agency in making payments



28         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report
to contractors, who have had very bad experience with disbursement procedures pertaining to
payments from counterparts funds. To ensure that IDA does not disburse all of its contribution
without corresponding action by Government/Beneficiaries, agreement was reached at negotiations
that would permit IDA to delay the approval of the new batch of sub-projects at the end of each year,
should the Government/beneficiaries have failed to make their contribution and the agency failed to
enforce its manual of procedures (3.4f).

H.    Accounting, Auditing and Reporting
2.70.         The accounting system will be set up as described in the manual of procedures.
Consolidated project accounts will be maintained by the Agency. These accounts will be audited
quarterly (with quarterly reports) by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, according to terms of
reference agreed by IDA. Auditors will express separate opinions on SOEs and special accounts.
Project accounts and auditors' reports will be submitted to IDA within three months of the close of
each quarter. Besides financial audits, AMEXTIPE will submit to quarterly management and
technical audits. Following its Manual of Procedures and its By-Laws, the Agency will submit
monthly progress reports and prepare a project completion report (PCR) within three months of the
closing date. The appointment of the appoint auditors for a period of three years is a condition
effectiveness (para. 3.3g).

2.72.           Supervision Missions. The Project will be supervised every four months. Supervision
missions will consist of field trips to visit work sites to review financial and management practices,
bidding, and payments procedures, micro, and small-scale enterprise participation as well as
maximization of employment creation. Supervision missions will also carefully monitor the number
of mattres d'oeuvre, the number of firms bidding and winning contracts and the number of firms
receiving technical assistance. A detailed supervision plan is presented in Annex 12.

2.73.         AMEXTIPE's projects in the areas of sanitation and cleaning of urban drainage,
urban renewal, road maintenance, sand removing, dune fixing, public gardening, garbage collection,
school and clinic construction and rehabilitation will lead to significant improvements in the urban
environment, as shown by the review of the environmental impact of the pilot operations. Particular
attention has been given to the need for a fruitful cooperation between AMEXTIPE and:
(a)    the UNSO-funded project which coordinates at the national level the fight against the
spread of sand dunes (see para. 2.24); and
(b)    the National Environmental Protection Service (Direction de la Protection de la
nature [DPN]).
AMEXTIPE will have business relationships with these two bodies as needed for the
implementation of its portfolio of subprojects.
2.74.         The annual technical audits will also include an environmental component.  In
addition, for the mid-term review, AMEXTIPE will commission an assessment of the environmental
impact of the subprojects carried out during the first half of the project. This review will examine
all subprojects pertaining to sand-removal, drainage, building and road rehabilitation, and garbage
collection to determine their environmental impact and make recommendations on how to mitigate
any adverse impacts in the future.
K.    Impact on Unemployment and Poverty
2.75.         Unemployment. The main objective of the project is to help fight unemployment in
urban areas. The expected impact of the project is three-fold:
(a)    direct impact during the project. Assuming that 25% of the value of the contracts
for works to wages, and on the basis of an average cost per worker of UM 10,000
per month, the project will finance about 3,400 man-years over the four years of the
project.  This direct impact will be monitored closely through the related
performance indicator (see para. 2.66);
(b)    indirect impact during the project.  Each dollar or UM  spent under a public
works/services contract has a secondary impact on the local economy through
subcontracting to and purchasing from local firms. This impact, although potentially
of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact, is currently impossible to
estimate, due to lack of reliable and detailed data on the labor force working for
internal consumption; and
(c)    indirect impact after the project. The project will demonstrate the appropriateness
of labor-based methods for carrying out simple works and services. About UM 600 4/
million per year of such works and services can benefit from the lessons learned
under the project. If and when Mauritanian authorities and customers accept fully
A/     About UM 250 million for roads, UM 200 million for municipal works and services, and UM 150 million for
other works and services in other sectors such as agriculture, in 1992.



MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraisal Report  31
this finding and use the labor-based methods, one can expect that about 10% of the
cost of the related works or services will shift from capital to labor. On that basis,
and using the same rate of UM 10,000 per month, the potential future impact would
be 6,000 man-months per year. This impact means the potential creation of about
600 permanent jobs.
2.76.         Poverty. The simple nature of the works and services to be financed under the
project, and the systematic use of small contractors to carry out these tasks, leads one to expect that
at least 60% of the temporary direct jobs will be offered to unskilled workers. This percentage will
be monitored as a performance indicator. One can expect the same percentage to apply to the
permanent jobs mentioned in para. 2.75(c) above. The percentage of unskilled labor related to the
indirect employment mentioned in para. 2.75(b) is unknown.
L.    Economic Analysis
2.77.         An economic analysis has been carried out for the trial operations to be carried out
under the PPF, on the basis of a comparison of discounted economic costs and benefits over time.
Specific benefits depend on the type of subproject, but include among other things:
(a)    reduction in vehicle operating costs (in the case of urban road maintenance or
rehabilitation subprojects);
(b)    reduction of the quantity of sand to be removed from roads;
(c)    reductions in the cost of services, in the case of labor-intensive garbage collection
which would otherwise be undertaken by more mechanized technologies; and
(d)    avoided cost of reconstruction (in the case of subprojects involving maintenance or
rehabilitation of infrastructure and/or buildings that would otherwise deteriorate).
Pilot projects have internal rates of return ranging from 17% to 44%. Rehabilitation
of classrooms and of health facilities reach the highest IRRs (42 and 44%). A dune fixing operation
shows an IRR of 24%, and a street drainage extension reaches 17%. Due to the large backlog of
infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance, its seems likely that IRRs will, on average, be well
above the 12% minimum that is included in the Manuel de procedures.
2.78.         Since the agency is created for the management of the project, and is expected to
disappear unless project owners want to contract out to it the management of their projects,
AMEXTIPE's operating costs are incremental costs (and they will be kept in appropriate proportion
to the costs of the subprojects managed by the agency). The progressive participation of the
beneficiaries and of the Government to the financing of these operating costs is also a specific feature
of AMEXTIPE.
M.    Benefits and Risks
2.79.         Benefits. The project will create low-cost, short-term and long-term employment
opportunities using private sector enterprises in the execution of social and economic public works.



32         MAURITANIA: Construction Capacity and Employment Project - Staff Appraiial Report
It will generate incomes for many categories of the work force (in the building and construction
trades). The project will also help the Government in the area of project management. It will
demonstrate the efficiency of private sector management in public works execution. Subprojects
concerned with garbage collection, sewer cleaning, and dune fixing will produce environmental
benefits.
2.80.         Risks. The main risks concern the continuation of the Agency after the project and
its sustainability as project manager. Specific measures for cost recovery such as the introduction
of a service fee by the Agency for execution works are designed to minimize this possibility. The
introduction of cost-sharing by the municipalities is intended to create the conditions for AMEXTIPE
to operate independently of IDA and other donor financing after the project ends. Another risk is
the fear that the Government may try to influence the Agency resulting in the latter's loss of
independence and operational efficiency. These risks will be minimized by the establishment of
internal control mechanisms and appropriate supervisory procedures by independent engineering and
consulting firms. The risk of political interference will be reduced by strict adherence to the manual
of procedures.
2.81.         AMEXTlPE'sfuture. The private legal status of AMEXTIPE makes it difficult to
predict with certainty how it will have evolved by the end of IDA credit term. However, it is
possible to indicate certain options that its owners will be able to choose among, as there will be no
special projects or markets reserved to support its activities in the area of delegated contract
management. The first option is for AMEXTIPE to continue with its current status as an NGO with
the same board. A second option is its conversion to a for-profit organization in which shares will
be sold to its current board members and to other investors. In either case, the members of its board
will decide its future.

Annex I
INSTITUMONAL SETUP
The institutional setup of this project is reflected in legal and contractual relationships
among the various actors concerned: the central government, local governments and other beneficiaries,
the Executing Agency, contractors, and consulting firms. The term 'contractorse is used here to include
building and construction companies, cooperatives, Groupements d 'lntcret Economique (GIE) and other
legally constituted entities able to enter into a contract for subproject execution. The term oconsulting
firm" refers principally to engineering and architectural firms, but may eventually include other legally
constituted entities (e.g., non-governmental organizations (NGOs)) able to provide the services required.
The legal texts setting forth the above-mentioned contractual relationships are described below:
(a)    The implementation of the project is entrusted to an executing agency named Agence
Mawitanienne d 'Excution des Trawy    d 'lntir& Public pour l 'Enalol (AMEX77PE),
hereafter referred to as 'the Agency". The Statutes (Articles of Agreement} of the
Agency (Standts, Annex 2), which must at all times be acceptable to the Bank, provide
that the Agency is a non-profit associadon whose Assembie GCnErale includes
representatives of: the CofEdEration GCEnrale des Enployeurs Maurtaniens (CGEM);
the Associadon des Makres; the Union Natlonale des lravalears Mawritankens (UNTM);
and the coordination committee of NGOs operating in the country, when established, is
expected to join. The role of the President of the Assemblic GinErale is limited to
convening and presiding over the meetinp thereof. The AssemblEe GEnErale also
includes one person elected Director General of the Agency, to whom is fully entrusted
the day-t-day management of the Agency. As provided by the Statutes of the Agency,
the Director General may be replaced only by extraordinary decision of the Assemblie
GinErale. The Director General, however, must be at all times acceptable to the Bank.
The Agency was effectively created after the founding members of the Assemblde
GEnirale hold their first meeting (AssemblEe GEnE rale Consttuttwe) to approve the
Statutes, and the Mlnist*re de l 'IntErleur issued its agrEment. The creation of the Agency
was a condition of negotiations.
(b)    The Frameworlc Ageement (Convention, Annex 3) between the Government and the
Agency describes the latter's nodus operandi in the context of the present project.
Among other things, the Agreement establishes: that the Agency will execute subprojects
consistent with those defined in the project; that, in the beginning, these subprojects will
be exclusively located in the Nouakchott area; that the central or local governments will
place non-reimbursable financial resources at the disposal of the Agency, including the
proceeds of the credit (in a Special Account); that the Agency can also receive resources
from other sources; that the Procedures Manual is an integral part of the Framework
Agreement; that the Director General of the Agency has full powers in connection with
the management of the Agency; that the Director General can be replaced only in
accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the Agency; that the Government confers
to the Agency all powers required for the implementation of the project; that the Agency
will execute all subprojects in strict compliance with the Procedures Manual (which is an



36            Constuction Capacity ad Employment Promjet Staff Appaial Repot. Annex 1
integral part of the Framework Agreement); and that the Bylaws of the Agency cannot
be modified without Government's agreement.
(c)    The Bylaws of the Agency (Rfglement Interieur, Annex 5) establish: the internal
organization; hiring, firing and other personnel management procedures; and
administrative rules and regulations. They ensure, among other things, that the Agency
will have a small staff, including a Director General asisted by one Financial Director
and one Technical Director.
(d)    The Procedures Manual (Manuel de Procedures, Annex 4), which must at all times be
acceptable to the Bank, recalls the fundamental objectives of the Agency and establishes:
the procedures whereby the Agency receives and processes subproject execution requests
from beneficiaries (central or local governments and public interest groups such as
Associations de Parents d'ElEves), including the model Execution Agreement
(Convention-7ype de Mattrlse d'Ouvrage Ddliguee) it will sip with the beneficiary if it
decides to execute the subproject; the procedures used by the Agency to establish and
continuously update a roster of contractors for different types of subprojects; the various
procurement procedures to be used by the Agency for subproject execution (depending
on the estimated value of the contract), including Sample Bidding Doauments with model
contract to be signed with contractor (Modtle de Lette de Sommission, Modake-pe de
Cauion d'Avwnce, and Contrat-3)pe de Trawm=); the procuremet procedures to be used
by the Agency for subproject engineering and supervision, induding nodel contracts to
be signed with consulting firms (Contrat-4pe d'Etudes and Contrat-7)pe de Supervision
des Travaux); the accounting and disbursement procedures to be used by the Agency in
connection with each subproject; the financial management procedures to be used by the
Agency; the nature and periodicity of reporting by the Agency; the procedures to be
followed to secure independent external auditing of the Agency; and personnel
management procedures.
The operating of the agency and the relations with the central and local governments, with
the beneficiaries, and with contractors and consultants are shown in the following tables.

au dossier d'appel d'offres; (iv) ne comportent pas de graves erreurs de calcul;
et (v) sont, par ailleurs, recevables. Toute offre qui n'est pas conforme pour
l'essentiel aux conditions et specifications du dossier d'appel d'offres, soit qu'elle
presente avec celles-ci des differences considerables, soit qu'elle comprenne des
reserves trop importantes, est rejetee. Une fois que les plis ont ete ouverts, le
soumissionnaire n'est plus autorise I corriger ou I supprimer les differences ou
reserves importantes.

le coQt de chaque offre et de comparer les offres entre elles sur cette base. Le
prix de l'offre lu I haute voix lors de la seance d'ouverture des plis doit &tre
ajuste pour tenir compte de toute erreur de calcul. Si un prix global et des prix
unitaires sont respectivement au-dessous de 15% ou 25% des prix de reference,
et les explications fournies pour justifier ces ecarts de prix ne sont pas
acceptables, cette soumission sera rejetee. La Commission d'Attribution doit
etablir un rapport detaille sur l'evaluation et la comparaison des offres indiquant

justifient une prorogation de la validite des offres, une demande ecrite doit etre
presentee I tous les soumissionnaires avant la date d'expiration.   Les
soumissionnaires ne doivent pas Wtre invites ni autorises I cette occasion I
modifier leur prix ou d'autres conditions de leur offre. Us ont le droit de refuser

appel d'offres, I'Agence peut alors entamer des discussions avec le
soumissionnaire ayant pr6sente l'offre la moins disante (ou s'il n'obtient pas de
reponse interessante, avec le soumissionnaire se plagant imm6diatement apres)

dossier d'appel d'offres ou qu'il n'y a pas jeu efficace de la concurrence. Quand
elle rejette toutes les offres, I'Agence doit en etudier la raison avant de lancer un

SECTION II. Gestion du Personnel
En matibre de gestion du personnel l'Agence sera geree suivant les principes de la
direction par objectifs.
A)    DMnition de la direction par objectifs
La Direction PAR OBJECTIFS est un effort systematise d'enrichissement des taches I
la verticale qui permet au cadre et I l'employe, selon leur niveau de competence, de contribuer I l'atteinte
des objectifs de leur organisation. C'est un processus pour lequel le superieur et le subordonne, I tout
palier administratif, se rencontrent et etablissent les resultats I atteindre par le subordonne pour une
periode determinee. Ces resultats s'inscrivent directement I l'interieur des buts de l'organisation. Une
rEvision des progrbs s'effectue a une date prevue afin d'evaluer les realisations concretes au regard des
previsions etablies.
B)    Procedure d'etabHlssemnent de la Lettre d'objectits annuels
Chaque cadre ou agent de mattrise regoit une fois par an, au debut du cycle annuel, sa
Lettre d'objectifs annuels; l'annee de reference se ddroule du ler juillet au 30 juin de l'annee suivante.
1)    Grace I cette methode le Directeur General doit:
(a)    faire savoir I ses collaborateurs ce qu'il attend d'eux,
(b)    les aider a faire efficacement leur travail,
(c)    identifier ceux d'entre eux qui sont aptes I assumer de plus grandes
responsabilites,
(d)    retribuer lers contributions,
(e)    sanctionne leurs defaillances.
2)     De leur c6tE, les collaborateurs doivent savoir:
(a)    comment est evalue leur travail,



Contuction CapacitY and Employment Project. Staff Appaisl Repoit Annex 4      81
(b)    cc qu'ils peuvent attendre de la performance.
3)     C'est ainsi qu'il est necessaire de mettre en place un programme de lmurs efforts qui:
(a)    permette I chacun de connattre, au moins une fois par an, l'opinion
circonstanciee de son superieur sur les resultats de son travail,
(b) incite les superieurs I conseiller utilement louts collaborateurs sur leur evolution
individuelle (amelioration des resultats, promotion eventuelle),
(c)    serve de base I l'application de la politique d'augmentation de salaire au merite.
4)     Processus:
(a)    En dEbut de cycle annuel, le Directeur General de l'Agence reunit l'ensemble du
personnel et expose la mission et lea objectifs globaux de l'Agence pour l'annEe
I venir et pour toute la duree du projet.Les objectifs globaux portent donc sur un
horizon pluriannuel et ont un caractere multidimensionnel.
(b)    Par ailleurs, il etablit une lettre d'objectifs individualisee pour le personnel.
(c)    Chaque superieur organise une reunion de l'ensemble de ses collaborateurs et
analyse avec eux les objectia de son unite; i s'agit d'une presentation et d'une
explication des objectifs du service ou du departement d'oi decouleront les
objectifs individuels. I1 s'entretient par la suite personnellement avec chaque
collaborateur afin de discuter de l'organisation de son travail, de ses difficultes
potentielles, des contraintes inevitables, pour parvenir b un accord sur ses propres
objectifs individuels, et definir les critbres de jugement destines I l'analyse de ses
resultats. Tout cela est note, en synthese dans un document qui sert de Lettre
d'objectifs annuels.
SEC1TION m.           Proc6dure d'Evaluatlon
A)    Auto-Evaluation
L'auto-contr6le preconise par la Direction par objectif& est une importante source de
motivation. L'auto-contr6le repose en effet sur le postulat suivant: los collaborateurs sont responsables
et veulent contribuer I l'atteinte dos objectifs; c'ost I eux de s'auto-controler quant aux moyens et
mesuros k prendre pour atteindre leurs objectifs. En se rapportant I ua lettre d'objectifs, chaque
collaborateur peut constater son avance ou son retard et prendre de ce fait, los decisions necessaires. II
peut ainsi sans attendre la fin du cycle annuel, s'auto-evaluer, et solliciter au besoin l'avis de son
superieur hierarchique. 11 utilisera pour cela, la fiche d'analyse de l'avancement dos objectifs.

STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION
The actions described below were undertaken during project preparation:
(a)    a coordination committee was set up for the preparation of the project. This
committee is chaired by the Director of Planning and includes representatives of the
Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Equipment and Transport, and the Municipality
of Nouakchott. This committee has been very active since the first preparation
mission, and a has taken a major part in the preparation of the project.
(b)    a Mauritanian construction industry specialist was retained to carry out a survey of
small- and medium-sized building and construction firms in Mauritania in order to
gain a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, identify the constraints
they face, ascertain the absorptive capacity of the industry, and propose suitable
remedial measures;
(c)   the same consultant was later asked to review the needs for managerial and technical
training of the typical Mauritanian contractors, and to prepare a technical assistance
and training program to be provided to the contractors to be involved in the
implementation of the five pilot operations. A draft action plan is currently under
review by the coordination committee.
(c)   the Ministry of Equipment and Transport (MET) and the Municipality of Nouakchott
identified five pilot subprojects for execution under PPF, before project effectiveness;
these operations are described in Annex 13. The execution of these pilot operations
will help the Agency fine tune several aspects of project implementation;
(d)    hiring of Mauritanian (engineering and architectural) consulting firms was begun to
prepare technical proposals and feasibility analyses of pilot subprojects; to prepare
bidding documents for the five pilot subprojects retained; and to supervise their
execution;
(e)    Framework Agreement between the Agency and the Government, have been drafted
and reviewed by a Mauritanian Lawyer, discussed in detail with the coordination
committee; the Framework Agreement has been signed By the Government and
AMEXTIPE on December 9, 1992 and the Agency's Articles of Agreement, Bylaws
and Procedures Manual have been adopted by the Agency's constitutive Assembly
and approved by the Government; the Agency has been set up on December 2, 1992,
and has been registered by the Ministry of Interior;
(f)   following a widely advertised search of candidates for the position of Director
General of AMEXTIPE one was chosen by the AMEXTIPE's General Assembly
during the first meeting; this Director General was hired as a consultant to participate
to the negotiations;
(g)    a Mauritanian consultant was hired to prepare an emergency action plan for the
Municipality of Nouakchott. His report has been discussed with the coordination



120          Constrtion Capacity and Employment Project. Staff Apprmil Report. Annex 6
committee, the Municipality and representatives of the Ministries of Finances and
Interior. The Municipal Council has adopted several measures proposed by the
action plan, which have been already partly implemented. The measures adopted and
implemented relate to the reorganization of the service in charge of collection of
municipal taxes, the replacement of illiterate tax collectors by literate ones, and the
issuance of new instructions for tax collection. Four hundred redundant staff
positions were identified and elimination of these positions has begun.
(g)    Terms of Reference for accounting assistance to AMEXTIPE were prepared; and a
short-list of three Mauritanian accounting firms was established;
(h)   terms of reference have been upon during negotiations for: (i) the Agency's external
audit; (ii) the technical and managerial assistance to and the training program for
contractors, consultants and beneficiaries involved in the implementation of the pilot
operations; and (iv) the grassroots participation program.
2.           The above-mentioned actions have been financed with the proceeds from two Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) advances: P-738-0-MLI approved on April 3, 1992 for US$125,000, and
P-738-1 approved on September 17, 1992, for US$700,000.

dana It projt DICE,
1.            La reussite du projet DICE dependra largement de la capacite des municipalites I degager
les moyens financiers adaptes au volume des travaux urbains programmes par AMEXTIPE. En effet, la
liberation effective de la contribution communale (dont le montant sera definitivement fixe lors des
negociations) constituera une condition prealable I l'engagement de toutes actions urbaines. Cette question
appelle par cons6quent une attention particuliere de tous les responsables et l'adoption rapide de certaines
mesures d'assainissement financier, aussi bien internes qu'externes aux collectivitds beneficiaires.
A.    Commune de Nouakchott
2.            Cette contrainte de la disponibiite prealable du financement communal a justifid
1'engagement d'une r6flexion sur une serie d'actions I court terme (voir Rapport sur le Plan d'Actions
Immediates pour la Commune de Nouakchott -PAIN) et a abouti I la formulation d'un diagnostic acceptd
par toutes los parties concernma, Commune, Tresor Public, Direction Generale des Imp6ts (DOI),
Direction des Collectivit6s Locales (DCL).
REforme de la gestion municipales
3.            Le redressement de la situation financiere de la Commune et les mesures d'amelioration
de la gestion municipale ont ete discutes simultanement au niveau interne et en coordination avec le
Ministere des Finances.
4.            Sur le plan interne(services municipaux). Le plan d'action de la Mairie de Nouakchott
est centre sur deux priorites: une meilleure collecte des recettes municipales et une reduction des
depenses:
(a)    collecte des recettes:
-      separation des fonctions d'assiette et de recouvrement au niveau des taxes municipales,
-      mise en place effective des structures administrativos permettant de mener I bien ces
taches (d6signation des responsables, definition des attributions, d6termination des
objectifs et des modalites d'interessement, etc),
-      s6lection d'agents ayant des profils adaptes I la fonction du recensement ou de la collecte,
-      definition des modalites d'intervention et la mise en oeuvre des moyens de
fonctionnement (tickets, moyens de deplacements, materiels, etc),



Projet de ddveloppcmnent de l'industric de la construction ct de 1'enploi. Annexe 7  125
(b)    reduction des depenses:
-      simplification de l'organigramme et la compression du personnel excedentaire (304
agents) afin de reduire les charges de la structure municipale et de degager une marge
accrue d'autofinancement,
privatisation du nettoiement, en commencant par deux moughataa (revragh Zeina et
Ksar).
Ces recommandations ete examinees lors de la session du Conseil Municipal le 19 mai
1992. Un programme de redressement a ete adopte et plusieurs decisions ont deja connu un dEbut
d'execution. En ce qui concerne la gestion des recettes municipales, la Commune de Nouakchott a
procede I la reorganisation de ses services financiers, I la selection du personnel charge de la collecte
des taxes, et I la ddfinition de nouvelles procedures de gestion des recettes municipales. En matibre de
depenses, une commission chargee d'operer la mise en oeuvre du programme de compression du
personnel a ete mise en place et, selon le maire de Nouakchott, la procedure portera sur 354 agents et
sera menee I bien d'ici la fin du mois d'aoet 1992. D'autre part, le principe de la privatisation du service
de nettoiement municipal a egalement et6 considere par l'autorite municipale et les dispositions
appropriees seront prises au cours de la prochaine gestion pour adapter les modalites de la gestion
actuelle.
5.            Sur le plan externe (directions techniques du Ministere des Finances). L'objectif principal
est de renforcer la collaboration entre la Direction Generale des Imp6ts, la Tresorerie Generale et la
municipalite pour accrottre l'efficacite dans la gestion de la fiscalite municipale. L'etude PAIN I
recommande les mesures suivantes:
(a)    mise I disposition des moyens materiels pour assurer le deplacement des agents de
recouvrements,
(b)    adoption d'un systeme incitatif calcule sur les performances effectives des agents
intervenants directement dans la mobilisation des ressources fiscales locales,
(c)    generalisation de la couverture fiscale de la commune,
(d)    amelioration de la comptabilisation des recettes municipales et acceleration de la mise I
disposition des fonds,
(e)    amelioration des emissions, la systematisation de leurs prises en charge comptables et
l'engagement des procedures de recouvrement contentieux sur une base plus objective.
6.            DEcisions prises: Lors d'une seance de travail, presidee par le Maire de Nouakchott, les
divers responsables des services financiers, ont convenu des points suivants:
(a)    de nouvelles procedures d'information sur les ressources de la municipalite seront mises
au point: I l'avenir les services financiers informeront los autorites locales des



126            Projet de dhvelopprnent de l'industrie de la construction ct de 1'emploi. Annexe 7
programmes de recensement (date et zone) et transmettrons regulierement les
performances enregistrees par les services,
(b)    les deux directions (DGI et Tr6sor) proposeront au maire un programme de travail I
court terme qui constituera leur strategie pour une am6lioration significative du
recouvrement des impots locaux. Les objectifs seront clairement pr6sentes et lea moyens
indispensables pour les atteindre (materiels, motivations, etc) seront identifi6s et chiffr6s.
Ces propositions seront transmises a la municipalit6 au plus tard pour le 20 juillet
prochain,
(c)    I'autorite municipale repondra I ces propositions dans les meilleurs d6lais et un accord
devrait intervenir avant la fin du mois de juillet. Les premibres actions seront engageea
des le mois d'ao(it grace au soutien financier de la municipalite,
(d)    des mesures d'accompagnement seront envisagees afin de faciliter la tiches des services
techniques. La municipalite preparera une fiche de projet pour le marquage des lots et
proposera un programme d'equipement des voies (plaques de nom de rue). Aprbs etude
de ce dossier, cette operation pourrait figurer au nombre des projets finances par le projet
DICE,
(f)    enfin, pour tester le dispositif qui sera adopte prochainement, les services
techniques proposeront une operation-pilote dans la zone de Tevragh Zeina pour
renforcer la mobilisation de la fiscalite foncibre. Ce dossier sera finalise avant la
fin du mois de juillet 1992. Le Ministere du Plan transmettra I la Banque les
documents contractuels qui engageront les diverses parties prenantes.
5.            Le lancement de ces operations est susceptible d'ameliorer rapidement la capacite
fmnancibre de la municipalite. Le redressement de la fiscalite foncibre sera particulibrement significative
car elle attestera de la volonte reelle de mettre en oeuvre une forme de collaboration, dynamique et
efficace. En consequence, le ratio "recettes municipales collectees par habitant' sera inclus dans les
indicateurs de performance pour le composant urbain du projet. Le Ministere du Plan coordonnera les
reunions pour entreprendre les actions mentionnees ci-dessus, et transmettra I la Banque, pour examen,
les contrats negocies entre la Commune de Nouakchott et les departements techniques des ministeres
interesses.
ExEcution des sous-projets en zone urbaine
7.            projets-pilotes :Les fiches des projets-pilotes sur les travaux urbains (ratissage et
nettoiement de sites, collecte et enlTvement des ordures menagbres, travaux de drainage, rehabilitation
d'une ecole et d'un centre de sante, travaux de voirie) ont ete finalisees par les services techniques de la
Commune de Nouakchott. II reste I hierarchiser ces fiches en fonction d'un ordre de prioritd qui sera fixe
par les responsables de la municipalite. Ce classement sera communique I la Banque avant la fin du mois
de Janvier 1993. Les operations pilotes retenues seront financees I 100% par la deuxibme tranche du
PPF du projet DICE.

8.            Futurs sous-proJets: Pour qu'AMEXTIPE soit pleinement operationnelle lors de la mise
en vigueur du credit, il faut preparer un portefeuille de sous-projets selon le chronogramme suivant est
propose:
(a)    avant la fin Janvier 1992: identification des projets au niveau de la municipalite
et preparation des fiches techniques, presentation d'un portefeuile de projets
pour la premiere annee apres concertation Commune- AMEXTIPE,
(b)    pour la mise en vigueur du credit: accord definitif sur le portefeuile de projet executes
durant la premiere annee,
(c)    I la mise en vigueur du credit: lancement des etudes techniques et execution des
operations.
9.            Proets sieciaux. Parmi les projets qui pourraient etre inscrits dans le premier portefeuille
de l'agence AMEXTIPE et qui seront executes dans le cadre du credit principal au cours de la gestion
1993, la mission recommande qu'une attention particuliere soit reservee aux deux operations suivantes:
(a)    la mise en place d'un systeme d'adressage sur une zone pilote: il conviendrait de
proceder I la denomination des voies, la mise en place de la signalisation verticale des
noms de voies, et la numerotation des parcelles au pochoir. L'execution de ces travaux
devrait etre preparee par une etude definissant la mdthodologie la plus adaptee. Cette
operation peut avoir un impact tres favorable sur le recouvrement fiscal,
(b)    la construction ou rEhabilitation du batiment dans lequel sont installees l'Inspection des
Impots et la Perception de la zone pilote de l'operation fonciere (Tevragh Zeina). Un
avant projet d'une structure d'accueil plus fonctionnelle, prepare par les services
techniques de la commune, pourrait etre examine lors de la negociation.
La municipalite sera le maltre d'ouvrage de ces deux operations. Si elles sont retenues,
il appartiendra aux responsables locaux d'inscrire ces projets au nombre de leurs operations prioritaires
et de liberer la contrepartie locale.
B      Op*ations dans les autres communes urbaines de Mauritanie
10.           Sous reserve d'une analyse de faisabilite, l'agence AMEXTIPE pourrait financer des
investissements decentralises lors de la deuxieme annee d'activ,td. Dans ce but, il y aura lieu d'identifier
un portefeuille de projet mobilisant par exemple 20% de l'enveloppe annuelle. Afin d'apprecier la
faisabilite technique et financibre de ces operations, les justificatifs de la capacite financibre des
principales villes de Mauritanie seront communiques I la Banque. Dans l'hypothtse d'une suite favorable
I l'extension de la zone de competence d'AMEXTIPE, l'agence identifiera les collectivites locales
beneficiaires et procedera I la classification des projets en fonction soit de la rentabilite economique ou
de l'utilite sociale. Le choix definitif des futurs partenaires sera determine par la disponibilite de la
contrepartie budgetaire. A cet effet, la Direction des Collectivites Locales du Ministere de l'Interieur



128            Projet de developpement de l'industrie de la constrction et de 1'emploi. Annexe 7
pourra prendre en consideration l'utilisation du fonds intercommunal pour aider les communes I financer
leur contribution aux sous-projets. Ceci aiderait les communes I acceder aux services d'AMEXTIPE,
et permettrait aussi d'entreprendre simultanement, afin d'en reduire le co9t, plusieurs operations dans la
meme region geographique.
11.           Calendrier. II pourrait eftre le suivant:
(a)    Fin juillet 1993: production par la DCL (Ministbre de l'Interieur) des statistiques
financibres decrivant 1'execution des trois derniers budgets communaux;
(b)    au 31 septembre 1993: inventaires des projets decentralis6s;
(c)    au 31 novembre 1993: proposition du portefeuille pour la deuxieme ann6e
d'activit6 I l'AID.
C.    Rfllexion sur le secteur urbain en Mauritanie
12.           Outre la r6alisation de travaux en milieu urbain, le projet DICE financera 6galement une
r6flexion sur les orientations majeures du secteur. Evalu6es I environ 500 000 dollars US, les principales
actions qui seront financ6es viseront soit I accompagner des op6rations urbaines, soit I pr6ciser le cadre
institutionnel dans lequel se situe l'activit6 des collectivit6s locales en Mauritanie.
13.           Actions d'accompagnement: pour l'essentiel, les 6tudes pr6vues visent soit I amEliorer
la mobilisation des ressources locales, soit a optimiser l'utilisation des cr6dits municipaux. La mission
propose de considErer les points suivants:
(a)    I titre de mesure d'urgence, I'acquisition de moyens informatiques I6gers pour
les services financiers de la Commune de Nouakchott,
(b)    la dEfinition d'une methodologie simple d'adressage dans la ville de Nouakchott afm de
faciliter la localisation des contribuables,
(c)    la definition d'un syst2me de collecte des ordures menagbres favorisant
l'intervention d'op6rateurs prives (pre-collecte, transfert et gestion des d6charges
municipales.

PROGRAM TO INCREASE GRASSROOIS PARTICIPATION
Terms of Reference
Introduction
1.           The Construction Capacity and Employment Project includes a program  of
information dissemination and consciousness raising among the population at large and the
beneficiaries of subprojects in particular. This program is seen as an important tool in (a) improving
communication between the grassroots and the local authorities; and (b) increasing the commitment
of direct beneficiaries to maintain the civil works or continue the physical services executed under
the subprojects.
2.           The program will contain the following activities:
(a)    a series of sample surveys in selected neighborhoods in each commune of Nouakchott
before and mid-way through project implementation. These surveys will help
ascertain the priority needs of the local population and will help Identify subprojects;
(b)   local meetings, before and after subproject implementation, with the leaders of
beneficiary neighborhoods and representatives of local groups. These meetings will
present the philosophy and modus operandi of AMEXTIPE and the objectives of the
subprojects and will encourage the support of the population to maintain or continue
the relevant works or services of the subproject; and
(c)    a multi-media campaign throughout project implementation, which will emphasize the
importance of health and sanitation and the benefits to be derived from responsible
behavior and hygienic practices.
uSReuKired
3.           These activities will be outlined in an Action Plan to be prepared by a sociologist
under the supervision of the Director General of the Agency (AMEXTIPE). The principal
responsibilities of the sociologist are:
(a)   to organize and prepare the sample surveys. Ihis includes the elaboration of the
sampling method, the identification of the sample; the design of the questionnaire,
the training of survey-takers, and the analysis of survey results;
(b)   to organize the local meetings. Ihe expert will prepare the way for these meetings
by contacting the key leaders and representatives of the selected neighborhoods in
order to gain their support. More specifically, ho will define the agendas, identify
the speakers, prepare relevant documnts to be distributed, organize any sketches
deemed necessary to promote grassroots involvement, and prepare short minutes of
the meetings. If necessary, he will participate in and stimulate the discussions;



136           Constucidon Capacity and Employment Project. Staff Appmail Rnport. Annex 9
(c)    to elaborate the themes and messages for the media campaign. Given the popularity
of radio broadcasts, the expert will determine the optimal time to reach the bulk of
the population, and prepare concise and simple messages which address and are
sensitive to the concerns of the local population. He will also make arrangements for
periodic TV spots, which will illustrate the works of the AMEXTIPE and other
major events during project implementation. He will prepare different pamphlets and
posters, highlighting different themes on hygiene, clean environment, etc., and will
recommend logos for other promotional needs, such as T-shirts, caps, etc.;
(d)   to prepare an implementation schedule for the above activities, in keeping with the
general implementation schedule of the project;
(e)    to identify and recommend specialized firms, as necessary, to carry out the different
activities of the Action Plan; and
(f)    to identify criteria for an annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the grassroots
participation program.
Profile and Duration
4.            The sociologist should have: (a) experience in communication methods appropriate
at the grassroots level; (b) first-hand experience in carrying out and analyzing surveys, particularly
'open-ended' surveys, and skills in training survey-takers in this method; and (c) good
communication skills, particularly to gain the confidence of local leaders and to convey clear and
simple messages to the bulk of the population. Given the nature of his intervention, the expert must
be familiar with local customs and practices and have knowledge of key local languages.
5.            The duration of the consulting services is about one year over the period of the
Project. It is clear that the greatest involvement is required during the first year of project
implementation.

367.000 UM pour la peinture et le reste pour la menuiserie et lea toitures en tlea ondulde.
3.            Situation sans Projet
Certaines de ces salls presentent des defauts menacants qui pourraient conduire I leur
fermeture s'ils ne sont pas traites (fissuration des dalli en beton, flechissement de la toiture en tUaes
ondul6a qui ne repose souvent que sur une seule porte en bois).
4.            Beneficiaire du Projet
Le beneficiaire du projet est la Municipalite de Nouakchott. La realisation des
travaux prdvus permettra d'eviter des arrets de cours pour des centaina d'61ves et mettra fin au
danger que constitue le risque d'ecoulement de certaines classs.

couvertes en tOles ondul6es cottent actuellement 405.000 UM, et celles en beton pres d'un million
UM. Avec un investissement moyen de 161.000 UM/salle ou 6viterait d'avoir I d6penser dans cinq
ans 702.000 UM, soit 8. 424.000 UM. La valeur nette actualisde (avec un taux de 12%) ressort a
3.040.000 UM et le taux de rentabilit6 interne est de 44%. En outre, l'ex6cution de ces travaux

Construction de puits perdus
Commune de Nouakchott
1.           Description Techni=
Chaque annee, lors de la saison pluviale (uillet-AoOt), des pluies s'abattent sur la
ville, laissant des mares importantes sur plusieurs voies publiques. Vu l'absence d'un reseau
d'ecoulement, cette eau stagne et reste plusiurs jours bloquant la circulation et provoquant des
problemes d'hygibne - la mise en place d'un reseau d'6coulement etant tres coOteuse, la ville se
propose de palier i ce probleme par la mise en place de puits perdus. les travaux I realiser consiste
I operer des ouvertures au niveau de la chaussee, de les fermer par des grilles at de les rolier par des
tuyaux en PVC I des puits perdus qu'il faut construire. Ce travail sera fait au niveau de 16 points.
Au niveau de chaque point, deux ouverturos seront faitos et deux puits perdus de 3m x 4m sur 2m
de profondeur seront construits.
2.            Elements du coftt
Le coat est estime a 5 millions UM dont 2,5 millions UM sera absorbes par la main
d'oeuvre.
3.            Situation sans Projet
Des eaux diluviennes s'accumulent apres chaque pluie - la villo est oblig6e
d'intervenir par l'intermediaire des camions vidangeurs. Ces operations cottent chaque annee I la
ville 500.000 UM en moyenne et cela en plus du blocage de la circulation sur certains axes pendant
pluieurs heures, voire pluieurs jours. En outre, la stagnation des eaux sur la chaussee expose
celle-ci I une degradation acc6lErEe.

Le beneficiaire est la Municipalite de Nouakchott. La realisation de ce projet evitera
la formation de mares lors des pluies et par la suite il n'y aura plus de blocage de la circulation ni
de problbmes d'hygiene provoques par ces mares - en plus la Mairie epargnera lea depenses que la
situation actuelle occasionne.
5.            Calcul d'Indicateurs
a)     main d'oeuvre: Ce poste absorbera 2,5 millions UM soit 50% du coat total. Le projet
occasionnera 5.504 journ6es de travail.
b)     delai d'etude et de demarrage. L'etude d'execution serait prete dans un mois. Le
demarrage pourra intervenir dans 45 jours.
6.            Opportunite dconomi=
La commune depense annuellement plus de 500.000 UM pour I'evacuation des eaux
pluviales sans pour autant eviter les probl mes que provoquent celles-ci (blocage de la circulation,
degradation des chaussEes, problbmes d'hygiene). Le surcoat impose par lea inondation de la
chauss6e est estime a 588.000 UM par an. En outre, la rehabilitation, tous lea 4 and, des sections
de chausses affectees est estimee a 768.000 UM. La valeur nette actualisee du sous-projet (au taux
de 12%) est de 4.464.000 UM et le taux de rentabilitd interne est de 17%.
Fixation de dunes
Route Nouakchott-Tiguent
Ministere de I'Equipemnent
et des Transports
1.           Description Technique
La route Nouakchott-Tiguent est de plus en plus frequemment envahie par le sable.
En 1992, la situation est la suivante: sur 5240 metra, la route est envabie par des dunes faibles
apportant environ 1 metre cube de sable au metre lineaire, et sur 1300 metres, la route est envahie
par des dunes fortes apportant environ 5 metrea cubes de sable au metre lindaire. Cette situation
s'aggrave d'annee en annee depuis 1986. L'aggravation, ou l'augmentation de la quantite de sable
apportee sur la route est estimee a 15% par an.
Le projet vise a:
(a)    enlever le sable se trouvant sur la chaussee,
(b)    degager les grosses dunes se trouvant au voisinage immediat de la chauss6es, sur une
profondeur de 20 metrs,
(c)    fixer les dunes par clayonnage. Le systeme de clayonnage comporte un systbme de
derivation de la dune et un systbme d'accumulation du sable. Pendant l'ete, la route
est protegee des vents dominants (Nord-Ouest) par lea claies; pendant l'hiver, lea



156 Construction Capacity and Employment ProjecL Staff Appraisl Report (draft yellow cover). Annex 13
vents dominants (Nord-Est) peuvent passer at enlevent le sable de la route et le
deposent plus loin.
Les ouvrages projetes se stopperont pas completement le depot de sable sur la route
mais le diminueront considerablement.
2.           Elements du coL t
Le coOt est estime a 6,5 millions UM, la premiere annde. En outre, l'entretien de
l'ouvrage de fixation coOtera 600.000 UM par an. L'enlevement du sable de la chaussde est estimd
a 400.000 Um en 1994, avec une augmentation de 15% par an par la suite.
3.           Situation sans Projet
L'avancement des dunes est estime a 15 metrs par an. Le coat de L'enlevement du
sable coOterait 2,9 millions d'UM en 1993, et augmenterait de 15% par an par la suite. En outre,
le coQt des usagers de la route augmenterait regulierement, par suite du nombre croissant des
interruptions de trafic en attendant que la route soit degagee.
4.           Beneficiaire du proiet
Le beneficiaire du projet est le Ministere de l'Equipement et des Transports, qui a
la charge de maintenir la route ouverte au trafic.
5.           Calcul d'Indicateurs
a)    main d'oeuvre: Ce poste absorbera 2,4 millions UM, soit 34% du coQt total; ceci
represente 50 hommes/mois.
b)    ddlai d'etude et de demarrage. L'etude d'execution serait pr#te dans un delai de
mois. Le demarrage pourra intervenir dans un mois.
6.           Opportunite economiQue
Le projet apporte une importante diminution du coQt du ddsensablement de la route,
et aussi une reduction du coat des usagers de cette route. Sur la p6riode 1992-1997, la valeur nette
actualisee (au taux de 12% par an) du projet est de 1,8 millions UM et la rentabilit6 interne est de
24%.
