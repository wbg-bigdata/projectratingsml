I.       Introduction and Acknowledgements
1.      A World Bank mission carried out an implementation support mission for the Second
Transmission and Distribution Project (TD2, original credit Cr. 4107-VN and the additional
financing Ln. 8026-VN) in Vietnam from June 3 to 11, 2013 and June 18, 2013. The mission
objectives for the project include: (i) review overall project implementation including
safeguards, financial management, procurement and disbursement; (ii) assess progress on the
actions agreed during the last supervision mission; and (iii) collect project indicators for results
monitoring and evaluation.
 2.     The mission visited and discussed project implementation progress with the Southern
Power Project Management Board (SPMB) and the Ho Chi Minh City Power Corporation
(HCMCPC) in Ho Chi Minh City; the Central Power Projects Management Board (CPMB) and
the Central Power Corporation (CPC) in Da Nang; the National Power Transmission Corporation
(NPT), and the National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) in Hanoi. Field visits were made to the
site of the 220kV Hiep Binh Phuoc substation in Ho Chi Minh City. The mission conducted a
wrap-up meeting on June 11, 2013, in EVN’s office in Hanoi chaired by Mr. Dinh Quang Tri,
Vice President of EVN. .
 3.     The mission wishes to thank the management and staff of EVN, NPT, CPC, HCMCPC,
the SPMB, the CPMB and the NLDC for their courtesies and hospitalities and for the assistance
extended to it in carrying out its tasks. The main findings and the key actions for follow up are
detailed in this Aide Memoire. A list of people met and the Bank Task Team composition are
attached in Annex 1.

II.    Project Development Objective (PDO)
 4.     The objective of TD2 Project is (i) Investment support to overcome bottlenecks in 500kV
 and 220kV transmission system and upgrades to selected 110kV distribution system; (ii)
 Replacement of the national and regional SCADA/EMS system; and (iii) Assistance in the
 reform and restructuring of EVN and its affiliates to manages and operate the transmission
 system efficiently in an unbundled and increasingly market-oriented power industry.
III.   Implementation Status and Key Issues
 5.     Progress towards achievement of PDO: Overall progress towards achievement of
 PDO is assessed as moderately satisfactory. Most of outcome indicators and result indicators
 by each component have been achieved or are likely to be achieved by the end of the Project.
 One key indicator related to the establishment of a new supervision control and data acquisition
 system and energy management system SCADA/EMS, is likely not to be achieved by the project
 closing date; however EVN/NLDC have confirmed that the system will be completed by
 December 2014. The latest status of results monitoring indicators is attached in Annex 2.
 6.     Overall Implementation Progress: Overall progress of project implementation is
 moderately satisfactory. Subprojects of component 1 for transmission and distribution
 expansion and reinforcement have made significant progress since the last supervision mission in
 October 2012. 9 out of 16 subprojects under original financing (Cr.4107) and 3 out of 8
 subprojects under additional financing (Ln. 8026) have been fully completed and have been put
 into operation. The remaining subprojects are also progressing well and expected to complete by
 the project closing date of June 30, 2014. The commitment value has significantly improved
 from 60% to 93%. However, the mission has been informed that the SCADA/EMS subproject
 under component 2 most probably will not be completed by the project closing date because of
 delays in the bidding process: the SCADA/EMS system contract was concluded with the
 contractor only in December 2012 and as per contract’s schedule the contract would only be
 completed by December 2014 which is 6 months after the project closing date. According to the
 schedule, by the project closing date of June 30, 2013, only 75% of contract’s work could be
 completed and consequently only 75% of contract amount would be disbursed under the
 project’s fund. EVN/NLDC has confirmed payment of the remaining about $5 million of the
 contract amount out of its own funds. Another component that is lagging behind schedule is the
 technical assistance for building NPT’s capacity to enhance its financial performance for which
 an allocation of US$500,000 was made under the Additional Financing Loan. NPT will start
 implementing the activities with a view to completing them by June 30, 2014. The detailed
 implementation progress is described in Annex 3 and 4.
 7.     Disbursement Progress: Overall progress of disbursement is highly satisfactory. The
 disbursement value for FY2013 up to the time of the supervision is recorded at $83.6 million,
 which is equal to a disbursement ratio of 42% for FY2013. Of the original IDA Credit 88% has
 been disbursed after 85 months of implementation since effectiveness (corresponding to 88 % of
 the project duration) and all remaining contracts are signed so the disbursement is expected to
 reach 100% by project closure. For the IBRD AF the disbursement stands at 42% but contracts
 are signed and work ongoing corresponding to an accumulated value of 93% of the loan. Only
 two contracts remain unsigned, but bid evaluation has been completed and contract signing is
 expected by the end of July 2013. The detailed disbursement status is listed in Annex 5.

IV.     Next Steps
8.      SCADA/EMS subproject: NPT/NLDC and the mission have agreed to monitor the
progress of the SCADA/EMS subproject very carefully so that the best possible outcome is
achieved by the end of the Project. NLDC has agreed to (i) work with the contractor to
accelerate the implementation as much as possible and (ii) make sure that advance payment and
other disbursement of funds to the contractor are made in a timely manner in accordance with the
progress of services.
9.      Reallocation of the Project Funds: NPT, HCMPC and NLDC informed that the
allocation of funds under Cr.4107 does not match the contract values committed. (Details are
presented in Table 2). EVN is therefore suggesting a restructuring of the project in order to
re-allocate funds by categories so as to best use the remaining funds available. The mission
supports this proposal and advises that the process of re-allocation shall be started as soon as
possible. The mission has informed EVN that an official request for such
restructuring/reallocation needs to be received from SBV.

10.     Monitoring Implementation Progress: NPT has been requested to monitor the
progress of each subproject to make sure that all the subprojects are completed by June 30,
2014. This mission has confirmed that the transmission and distribution expansion and
reinforcement subprojects are showing good progress toward the completion by the closing of the
Project, but notes that some remaining safeguard issues need to be resolved in a timely manner.

Implementing Agencies including CPMB and SPMB are requested to provide detailed
information concerning all remaining environmental and social safeguards issues.
11.      Subproject Completion Reports (SCR): Each implementing agency is required to
submit SCR for completed subprojects to the Bank in a timely manner. The mission has
agreed to provide a standard report template to HCMC PC who plans to submit SCR reports for
the first time.

V.      Financial Management
The financial management arrangements of the Project remain adequate. However, there are
some areas with room for improvements that the Project Management should consider, as
follows:
12.     Inadequate management of project’s inventories:
The audit closing minute of Deloitte at SPMB commented that SPMB has conductors and earth
wires valued at VND 41.2 billion being consigned at the warehouse of the contractor - Tan
Cuong Thanh Ltd Co. However, the inventories have been collateralized to the commercial bank
by Tan Cuong Thanh as at the time of the mission and therefore not available for project
construction. SPMB is requested to report to the Bank in writing on the status of resolving this
matter with Tan Cuong Thanh Co. and how it affects the progress of the Phu My – Song May
transmission line by 31 July 2013. In case these materials and equipment are lost by the
contractor, they will not be eligible for financing from the World Bank.
All project implementing agencies are strongly requested to closely monitor the inventory
management practices on an on-going basis to avoid similar instances in the future.
13.       2012 Audited financial statements
NPT components:
a) Issue: The 2012 Auditor's report on Compliance and Internal Control Matters raised a
   number of critical issues, including the non-compliance with the requirements of Debt to
   Equity Ratio set forth in the Project Agreement No.8026-VN.




                                                                                       Page 4 of 29
                                                                                  Aide Memoire – June 2013

      Recommendation: The mission has requested that Project Management address these issues
      raised by the auditor and report to the Bank on the status of implementation before
      September 30, 2013.1
EVN components:
b) Issue: The 2011 audited financial statements and management letter (“the reports?) of the
   Second Transmission and Distribution Project were submitted to the Bank on July 6, 2012
   which is later than 6 months after the financial year end as required by the financial
   covenants.
      Recommendation: The mission strongly recommends that the Project Management works
      closely with the auditors during 2013 audit to ensure the Project’s financial statements for
      2012 will be submitted on time and ith acceptable quality.
c) Issue: The 2012 Auditor's report on Compliance and Internal Control matters raised a
   number of critical matters, including the non-compliance with the financial covenants
   regarding the financial capacity of the Project executing entities
      Recommendation: The mission has requested that Project Management address these issues
      raised by the auditor and report to the Bank the status of implementation before September
      30, 20132.
      The mission would like to remind NPT and EVN about the requirements to forward the Term
      of Reference of financial audit to the Bank for review and approval before signing the
      financial audit contract for future years/periods. Failure to do this may result in the Project
      audited financial statements being unacceptable to the Bank.


VI.      Procurement
14.     The procurement performance is satisfactory: During the period under prior review,
about 10 sets of bidding documents and 10 bid evaluation reports (BERs) have been reviewed,
with costs per package in the range of $300,000 to $25 million. Documentation and decisions
have generally been of high quality, although often some minor changes have been required to
BERs. There have been improvements in the recording of advertising of Invitations to Bid;
notifications of bid opening; and publication of bid awards. During the period, one complaint
regarding bidding for the SCADA/EMS subproject was recorded. The complaint was found to
have no substance and the case has been resolved.

1
  On 28 September 2012, NPT wrote to the Bank explained the reasons of the non-compliance. NPT also indicated
that the Corporation will be able to comply with the Covenants by 2015. These breaches of the financial covenants
cannot be resolved at the project or company level and will need to be assessed more strategically and holistically -
addressing the overall financial challenges of sector, EVN and its subsidiaries. Hence, EVN and the World Bank
have agreed to conduct a study on developing "Strategic Options for Financial Recovery of the Vietnamese Power
Sector" that will result in a detailed financial strategy and action and recovery plan for EVN and its subsidiaries.
EVN has formed a Working Group with other relevant Government agencies to supervise the implementation of the
Bank-executed study. With respect to the internal control matters, the Corporation is committed to resolve them
successfully.
2
  In October 2012, EVN wrote to the Bank explained the reasons for the non-compliance. EVN also indicated that
the Corporation will be able to comply with the Covenants by 2015. This is a situation similar to that of NPT and the
mission is taking the same approach to deal with this matter. Please refer to previous footnote.

VII.   Safeguards
Environmental safeguards
15.     Overall, the project is in compliance with the environmental safeguards policies, and its
environmental performance can be rated as satisfactory. The mission reviewed some bidding and
contractual documents of the project and found that environmental management requirements
were incorporated. The mission also reviewed the independent environmental monitoring reports
submitted on March 2013 by the Independent Monitoring Consultant and found them
satisfactory. The project environmental safeguard documents have been disclosed as required by
the Bank policy on access to information. The environmental management systems of the PMBs
are functioning, and monitoring reports submitted by the construction supervision consultant and
independent environmental monitoring consultant indicate that contractors complied with the
EMP. As an example, CPMB maintains a very good safeguard monitoring system with rigorous
monitoring by the construction supervision consultant and the independent monitoring
consultant.
16.     The mission visited 220kV Hiep Binh Phuoc substation and 220kV/110kV Hoc Mon –
Hiep Binh Phuoc transmission line in Ho Chi Minh City. Construction of the substation was
completed while the work on the transmission line is ongoing. The mission was pleased to see
that the site restoration was well done and that fire preventive measures are in place at the
substation. However, worker safety, workers camp conditions, and overall construction
management need to be improved at the transmission line construction site. The workers at the
tower foundation neither wore safety helmets nor protection boots and the workers camp is not
up to the standard. In addition, construction waste was not well managed and left scattered
around the site.
17.    The SPMB reported that there may be some changes in the alignment of the 220kV Tan
Dinh – Uyen Hung Transmission lines. If the changes would cause moderate impacts on the
environment, the EMP of this subproject needs to be updated accordingly. The mission was
informed that the technical design for the monastery relocated due to the 500kV Phu My – Song
May transmission line was completed taking into account all requirements of the monastery
owner. The owner will be compensated to an extent that will enable her to construct a new
monastery by herself. This mission advises that SPMB consider offering compensation to allow
observation of local religious tradition associated with the dismantlement and relocation of the
monastery to a new place and that a detailed relocation plan acceptable to the Bank is prepared.
Social safeguards
18.  The mission had meetings with all implementing agencies (CPC, CPMB, HCMPC,
SPMB) to review the implementation and compliance with social safeguard policies.
19.     CPC: The mission was informed that there has been no major difficulty in performing
land acquisition and compensation for Quang Ngang 110kV substation and branch lines. The
substation is located within the Quang Ngang industrial zone where land was previously
acquired. CPC is now working with the steering committee of Quang Ngang industrial zone to
reimburse the compensation budget that the latter paid to 6 affected households. The estimated
budget is around 300 million VND. ToR for an independent monitoring consultant has been
cleared on May 10, 2013. It is expected that this consultant will be mobilized by July 2013.


                                                                                     Page 6 of 29
                                                                                    Aide Memoire – June 2013

20.     CPMB: The mission acknowledged the great effort made by CPMB in performing the
land acquisition for the Quang Ninh – Hiep Hoa 500kV T/L subproject. Of the total 316 tower
positions, only 7 positions (in Chi Linh, Hai Duong) are not yet ready for civil works. CPMB
committed that by July 2013 all payments will be made to affected households (especially for
RoW3 compensation) in order to meet the commissioning date of the project previewed in
September 2013. The mission re-emphasized that per Bank requirement and given the
complicated nature of 500kV subproject, resettlement arrangement must be properly addressed
before physical relocation. CPMB is requested to prepare a synthesis table capturing relocated
households, type of resettlement, and potential resettlement arrangement. CPMB will send this
table to the Bank by July 2013. Under this subproject, a second monitoring report of RP
implementation was prepared in March 2013.
21.    HCMPC: Regarding the Hoc Mon – Hiep Binh Phuoc 220/110 kV T/L, the mission is
pleased to note that affected households accepted the new compensation rates. Subsequently, all
tower positions in District 12 (6 positions) and in Thu Duc district (9 positions) were handover to
contractors. However, Van Phuc Company and HCMPC have not yet reached an agreement on
compensation for impacts in the RoW (Van Phuc Company expects to have full compensation
for impacts in RoW whereas HCMPC proposes compensation only for impacts due to the
upgrading from 110kV to 220kV). HCMPC and Van Phuc Company are currently working with
Thu Duc District People’s Committee to reach a final decision on this issue.
22.     SPMB: Land acquisition, resettlement and compensation activities are still ongoing in six
500 kV and two 220kV subprojects. Two outstanding issues require particular attention. Firstly,
related to the relocation of Ngoc Trung monastery, the mission is pleased to note that land for the
new monastery is identified. The design is developed based on the agreement with the owner
who will build the new monastery by herself with compensation budget provided by SPMB. The
mission emphasized that (i) the old monastery should be demolished only when the new one is
ready for usage; (ii) the compensation package will include expenses for rituals associated with
the relocation and (iii) SPMB should prepare a detailed report and submit to the Bank Team by
July 2013. Secondly, the mission was informed that the alignment of Tan Dinh – Uyen Hung
220kV T/L will be changed to avoid the new urban area of Thu Dau Mot city (Binh Duong
province). The change will impact 4.9 km T/L and 17 tower position. SPMB is requested to
update the Resettlement Plan for this subproject incorporating the newly identified impacts due
to the change of alignment.


VIII.     Financial Performance
  The mission reviewed NPT’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2012 based on
draft financial statements.      FY2012 key financial indicators are positive and show NPT
recording a profit for the first time since 2009, its first full year of operation and achieving all
three targets covenanted under the Second Transmission and Distribution Project, i.e. the
self-financing, debt service coverage and debt equity ratios. The table below shows the targets
under the project and the actual indicators achieved during 2012. The key factors behind NPT’s
financial results during 2012 are as follows:

  Right of Way: this refers to the corridor in which the transmission line runs and where land use is restricted for
security reasons.

      a) Operating Revenues: A revenue increase of 25% driven by an increase in energy transfers
         of about 15% and a lower increase in operating costs; there was no increase in transmission
         charges for NPT in 2012. The mission understood that the increase in energy transfers
         arose from the introduction of metering of embedded generation (less than 30MW) at
         transfer points from distribution voltage (110kV) to high voltage lines (220kV).
         Previously only small generation units directly connected to the NPT high voltage
         transmission system were metered at the transfer points.
      b) Assets Revaluation: A major asset revaluation (VND 15 trillion) was finally incorporated
         onto NPT’s balance sheet which together with the operating results jerked up net equity by
         a factor of about 5.5 times (from VND 3.6 trillion to VND 20.1 trillion).
      c) Finance costs: These were slightly higher than in 2011 despite a substantial increase in
         debt; this was due to the impact on foreign currency debt of the stabilization of the VND
      d) Exchange rate changes: NPT had a net gain due to effects of foreign exchange rate changes
         on its debt compared to a huge loss of about VND 1,791 billion in 2011. This affected both
         its cash flows (realized exchange rate movements) and its debt and equity position.

23.     Since the analysis is based on unaudited financial statements the Bank will review the
results based on audited financial statements which are expected to be received prior to the end
of June 2013,

24.     NPT’s financial projections for 2013-2015 indicate that NPT is unlikely to meet the
self-financing and debt service coverage ratios in 2014. While the projections indicate marginal
shortfalls (SFR of 24% against the targeted 25% and DSCR of 1.47 against the target of 1.5) the
real gap will likely be larger. The main reason is that the revenue estimates are likely overstated
given that they assume an average transmission charge yield of VND 91.47/kWh for 2013
whereas the current charge is VND 83.32. To achieve the projected yield would require an
increase of about 19.5% effective from July 1, 2013. If there is a delay in approving the current
proposal which NPT submitted to EVN the increase required to produce this revenue yield would
be even larger.

25.       The model has other assumptions that could be optimistic (those related to modest


                                                                                        Page 8 of 29

foreign exchange losses and high energy transfers of about 10% in 2013, 12% in 2014 and 13%
in 2015. It is notable, however, that although the indicators after 2013 appear to be healthy
based on these assumptions the debt equity ratio will be creeping upwards after the revaluation
boost to reach 72/28 by 2015 and the year-end cash balances will remain very low suggesting
possible liquidity constraints in the coming years.

26.      Finally, the positive 2012 results do not necessary mean that NPT has achieved a
financial turnaround. The risks are clear and emphasize the need to proceed with the TA
provided under the project to help improve the management of financial performance. A key
ingredient of the TA is the emphasis on improving the quality of the investment program and
how it is financed, including optimizing revenues through engagement in the regulatory process.
The ongoing EVN-wide financial study is also expected to contribute to NPT strategies for its
financial turnaround.

                        Annex 3 – Implementation Progress by Component

I.    ORIGINAL PROJECT (Cr. 4107)

1.      Brief Description of Component Activities; The original project (Cr. 4107) consists of the following
three components: (i) Transmission and Distribution System Expansion and Reinforcement which
comprises subprojects for 500kV and 220 kV transmission lines and related substations and for selected
110kV distribution systems (US$176.6 million), (ii) Electricity Market and System Operations
Modernization which supports the replacement of national and regional dispatch and control systems
(US$21.8 million); and (iii) Market Transition Support which provides technical assistance for reform and
restructuring of EVN and its subsidiaries as part of the transition support towards an electricity generation
market (US$1.65 million).
2.     Overall progress of project implementation is assessed as moderately satisfactory due to delay of
the implementation of Component 2 – SCADA/EMS subproject.
3.     The implementation of Component 1 is satisfactory. All the 82 contracts for subprojects under
Component 1 (Transmission and Distribution Expansion and Reinforcement) have been signed,
representing a total commitment of US$197 million or 110% of the allocated IDA funding for this
component. A re-allocation of funds is needed to avoid overdraft of the allocated categories (see Annex 5
for more detail).
4.     Component 2 (Electricity Market and System Operations Modernization) with an estimated cost of
US$12.9 million has been delayed due an extended bid evaluation and contract award process. The contract
was signed in December 2012 with a schedule of completion in 24 months, which is 6 months after the
Credit’s closing date of June 30, 2014.
5.     Component 3, Market Transition Support, comprised technical assistance for transmission system
planning for an amount of about US$0.74 million. However, the contract expired and was not extended.
Since the Vietnam Power Master Plan No. 7 (PDP7) has been approved by Government recently, this
proposed study is no longer required.
6.   The disbursement during FY 2013 was about $16.5 million, and the total disbursement rate reached
88%.

Implementation by SPMB
8.      SPMB is implementing 9 out of the 15 subprojects under this component. 5 subprojects have been
completed and the mission has requested SPMB to prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
for these subprojects. The 4 subprojects are as follows:
   •   500kV Tan Dinh S/S: The subproject comprises the addition of a second 500/220kV 450 MVA
       transformer, plus upgrading of the communication system, and connection to the Song May-Tan
       Dinh 500kV T/L. The substation installation has been completed and was energized in August 2010.
   •   500 kV Nha Be-O Mon T/L & O Mon 500kV S/S: This is the largest subproject comprising nine
       contracts all of which have been signed for a total cost of US$31 million in IDA financing. The
       500kV O Mon SS was energized in April 2010. The T/L has two sections: O Mon – Cai Lay and
       Cai Lay – Nha Be. The section O Mon - Cai Lay has been in operation since 2009 at 220kV and the
       section Cai Lay – Nha Be had been delayed for a while. The entire section O Mon-Nha Be has been
       put into operation at the 500kV voltage level in May 2011. This subproject is using financing from
       TD2 only for goods contracts (not works) and 100% of committed funds have already been
       disbursed. There was one contract (Package No.6) which has been withdrawn from financing by
       IDA for financing by NPT SPMB. The mission reminded SPMB to refund to WB the 10% of the
       advance payment which has been paid for this contract.
  •    220kV Thuan An SS & Xuan Loc SS: Both subprojects comprise building new 220kV substations
       which consists of 220-250MVA and 110V-63 MVA power transformers; outgoing 220kV and


                                                                                                   Page 15 of 29
                                                                                 Aide Memoire – June 2013

           110kV feeders and associated controls, protection and SCADA systems. Construction works have
           been completed for both substations. Thuan An SS was energized in December 2011 and Xuan Loc
           SS in June 2012.
9.      The remaining 5 subprojects under SPMB are expected to be completed by Q4/2013. In order to
ensure the completion of those by the end of the project, the mission has requested SPMB to provide
detailed information concerning the remaining issues on environmental and social safeguards. The
status of the individual subprojects is as follows:
      •    500kV Phu Lam- O Mon T/L: The subproject finances a single circuit in the Long An to Phu Lam
           section of the O Mon - Phu Lam 500 kV T/L. All eight contract packages have been signed. The
           site clearance was delayed for tower foundations no. 6 and 7 which are crossing the Sai Gon – My
           Tho Railway. During the previous mission in November 2011, SPMB had expected to complete the
           subproject by November 2012, but there has been a long discussion about the railway crossing issue
           with the Ministry of Transport (MOT) since then. The issue has been solved and the completion
           date is now revised to the third quarter of 2013.
      •    500 kV Phu My-Song May and 500KV Song May-Tan Dinh T/L and 500kV Song May SS: These
           subprojects consist of a 64 km T/L from Phu My to Song May with extension of 500kV bays at Phu
           My SS and Song May SS (450MVA) and a 36 km T/L from Song May to Tan Dinh SS. These
           subprojects aim to supply power to the northern areas of the Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area.
           These subprojects were much delayed due to difficulties in the site clearance in the area of Dong
           Nai and Ba Ria – Vung Tau provinces; however after the joint Bank and NPT/SPMB special
           mission in April 2012 to the provinces authorities, the site clearance has progressed significantly.
      •    Transmission line subprojects: Compensation, site clearance, civil work and tower installation have
           been completed for 118 out of 138 foundations in Dong Nai province and 8 out of 21 foundations in
           Ba Ria – Vung Tau province. SPMB expected to complete works contracts by June 2013 for the line
           subprojects and September 2013 for the Song May substation.
      •    500KV Phu My-Song May-Tan Dinh T/L second circuit: (This subproject was added to TD2 at a
           late stage.) The 5 contract packages have been signed. The installation of this second circuit is now
           being implemented in parallel with the first circuit and is expected to be completed by the third
           quarter of 2013.
10.     Fund allocation and disbursement: the total credit funding allocated to NPT/SPMB is about $142
million while the total value of the contracts for 9 subprojects is about $148.5 million. Taking into account
that most of those contracts were signed with price adjustment clauses, the value of the contracts is now
estimated about $152 million. NPT will discuss with EVN possible solutions to the $10 million shortage of
funds including (i) restructuring of the FA for reallocation of funds between the three components; and (ii)
if after reallocation there is still shortage of fund, NPT will use its own funds for that payment. SPMB
reported that the disbursement for all 9 subprojects is about $138 million, i.e. about 93% of the funds
presently allocated.


Implementation by HCMC PC
11.         The status of implementation of the HCMC PC projects is as follows:
          • Binh Tan 220 kV GIS substation: The subproject is located in Binh Hung Hoa B Ward of Binh Tan
            District (Ho Chi Minh City) and consists of 2x250 MVA transformers at 220/110kV and 2x63


                                                                                                    Page 16 of 29
                                                                            Aide Memoire – June 2013

        MVA transformers at 110/22kV. The substation has been completed and was energized in June
        2012.
      • Hiep Binh Phuoc 220 kV GIS substation: This subproject is located in Hiep Binh Phuoc ward of
        Thu Duc district (Ho Chi Minh City) and it is technically similar to the Binh Tan S/S.
        Compensation and site clearance are completed. All four contract packages have been signed and
        the civil works started in May 2010. The substation was energized in May 2013.
      • Hoc Mon – Hiep Binh Phuoc 220kV TL: this subproject consists of 550 km of 220kV and 110 kV
        outgoing feeders from the 220kV Hiep Binh Phuoc substation. All three contract packages have
        been signed and the civil works started in May 2012. Construction works are progressing well and
        the lines are expected to be energized in November 2013. Cut-off of electricity is planned in July
        2013 in order to accelerate the whole construction of the project. Impact on local residents will be
        mitigated by providing rerouting of distribution.
12.     HCMC PC requested the Bank for additional capital to cover the shortfall on signed contract of
approximately 1.5 million USD. The total contract value of 4,379,054 USD exceeds the amount available
of 2,895,301USD. The mission requested HCMC PC to check carefully the remaining balance of capital
for disbursement and consult with NPT as to possible reallocation of funds.
13.    The mission has requested HCMC PC to submit SCR reports to the Bank. This is the first
experience for HCMC PC to prepare for the SCR, therefore the mission has agreed to provide a template.


Implementation by CPC
14.     The status of implementation of CPC’s three subprojects is as follows:
      • Bac Dong Hoi and Hoa Thuan 110 kV substations: Installation of these two substations was
        completed. The Hoa Thuan substation was energized in April 2010 and the Bac Dong Hoi
        substation was completed and energized in September 2010. The Subproject Completion Report
        (SCR) has been prepared and submitted to the Bank.
      • My Thanh 110kV substation: The upgrading of this substation included installation of new power
        transformer and primary equipment. Part of the equipment procured for Nam Chu Lai has been used
        for upgrading the My Thanh substation subproject. The cost of the remaining equipment and
        installation works has been covered from CPC’s own funds. The substation has been energized on
        November 2011.
      • Nam Chu Lai 110kV substation and upgrading of 110kV My Thanh substation: The Nam Chu
        Lai 110kV substation subproject was proposed for financing under TD2 Project. All 3 goods
        contracts have been signed and goods have been delivered. Two works contract have been signed.
        Payment has been made for 100% of the goods and advance payment (10%) has been made for
        works contracts. However, due to the restructuring of Vinashin Corporation, the need for power in
        this area is no longer urgent; therefore EVN/CPC has sent an official request to the WB proposing
        to use the procured equipment for Nam Chu Lai for upgrading the My Thanh 110kV substation and
        Quang Ngang 110kV substation. The transfer of equipment has been agreed by the Bank; however
        CPC should determine the balance of funds paid for the Nam Chu Lai subproject for immediate
        return to the Bank including the money paid for the two works contracts.




                                                                                               Page 17 of 29
                                                                          Aide Memoire – June 2013

    • My Thanh 110kV substation: The upgrading of this substation included installation of new power
      transformer and primary equipment. Part of the equipment procured for Nam Chu Lai has been used
      for upgrading the My Thanh substation subproject. The cost of the remaining equipment and
      installation works has been covered from CPC’s own funds. The substation has been energized on
      November 2011.
    • Quang Ngang 110kV substation: The subproject comprises of two 110kV 25 MVA transformers,
      plus completed electrical and communication system. The mission agreed to CPC’s proposal to use
      the remaining equipment procured for Nam Chu Lai and not used for upgrading the My Thanh
      110kV substation for this substation. The subproject has been appraised by the Bank in August
      2012. CPC will start the procurement process from November 2012 and started construction in May
      2013. The subproject is expected to be energized by the end of 2013.


Component 2: Electricity Market and System Modernization
15.     This component comprises design, procurement and installation/commissioning of the new
SCADA/EMS system for a National Load Dispatching Center (A0) in Hanoi and three regional Load
Dispatching Centers in the North, Central and South of Vietnam (A1, A2 and A3). Due to the difficulties
encountered in the consultant selection, bid preparation and approval, the project is delayed. The bid was
processed in 2 stages. The first stage has been completed in January 2012. During the previous mission in
November 2011, NLDC had expected to complete the 2nd stage bid in June 2012 and to sign the contract
early July 2012; however the bid evaluation of the 2nd stage was prolonged with many rounds of
clarifications. The final bid evaluation report (BER) was submitted to the Bank on September 24, 2012 and
the Bank has provided the no objection to the BER on September 28, 2012. The contract was finally signed
on December 19, 2012 in the amount of approximately $12.9 million. The services will be completed
within 24 months, i.e. by December 2014 or 6 months after the Credit’s closing date of June 30, 2014.
16.      By June 30, 2014, only 75% of the work (equivalent to $10 million) will be completed, indicating
that (i) NPT/NLDC will need to finance the remaining 25% of the service by utilizing other funds including
their own sources, and (ii) approximately $1.6 million for component 2 will remain undisbursed and it
should therefore be considered to reallocate this amount for other purposes.


Component 3: Market Transition Support
17.     This component includes technical assistance on transmission system planning (calculating of the
Vietnam power transmission system) in the period between 2008 and 2015 with perspectives to 2025. SNC
Lavalin (Canada) was selected to carry out the service. The consultant started work in August 2009,
submitted the Inception Report by the end of September 2009 and first Interim Report in March 2010. The
second interim report was expected to be submitted in September, 2010 and final report in January 2011,
but both are still outstanding because of a disagreement between EVN and NPT on the consultant’s
performance against the Terms of Reference. As a result the contract expired November 2010. In July
2011, NPT had proposed retroactively to extend the contract for another 16 months, which the Bank would
not agree to. Therefore, NPT needs to finalize all the pending payments in accordance with the contract
conditions. The mission asked NPT to expedite this matter and to send the output to the Bank. EVN/NPT
also informed the WB that in connection with the new Vietnam Power Master Plan No.7, which was
recently approved by Government, the output of this study is no longer needed by NPT.

II.         ADDITIONAL FINANCING PROJECT (Ln. 8026)
18.    The Additional Financing Loan for TD2 was approved by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors
on March 29, 2011 for an amount of US$180 million. The agreements were signed by all the relevant
Vietnamese parties and the Bank on May 31, 2011, and the Loan was declared effective by the Bank on
August 29, 2011. The purpose of the additional financing is to scale up the impact of transmission system
expansion and reinforcement (Component 1 of the original project).
19.     The mission has reviewed the implementation progress of the subprojects proposed under the AF
Project. A list of the 8 subprojects under this component is provided in Table A3-2. Of these, three
subprojects have been completed. 39 of 40 packages have been signed, and the remaining one package will
be signed right immediately after the mission. Until now, US$87 million (48% of the total AF fund) have
been disbursed.

 Implementation by CPMB
20.   The status of the three subprojects (one from the base list and two from the reserve list) being
implemented by the CPMB is as follows:
      •     500 kV Quang Ninh – Hiep Hoa TL: This subproject consists of supply of equipment and
            construction of a 139 km 500kV transmission line from 500kV Quang Ninh to Hiep Hoa and
            extension of a 500kV bay at Quang Ninh SS. All the 6 contracts have been signed. During the
            mission CPMB informed the Bank that package No. 7 for secondary equipment of the extension of
            the 500kV Quang Ninh substation, originally proposed for IBRD funding, should be financed from
            CPMB own funds due to change of the substation design. The Mission advised that, regardless of
            the source of funds, CPMB should ensure completion of that package within the committed
            schedule for the entire subproject. The construction work started in March 2012 and is expected to
            be completed within 18 months, i.e. by December 2013. The construction works of the extension of
            500kV Quang Ninh substation are expected to be completed by March 2014. The transmission line
            crosses three provinces: Quang Ninh, Bac Giang and Hai Duong. While the site clearance and
            compensation almost have been completed in Quang Ninh and Bac Giang provinces, the site


                                                                                                   Page 19 of 29
                                                                          Aide Memoire – June 2013

       clearance process in Hai Duong has been delayed because the provincial authorities have still to
       approve the compensation plan. The mission expressed that given that this subproject alone
       accounts for almost 50% of TD2 AF and given the difficulties with land acquisition,
       compensation, and site clearance in Vietnam, CPMB and NPT need to prepare a realistic
       implementation plan including resolving safeguard issues so that the project is energized by the
       end of June 2014 (The safeguard section of this AM provides more detailed issues). The Bank
       and CPMB/NPT has agreed to conduct a joint site visit during the next mission.


Implementation by SPMB
21.     SPMB is implementing 7 out of the 8 subprojects under this component. 3 subprojects have been
completed and the mission has requested SPMB to prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
for these subprojects. The 3 subprojects are as follows:
   •   220kV Tra Vinh substation and Vinh Long - Tra Vinh transmission line: The subproject comprises
       addition of a second 500/220kV 450 MVA transformer, plus upgrading of the communication
       system, and connection to the Song May-Tan Dinh 500kV T/L. The substation installation has been
       completed and it was energized in August 2010. All 4 contracts for 220kV Tra Vinh substation and
       6 contracts for the transmission line have been signed. During the previous mission in November
       2011, SPMB had expected to complete the subproject by November 2012, but due to delays in the
       bidding process for two packages (conductor and insulators). The project was completed in April
       2013.
   •   500kV O Mon substation (2nd transformer): The construction of the substation started in September
       2011 and was completed in April 2013.
22.     The remaining 4 subprojects under SPMB are expected to be completed by the project end. In order
to ensure the completion of those by the end of the project, the mission has requested SPMB to provide
detailed information concerning the remaining issue on environmental and social safeguards. The status
of the individual subprojects is as:
   •   220kV Uyen Hung substation and Tan Dinh – Uyen Hung transmission line: all the contracts for
       220kV Uyen Hung substation and transmission line have been signed. During the previous mission
       in November 2011, SPMB had expected to complete the subproject by June 2013, but due to delays
       in the bidding process for two packages (primary and secondary equipment for extension of Tan
       Dinh substation) the completion date is now revised to December 2013.
   •   500kV Song May substation (2nd transformer): This subproject is the second phase of the 500kV
       Song May substation, the first phase of which is financed by the Original TD2 Project. Due to the
       delay of the first phase of the substation, the construction of the second phase was also delayed.
       SPMB informed that the 1st stage of this substation shall be completed by June 2013, so the
       construction work of the 2nd stage can only start after June 2013. The mission requested SPMB to
       monitor the progress carefully to ensure completion before the June 2014.
   •   500kV Cau Bong substation: This subproject comprises of three single phase 500kV 200 MVA
       autotransformers, two three-phase 220kV 250 MVA autotransformers, five 500kV bays, thirteen
       220kV bays, eleven 110kV bays and associated control, protection and SCADA systems. The
       subproject is located at a 16ha site in Cu Chi district, HCMC. It aims to increase the stability,
       connectivity and reliability of power supply in HCMC and the Southern area, and (ii) receiving and


                                                                                            Page 20 of 29

       transmitting power to nearby load centers planned to be constructed in the near future; In the
       original Project Appraisal Document (PAD), this subproject is proposed in the reserve list; however
       upon request of NPT/SPMB this subproject has now been included in the official list of financing
       under the AF Project. However the cost estimate of this subproject is US$55 million, which is more
       than the remaining fund for the AF. NPT/SPMB confirmed that in the case of shortage of WB fund,
       NPT shall use its own funds for covering the shortfall. Contracts for 4 out of 5 packages of this
       project have been signed. The transformer component is still under final negotiation, but SPMMB
       expects to sign the contract very soon due to the importance of this substation in the HCMC area.
       The construction work is expected to start on November 2012 and is scheduled to be completed by
       June 2014.


23.     TA component under Additional Financing:
The project includes technical assistance to support NPT in building up its capacity for financial
performance management. The TA comprises support to improve its: (a) planning and financing of
transmission investments with a view to improving investment selection and financing strategies; (b)
management of liabilities to minimize the impact of currency depreciation and high interest rates; and
(c) determination of tariff adjustment requirements and management of the regulatory process in
order to enhance revenues from transmission fees.        An allocation of US$500,000 was provided
under the project to support implementation of these activities.

The mission reviewed the status of these activities with NPT and noted that none have been
implemented yet with about one remaining before the project closes on June 30, 2014. Agreement
was reached on a process and schedule for implementation of the activity on building capacity for
planning and financing transmission investments. With respect to the management of liabilities
NPT requested the mission to help with preparation of a brief scope of works from which NPT will
prepare full terms of reference. This will be provided to NPT by July 31, 2013.

On transmission tariffs and the associated regulatory process NPT informed the mission that after the
appraisal of TD2 AF, the Government had issued Circular #14 4which details the methodology for
determination of transmission tariffs and, therefore, this activity is no longer required. The mission
advised NPT to reconsider its views given that Circular 14 has not been consistently applied to date
and that the specified methodology may benefit from expert reviews to assess its conformity with the
financial objectives of NPT (for example the recovery of foreign exchange losses through tariffs, the
requirement if any for the shareholder to earn a rate of return on equity).

The mission assisted NPT to prepare a draft TOR for this activity. A consultant will be engaged to
review existing regulations and processes for investment planning, the methodologies for economic
and financial analysis, the existing financing strategies, including choice of currencies, and to
recommend measures for addressing identified issues and optimizing outcomes. The consultant will
document the agreed recommendations in a manual and provide training to NPT staff.

The selection of the consultant will follow the selection based on cost and qualifications (SBCQ).
