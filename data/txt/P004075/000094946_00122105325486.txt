HYUNDAI GROUP
A.   Introduction
1.        The Hyundai Group is made up of eight affiliated companies which
are loosely held together by the fact that controlling interest in each is
vested with the Chung family. The Group's origin can be traced back to the
Hyundai Construction Company which was founded in 1945 by Mr. Ju Yung Chung,
eldest of the four Chung brothers, all of whom are actively involved in
running the family's business. The Construction Company subsequently branched
into various other operations, directly or indirectly related to construction.
Several of these were later reorganized into independent operating companies,
while other companies were formed as the Group diversified its operations.
A description of each of the companies in the Group, all with headquarters
in Korea, is provided in the following paragraphs. Summary financial data
for Group companies and details on their ownership structure are provided
in Tables 1 and 2 at the end of this annex.
B.   Hyundai Construction Co., Ltd
2.        Hyundai Construction commenced operations in 1945 and was incor-
porated in 1950. It is presently the largest construction company in Korea
with extensive activities in both domestic and overseas markets. Present
facilities include: 8,000 units of heavy construction equipment, a heavy
equipment maintenance shop, rock crusher and asphalt plant, and a concrete
block plant. The company has a reputation for low cost, high quality, and
efficient execution of construction projects. In Korea these have included:
highways, bridges, dams, power plants, industrial plants (including steel and
petrochemical plants), housing complexes and hotels. Abroad, Hyundai Construc-
tion has built highways in Thailand and Indonesia, bridges in the U.S., power
plants in Papua, New Guinea and harbor facilities in Australia. The company
also has significant and expanding operations in the Middle East where it is
engaged in the construction of major shipyards in Bahrain and Iran and port
facilities in Saudi Arabia.
3.        As of year-end 1976, the company held assets of US$406 million, and
earned before taxes US$30.6 million on sales of US$278 million.
C.   Hyundai International Inc.
4.        This company, the sponsor of the proposed project, was incorporated
in 1962 to conduct international trading operations for the Hyundai Group.
While this activity ceased in 1973, its operations now include the manufacture
of heavy construction equipment, auto parts, and iron and steel castings
and forgings, as well as the operation of four ocean-going freighters for
world-wide tramping services.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
5.        Hyundai International employs some 3,500 staff, and in 1976 earned
US$1.5 million on sales of US$47 million, and assets of US$92 million.
Details on the company's operations are given in Annex 2-4 and 2-5 and in the
main text of this report.
D.   Hyundai Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.
6.        Hyundai Shipbuilding was formed for the purpose of building a
variety of cargo vessels and supertankers. Construction of the shipyard,
financed by a US$70 million loan from a European consortium and guaranteed by
the Government of Korea, began in lMarch 1972. By November 1974, the shipyard
had delivered its first two tankers of 259,000 DWT each. The shipyard
consists of three large dry docks, hull shop, steel fabrication shop, assembly
shop, paint shop and out-fitting shop. Altogether, the facility is capble of
producing ten 300,000 DWT vessels every year.
7.        The company employs a total of over 18,000 people, and in 1976
incurred losses of US$27 million (against 1975 profits of US$21 millon) on
sales of US$380 million and assets of US$397 million.
E.   Hyundai Motor Company
8.        The Hyundai Motor Company was incorporated in 1967 to assemble
passenger cars, buses and trucks under license from the Ford Motor Company
of the U.S. In 1975, the company completed construction of an integrated
automobile plant with an annual capacity of 80,000 units of cars and com-
mercial vehicles (including the popular Hyundai Pony - the first original
Korean car). The new plant includes an engine assembly shop, foundry and
forge, die and tooling shop, stamping plant, parts manufacturing plant,
and an assembly plant. As a result, the company has increased the local
content of its products to about 65% of total value. Overall, Hyundai
Motor is the largest auto manufacturer in Korea with about 55% of the
local passenger car and bus markets.
9.        In 1974, the company went public, with an issue of just under 50%
of its capital stock to the general public. The company employs about 1,600
people, and in 1976 earned US$7.3 million before taxes on sales of US$109
million and assets of US$159 million.
F.   Hyundai Cement Co., Ltd.
10.       This company developed from a division of the Hyundai Construction
Company which established a 400,000 metric ton portland cement plant in 1964,
with USAID financial assistance. In 1970, the Hyundai Cement Company was
incorporated to take over the operations of the plant with a view to
improving its manufacturing and sales efficiency. In 1974, the company
completed an expansion project, raising plant capacity to 1.2 million
metric tons per annum. The expansion was financed by the US Exim Bank and
a US commercial bank.

11.       Hyundai Cement became a publicly-owned corporation in 1975.  As
of year-end 1976, the company's total assets amounted to US$37 million,
with sales of US$30 million on which it earned profits of US$0.5 million.
G.   Keum Kang Asbestos Cement Industries Co., Ltd.
12.       This company was established in 1958 to manufacture various types
of construction materials for the domestic and foreign markets. Major pro-
ducts include corrugated and ribbed asbestos/cement sheets, and interior
walls and partitions for office and institutional use.
13.       Keum Kang went public in 1973, the first of the Group companies
to do so. Total earnings in 1976 amounted to US$0.7 million on sales of
US$30 million and assets of US$21 million.
H.   Hyundai America Corporation
14.       Hyundai America was established as an integrated construction
contractor in the U.S. territory of Guam, in 1968. Since then, the company
has successfully built a number of public and private projects including:
schools, generating plants, offices, condominiums and housing units. The
company held assets of US$15 million and reported a loss of US$1.5 million on
sales of US$5 million in 1976.
I.   Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co., Ltd.
15.       This company was established as a joint venture between Hyundai
Shipbuilding and Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries of
Japan in 1975. Facilities include repair docks and a quay with the capacity
for repairing 200 large scale ships per year, up to an individual size of
700,000 DWT. The company is based alongside the Hyundai Shipyard in Ulsan
and employs 2,500 persons. In 1976, the company held assets of US$21 million
and incurred losses of US$0.1 million on sales of US$11 million.

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
EXISTING FACILITIES OF HII
A.   Background and Development
1.        HII was established in 1962 as a joint stock company under the
Commercial Code of the Republic of Korea, to carry out trading activities
for the Hyundai Group. It first concentrated on exporting products of
the Hyundai Group and importing industrial and construction materials
and equipment. HII entered the field of manufacturing in 1965 by
establishing a machine shop at Anyang (26 km. from Seoul), for producing
stainless steel tableware. Further, in 1968 the Company supplemented its
trading operation by international shipping operations on a small-scale.
In 1969, the table-wares plant was expanded and modified for the production
of various automobile parts such as shock absorbers, engine radiators and
side-frames. The Company expanded its manufacturing operations in 1970
when it initiated the construction of a machinery manufacturing plant at
Gunpo (30 km. from Seoul) by setting up a foundry for the production of
iron and steel castings. This was followed by the additin of a machine-
shop in 1972 and a forging facility in 1973 and subsequently HII began to
manufacture heavy construction machinery. The shipping operation was
strengthened and by 1973, HII was operating four ocean-going vessels with
a total tonnage of 70,000 DWT. As other operations gained in importance,
the trading activity was curtailed and discontinued in 1973. The Company
added a range of electrical auto-parts to its Anyang product-line through
further expansion in 1974.
2.        In mid-1975, the Company received a US$17.5 million loan from
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for expanding the Gunpo facility into
an integrated machinery manufacturing plant at an estimated total cost
of US$30 million. The Company is in the process of completing the
expansion, which would place HII in a position to manufacture a variety
of heavy construction equipment; water chillers; machine-tools; textile-
spinning, cement and paper machinery; and a range of forgings, castings
and fabricated products. Recently, the Company negotiated another loan
for US$7.6 million from the U.S. Exim Bank for a further increase in
the capacity of the Gunpo plant.
3.        The Gunpo facility contributed 54% of HII revenue in 1976,
Anyang 31% and shipping 15%. With the completion of the current expansion,
Gunpo would become significantly more important than HII's other existing
operations. By 1979, when Gunpo is expected to reach full operational
status, it alone is projected to generate around US$200 million in annual
sales revenues, as compared to about US$48 million of HII's entire turn-
over at present.

B. Present Facilities
1.   The Gunpo Plant
4.        The Gunpo facility, begun in 1970 with a Foundry shop, has since
been expanded into a large facility with the flexibility of manufacturing
a diverse range of light and medium machinery and related products. For
current products, manufactured under international licenses, see Annex 2-5.
Upon completion of the current ADB-fin2nced expansion, scheduled for early
1977, the plant wi;l comprise 99,000 m of building area spread over a site
covering 264,000 m . The space-allocation to the primary facilities and
their estimated capacities are summarized in Table 1.
5.        The Foundry and Forge shops:  The melting shop comprises a 1-ton
induction furnace, a 3.5 ton cupola and a 10-ton arc furnace all of which
are already in place. Another 10-ton arc furnace has been provided for
in the current expansion plans. The shop incorporates modern sand pre-
paration, sand slinging and sand conveying and return systems for use in
conjunction with the automatic and manual moulding lines. The casting
operation is supported by suitable pattern-making equipment, shot-blasting
machines and annealing and hardening furnaces of various sizes. The
estimated annual capacity of the shop is about 15,000 tons of steel
castings and 6,000 tons of iron castings. The forge shop, located adjacent
to the foundry, is equipped with a 2 ton free-forging press capable of
handling ingots up to 5 tons in weight. For small forgings, the plant
utilizes three air-operated drop hammers with a maximum weight capability
of 15 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, and suitable upsetting and trimming presses.
6.        A large heat-treatment facility is housed separately and includes
a broad range of heat-treating and hardening furnaces. It also includes
specialized induction-hardeners for components of heavy construction equip-
ment such as bulldozer track links and a rotating hardener for sprockets,
wheels and gears.
7.        The Heavy IMachinery and Fabrication Shop:  The machining capability
at Gunpo is divided into two areas: light macpining and heavy machining.
The heavy machine shop is housed in a 32,000 m structure along with the
fabrication shop, 2 bays being used for machining and 3 bays being used for
fabrication and assembly. The heavy machinery is being provided under the
ADB and U.S. Exim Bank loans and includes a large number of lathes, verticle
and horizontal boring mills, planers and plano-millers, drilling and grinding
machines, gear-making machinery, a dynamic balancing machine and numerically
controlled machining centers. The heavy machining capacity of the shop is
estimated at over 182,400 machine-hours, assuming 3-shift operation.
8.        The fabrication shop provides significant capability with a 800
ton dishing press, a 600 ton press brake, two sets of plate-bending rolls
and a range of other presses, shears, angle-bending tube-bending and turning
rolls. The shop also provides six sets of gas-cutting equipment including



ANNEX 2-4
Page 3
a plasma-arc cutting machine. In the welding area sixteen sets of different
types of welding machines are available and include MIIG and TIG arc welders
and self-propelled submerged-arc welding machinery.
9.        The2Light Machine Shop:  The light machine shop is housed in a 14
bay, 27,000 mn structure. Eight bays within the shop are utilized for crane
and under-carriage assembly and a repair and maintenance facility. At the
machine-end, the heavy machinery is adequately supplemented at the light-end
through the provision of a number of lathes (84), milling and drilling
machines, shapers and slotters and grinding machines. Within the light
machine-shop there is a provision for a tool-room and other support areas.
The capacity of the light machine shop is estimated at over 1,186,000 machine
hours on the basis of 3-shift operation.
10.       Manpower Resources:  The Gunpo plant employed at year-end 1976 a
total labor force of around 700.  Of these, 650 are employed in administrative
and engineering functions. In order to manage the technology transfer under
the range of existing foreign licenses (see Annex 2-5), the Company is in the
process of strengthening in-house engineering capability. Gunpo currently
employs around 170 manufacturing engineers and an additional 200 people
working in design, drafting and related functions. By 1979, when Gunpo
is expected to attain full capacity, the engineering and labor resource
is expected to double.
11.       Gunpo project-completion experience:  The ADB financed expansion
project was estimated to be completed in August 1977. In view of progress
to-date, the project-implementation is proceeding three months ahead of
schedule and is expected to be completed in June. The project cost experience
is shown below. The increase is almost entirely related to a change in pro-
ject scope, to accomodate additional machinery financed by the U.S. Exim Bank.

The unit cost experience at Gunpo adjusted for inflation has been used as
the basis for estimating construction costs for the Heavy N4achinery Project.
12.       The Gunpo facility with its significant light and medium engineer-
ing capability will be of considerable assistance to the Project in both
the construction and operational phases. It has already served a useful
function in providing qualified and experienced manpower for the early
design and planning stages of the project. It will provide a great deal
of assistance in the early Project fabrication work, through the availability
of its facilities and trained labour. In the early operational phase it will
supplement training facilities included in the Project and serve as a productive
training ground itself. Finally, in the operational phase, it will complement
the Project's heavy engineering capability by providing medium-sized forgings
and castings and machined components. The Project design takes these factors
into account in establishing equipment requirements.
2.   The Anyang Plant
13.       The Anyang plant was HII's first venture into manufacturing activity
beginning with the production of stainless steel wares and expanded to manu-
facture a line of automotive components under different international licenses
(see Annex 2-5). In relation to Gunpo, it is a small facility, catering to
mass-production of light automotive products.
14.       The Facilities:  The plant is structured along product-lines in
accordance with its mass-production orientation, with some common facilities
such as the press-working and painting shops, a die-making shop and a labora-
tory. The product-oriented lines are: the brake and steering system line,
the shock-absorber line, the radiator shop and lines for different automotive
electrical equipment such as starter motors and ignition coils. Six heat-
treating furnaces are provided in the plant to meet annealing, tempering and
hardening requirements. A continuous sinter furnace was installed recently
to extend the Company's capability into the production of sintered metal
products. The primary production facilities are housed under two structures:
The press-working, welding, painting and radiator shops in one and the remainder,
along with maintenance area in another.
15.       The Anyang plant was initially designed for a capacity of 30,000 sets
of automotive components. With some rearrangement of the assembly lines and
investment in automation of functions such as coil winding, the capacity at the
beginning of 1977 is 40,000 sets with flexibility to increase the production of
a specific item at the expense of another. The major facilities have the
capacity to produce up to 60,000 sets and with minimum investment in specific
items of machinery and additional manpower, the overall capacity can be in-
creased to 60,000 sets. HII's present programs include plans to achieve
this increase by 1979 and the necessary investment funds have been provided
for in the financial projections.

3.   Marine Equipment and Operations
16.       HII has been engaged in the operation of a shipping line in the
past and recently added a small builidng and repair facility to its operations.
HII's shipping line is named in Korea Atlas.
17.       The Korea Atlas Line comprises four ocean going vessels described
below:
HII: Atlas Line Vessels
Name                         Description                          Tonnage
Premier                 General Cargo/Car Carrier           10,300 DWT (5 holds)
Challenger              Pure Bulk Carrier                   19,680 DWT (7 holds)
Carrier                 Car/Bulk Carrier                    18,110 DWT (7 holds)
Counsellor              Car/Bulk Carrier                    20,330 DWT (6 holds)
The four ships, currently operating year-round, are valued at around US$11
million. The ships generally ply the trans-pacific route between Korea/
Japan and the U.S. West Coast.
C.   Conclusion
18.       HII has made substantial progress, since its inception in 1962.
Total revenues increased from around US$2 million in 1971 to US$48 million
in 1976 as the Company grew from a small trading operation into a significant
manufacturing enterprise. In its Gunpo and Anyang operations, the Company
has shown the ability to manage a number of diverse though comparatively
simple technologies obtained through overseas licenses. The Gunpo plant
incorporates some of the elements of a heavy manufacturing facility so
that the Company has some experience that relates to the Heavy Machinery
Project. The Gunpo construction experience is transferable to the Project
and in addition, as indicated earlier, Gunpo will serve as complement to
the Heavy Machinery Project.

EXISTING LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND PROGRESS
1.        HII's manufacturing operations are based upon the transfer of
technology under license agreements with international manufacturers in
the U.S.A., France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Thus far,
for its existing plants at Gunpo and Anyang, the Company has negotiated
15 licenses, one of which has expired and another is pending Korean Govern-
ment approval.
A.   The Products
2.        The licensing agreements cover the full range of HII's products,
currently being manufactured and scheduled for manufacture in 1977 (see
Table 1). The products can be categorized into five groups: automotive
components; heating and cooling equipment; construction machinery;
machine tools; and industrial machinery. For most of these products, the
Company has selected licensors from amongst the leading manufacturers in
the world. In most cases the technology transferred was new in the Korean
context enabling thle Company to establish itself as the sole domestic
producer.
B.   The Nature of the Agreements
3.        The agreements are generally licenses that extend for 5 years
after the Korean Government has approved them. Thereafter, they can be
extended for another 3-5 years subject to Government reapproval. The
initial down payment in most cases was quite low based on each model or
each set of drawings ranging from US$1,000 for the shock-absorber to
US$25,000 for the largest crawler tractor. The royalty paid ranges be-
tween 2.5 - 5% averaging around 3% of the sales value. All agreements
provide for dispatch of the licensor's engineers at HII's request and
expense and in most cases for training of limited HII staff at the
licensor's facility. The Company has fully utilized the latter provision
as the most effective means of ensuring a smooth transfer of technology.
C.   Progress in Production
4.        As may be expected, production in the early years was heavily
reliant on imported parts and sub-assemblies. HII only contributed 30 -
35% of the total value added, which is still the case for recently intro-
duced construction machinery. However the Company has pursued a rapid
localization program and has succeeded in fully localizing the manufacture
of some of the automotive components.  The manufacture of cranes has been
localized to the extent of 60% and along with other construction machinery



ANNEX 2-5
Page 2
is scheduled for around 70% localization by 1979. Some items that are
not to be localized because of their specialized nature have been clearly
identified. These include components such as master cylinders and other
hydraulic systems, engines, special transmission and bearings.
D.   Conclusion
5.        The Company has gained substantial experience in working with
a number of foreign technologies at the same time and has been quite successful
at it. Though the technologies involved in the Heavy Machinery Project are
much more complex, HII's past experience has been and would continue to be of
some value in negotiating licenses for the Project and in setting up the
organization necessary to absorb the licensed technologies efficiently. In
view of the success of the approach followed in the existing operations, a
similar approach, modified for added complexity to include a higher degree of
training, a comprehensive program for technology transfer and a more elaborate
manufacturing information system, is considered appropriate for the Project.

purchases of raw materials.

KOREA
HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
MARKET FOR EXISTING HII OPERATIONS
1.        HII's operations can be grouped into the following categories:
automotive parts; forging and casting products; space heating and cooling
equipment; construction equipment; machine tools; cement, textile and paper
machinery; and marine operations. The manufacturing operations are carried
out in the Gunpo and Anyang plants under license from reputable international
manufacturers (see Annexes 2-4 and 2-5). The marine operations comprise
contract and charter voyages on the trans-pacific route. The market prospects
and sales plan through 1979 for each of the categories are briefly discussed
below. No forecasts are made beyond 1979 since, by that time HII will have
reached full capacity operations at both plants.
A.   Automobile Parts
2.        The demand for motor vehicles in Korea has increased at rates
averaging around 27% since 1972 as shown below. For the future the Govern-
mnent projections suggest a rate of 10% and 30% for buses and trucks respec-
tively. The forecasts for passenger cars range from growth rates of 15%
to 40% depending upon the cost of ownership and the system of car taxes
in effect. The lower figure of 15% would imply a total of 6 to 7 cars
per 1,000 persons in 1981, whereas in other countries, at a similar stage
of development, registration amounted to 100-150 cars per 1,000 persons.

ANNEX 2-8
Page 2
In line with these forecasts, the original equipment manufacturers' (OEM)
market for vehicle parts can be expected to range between 80,000 and 120,000
sets in 1979. In light of past performance, a figure between the two extremes
of around 100,000 units, implying an aggregate growth rate of 28% is considered
reasonable.
3.        At the supply end the market for vehicles is serviced by three major
manufacturers, Hyundai Motor Company (HMC), Kia Industrial Company, and General
Motors Korea (GMK). These began as assembly operations and have subsequently
begun integrated manufacture. Under the Government's localization plan, most
parts are purchased in the local market. The Government approves domestic
manufacturers as suppliers of specific parts and thereafter import of these
parts is strictly regulated. HII is the largest approved manufacturer of
a wide range of parts under license from overseas manufacturers. For most
of these parts HII's only competition is from small manufacturers primarily
servicing the replacement market. HIT also has the advantage of a captive
buyer in its affiliate HMC, the market leader in cars and buses (1976
market share of 57% and 56% respectively.) Consequently HII dominates
the original equipment manufacturers market in its range of products,
supplying 100% of HMC's requirements, upto 70% of Kia's requirements of
specific parts and 90% of KMK's shock absorber requirements. In addition,
10% of HII's sales are directed towards the replacement market for HMC
vehicles where it competes against less expensive, lower quality products.
4.        HII's past sales record and projections for the future are shown
in Table 1. For most products, growth rates ranging up to 70% are evident
between 1975 and the annualized sales of 1976. Sales in 1976 were constrained
by capacity considerations and, following recent expansion of capacity, are
expected to increase sharply in 1977 and 1978, especially for recently intro-
duced items such as brake and steering systems. Thereafter, a more gradual
increase of upto around 30% is projected for 1979 corresponding to the
increase in vehicle demand. The sales projections for 1979, approximately
amounting to 60,000 sets, include sales of around 6,000 to 10,000 sets to
the replacement market. Based on these sales forecasts, HII is expected to
have a market share of around 50% of the OEM market, which is considered
attainable in view of its unique market position.
B.   Castings and Forging Products
5.        Korea's total requirements for foundry products, primarily cast-
iron, amounted to around 230,000 tons in 1974 showing over a 30% annual
increase from 1970 figures of 70,000 tons. Demand growth for forgings
has been relatively flat, fluctuating around a level of 40,000 tons be-
tween 1970-74. Aggregate estimates for 1975-76 indicate a total require-
ment of castings and forging of 299,000 tons in 1975 and 343,000 tons
in 1976. Under the Fourth Plan projections, the requirements for castings
are expected to increase markedly in cast-iron products and at a slower
rate in cast-steel products. The requirement for forgings is expected to
increase above 100,000 tons from its current levels of around 40,000 tons.



ANNEX 2-8
Page 3
These increases are based on projections for the rapid growth of the manu-
facturing and especially the machinery industry sector in Korea. The
projections through 1979, along with planned HII sales are shown in
Table 2.
6.        Through 1974, HII primarily sold casting and forging products
to its affiliates, Hyundai Construction Company, HMC and Hyundai Ship-
building and Heavy Industry Company. Recently the Company has expanded
its market to include custom jobs for outside the Group such as special
ingots, motor castings, tire manufacturing molds, parts for cement kilns and
pulp machinery. In this field HII faces substantial competition but is helped
by its access to low cost, high quality scrap from its affiliated shipyard.
HII's sales are expected to grow with the overall demand for forgings and
castings. HII sales were 5,800 tons in 1975 and on an annualized basis over
7,600 tons in 1976. In light of this past performance the projected sales
increases implying a constant market share are considered reasonable, espec-
ially in view of the added capacity at Gunpo.
C.   Space Heating and Cooling Equipment
7.        HII also manufactures space-heating radiators, car and bus coolers,
residential air conditioners and waterchiller-type cooling equipment, under
license from international manufacturers. In these products, HII has been
successful in localizing the manufacture of a large proportion of the compo-
nents including the compressors thereby gaining an advantage over other
competitors that have to pay import duties on such components. HII's
sales plan for these products is presented in Table 3, along with their
sales performance for the past two years. The sales of these products are
expected to grow quickly due to the expansion of both the Gunpo and Anyang
facilities. The sharp increase in the sales of waterchillers is related
to the projected increase in demand of such equipment and HII's introduction
of the less expensive 100% localized absorption-type water chillers after
1977. HTI sales are further supported by strict regulation of the import of
such equipment since late 1976 following the demonstration of domestic
manufacturing capability.
D.   Construction Machinery and Forklift Trucks
8.        The Korean construction industry has shown sharp increases in
activity in the period between 1965 and 1975. Correspondingly the demand
for heavy construction machinery also grew in this period and was met
primarily through imports. The levels of construction activity in the
past five years and the import status of major items of equipment are shown
below.

The demand for cranes has been constrained by the fact that they are classified
as heavy transportation equipment and the financing of their imports is con-
trolled by the Government. The sales situation is expected to improve espe-
cially as cranes become available domestically.
9.        The increase in construction activity is expected to continue into
the future at a real rate of around 9% and the demand for construction
machinery is projected to grow accordingly. The demand for such machinery is
expected to be further spurred by two additional factors, namely, the Govern-
ment's plan to pave all "national road" surfaces in the country by 1981 and
the rapid expansion of overseas activity undertaken by Korean construction
companies for which they purchase equipment through Korea. HII's affiliate
Hyundai Construction Company is the most active contractor in this area.
The projections for sales of construction and other mobile machinery in
Korea are presented in Table 4. Growth rates for specific items are assumed
to be different in view of the different types of construction activity
anticipated and the number of machinery units currently in use in Korea. The
table also shows HII's estimates for its own sales of these items which are
manufactured under license from internationally known manufacturers. Except
for cranes, of which HII only manufactures relatively light units, its products
span a wide range and in these product ranges it is the sole domestic manufac-
turer except for forklifts, where it has one competitor. In addition, the
Korean Government recently levied an import restriction on most items of
construction machinery, manufactured locally. In view of these circumstances,
the implied market shares ranging between 25% and 50% by 1979 are considered
attainable.



ANNEX 2-8
Page 5
The only real constraint to these forecasts is capacity and with the
expansion at HII's Gunpo facility, this constraint will be removed by
early 1977.
E.   Machine Tools
10.       Concomitant with the development of the mechanical industries in
Korea, the requirements for machine tools have risen rapidly. About 70%
of domestic requirements primarily comprising precision machinery have
historically been imported, the import level rising to about US$60 million
in 1975 as shown in the table below. In accordance with the Government's
localization policy, domestic production has increased primarily in the
low-grade general purpose tools such as low precision lathes and milling
machines, keeping pace with the overall growth in the manufcturing index.

1/   Derived from contribution of Manufacturing to GNP in current terms.
11.       HII plans to begin the manufacture of lathes and milling machines
in 1977 in its expanded Gunpo facility. Its projected sales in relation to
the total demand are shown in Table 5. The demand projections are based on
machine tools existing in Korea in 1974 and comparison with other nations.
HII plans to establish selling prices at levels equivalent to current c.i.f.
prices for imports. As low-grade machine tools which can be manufactured
domestically are subject to duties this should provide a significant compe-
titive advantage to HII, making it possible for the Company to contribute
significantly to the localization of machine tool production which is
expected to reach around 50% of total Korean requirements by 1981.
F.   Industrial Machinery
12.       Korea has relied on imports for its requirements for industrial
plant machinery in the past, though domestic production began to pick up in
1970. According to data obtained from the Ministry of Construction and



ANNEX 2-8
Page 6
Industry, total demand rose from US$.3 billion in 1970 to US$3.3 billion
in 1974 showing an average annual increase of over 25% in current dollar
terms. Of the total requirement, domestic production accounted for
US$0.7 billion in 1970 and US$1.3 billion in 1974. The Government is
encouraging domestic production of industrial machinery and HII plans to
manufacture equipment for the textile, cement and paper industries under
license from Marzoli (Italy), Fuller (U.S.A.) and Voith (Germany) respec-
tively.
1.   Textile Machinery
13.       Korea is currently one of the world's largest exporters of
textiles and garments. These exports have been supported by significant
imports of textile machinery. Spinning machinery alone accounted for
US$138 million in imports in 1974, up 42% from 1973. There are currently
2.1 million cotton spinning spindles in Korea and under the Government
supported expansion plan, licenses have been issued for the installation
of one million more in 1977 and 1978. In addition the demand for replace-
ment spindles in this period is projected at 500,000. The demand there-
after is projected to drop. HII, manufacturing under license from Marzoli
plans to supply cotton spinning spindles beginning in 1977. Its sales
forecasts are reasonable in relation to the estimated demand considering
its position as sole domestic manufcturer (see table below).

2.   Cement Machinery
14.       The cement manufacturing industry in Korea has progressed signifi-
cantly through modernization and expansion of capacity. Korea achieved self-
sufficiency in cement in 1970 and has been exporting cement since. The demand
for cement in line with the rapid increases in construction activity had grown
from 2.4 million tons in 1967 to 8.8 million tons in 1974 at an average annual
rate of 21%. In line with further expected increases in domestic demand and
exports, the Government is planning for a 5.6 million ton increase in capacity
in the Fourth Five-Year Plan between 1977 and 1981. HII plans to supply a
part of the machinery required for such an expansion. According to current
Korean estimates the machinery cost per annual ton of capacity would amount
to US$50, of which HII is capable of supplying 70% (US$35/ton of capacity)
the remainder being imported. In addition to the domestic market, since
signing of its license agreement with Fuller, HII has been aggressively
marketing cement plants in a number of other countries. In view of
these factors, the sales forecasts presented below are reasonable.

the Government's localization policy attained self-sufficiency in 1975, pro-
duction increasing from 410,000 tons in 1972 to 665,000 tons in 1975. The
demand for paper is projected to continue to increase at an average annual
rate of 10-12% and it is planned that domestic production capacity increase
correspondingly (see Table below). HII plans to manufacture the complete

range of paper-making machinery under license from Voith (German). In the
past year HII's domestic project sales staff has been actively negotiating the
sale of two plants to local companies totalling 155,000 metric ton capacity,
to be installed over the period 1977-79. In this field HII has little
competition, the only other manufacturer in Korea being smaller companies
catering to plant size in the range of 6,000-10,000 metric ton capacity.
Accordingly HII's sales plan presented below should prove to be realistic.

G.   Marine Operations
16.       HII operates the Korea Atlas Shipping line which currently comprises
four vessels acquired in 1972, with a total available tonnage of 68,420 dead-
weight tons. Except for one pure bulk carrier, the vessels are combination
caVgo/bulk cariers and generally run the trans-pacific route between the U.S.
West Coast and Japan/Korea. The vessels are operated on a contract basis for
cargo transport to the U.S. and rely on the spot market for grain transport
from the U.S. Currently one vessel is on time charter to the affiliate,
Hyundai Construction Company and two have one year contracts for car transport.
HII's marine revenues rose steadily between 1971 and 1974 and dropped in 1975
due to a collapse in the market in that year (see table below).

17.       The Atlas Line's operations are supported by four overseas offices
and cargo brokers and it has been nominated by the Government as one of the
six major shipping lines in Korea and is being encouraged to actively parti-
cipate in the expansion of Korea's shipping activity.  An uptrend in the
market was expected to generate 1976 revenues of Won 3,600 million. However
the projection of its operations into the future can be expected to remain
around that level but for changes in charter and other rates. The revenues,
assuming only inflationary rises in charter rates are shown below.

H.   Jobbing and Other Sales
18.       In addition to the above activities, HII undertakes custom manu-
facturing and outfitting for local and overseas companies and the Korean
Government. This category includes sales of small batches of sintered
metal parts, special fabrications for some HII licensors, vehicle-outfitting
for the Korean Government and other products not manufactured on a continuous
basis.
I.   Conclusion
19.       A summary of HII's forecast sales is presented in Table 6.  The
market prospects in all manufacturing areas are excellent spurred by Korea's
rapid development in all related sectors. HII withi its Gunpo facility in
place and its numerous licensing agreements is in a very good position to
benefit from the Government's localization policy and thereby contribute
significantly to import substitution in most areas. In most of the areas



ANNEX 2-8
Page 10
HII is expected to be for the time being the sole supplier competing only
with imports, which are strictly regulated and subject to import duties.
In addition it has captive markets in its affiliates. The forecast sales
are therefore justifiable, and in instances conservative from the market
perspective, being constrained by capacity considerations.

1/ Salesi forecast, 1977-79, is dt,tailed in Annex 2-8, Table 7.  For 1980-86, sales are assumed to grow at 7% ainually to reflect inflation beyond the 1979
stea(Iy btate.  Inilation rat,!s used are estimated internatinoiil inflation rates for machinery and eqliipment.
2/ Labor co!its are based on 1I1l's manpower plani for the 1977-79 period.  Labor costs drop as a % of sales in 1977 reflectir.g -- ,,                       of 1-b3r
bhi It up in advance, 1975-76, to support the Cunpo expansioni.  Laibor costs are assumed to inflate 207 annually, 1977-79, and 15% annually, 1980-86,
to reflect the expected real t ains in Korean wage rates as development proceeds.
3/ Forecast material costs for exiistinig product lines are based on actial 1976 costs as per IIII's cost accounting records.  For new products (chiefly
nmaclinle tools and industrial mnachinery) material costs are basedl on material lists and produiction drawings obtained from  licensors.  In 1977 and 1978,
in order to reflect inefficiencie:s in raw material uisage and a greater reliance on bought-out parts, unit material costs for new products have beeni
increased above those used for tlhe 1979 steady state. For this reason, anid because of an increase in sales mix towards items with a high bought-out
parts conitent (constructioti machinery and induistrial machiinery) versus items with low bougit-out parts (auto parts), material costs as a percentage of
sales are significantly higlier in L977 than in 1976.  Material costs as a percentage of sales decrease in 1978 and 1979, however, increasing efficiencies
in material uisages for new prodiucts is partially offset by a continued sales trend towards items with hiigher levels of bought-out parts.  Inflation of material
costs is assumed to be at the saiau rate as sales inflation.
4/ Forecast at 87. of sales, in line with historical results.
5/ Forecast at 37. of sales, in line with historical results.                                                                                                                       Xt0

';iE:  For the purpose of calculating working capital requirements, HII's existing operations have been divided into two areas:  the
manufacture of long lead time products (industrial machinery, representing about 30% of sales) and the manufacture of short
lead time products (all other items).  The working capital requirements on both types of products are quite different.  More details
on the assumptions for working capital requirements for long-lead time products are given in Annex 5-2.
Also, it should be noted that turnovers of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable will be lower than normal in the
early years of the Gunpo expansion when sales and related costs are increasing throughout the year.  Normal turnovers will be
achieved in 1979 and later years when revenues and expenses have reached steady-state levels.

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
THE MACHINERY SECTOR
A.   Economic Setting
1.        The Republic of Korea is a small densely populated country with
a total land area of 99,000 square kilometers. Its topography and harsh
winters limit the productive potential of agriculture, only about 23% of the
land being cultivated. Korea's mineral resources, principally low quality
anthracite coal, are not of great value. Despite these constraints, Korea
has established an outstanding record of economic growth, aggregate real
GNP increasing at an average rate of around 10% per year since 1962. The
rapid growth has been based on the expansion of exports of manufactured
goods and has transformed the structure of the economy as shown below.

ANNEX 3-1

The rapid growth in the manufacturing sector, at about twice the rate of
growth in aggregate GNP, has resulted in a decline of the share of other
sectors in the GNP.
2.        The leading edge of this growth and transformation has been the
increases in manufactured exports. The share of net manufactured exports
to GNP has risen from 1.1% in 1965 to 10.7% in 1975. In 1975, manufactured
exports accounted for around 83% of Korea's total commodity exports. This
period has also seen marked shifts in the composition of manufactured ex-
ports. The share of crude intermediate materials in the export product-
mix dropped significantly as a number of higher value added commodities
demanding more sophisticated production techniques have gained in prominence:
among these are transport equipment, industrial machinery, and a variety
of chemicals and precision instruments.
3.        Korea's extraordinary export performance is reflected in the chang-
ing structure of the manufacturing sector in the last decade, as shown below.
Between 1961 and 1975, the heavy manufacturing sector has gained while food
processing industries declined in importance. The most notable increase
is in the share of machinery and equipment, especially between 1971 and
1975.

The sector has grown at very high rates in terms of both, production and ex-
port performance. The growth, which has been most dramatic since 1972, was
spurred by an investment outlay of Won 542 billion (at 1975 prices) or 19.3%
of the total outlay for the manufacturing sector, in the third Five-Year Plan
(1972-76). However, almost half of this investment was allocated to the
ship-building and electronics industries, which contribute the bulk of the
exports from the sector.
5.        The machinery sector has also gained in economic importance in terms
of employment generation. Employment in the sector more than doubled since
1971 and also increased as a proportion of employment in the total manufacturing
sector as shown below:

Employment %
Employment in the machinery sector has grown at the rate of 23% as against
only 14% for the manufacturing sector as a whole. The number of establishments
in the machinery area has also been increasing, while those in the manufactur-
ing sector has declined. A trend towards larger establishments in the sector,
reinforced by the inclusion of the shipping industry, is also evident. Within
the machinery sector, the machinery building industry itself accounted for
2,419 establishments with an estimated 129,000 employees or 39% of the employ-
ment in the machinery sector.
6.        The breakdown within the machinery sector by 1975 output is approx-
imately: machinery building 50%, shipbuilding 12% and electronics 38%. The
performance figures revised to exclude shipbuilding and electronics are shown
in the following table. The export performance in the machinery building
industry, though registering high growth rates because of a small base, has
lagged behind the machinery sector as a whole. In 1975, only 21% of the
production was exported as against 37% for the sector i.e. after including
shipbuilding and electronics. However, the performance is commendable, since
most of the growth occured in the mid-seventies, while international trade was
affected adversely by the oil crisis.

The general machinery sub-sector which includes industrial machinery and
plant equipment amongst other items, contributed only 21% of the output
and was the most import-dependent (74%) of all sub-sectors.
8.        In terms of physical structure and location, around 80% of the
establishments are estimated to employ under 50 workers, and around 60% of
them are located in and around the metropolitan centers of Seoul and Pusan.
The companies in the sub-sector are largely privately held, the larger enter-
prises being owned by family groups. The Government strategy in this regard
has been to encourage the private sector's development. In case of priority
projects, such as the HII Project, the Government selects the private enter-
prise most capable of successfully implementing the project. Companies
sponsoring such projects and other large companies are also being encouraged
to distribute ownership to the public. This measure is reinforced with
a large tax incentive, the corporate tax-rate dropping from 50% to 34% when
a closely held corporation goes public. This pattern of private ownership
has generally worked well, though due to lack of coordination, it has led
to fragmentation of capacity.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 7
9.        In summary, the machinery building industry has lagged behind the
machinery sector as a whole, due to the focus on electronics and shipbuilding.
Further, in the relatively capital-intensive industrial machinery sub-sector,
the country has continued to rely on imports as it concentrated development
attention on industrial activities of lower capital intensity where it enjoyed
a comparative advantage in export markets. Centralized investment planning
has not occurred in the sector due to the extreme heterogeneity of the pro-
ducts, and has led to a structure with fragmented capacities and assembly-type
operations. There are only a limited number of companies engaged in manufacture
of the heavy class of machinery and equipment and these are yet to fully
develop local design and technological capabilities. A list of the companies
engaged in heavy manufacturing is given in Table 1. HII, with its expanded
Gunpo facility, is one of them. In terms of products, rolling stock in the
transportation sub-sector and the larger items of construction machinery
represent the heaviest and most complex products currently manufactured. The
Project would thus represent a significant advance on this front.
C.   Fourth Plan Targets
10.       The basic strategy of the fourth Plan (1977-81) is an extension of
the high-growth pattern (9.2% increase in GNP per year) of the previous plans
with increased emphasis on high technology items. As in the past exports
are expected to be the driving economic force. The table below shows a
comparison between the second, third and fourth Plans in relation to manu-
facturing. Performance in value-added terms in the manufacturing sector
has exceeded past plans and the sector is planned to receive continuing
emphasis, receiving 23.2% of the total investment outlay.

11.       Within the sector, the government plans to continue its emphasis
on the heavy and chemical industries, for the country to become more self-
sufficient in intermediate and capital goods industries and to expand and
diversify export into higher value-added goods. In constant terms, the
sector output is planned to grow at around 14% a year with the machinery
building industry growing much more rapidly at a rate of around 22%. For a
detailed breakdown see Table 2. The machinery and electronics industries are
planned to receive more investment emphasis with corresponding reductions in
textiles and shipbuilding. The prospective growth of the machinery industry
excluding shipbuilding and electronics is presented below, leading to total
exports of US$1.4 billion by 1981 and a reduction in the import ratio to under
30%. The increase in exports represents an average annual growth of 32% and
incorporates export of heavy manufactured goods. The relationship of these
exports to total exports is shown in Table 3.

D.   Government Strategy for the Machinery Building Industry
12.       Promotion of the machinery building industry is especially emphasized
in the fourth Plan. Machinery products are planned to be developed for import
substitution as well as export. The development is to be supported through a
number of incentives related to foreign capital and technology inducement and
domestic industry promotion through funds assistance. Import substitution
is planned to be promoted through increased incentives and encouragement for
purchase of domestically produced machinery. In early 1977 the Government
established a Committee for Machinery Localization Encouragement constituted
of the heads of all relevant ministries and chaired by the Minister of E.P.B.
Reporting to this committee are subcommittees at the Assistant Minister and
Director levels. The Committee's policy proposals presented in March 1977
establish the principle of increasing localization in a number of machinery
sub-sector, with specific reference to plant equipment. The proposals, to be
developed further, outline basic strategy and related policy.   Export would
be encouraged through increased export credits and incentives. The machinery
building industry sector is marked for intensive development at a total
investmenmt outlay of US$1.85 billion during the 4th Five-Year Plan, excluding
the allocation for shipbuilding and electronics.
13.       In order to support intensive development of industrial sectors,
Korea has established over 20 industrial estates around major population
centers and ports. These are classified into four major groups: free export
zones, special industrial estates, export industrial estates and local indus-
trial estates. A large number of these are engaged in manufacturing in a
single sub-sector such as electronics at Gumi, non-ferrous metals at Onsan
and petro-chemicals at Ulsan. This approach lowers investment cost in infra-
structure facilities, maximizes linkage and technology diffusion effects
and reduces environmental pollution in the metropolitan centers. For the
machinery industry, Korea has established an integrated machinery complex
at Changwon.

The increase in exports represents an average annual growth of 32% and incor-
porates export of heavy manufatured goods. The relationship of these exports
to total exports is shown in Table 3.
1.   The Changwon Complex
14.       Changwon has been conceived as a giant complex of 104 factories
linked in the manufacture of machinery and parts. The physical layout of the
Complex is shown in Map IBRD 12645 and the basic infrastructure discussed in
Annex 4-8. The Complex covers a total area of 43.3 square kilometers, of
which 17.4 square kilometers is allocated to industrial development, and
incorporates all basic infrastructure requirements of the planned 100-plus
facilities. The Complex was opened for construction of factories in 1974.
15.       Along with the establishment of the physical infrastructure, the
Government offered an attractive package of incentives to induce entry of
both domestic and foreign enterprises in the area of machine manufacture.
Some of the major incentives are shown in the following table.

3-year grace period available for 70% of land costs
and 75% of facility costs; also 50% of operation
funds provided at same interest, repayable over
3 years with no grace period.
16.       Since 1974, 49 factory units have entered the complex, including
9 joint venture enterprises. A complete list as of December 1976 is shown
in Table 4. These divide along product lines as follows:
-    14 producers of metal products and components (the largest
unit is a special steel plant).
-    20 makers of industrial machinery and equipment (this group
includes Hyundai International and Samsung Heavy Industry;
also eight machine tool factories).
-    3 makers of electrical equipment and appliances.
-    5 producers of auto parts.
-    7 producers in the miscellaneous category.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 12
This development has fallen short of expectations in numbers of entrants
and the types of factories, which are largely fragmented units engaged
in relatively low capital-intensity operations. Duplication of capacity
is also evident.
2.   Project Relevance
17.       The HII Project is the most significant constituent of the Changwon
Complex and is expected to have a major impact on its future. The Project is
Korea's first venture into the field of the manufacture of highly advanced
and very heavy equipment and is designed to fill a substantial position of
the domestic demand of such machinery in the steel, power and chemical/petro-
chemical industries. In the machinery sector report of the 4th Plan, turn-key
plant export was singled out as a major new export opportunity for Korea. In
this context, the Project is certainly not limited to import-substitution in
the longer term. When the Project achieves full operation, it would supply
large castings and forgings to other industries and it would be a buyer of a
variety of equipment parts and subassemblies. In time, the forward and back-
ward linkages can be expected to evolve into a cluster of large and small
enterprises joined together in the manufacture of heavy plant equipment,
sharing technologies, skills or some highly specialized and expensive pieces
of production machinery. HII plans to facilitate this process by assisting
in the strengthening of existing supply capabilities through help in product-
selection, licensing and technology transfer and training.
3.   Other Measures, Policies and Regulations
18.       The development of the machinery building industry is further based
on increased local-content in domestic plants, modernization of machinery-
manufacturing facilities, availability of skilled manpower, technological
advances, inducement of foreign capital and joint ventures, and export pro-
motion.
19.       The Government plans to limit the construction of domestic plants
on a turn-key basis by foreign companies, promoting instead the development
of local design and engineering firms and a high local content in all domestic
plants. The investment outlay for the fourth Plan includes funds for the
modernization of 500 existing small and medium-scale enterprises to strengthen
the technological and production base. The country already has an excellent
training program for basic technicians and machine operators and has planned
further increases to meet the expected requirements of scientists, engineers
and skilled manpower under the fourth Plan.
20.       In regard to technological advances, the Government has developed
a list of priority items for which incentives have been legislated. There is
a tax reduction of eight percent on the proportion of undistributed profits
used for investment expenditures in foreign technology (10% if domestic
machinery is used), and a tax exemption on a reserve fund upto ten percent
of profits. In the area of research and developments, to start with a new



ANNEX 3-1
Page 13
metals and machinery institute at a cost of US$5 million has been planned
for Changwon but not yet established. The overall investment in science
and technology, excluding defense, has been stepped up significantly
from the third Plan level of 0.3% of GNP to 1.0% of GNP or US$310 million
between 1977-81. Research and Development is planned as a cooperative
venture with the private sector sharing 60% of the cost burden.
21.       Also, in order to encourage foreign investment, the Government
promulgated the Foreign Capital Inducement Law in 1973. Under this law
foreign enterprises that have been approved by the Economic Planning Board
are permitted to import capital equipment, semi-finished products and
raw materials on a duty-free basis. The law also includes the tax incentives
discussed earlier in the context of Changwon. For domestic enterprises in
priority industries such as the machinery industry the exemption on capital
goods is applicable, but both customs duties and commodity taxes may be
levied on import of materials and components. Investors have a choice
between tax-holidays in early years, an 8% tax credit or a special 100%
depreciation.
22.       The machinery building industry (and the Project) is expected to
be largely import-substituting. Flexible tariff protection has been granted
in the past to some key import substituting industries. There has also been
a tendency to impose procedural controls on competing imports of both inter-
mediate and capital goods immediately following initiation of domestic pro-
duction. In order to manage the prices of the products of industries that
are monoplistic-oligopolistic in nature, the Government announces maximum
prices for such products under the Price Stabilization Law revised in 1976.
Generally, there has been a shift towards larger incentives to priority
import-substituting industries, such as the machinery building industry.
Export incentives such as reduction in taxes on earnings from exports, pre-
ferential credit and access to imports have been reduced as Korea's interna-
tional competitiveness increased, but continue to favor exports over import-
substitution.
23.       In relation to financial assistance to the machinery building
industry, a special fund was created in 1967 under the Machinery Industry
Promotion Law. Subsequently, a number of special funds such as the National
Investment Fund and a special fund for exports have been established. These
funds are essentially intended to serve the needs of the machinery industry
in two ways, in direct assistance to the manufacturer and in sales financing
through loans to the end-user. Generally the terms for the funds to the
manufaturer are 12-14% for 8 year loans and to the end-useer 12-14% for 5 year
loans with some differences due to priority of the product-group and eligib-
ility for different funds. The National Investment Fund is the largest
element with approval of around US$376 million in 1976, of which US$75
million was channelled to the machinery industry. Total approval of US$443
million is planned for 1977. The special export import facility was estab-
lished as an independent entity in 1970 with a subscribed capital of US$135
million. Loans of US$110 million primarily financed shipbuilding exports.
The lending is proposed to be expanded to around US$400 million in 1977.

E.   Sector Issues
24.       The rapid growth of the sector and of the machinery industries
has been remarkable. However, the heterogeneity of products and the primarily
private ownership pattern has not permitted centralized planning as has been
true for other sectors in Korea, such as power or steel. Consequently,
certain weaknesses have developed in the sector. The Government is aware of
these weaknesses and the development of a general strategy based on a number
of studies in different areas, as under the M1achinery Localization Encouragement
Committee, is underway. However, detailed planning including allocation of
responsibilities, implementation schedules and coordinating mechanisms still
remains to be worked out. In order to ensure that the further planned growth
of the sector occurs in an optimal manner, the following sector issues require
further Government attention:
(i) Rationalization of Investment: As indicated earlier, centralized
investment planning has not been possible in this sector and the Government
concentrated on identification of priority products rather than projects.
The HII Project is one of the very few exceptions. Considering the diffi-
culties of centralized planning, it is important that mechanisms such as
screening or monitoring agencies be set up to ensure that duplication of
investment is avoided when approving new facilities.
(ii) Rational Development of Changwon: Progress to date in Changwon
already shows fragmentation of capacities in small units and has fallen
short of the intention of an integrated machinery complex. Consideration
of existing facilities is important in planning future capacity in order to
improve overall efficiency of the Complex. Such planning and control requires
immediate Government attention.
(iii) Transfer of Technology: In this area, there is again the need for
rational acquisition of relevant and up-to-date technology, without duplication
of licensing arrangements. Larger companies, such as HII, have the resources
to suitably select such technology and should be encouraged to assist smaller
producers in obtaining adequate licensing arrangements. In this regard, the
responsibility for monitoring progress and screening proposed agreements
on this basis should also be clearly allocated to existing or new agencies.
(iv) Research and Development: The adequacy of research and development
support is critical to the development of the machinery industry especially
in technologically advanced areas. Quality assurance is key not only for the
producers but also for their suppliers. The fund allocation of US$5 million
for the research institute at Changwon would not be adequate to provide such
support. The Korea Institute of Science and Technology has a precision
machinery center and a foundry center but neither has the physical facilities
to undertake the range of development work required by the emerging heavy



ANNEX 3-1
Page 15
industries. There is a need to accumulate existing knowledge in the country
and facilitate its dispersion to smaller producers; a systematic assimilation
of new knowledge should proceed simultaneously.
(v) Upgrading of Training: Korea has an excellent training program,
which has proved adequate in the past. However, as the orientation of the
machinery industry changes towards high technology heavy manufacture, an
ungrading in the skills of the training graduates would be required. Various
studies exist on upgrading of training programs, to include modern production
techniques, exist but a comprehensive program is yet to be developed.
(vi) Development of Supply Industries: The fourth Plan provides for
funds for the modernization of small and medium-scale enterprises, but ration-
al plans for such assistance are only now being developed. The total invest-
ment allocation of around US$1.85 billion for the fourth Plan might not prove
adequate. It is important that planning for these, the supply industries,
take place alongside that for the heavy industries. This is needed to ensure
the availability of an adequate domestic source of matezials and components
and the establishment of appropriate backward linkages.
(vii) Sales Financing: Mechanisms already exist, as indicated, to assist
sales of machinery products. However, again, the amounts allocated would not
suffice to support the sales of the heavy industries. The sales from the
Project alone are expected to be around US$400 million (in constant 1976
terms) at full operating, against the National Investment Fund 1976 machinery
industry loans of US$75 million. Availability of sales financing is likely
to be one of the critical factors in the success of the Project and other
ventures in this sector.
(viii) Export Strategy: The Government is already taking steps to estab-
lish export-promotion funds and should review the needs of the heavy sector
in determining the amounts. In addition, planning should focus on product-mix
selection for export and on additional promotion measures to support the
priority products in realizing early export potential.

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
MARKET FOR THE PROJECT
A.   Introduction
1.        The Korean economy has grown rapidly in the past decade register-
ing GNP growth rates of 10.5% in the second Plan (1967-71) and 9.4% in the
third Plan (1975-76). The growth in the manufacturing sector has signifi-
cantly outpaced overall growth. The sector has grown at an average rate
of 18.4% since 1971 and is expected to grow at a rate of 13.3% in the
fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81). The fourth Plan places special emphasis
on the development of heavy and chemical industries which are planned to
grow at an average rate of 16.8%. Under the fourth Plan the Government
aims to build domestic capability in the manufacture of plant-equipment
to support such growth. In view of this objective, the Government has
selected HII to set up a modern facility for the manufacture of plant
equipment under the Project. The Project will be the first facility in
Korea planned for the manufacture of the very heavy class of plant equip-
ment, and will contribute towards the objective of import-substitution.
2.        Within the heavy and chemical industries, the steel sector has
been growing most rapidly at a rate of 36.8% since 1971 and contributed
around 4.5% of the manufacturing output in 1976. The chemical industries
sector contributed nearly 25% of the total manufacturing output showing
a growth rate of 17.2% since 1971. These two sectors are expected to con-
tinue rapid growth under the 4th Plan (17.9% and 13.2% growth respectively)
and together with the power-generation sector, which is planned to keep pace
with the development of the economy, are the primary target markets for the
project:
(i) Steel Sector: Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (POSCO), a
government enterprise, has a present capacity of 2.6
million tons of crude steel per year to be expanded
to 5.5 million tons by mid-1979. The project is planned
to supply equipment for the subsequent expansion to 8.5
million tons scheduled to be implemented in 1979-1982.
In addition it is expected to supply equipment for rolling
and finishing capacity expected to be installed by smaller
private companies. Beyond 1982, the Project would meet the
demands of further expansions in steel production capacity;
(ii) Power Generation Sector: The power network in Korea is
operated by the government-owned Korea Electric Co. (KECO).
Over the fourth and fifth Five-Year Plans (1977-86), KECO
plans an ambitious program of expansion of generating
capacity as well as modernization and standardization of
its system. The plans call for thermal plants (300-500 MW),
hydroelectric plants (50-400 MW), pumped storage plants



ANNEX 3-2
Page 2
(300-400 MW) and nuclear power plants (600-900 MW). The
Project is designed to undertake the integrated manufacture
of all power plant equipment and would initially concentrate
on conventional thermal power stations and also service the
requirements for hydrostations to come on stream in Korea
from 1980 onward. With experience, the Company would be
in an excellent position to undertake nuclear equipment
manufacture.
(iii) Chemical/Petrochemical Sector: Korea's petrochemical
industry has developed rapidly since 1970 with the estab-
lishment of the country's first petrochemical complex at
Ulsan and produces a variety of intermediate and end-
products in plastics, fibers and elastomers. Future growth
is importantly linked to the growing exports of textiles
and garments. The fourth Five Year Plan calls for expansion
of the Ulsan complex and the establishment of a new complex
at Yeochun. The Project is intended to supply equipment
for these and future programs (fifth Five-Year Plan) in the
sector. The equipment for the sector primarily comprises
fabricated items, an area in which the country and the
Hyundai Group have some related experience. Supported by
the marketing organization and the past record of the Group
companies in overseas construction, HII could achieve early
success in the turnkey export of chemical/petrochemical plants.
3.        In the following sections, the three major consuming sectors will
be examined in detail to determine the appropriateness of the Project's
planned production program. Further, the demand and market for plant
equipment will be determined to establish the viability of the levels of
production during start-up and full operation. Potential for export and
sales to the domestic replacement market has not been considered in the
analysis.
B.   The Steel Sector
1.   Demand
4.        The following table shows the historical consumption and supply
of steel in Korea. The increase in domestic consumption has been led by
the investment in construction activity as Government efforts focussed on
the building of infrastructure - land development, roads, highways, ports
and harbor projects.

1/   Total Requirement =  Apparent Consumption + Export = Production + Import
2/   Percent export is given on basis of total requirement (Production plus
Import) rather than production alone because some export tonnage is
derived from imports e.g. imported hot-rolled coil is exported as cold-
rolled coil or sheet.
5.        Steel demand in Korea can be expected to increase steadily
as the country's development continues, especially in the heavy and
chemical industries, planned to grow at an overall rate of around 18%
between 1977-81. The following table shows the demand projections from
two sources:
(i) Korea Development Institute (KDI) projection is derived from
its macro-economic model and is based upon a projected GNP
growth at 9% annual rate and an export rate continuing at
30% of total requirements.
(ii)  U.S. Steel projection is derived from a macro as well as
micro analysis of the major steel user industries and based



ANNEX 3-2
Page 4
upon a GNP growth of 10% annual rate and export of 30% of
total demand. Steel demand is projected to grow at 22%
annually through 1980 and at a slower rate of 12% annually
thereafter as the steel intensity increases and the growth
curve levels off.

Finished Steel Growth/GNP Growth    1976-81  :  1.44
(KDI forecast)                        1981-86  :  1.12
6.        Of the two forecasts, the KDI forecast more closely reflects the
present GNP growth target of 9.0% in the fourth Plan and is probably more
realistic. The forecast implies a domestic demand growth of 17% between
1976-81 (vs. 19%, 1971-76) and 11% between 1981-86. The 1981 projection
translates to a per capita steel consumption of 300 kg which seems reasonable
in comparison with Japan's performance in the past (260 kg, 1960-64) or that
of Spain (315 kg, 1973).
7.         The export of steel is more difficult to assess in view of the
dynamics and complexity of the international steel market. The 30% export
assumed in both projections is optimistic and based upon the recent perform-
ance of the steel industry (45% annual export growth, 1971-76), as well as
upon the expectation that the low labor and overhead cost structure of the
industry would enable it to continue to compete successfully. However,
conditions could change and curtail the level of exports. It might be noted
that in the past, performance has tended to exceed projections for both the
second and the third-Five-Year Plan periods. In view of these factors, the
demand estimate of 11.0-12.0 million tons in 1981 and around 18.0-20.0
million tons in 1986 is considered reasonable.
2.   Supply
8.        POSCO today has a capacity of 2.6 million tons per year of crude
steel. The third expansion of POSCO, to be completed in early 1979, will



ANNEX 3-2
Page 5
increase it to 5.5 million tons. The fourth expansion, planning for which
is already underway, will further raise it to 8.5 million tons. In addition,
there are 14 private steel producers with a combined capacity of about 2 mil-
lion crude steel tons; these plants produce steel by melting scrap in the
electric furnace (Table 1). In 1976, these mini-plants accounted for over
35% of the total production of 3.34 million tons of crude steel.
9.  r    Future supply must consider not only the tonnage increase in demand
but also the change in the composition of demand. Through about early 1970,
well over 50% of the demand originated in the construction sector. This will
no doubt change. During the fourth Plan and beyond, with increased develop-
mental emphasis on the manufacturing sector, the demand for flat products and
for higher quality engineering steels can be expected to increase more rapidly
relative to the demands from the other sectors. This would suggest that there
will be a practical limit to the self-sufficiency rate that Korea can hope to
achieve, since the steel industry will still be small in 1986 by world stand-
ards and cannot be expected to produce the variety of steels that the home
market will require.
10.       The fourth Five-Year Plan objective of the Government for the steel
sector is an increase in the self-sufficiency ratio of steel upto 78%. How-
ever, only two investments in capacity have been identified - POSCO expansion
from 5.5 million to 8.5 million tons by 1982 (Table 2) and the establishment
of the special steel plant with an output of 250,000 tons of alloy and stain-
less steels by the middle of 1978. No final plans have yet been established
beyond that, but it is expected that the Government would seek to reach the
fourth Plan objective of high self-sufficiency. In view of the 18.0-20.0
million ton requirepient in 1986, an expansion of capacity upto at least 15.5
million tons is considered reasonable. This probable pattern of capacity
installation is shown below.

11.       The large expansion under "others" in 1981-86 reflects the fact
that no further expansion is possible at the POSCO site, and is likely to be
primarily achieved through a second integrated steel mill. Plans for such a
mill of 3.5 million ton crude capacity were earlier drawn up and then deferred
past 1981. The remainder would be made up by expansion of the smaller electric
furnace installations. With more steel available for processing, the private
steel plants would also be able to significantly expand their finishing
capacity. The capacity expansion in crude steel between 1977-86 would require
addition to this capacity of around 4.0 million tons to maintain the balance
between crude and finished production. The historical and projected investment
in this sector is shown below.

13.       Demand in the future is expected to continue growing rapidly, though
at a somewhat slower pace. Load forecasts by KECO call for increase in sales
to 38,960 GWH in 1981 (14.7% average increase in the fourth Plan), and to
69,270 GHW in 1986 (12.2% increase in the Fifth Plan). The forecast (Table 3)
is based on the assumption of a maturing economy resulting in lower elasticity
coefficients as shown below:

14.       The Bank power sector mission in 1974 projected lower sales figures,
based upon an expected GNP growth rate of 8% in the fourth Five-Year Plan, in
light of the then depressed economy in Korea. However, recent performance of
the economy suggests that the KECO forecast based on higher GNP growth rates
is reasonable.
2.   Generation
15.       Based on the KECO forecast for demand, the peak demand requirements
are presented in Table 3, assuming improved transmission and distribution
efficiency. Accordingly, KECO has drawn up the following schedule of buildup
of capacity. Significantly, the ratio of dependable capacity to installed
capacity in 1975 is estimated by KECO at a low 76%, yielding an effective
reserve margin of dependable capacity to peak demand of less than 8%. The
reasons given for the low ratio are frequent equipment breakdowns, and
problems in spare parts supply. The buildup schedule proposes to raise the
reserve margin to around 20%.

16.       The historical growth in power-generation capacity between 1972-76
is shown below. During this period the bulk of the investment went into
thermal power with the ratio of thermal to total power increasing from 67%
to 86%.

Future plans call for greater diversification of power resources through
installation of nuclear plants, tidal plants and large pumped storage
units to meet peaking requirements, with the dependence on thermal plants
falling to around 80% by 1981 and below 65% by 1986.
17.       The pr7ojected pattern of installation of capacity is based on the
schedule of new plants shown in Table 4. The schedule reflects the policy
of size standardization. Beyond the new thermal plant number 3, KECO plans
to install exclusively plants of 500 MW capacity. The plan is considered
adequate in view of the projected demand, losses and required reserve margins.
The total investment in the next decade is shown in the following table in
relation to the historical pattern. In mid-76 terms, the planned investment
in this period amounts to US$7.7 billion. The low figure for 1982-86 reflects
exclusion of investment in 1983-86 for plants to come on-stream after 1986.

D.   Chemical/`etrochemical
18.       Korea's chemical sector began to develop as a modern industry
in the mid-60s, prior to which production was limited to final products such
as paints, detergents, caustic soda, sulphuric acid and medicine. Beginning
with the establishment of an oil refinery and two urea plants under the first
Five Year Plan (1962-66), production activities have accelerated rapidly along
with demand. Significantly, under the second and third Plans (1967-76),
the chemical industry received significant planning emphasis and a major
petrochemical complex was established at Ulsan. While the industry is not
large, its special significance to Korea derives from its linkage to the
export-oriented textile and garment industries.
1.   Demand
19.       Domestic consumption of petroleum and petrochemical products has
grown rapidly over the past decade. The demand for fuels increased from
1.8 million tons in 1966 to about 10.6 million tons in 1974 at an average
annual rate of 25%. Exports (principally subcontracting and balancing of
refinery output) have increased at about 21% from 350,000 tons in 1966 to 1.7
million tons in 1974. The requirements of feedstocks for the petrochemical
industry have averaged an increase of around 35% over this period.
20.       The consumption record for the major petrochemicals between
1968 and 1974 is shown in Table 5 and confirms a growth rate of 35%. Demand
is projected to continue growing led by increasing exports in textile and
garments. The projections under the Fourth Plan call for a 9.6% growth in



ANNEX 3-2
Page 11
petroleum and growth rates averaging around 20% for major petrochemical
products. Firm long range forecasts for the Fifth Plan are not yet available,
though growth is tentatively projected to slow down to around 10% in this
period. Detailed forecasts are shown in Table 6.
21.       The chemical pulp sector is also targetted for supply under
the Project. Since 1970 pulp consumption in Korea has been increasing
at an average rate of 10.6%, with the demand for chemical pulp increasing
at around 13% as shown below; this higher rate for chemical pulp reflects
the trend towards higher quality paper production.

Demand is expected to increase at a slower rate of 10.8% over the fourth
Five-Year Plan rising to around 600,000 tons by 1981.
2.   Supply
22.       As shown in Table 5 and the table above, a large percentage of the
demand for petrochemicals and for chemical pulp has been historically met
through imports. The current refining capacity in the country amounts to
435,000 barrels per stream day (BPSD) and petrochemical facilities are
designed around a 100,000 ton per year naptha cracker. The existing
plants are shown in Table 7. So far demand requirements and refinery
yields have been balanced such that from crude imports the country is able
to almost fully satisfy its fuel product requirements. Under the fourth
Plan, the Government proposes to continue this policy with refinery
capacity projected to rise to 675,000 BPSD in 1981, and 1,050,000 BPSD in
1981.
23.       At the petrochemical product end, the Government proposes to
significantly curtail dependence on imports by expanding the Ulsan Complex
and building another complex at Yeochun. The core of the program is an
expansion of the naphtha cracker at Ulsan by 50,000 tons per year and the



ANNEX 3-2
Page 12
building of a new cracker at Yeochun of 350,000 tons per year capacity.
The program represents a scaling down from an earlier plan to build two
new 350,000 ton crackers. A number of downstream plants are also planned.
In addition, a chemical pulp plant of 300 ton/day capacity (US$91 million)
and other investments in the area of fine chemicals and facilities such
as an ion exchange salt plant (US$300 million) are also scheduled.   A
list of the major new plants is shown in Table 8 amounting to a total
investment in the sector of around US$1.9 billion through 1981.
24.       Under the fifth Plan, the projections call for further increase
in capacity to meet domestic demand. Tentative estimates based on fourth
Plan indications are shown in Table 9 and amount to a total investment of
around US$2.5 billion. In summary the supply situation in the sector is
planned to shift from reliance on imports to a high degree of self-sufficiency
in petrochemical products. The investment in the next decade is summarized
below, and compares reasonably with investment undertaken in the 3rd Plan.

E.   Plant Equipment Market for the Project
1.   General Considerations
25.       The domestic plant equipment market generated from the investment
plans outlined above will form the primary market for the Project. The
Project design incorporates sufficient flexibility to enable manufacture of
plant equipment and heavy machinery for other sectors also. The primary
market can therefore be expanded through additional licensing arrangements
as need develops. The analysis herein concerns itself with sales of new
plant equipment; sales of ancilliaries and jobbing products to sustain the
production capacity would be in a number of different areas and have not
been covered. The analysis also excludes any consideration of possible
exports which would potentially provide a safety margin over and above the
domestic sales.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 13
26.       The market comprises a number of complex products in each sector
and is difficult to assess in terms of physical units. The assessment is
based instead in terms of mid-1976 constant dollars. The value is derived
from the total investment program on a percentage equipment basis. The
percentages used reflect past experience of domestic buyers and of IIII
licensors. The equipment accounted for in these percentages relates
only to products to be manufactured by HII and excludes items such as
structural steels, general pipes, valves and fitting which could be
supplied by other domestic manufacturers. In the range of equipment
covered, HII is expected to be the sole domestic supplier for the
time being with some local subcontracting arrangements. No final plans
for any other facility to undertake manufacture of similar equipment
currently exist in the country and accordingly HII is not expected to
be faced with any domestic competition in the near future.
2.   Steel-making Equipment
27.       The equipment market deriving from the steel sector investment
program comprises the full range of iron-making, steel-making and rolling/
finishing equipment. Under the 4th Plan, HII's primary target would be

on POSCO's actual experience to date, adjusted for inflation to
mid-1976 levels. It takes account of cost data from the third
expansi--   ^urrently underway.

Since POSCO is a government enterprise and HII would be the only company
in Korea capable of supplying the equipment, the probability of HII securing
the POSCO contract, jointly with their licensors is very high. The sales
breakdown by year, amounting to a share of only 22% in 1981 is considered
attainable in view of HII's build-up of capacity and capability.
28.       Under the fifth Plan, the estimates of the equipment market are
shown below:

and 4.0 million tons of additional rolling/finishing capacity. Costs
based on earlier plans for 2nd Steel Mill and adjusted POSCO data.
In order to capture a larger market share than shown for 1983, the
Company would have to make additional investments to increase production
capacity.
3.   Power Generation Equipment
29.       The power-generation equipment market resulting from KECO's expan-
sion program, after the Project begins production in 1978, is shown in Table
10 and summarized below. The market is based on existing plans, which only
include plants to be completed within the fourth and fifth Five-Year Plans.
As planning beyond 1986 is undertaken, the market in the period 1983-86
can be expected to be increased further in light of plants scheduled to
be completed in 1987 and beyond. Additionally, equipment sales for replacement
purposes estimated at US$12 million in 1975, which can be expected to increase
significantly as the installed capacity increases would further increase
the power plant equipment market available to HII. This market is the most
important market for HII in view of its continuity and its large size relative
to the other two sectors.

Source: KECO
/1 Machinery Investment and Primary Equipment % are estimated based on the mix
of plants. It is higher in the projections due to inclusion of nuclear
plants.
30.       In the early years, HII plans to concentrate on the thermal plant
market in collaboration with its licensor, General Electric. The companies
are already jointly engaged in presenting plans for Thermal Plants 3 and
4 to KECO and the various ministries. HII has already signed a license
for hydroturbines with Creussot-Loire, for hydro-generators with Alsthom-
Atlantique and the license with General Electric includes the possibility of
nuclear turbines. With experience, the Company plans to move into these
fields. The Company's market position is significantly strengthened through
its relationship with General Electric. Of the full range of boiler, turbine,
generator, condenser and feed-water equipment for this sector, HII only plans
to manufacture the less complex products at startup, reflected in the fact
that in-house manufacture is only 49% of the sales value in 1978 (see Annex
7-1). The projections for sales are considered attainable in light of these
factors.
Chemical/Petrochemical Equipment
31.       The market for this sector comprises mainly fabricated equipment;
reactors; heat exchangers; vessels and tanks; columns and towers; and
process machinery including pumps and compressors. Together these constitute
around 35% of the total investment program in this sector in Korea as shown
below:

HII Market Share                    17%             44%
32.       The low aggregate market share in the 4th Plan period takes into
account the fact that a major portion of the planned investment is scheduled
to take place in 1977-79 and thus would not be available to the Project.
However, there has already been some slippage in implementation, thus improv-
ing market availability to the Project. The market forecast by year is
shown below.

33.       HII's position in this sector is strengthened by the fact of the
significant fabrication-related experience currently available in the Hyundai
Group.  HII itself, supported by its construction affiliate is already engaged
in marketing cement plant overseas. The same approach could prove very
successful in marketing chemical plants abroad in the longer term. However,
as mentioned previously the export potential has not been considered in this
analysis.

F.   Summary
34.       The above discussion on the equipment market and the Company's
sales to it is summarized below. The sales estimates are considered gener-
ally reasonable in view of its position as the sole domestic primary equipment
supplier. The remainder of the market is expected in the near future to
be serviced through imports and for some general items through existing
domestic suppliers.

ANNEX 3-2

G.   Market Issues and Risks
35.       The major issues and risks related to the market for the Project can
be discussed along the following dimensions:
(i) Timing: The Project timing is critical in that it matches
the bulk of the investment planned for the fourth Five-Year
Plan. Any delays in Project implementation could have serious
consequences by effectively eliminating large portions of the
chemical and power sectors and POSCO's fourth expansion. In
this regard HII is partially protected through the availability
of the Gunpo facility, where it could take up the manufacture
of the less complex items before the Project becomes operational;
(ii) Market Acceptance: The manufacturer's reputation and track record
are important in the marketing of the complex systems, that form the
Project's output. Lacking a track record, HII could be faced with
customers who prefer to import their requirements based on past
experiences and relationships. However, it is early successful
entry into the domestic market that would permit HII to build its
reputation. KECO and POSCO are both Government enterprises and will
support the policies favoring domestic procurement but only if they
see it as not adversely affecting their operations. On the positive
side, there could be a significant advantage to these companies to
secure a reliable domestic source of supply of equipment from the
view of after-sales service and replacement parts. Also, HII's
relationship with licensors who are amongst the leading manufacturers
in their areas and the proposal to offer joint licensor-HII perfor-
mance guarantees on early contracts should further lower the risk.
As discussed in Annex 3-3, HII further plans to devote considerable
effort in building up customer relations. On a price basis, the
Project is expected to be fully competitive from the start if
provided an opportunity to compete, despite its lack of experience
in these areas;
(iii) Technological Risk: In view of the complexity of the products,
quality could in itself pose a significant risk. The risk is
planned to be protected against through a comprehensive imple-
mentation of the technology transfer function and a very
gradual upgrading of in-house content. In this regard, HII
plans to develop technically achievable localization targets;
(iv) Market Size: The market size could be adversely affected if
current plans are deferred or the market available to HII could
be curtailed if some projects are financed through tied credits.
As indicated earlier the Project has the flexibility to enter
other markets and in any event would be in a position to manu-
facture under subcontract for other companies. In addition,
the domestic replacement market, subcontracts to licensors
for plants sold in neighboring areas and direct exports provide
an added margin of safety; and



ANNEX 3-2
Page 19
(v)  Financing of Sales:  Another potential risk to the Project is
the availability of financing for its products and the related
preference for imports with associated credit arrangements.
However, financing mechanisms, such as the National Investment
Fund, already exist and the Government plans to strengthen
these to meet the needs of this project and other such
projects.

ANNEX 3-3

KOREA
HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
MARKETING ORGANIIZATION AND STRATEGY
1.        The marketing organization at HII has in the past been directed
towards domestic sales of Gunpo and Anyang products. The marketing respon-
sibility is divided by product group with managers responsible for sales
of automotive parts, construction machinery, heating and cooling equipment,
and castings and forgings, directly reporting to the Senior Director for
marketing. In the recent past, HII added another arm to its marketing
unit by setting up a unit for Project sales to promote sales of plant
equipment to be manufactured at Gunpo and under the Project (Annex 2-2).
In this area, the Company proposes to continue this overlap between existing
operations and the Project, in view of the similar nature of the marketing
function for sales of plant equipment to different industries.
A.   Development of Proposed Organization
2.        The Project sales department at HII currently comprises around 40
staff (9 overseas) drawing additional support from the technical and opera-
tional staff of the Company, as necessary. The staff report to four managers:
(i) Manager of Power Plant Sales: Responsible for coordinating
with General Electric (USA) in submitting joint bids where
HII would contribute the required local content, presently
through Gunpo operations. The manager is also responsible
for the early development of the steel mill machinery
market;
(ii) Manager of Chemical Plant Sales: Responsible for promoting
and advertising the Company's future production capabilities
in this area and ensuring HII involvement at the inception
stage of chemical projects;
(iii) Managers of Textile and Paper and Pulp Plants: Responsible
for domestic sales of these plants proposed for manufacture
beginning in 1977. In these areas, the Company has been
actively negotiating orders for construction of plants
between 1977 and 1979; and
(iv) Manager of Cement Plant and Export Sales responsible for
cement plant sales to the domestic and export markets and
also for exports of special order forgings, castings and
fabrication products. The two functions have been combined
in view of HII's cement plant marketing being largely
oriented towards exports. The Company carries out the
export function through travel, supported by four overseas
offices in London, San Francisco, Sydney and Tokyo.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 2
3.        As a first step towards building a marketing capability for the
products of the Project, HII proposes to appoint a manager for marketing
steel mill machinery and set up the support function staff for market research
and product pricing and costing. In these areas, the staff will operate
within the framework and policies set by the Policy Committee and provide data
to the Committee as necessary. It is planned to increase the strength of the
Project sales department to around 100 by the end of .977 and to over 200 by
1980 in order to fully support the operational capacity build-up of the
Project. The staff will include a number of sales engineers, who in colla-
boration with the technical staff, would not only assist in assessing customer
requirements but also assure adequate aftersales service. The custom and
jobbing sales, unless directly related to plant equipment, will be handled
through the manager for sales of forgings and castings for existing opertions.
The staff in that function too will be significantly expanded. Over time, the
Company plans to apppoint additional managers exclusively for ancillary and
jobbing sales.
B.   Marketing Strategy
4.        The Company's approach to marketing the products proposed for
manufacture under the proposed Project emphasizes two aspects:
(i) Close contact with the Government agencies, such as the
Economic Planning Board, Ministry of Commerce and Industry
and the Korea Society for Advancement of Machinery Industry,
responsible for Government approval at different stages and
for establishing localization plans and import regulations;
and
(ii) Continuous information exchange with Project Sponsors, Pohang
Steel Company, Korea Electric Company and a number of companies
in the chemical area to advertise HII's capabilities, to ensure
prequalification and to promote market acceptance by being
involved from the earliest stages. Through this approach,
the Company plans to incorporate the needs of its major
customers in its own process of product selection.
5.        In regard to contact with Government agencies, the marketing
staff propose to be involved at the earliest stage when projects are
identified by the Economic Planning Board in the development plans for
the country. From these onward HII will be involved through the stages
of project design, and approval, providing design information and
information to assist the Government agencies in establishing local
content requirements based on local manufacturing capabilities, and
strengthening local capabilities. In addition, the Company is already
working with the relevant agencies on issues such as standardization
of processes, capacities and designs for plants in Korea especially in
relation to the power generating industry.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 3
6.        Another issue proposed for discussion is the availability of
adequate domestic sales financing arrangements through mechanisms such
as the National Investment Fund to ensure local competitiveness with
credit terms offered with imports. Availability of financing presents
a major potential risk to the success of the Project as discussed in
Annex 3-2. The allocation of the National Investment Fund to the Machinery
Industry in 1976 amounted to around US$70 million. It would need to be
expanded significantly in order to provide basic support to the machinery
industry and also support sales of domestically manufactured capital goods.
7.        In relation to the exchange with project sponsors, the Company
plans visits for their staff to HII's Gunpo operation and offers an orienta-
tion to the capabilities of the entire Hyundai Group. The Company plans to
be responsive to the needs of its major customers by seeking their inputs in
the negotiation of future licenses. Where projects are identified without
sponsors, such as for some chemical plants, the Company proposes to work on
preliminary design of the plant and market a turnkey proposal to potential
sponsors.
8.        The major risk to market acceptance is based on the perceived
technical capability of HII in view of the nature of the product, the
importance of overall system and component reliability and the fact that
HII lacks a proven track record. The Company proposes to counter this
risk by relying heavily on its licensors in the early years of operation.
The Company plans to bid its first few contracts jointly with its licensors,
both parties providing a shared performance guarantee. The Company plans
to gradually build up the local content in such bids in consultation with
licensors, in line with its own capability and the establishment of its
reputation as a reliable supplier in the market.
C.   Pricing Policy and Terms
9.        The Company has not yet developed a comprehensive pricing policy.
Generally, HII plans to establish its prices in line with existing price
of imports, based on information gathered from the past experience of its
major customers. The market for the Company's products and its own sales
(Annex 3-2) has been derived on this basis. It should be noted that the
past experience relates to the most competitive bids received for earlier
purchases and prices derived on that basis, adjusted for inflation to the
relevant year, should assure HII's competitiveness. Further details are
provided in Annex 7-1.
10.       Imports of such capital goods are not currently subject to any
tariffs and HII's pricing policy therefore does not assume any tariff
protection against imports, though some procedural protection might well be
available as the Company establishes itself as a quality manufacturer. Under
such procedures, buyers of products that HII is capable of manufacturing
domestically, would be asked to consider domestic purchase, and imports
would be permitted only against strong justification.

11.       The relationship of cost to the above prices is more difficult to
assess at this time on a product by product basis given the diversity of
products. But for the early years of operation, with limited sales and an
extremely high content of bought-out parts, it is expected that the low labor
cost of the Company would assure adequate coverage of costs. Current estimates
on an aggregate basis fully support this conclusion.
12.       HII plans to sell its primary products on terms comparable to those
used worldwide for sale of such goods. The Company would receive 10% of
sales value as an advance with the order to support engineering work, a total
of 70% in progress payments spread over the period of manufacture and 10%
on receipt of shipment by the customer. The remaining 10% would be paid
on performance of acceptance tests, serving as a performance guarantee.
D.   Export Potential
13.       The discussion above largely relates to the domestic market, which
would be the focus of HII's efforts in the first few years of the Project.
The Company recognizes the limitations to its export potential in these
early years and these have not been included in assessing the viability of
the Project. However, the Company proposes to make an early start in export
marketing capitalizing on the overseas position of its affiliate (the Construc-
tion Company), subcontracting requirements of its licensors and the fact that
it already devotes resources to overseas marketing of castings and forgings
and cement plants. The Company plans to base early exports on joint bids with
licensors, an approach it is following currently in marketing cement plants
(with Fuller Company of USA). The proposed early start should assist entry
into export markets when HII is ready to do so on the basis of an established
reputation in Korea.

KOREA
HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A.   General Objective
1.        The Government of Korea has planned for a strong and sustained
growth in the fourth and fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plans in the
industrial sector, particularly in the field of steel production, electric
power generation and chemical and petrochemical industry. The Government's
strategy is to develop the heavy machinery sector to meet the growing demand
for plant and equipment. As such, the Government has given a high priority
to the development of the heavy machine-building sector in its development
plan and has selected Hyundai International Inc. (HII) to implement a key
project in this sector. The Government is providing a wide range of support
for the implementation of such a project.
2.        Within this overall framework and consistent with the economic
development plans of the country, HII prepared the project and it was
reviewed by Ingersoll Manufacturing Consultants (IMC) of the U.S.A. The
project will be the first of its kind and magnitude in Korea. Although
basic project parameters have been finalized, the details are still being
worked out with the help of experienced foreign consultants and licensors.
The project is proposed to be located at Changwon on the southeast coast
of the Korean Peninsula, close to the Changwon Industrial complex (See
Map IBRD 12644). The selection of this project site is consistent with the
Government's desire to develop Changwon as an excellent industrial center
with a heavy machinery base. The plant is well situated, with respect to
raw materials and component supply, availability of infrastructure and
labor, market and future prospects for exports of machinery and plants.
B.   Overall Concept
3.        The Project is primarily designed to manufacture most of the
equipment required for steel plants, power generating plants and chemical
and petrochemical plants, with sufficient flexibility to produce products
with some or all of the following characteristics:
a)   large custom-built equipmemt, in line with users'
requirements and specifications;
b)   extra large dimensions and/or heavy weights;
c)   operation at very high temperatures and pressures;
d)   rotation at high centrifugal speeds;



ANNEX 4-1
Page 2
e)   equipment requiring extra-thick materials and
involving high strength properties;
f)   high accuracy with very close tolerance levels; and
g)   rigid quality assurance standards at all stages of
manufacture, assembly and testing.
4.        The facilities under the Project will be highly flexible, versatile
and capable of producing a wide range of heavy industrial equipment and mach-
inery. The design of the plant recognizes that each of the major products is
technically complex requiring a high degree of engineering work, manufacturing
skills and significant expertise in assembly and testing. Moreover, each
product has to function, with high reliability, as a part of a system in an
industrial plant or in a power plant. As a manufacturer of such equipment,
HII will, therefore, be regarded as being responsible for efficient function-
ing of the whole system. In addition to major equipment manufacture, the
project is also designed to undertake minor jobbing works to balance the
cyclic load inherent in a project of this type.
5.        The production capacity of the project is based on the following:
(i)  1,000 MW of power plant each year;
(ii)  one steel plant with 3.0 million tons output every three years;
(iii)  a complete array of equipment required for a chemical and
petrochemical plant; and
(iv)  some fabricated items, forging and castings to achieve maximum
capacity utilization.
These products require a wide variety of equipment and machinery and the
project is expected to achieve an annual output of 100,000 TPY at its
steady state to be reached in 1983.
6.        In the design of the project, due consideration has been given to
factors such as planned product mix at the steady state based on market
requirements, specific product and technology requirements, desirable import
substitution levels, the optimal trade-off between the use of labor and
equipment, local availability of materials and components, site conditions,
efficient material flow for products and future potential expansion require-
ments, in developing basic parameters for the following areas:
a)   process selection and equipment requirements,
b)   space allocation and plant layout,
c)   manpower requirements, and
d)   technology requirements (licenses)



A1iNEX 4-1
Page 3
7.        The initial equipment requirements and configuration were devel-
oped, based on discussions with major licensors, to meet the needs of indi-
vidual products. This initial configuration was then consolidated to remove
any duplication of under-utilized equipment capacity. Improvements were
then made to achieve higher overall productivity by rationalizing equipment
sizes and types and substituting more appropriate machinery for the proposed
product mix. To increase flexibility to produce various heavy machinery,
without significantly impairing productivity, some additional modifications to
the process and equipment selection were made. Some of the highly specialized
equipment used by high-volume, single-product manufacturers has been replaced
with semi-specialized or general purpose machine tools with special attachments
to increase versatility and to reduce unnecessary investment needs. This would
also allow increased utilization of low cost skilled labor. A size and weight
capability to match a broad base of industrial machinery products has been
included in critical areas of production. Equipment and machinery required
to produce items which are relatively easy to subcontract either within the
Company or to other manufacturers, were eliminated. Specific areas, in this
regard, are light machining, gear making and light fabrication. In order
to reduce project cost, to provide manufacturing load during the start-up
phase and to demonstrate HII's manufacturing capabilities, some equipment,
which is required for the project, was identified as potentially suitable
for manufacture by HII under licenses or manufacturing agreements with rele-
vant equipment suppliers. Detailed plans for these types of equipment are
being presently developed.
8.        Space requirements were established by comparing HII's planned
production volume to existing facilities of licensors for similar annual
through-put and also taking into account the future expansion requirements.
The rationale for the general plant layout and space allocation is given
in Annex 4-2. In developing the manpower requirements for the project the
following factors were considered: local labor productivty; the number
of people required for operation of each machine and for non-machining
operations; and the experience in the facilities of licensors or manu-
facturers of similar products and through-put. Further details are
contained in Annex 4-7. Since the level of technical complexity in most
of the products is high during engineering and manufacturing stages, the
need to establish a broad technology base was given full consideration
in the Project design.
C.   Project Scope
9.        The project consists of the following major facilities:
1.   Foundry and Forge shops;
2.   Fabrication shops;
3.   Machine shops;



ANNEX 4-1
Page 4
4.   Assembly and Test shops;
5.   Support facilities; and
6.   Other auxiliary facilities.
The plant layout, and material flow diagrams for typical products are given
in Annexes 4-2 and 4-4 respectively.
1.   Foundry and Forge Shops
10.       A wide variety of castings and forged parts are required for the
production of machinery envisaged in the project. The weight of each casting
will vary from 200 tons to less than 500 kg per piece. Similarly the weight
of forged parts would also vary between 200 tons to less than 500 kg. Small
castings and forged parts up to 5 tons will be purchased from existing
producers in the country, including HII's Gunpo plant. The maximum weight
and size of castings and forged parts were the main consideration in select-
ing the equipment for this plant. The capability to produce such large
castings and forgings will provide the necessary technology base and flex-
ibility for the manufacture of products involved, and better control of
production cost and delivery. However, this facility will have some surplus
capacity to meet the needs of other industries in the country.
11.       According to the present production program, the largest casting
to be produced would weigh around 200 tons. However, the project has the
capability to produce heavier than 200 ton castings utilizing electro slag
welding techniques, which are well established in plants in the U.S.A,
Western Europe and Japan. The forge shop is planned to produce shafts,
blanks and rings needed in most of the products. The ability to forge
successfully the large shafts, such as turbine rotors, will depend on the
availability of high quality ingots from the foundry. These parts have
stringent metallurgical and quality requirements that are sometimes diffi-
cult to meet even for internationally renowned manufacturers. With appro-
priate know-how and technical assistance, HII will be able to manufacture
increasingly large shafts up to a maximum 200 tons ingot weight.
12.       To ease material handling, the foundry and forge shops are loated
in adjacent buildings. The foundry shop will cover an area of 35,500 m
(275 m x 80 m and 300 m x 45 m) with two 20 m bays, one 25 m bay and one 30 m
bay. The highest and lowest distance under the crane hook will be 16 m and
21 m respectively. The forge shop will occupy an area of 30,000 m (300 x
100 m) with one 15 m bay, two 25 m bays and one 35 m bay. The maximum
distance under the crane hook will be 25 m. Sufficient lifting capacity (a
maximum of 250 tons) has been included in both shops and the two shops will
be linked by rails to facilitate transfer of work-pieces. The elevation of
these shops will be 8 m above mean sea level. They have been located in the
northeast corner of the site, in view of prevailing wind direction, to avoid
pollution from dust and fumes. The shops additionally include necessary
pollution control devices such as electrostatic precipitators, "bag filters"
for fumes, and dust-collection systems.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 5
13.       The foundry shop will have the following equipment:  one 100-ton
arc furnace, one 100-ton holding furnace, one 20-ton arc furnace, one degassing
facility a number of ingot mold and ingot mold cars with capacities varying
from 10 to 200 tons, sand preparation plant including necessary conveyer
systems, and necessary auxiliary facilities. The melting capacity of the
foundry on a 300-day working year will be about 110,000 tons per year. The
maximum pouring capacity of this foundry will be about 240 tons. The casting
areas for the small and large castings will be separate: the large casting
pit will be 40 m long, 6 m wide and 2.5 m deep with provisions for partitioning.
Molding sand for both these casting areas will be fed by a continuous mixer
through a conveyer system from the sand preparation plant. This shop will be
constructed in two stages. The 20-ton arc furnace and most other facilities
will be completed in the first stage. By utilizing these facilities HII,
under manufacturing or licensing agreements, will construct in the second
stage the 100-ton arc furnace, 100-ton holding furnace, some ingot mold
cars and ladles. This knocked down kit approach for stage two, whereby HII
will obtain the essential components and drawings from the suppliers, is
considered appropriate for this project and will reduce the investment
requirements.
14.       The forge shop will include the following equipment: one 3,000-ton
hydraulic press, one 8,000-ton hydraulic press, two manipulators (50-ton and
200-ton), ring rollers, and vertical heating furnace. Like the foundry shop,
this will also be implemented in two stages: (i) the small hydraulic press
(3,000 ton) and associated manipulator (50-ton) and other supporting facilities
will be implemented in the first stage and (ii) the large hydraulic press
(8,000-ton) including its manipulator (200-ton) in the second. Assuming an
average ingot weight of 100 tons and six-hour working period per piece, the
capacity of the forge shop will be about 24,000 tons per year.
15.       The foundry and forge shops will also include other supporting
facilities such as heat treatment facilities, soaking pits, fettling equip-
ment, shot blast equipment and necessary equipment for testing and quality
control. These shops are very large even by international standards, and
have ample capacity to support the proposed product mix.
2.   Fabrication Shops
16.       In order to improve operational efficiency, the fabrication
functions will be located in two separate buildings one for flat steel
fabrication and another for non-flat steel fabriiation. The flat steel
fabrication shop will occupy an area of 35,000 m (250 m long and 140 m
wide) at a mean elevation of 5.5 m above M.S.L.   This plant is capable of
producing very high-capacity and high pressure vessels and boilers. This
shop will have one 50 m bay, and three 30 m bays and is capable of processing
steel plates of up to 250 mm thickness and products weighing uE to 240 tons.
The non-flat steel fabrication shop will have an area 20,000 m (200 m long
and 100 m wide) and will be divided into five 20 m bays. This shop is



ANNEX 4-1
Page 6
designed to fabricate tubular components and pipe wastes. One transfer bay,
mainly for preparation and transport of raw materials into the fabrication
areas, is also included in both the fabrication shops. Adequate lifting
capacity is also planned in both the shops.
17.       The equipment in the fabrication shops consists of one hot roll
bender for plate up to 160 mm thickness and another for up to 25 mm, one
8,000 ton hydraulic press, one 600-ton straightening press, shears, press
brakes, power rollers, horizontal boring bar, radial drills, various types
of welding equipment including submerged arc, electro slag, MIG and TIG
welding equipment, necessary cutting equipment including plasma arc cutting
torch, tube benders, pipe benders, manipulators, rotary positions of dif-
ferent capacities, weld tables, burning tables, necessary supporting facil-
ities and machine tools and all the required testing and quality control
equipment such as portable magna-flux testers, fluoroscope machines, ultra-
sonic testers, X-ray equipment and pressure test equipment. These shops are
capable of producing most of the heavy fabricated vessels and equipment. Some
of the equipment such as two roller benders, three press brakes, positioners
and miscellaneous tables will be manufactured by HII under the knock-down kit
approach.
18.       The Hyundai Group has considerable knowledge in the fabrication
area, primarily acquired through its ship building facilities. However, the
fabrication requirements of the project are much more complex because of the
nature of the materials and products (high strength and heavy materials and
very close tolerance requirements) and the fabrication techniques involved.
Some of the welding and cutting techniques will be new to the country. Since
the manufacturing technology involved in fabrication is an extension of that
already existing within Hyundai Group, HII is expected to have a comparatively
fast learning curve in the fabrication area. A portion of the fabrication
shop will be one of the first facilities to be completed, since it will be
used for fabrications needed for the Project.
3.   Machine Shops
19.       The machine shop, which requires the highest investment in produc-
tion equipment, will signify the largest advance in technology. The machine
shops are divided into two categories; heavy machine shop and light machine
shop. While the inputs used in the heavy machine shop will be heavy castings,
forging and fabricated products, the light machine shop will consume various
types of bar stocks to produce light parts for final assembly and jigs and
fixtures for the heavy machine shop. The machinery requirement in the light
machine shop is kept to the bare minimum, taking into account the fact that
light machining capabilities are already available in the country. The
heavy machine shop is the most important facility in the Project and the
success of the Project will greatly depend on its efficient operation.
Therefore, final details of this shop have been developed with the assistance
of experienced consultants.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 7
20.       To minimize the cross flow and material handling requirements, the
heavy machine shop and the assembly shop will be in one building (380 m long
and 140 m wide), and the light machine shop will be adjacent to the heavy
machine shop. The areas of the heavy and light machine shops are as follows:
Heavy machine shop - 35,700 m2 (2 bays of 40 m and 2 bays
of 30 m, all of 255 m long)
Light machine shop - 15,000 m  (3 bays of 20 m and 250 m long)
Both the shops have appropriate lifting capacity for materials handling.
The maximum lifting capacity in the heavy machine shop is about 300 tons
(utilizing one 50-ton crane and one 250-ton crane included in this shop).
21.       The components to be manufactured in the heavy machine shop fall
into two major categories.
- cubic parts (rolling mill stands, turbine casing, etc.)
- cylindrcial parts (rotors, rolls, etc.)
The basic manufacturing route for cubic parts is through surfacing, rough
boring, drilling and finish boring; for cylindrical part the route is hori-
zontal turning, flat surfacing and drilling, and grinding. The size and
weight of the parts involved dictate the primary manufacturing flow within
each bay and the type of machine to be utilized. The machine tools included
in the project are sufficient to meet the size and capacity for the planned
products. The light machine shop will contain a wide range of smaller general
purpose machine tools and some special equipment to provide a capability to
machine turbine blades. A substantial volume of small part machining will be
subcontracted or manufactured at Gunpo Plant.
22.       Although the basic equipment and machine tools required for both
heavy and light machine shops have been developed, this list will be reviewed
further by the Company with the help of qualified consultants. The machine
tools, including heavy ones, included in the heavy and lighter machine shop
will total about 130 and comprise the following major equipment:



ANNEX 4-1

Total    Heavy    Light
(i)  adjustable rail-milling machines                5        5          -
(maximum size: table 6.25 x (2) 10 m)
(ii)  Horizontal Boring Mtachines                    14       12          2
(maximum size: 200 cm diameter raw)
(iii)  Vertical Boring Machines                       15        9          6
(maximum size: 8.5 m table/ 12 m swing)
(iv)  Horizontal Turning Machines                    16        7          9
(includes N/C machines: Maximum size:
3.6 m diameter x 12 m)
(v)  Drilling Machines                              23        5         18
(maximum size: 100 m spindle, 3 m x 4 m
travel)
(vi)  Grinding machines, including one N/C            6        2          4
(maximum size: 2.5 m diameter x 18 m)
(vii)  Gear making machines                            2        -          2
(viii)  Blade making machines                          14        -         14
(ix)  Miscellaneous small machine tools,             35        -         35
including slotters, shapers, threaders,
key scaters, etc.
Total number of machine tools (about) 130         40         90
23.       The maximum size of milling, boring, turning and grinding machines
included in the Project will allow HII to manufacture the largest size of
equipment required under the production plan. Moreover, since most of these
machine tools are semi-specialized or general purpose machines, this shop
has sufficient flexibility in the production of various types of equipment.
Although some machines are provided for the manufacture of large turbine
blades for many of the stages in the high-pressure cylinder and medium-
pressure cylinder, where the manufacturing process is not too complicated),
HII will enter into this area only very gradually. The blades required for
the low-pressure stages will be the most complicated area and the mastery of
this technology will require more time. Therefore, these items will be
imported and hence machine tools required for these are not included in the
project. In addition to the machine tools, the heavy machine shops will also
have necessary heat treatment, storage, and handling facilities. On the
whole, the equipment selection and space allowed in the machine shops are
considered adequate.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 9
4.   Assembly and Test Shop
24.       The products to be assembled in this shop will require very large,
heavy and complex equipment. So, to minimize material handling of intricate
and heavy pieces, the assembly shop and the heavy machine shop will be
under one roof, with sufficient provisions for overhead cranes to cover
both the shops without difficulty. Since the machinery and equipment to
be assembled are very large, a great amount of space is required in the
assembly plant. The assembly plant will have an area of 17,500 m , with
two 40 m bays and two 30 m bays -- extension of the heavy machine shop bays.
Most of the equipment required in this facility is selected on the basis of
easy maneuverability for assembly and test purposes of various heavy products.
Therefore, the fixed facilities in this shop will be kept to a minimum to
ensure the flexibility needed to match a constantly changing work load.
However, among the products, the steam turbine and generator require certain
special facilities, which are included in this shop. The 40 m bay, where the
largest pieces will be assembled, will have one 400-ton overhead crane, and
the other bays will have necessary lifting capacity to handle the planned
production.
25.       The major equipment in this shop will include the following:
precision balancing facility, erection platforms, winding and assembly
equipment for generators, baking ovens, shrinking ovens, transposition
tables, brazing equipment, necessary quality control and testing equipment
and appropriate jigs and fixtures. Since most of the items, with the
exception of precision balancing facility and testing and quality control
facilities, are required only at the end of the Project implementation and
can be produced in other facilities of the Project, HII will adopt the
knock-down kit approach for fabricating and installing these facilities.
5.   Support Facilitie
26.       The support facilities, most of which will be located between the
two fabrication shops will consist of the following: large heat treatment
facility, grit blast and painting facilities, X-ray facilities, maintenance
shop, central tool room and materials handling. The heat treatment facility
will have a large stress relief furnace capable of accommodating large cast-
ings, forgings and fabricated products. The grit blasting and painting shop
will also include facilities for accommodating large sub-assemblies and
final fabricated products. Necessary pollution control equipment is included
in the heat treatment, grit blast chamber, and painting shop. The centralized
X-ray testing equipment will be located in a fully covered concrete building.
The maintenance facilities will contain small machine tools required for the
repair work of tooling, production equipment and buildings. The central tool
room will consist of about 30 small machine tools, such as lathes, milling
machines, jig borers, shapers, tool grinders and tool cutters.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 10
27.       As mentioned earlier, the material flow has been one of the primary
factors considered in developing the proximity requirements for the different
manufacturing activities. Intra-building movement of heavy parts, to the ex-
tent feasible, is planned to be through individual bays using overhead
cranes. Where cross bay movement is required, transfer cars will be utilized
for materials handling. Single-log gantry or jib cranes will handle material
movement within localized areas. The flow of components and parts will be
transported by fork-lift trucks. Intra-building movement of major heavy
parts, which will be kept to a minimum, will be accomplished using multi-wheel
load spreading vehicles. Some rail-mounted transport facilities will also be
available for the transport of large items to and from the common facilities
of heat treatment, X-ray test, grit blast and paint. The project includes
necessary materials handling equipment, including a 450-ton multi-
wheel loader and a 150-ton rail car.
6.   Other Auxiliary Facilities
28.       Electricity:  The three phase electrical power, at a voltage of
154 KV and at a frequency of 60 Hz, will be transmitted to the sub-station
at the plant through two 154 KV incoming circuit breakers each with power
metering equipment. The transformer station will have four 40 MVA trans-
formers to meet up to a maximum demand of 156/160 MVA, which is more than
adequate for the proposed facilities. The distribution network within the
plant will have two HV networks at 22.9 KV and 6.6 KV and one LV at 400 -
440 volts. (Refer to Chart 1 of Annex 4-8 for further details.) Power
factor correction will be applied to the distribution network, which will
be carried out completely by underground cables. At the location of large
loads, where significant savings in distribution cabling is possible,
individual correction will be applied.
29.       Water, Steam, Compressed Air, and Fuel Oil:  Total water require-
ments of the project will be about 5,000 m /day, of which 60% would be for
industrial use. This is based on the provision that a recirculation system
for the foundry shop will be established and a separate system for fire
fighting facilities will be available. Two water storage tanks, necessary
distribution network and disposal system, including a waste water treatment
plant, are included in the project. Since major production facilities are
located in different buildings and the requirements vary among shops, a
central steam generation and a compressed air station are not considered
appropriate for the project. Each facility, based on its needs, will have
its own means for providing steam and compressed air. At steady state,
the Projict would require about 2,000 tony of steam per day and about
15,000 m /hr of compressed air at 7 kg/cm . The fuel oil (Bunker-c oil)
required for the Project, primarily for steam boilders and heat treatment
facilities, woudl be about 300,000 M/T per year. Necessary facilities to
meet this requirement have been incorporated into the Project.
30.       Argon. Oxygen. CoO and Acetylene:  Facilities necessary to produce
these gases are not part of this project. Adequate storage facilities, however,



ANNEX 4-1
Page 11
have been provided for sustained production at a steady state. All these gases
are required for welding and cutting funct ons. At steady sSate the totai
need per day would be about:  Argon, 110 m ; oxygen, 2,250 m ; C02, 220 m
acetylene, 200 m .
31.       Warehouse Facilities:  In addition to the storage areas provided in
each major facility, centralized warehouse facilities are also included in
the Project.  The main warehouse, where most of the bought-out party, spare
parts and other items will be stored, will cover an area of 8,400 m (120 m
long and 70 m wide with one 30 m and two 20 m bays). This facility is quite
adequate for the purposes of the Project. An independent underground storage
facility, away from the plant, is also available for in5lammable products like
paints, varnishes, etc. An open area of nearly 7,000 m , with gravel floor and
necessary gradient for drawing off water will also be provided for steel
and bar stock storage. The scrap and sand storage area will be close to
the foundry melting area.
32.       Training School and Laboratories:  A training school to train
technicians and machinists will be included in the Project. Since training
of workers should start before the completion of the project, this facility
will be completed by the end of 1977. A central laboratory consisting of
testing equipment for raw materials and components, metallurgical and
metrology testing facilities, X-ray equipment and other relevant equipment
will also be a part of the project.
33.       Administrative and Other Buildings:2 An eight-story administrative
building (with a total floor area of 20,000 m ) living quarters for expatriate
technicians and for some local workers, a guest house, dining facilities,
dispensary and recreational facilities are also planned.

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
PLANT LAYOUT
1.        The selected site encompasses 3.24 km of a5ea on the south eastern
coast of the Korean peninsula. Of this area 0.54 km is to be reclaimed from
the sea, which is on average 6 meters deep in the region to be filled. The
area experiences moderate climatic and tidal conditions throughout the year.
The site is part of the Changwon Machinery Complex and lies on the coastal
belt set aside for industrial development and removed from tourist areas.
The occupant enterprises in the complex are expected to be the dominant
source of raw materials and components for the Project. In addition the
site has access to other inland areas through a well-connected highway system.
The planned availability of deep-water harbor facilities close to the site
would further facilitate transportation of materials and end-products as a
number of the Project's consumer induitries are also located on the same
coastal belt. The site area (3.24 km ) provides adequately for future expan-
sion as only 0.26 km of area is currently taken up by the planned facilities.
2.        Various ground investigations have been utilized to assess the nature
and magnitude of the geological problems likely to be encountered. A seismic
survey carried out by the College of Engineering of Seoul National University
reveals that only normal design factors are required for design since the
area is not in any earthquake zone. Standard Penetration Tests undertaken
by HII indicate a steady increase of strength with depth. Over the area of
site a grid of 24 boreholes were drilled, which varied considerably in depth
depending on the depth to weathered rock at each location. In general, hard
rock was proven to a depth of about 3 m. However, geotechnical information
available suggests that careful engineering attention should be given to the
development of the site and the Company is taking necessary measures to
achieve proper ground conditions.
3.        The plant layout was developed by HII in consultation with its
technical consultants. Thereafter it was modified following discussions with
the Bank. The layout will be finalized following in-depth review by the
Company, its main licensors and its consultants. The present, general plant
layout, shown in Chart 1, is based on the following considerations:
Space Requirements for each activity: Based on the space require-
ments, block dimensions for each of the shops were developed to ensure ade-
quate flexibility in installation of equipment, for the insertion and support
of large workpieces and efficient operator functioning.



ANNEX 4-2
Page 2
Proximity for material flow: In view of the large amounts of
material moving through the plant, material flow considerations were used
to develop the relationships between facilities. The heavy machine shop
was combined with the assembly shop to ensure proximity and the other facil-
ities were placed around this combination resulting in a matrix-type flow.
Supporting Service Relationships: Supporting services were placed
in relation to the primary facilities that would use them. The open stock
areas were positioned adjacent to the fabrication shop and the forge and
foundry where most production would be initiated. Administration and
accommodation areas have been planned away from the plant along with the
recreation and medical care areas.
Investment Cost Optimization: While preserving the basic relation-
ships, site-utilization by the various blocks took into account the natural
conditions of the site. The piling requirements and costs vary significantly
along the site ranging from zero at the base of the hills to around US$20
per square meter in the reclaimed areas. Accordingly the heavier facilities,
the forge and foundry and the heavy machine and assembly shops were positioned
on firmer soil to reduce piling and foundation costs.
Wind Direction: The forge and foundry shops were placed at the
edge of the site to take account of prevailing winds which generally flow in
a northerly direction and with this position, would carry any residual fumes
away from the remainder of the plant and residential area.
Control and Future Potential: The block-concept with separate
blocks as against one or two massive structures will facilitate control of
production activities. In addition, it permits the provision of adequate
space around and adjacent to the blocks for systematic future expansion.
Organization by functional blocks is considered appropriate for the pro-
duction volumes proposed in the Project.
4.        Conclusion:  The layout of machinery and equipment within each
facility is being finalized. Both plant site and general plant layout are
considered appropriate and satisfactory for the operation of the plant.

KOREA
HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
TECHNOLOGY
A.   Introduction
1.        The products planned for manufacture under the Project are primarily
technology and material intensive. The products represent a technology, both
product and manufacturing, largely new to Korea. The products generally form
parts of whole systems such as power-generation and steel-making systems,
wherein overall reliability and built-in quality assurance is a critical
consideration. Successful manufacture of these products would represent an
upgrading of the Korean technological base into precision heavy manufacturing
specially in forge, foundry and heavy machining activities. The products also
utilize currently available technologies especially in the manufacture of
small-dimension parts and components. For these, the Project would rely on
existing facilities in the Changwon Complex and elsewhere in Korea. This
factor has been incorporated in the design of the Project.
2.        The Project involves a high level of technology transfer to be
carried out under a number of licensing agreements with international manu-
facturers. Its successful implementation is dependent not only on suitable
licensing agreements but also on adequate transfer of operating know-how and
the availability of the required skills within HII. This can be accomplished
through licensor contact, licensor and company training and the use of
experienced expatriate personnel, where necessary.
B.   Licensing Agreements
3.        The requirements imposed on HII in the process of seeking licenses
are unique for the following reasons:
(i) The level of technical complexity in most of the products is
high at both engineering and manufacturing stages;
(ii) A number of different products and technologies are involved.
HII plans to conclude nine major licenses and more than thirty
licenses for auxiliary products;
(iii) All the licenses will be operative under one roof, many of them
simultaneously, with common facilities being used for each
while each licensor will have his own specialized engineering
and manufacturing approach; and
(iv) It may not be possible to evolve licenses under similar terms
in view of the licensors' varying origin, experience and
background.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 2
4.        HII currently operates a number of international licenses for
small and medium-sized products at its Gunpo and Anyang plants (see Annex 2-5).
HII is in the process of negotiating agreements for products planned for
manufacture under the Project and has so far concluded seven licenses for its
primary products, selecting licensors, who are amongst the leaders in their
fields.
Product                        Licensor                   Term
(i)  Steel mill equipment:
Rolling Mills 1/              Wean United (USA)             10 years
Iron and steel-making         Krupp (Germany)                5 years
(ii)  Power-generation equipment:

(iii) Chemical/Petrochemical
equipment:
Fabricated equipment          Mitsubishi (Japan)             4 years
1/   Manufacturing Association Agreement
Licenses in Korea are generally granted for a term of 3 years; longer terms
require detailed justification by the licensee. In light of the nature
of the equipment, HII has been granted approval for longer terms especially
on its licenses with General Electric and Combustion Engineering and agreement
with Wean United. The other two licenses provide for further extension upon
Government approval. The Company has also agreed with other international
corporations for other products to be manufactured in order to level capacity
utilization in the wake of the cyclical production requirements for the
primary products. These secondary products include mining and pollution-control
equipment. In addition HIT is seeking to supplement these existing agreements
with a number of others to cover the full range of products comprising the
primary systems. For a review of the current status of HII's efforts see
Table 1.
1.   Transfer of Technology
5.        Under the large number of license agreements, the transfer of
technology aspect will cover the transmittal of existing documents, design
data, manufacturing drawings, process sheets and parts and materials lists
in accordance with the licensors' practices. In each case HII would be
required to adapt the information to,-its own system and environment. For
this purpose, the Company plans to establish within its technical organiza-
tion (see Chart 1), a competent Engineering Cell. A flexible general design



ANNEX 4-3
Page 3
capability is planned, constituting an engineering manpower resource. Over
this general capability design specialists will be required for each major
product group. The number of groups (shown as 'A' and 'B' in Chart 1) would
depend on the number of product-groups manufactured. Each would be the
responsibility of a Product Design Manager, specializing and concentrating
on his specific product group, who would draw resources from the engineering
cell, as necessary. Also responsible to the Director of Engineering would
be the Manager of Standards and Services, responsible for maintaining, and
integrating where possible, the multiple engineering standards used by the
licensors. He would also ensure that bought-out components conform to the
required standards.
6.   Director of Technology Transfer:  In view of the complexities
involved in the transfer process, HII plans to establish a special position,
titled the Director of Technology Transfer, reporting directly to the
Executive Director for the Project (Chart 1). He would be responsible for
managing the interface between the Company and existing and potential
licensors. The interface with licensors can be divided ito three general
categories:
(i) Evaluation of market requirements to identify potential
products and negotiation of suitable agreements for
these products;
(ii)  Joint HII and licensor sales activities; and
(iii)  Licensor assistance in implementation of a manufacturing
capability as well as of specific contract orders.
These will involve HII staff from most departments and will occur in Korea
and at licensor plants. The Director of Technology Transfer will be respon-
sible for coordinating these interactions. The latter two categories are
especially important as these relate to a critical aspect of HII's strategy.
In order to ensure acceptance of the market, HII plans to bid its initial
contracts with the licensors, with a joint performance-guarantee. As its
products gain acceptance and the Company establishes a reputation for
reliability, it will undertake total manufacture and performance guarantees
on its own.
7.        In these interactions, the Director of Technology Transfer will play
a key role. His responsibilities will extend to the early stages of each
license:
(i) Identifying with the potential licensors, the appropriate
products and technologies in line with the requirements of HII's
major customers;
(ii) Developing and negotiating the details of the agreements to
provide for the required flow of technology, assistance and
training; and



ANNEX 4-3
Page 4
(iii) Coordinating the flow of information and personnel between HII
and licensor facilities to ensure implementation of the
technology.
In the later stages, the responsibility for continuing functions would shift
to other HII directors. The functions outlined above are crucial to the
success of the Project and HII's approach is considered suitable.
2.   Training
8.        The license agreements also provide, to a varying degree, for
the training of HII staff at the licensors' facilities. HII plans to fully
explore the training opportunities provided by the licenses and extend them,
if required. The Company plans to adopt a three-fold approach to the over-
seas training of its staff at licensor and equipment-supplier facilities
(for details see Annex 4-7):
(i) Product-oriented programs to give in-depth product experience
and a broad understanding of the total manufacturing functions
within each licensor, for its engineering staff;
(ii) Manufacturing and specialized activity programs to give in-depth
experience relating to the manufacturing techniques and related
activities used in the licensor plants on a multi-product basis for
managers, engineers, supervisors and key operators; and
(iii) Operating activity programs at the facilities of suppliers
of key equipment for in-depth experience in operating key items
of machinery.
C.   Technical Assistance
9.        All licensing agreements would cover technical assistance to HII
from the licensor and such assistance is considered to be adequate in the
areas of Machining, Assembly and Fabrication. Though a measure of assistance
would be available in relation to the Forge and Foundry operations, the
licensors such as General Electric have traditionally purchased their require-
ments of castings and forgings and would not be able to provide the appropriate
exposure. In view of this fact HII would be required to essentially directly
transfer operating know-how for these facilities which in turn would be
linked to facility selection and layout. The Company has accordingly selected
Terni (Italy), an experienced operating company and signed a consulting and
technical assistance agreement for the provision of assistance in detailed
engineering, implementation and operation of the foundry and forge shops in
the early years.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 5
D.   Expatriate Requirements
10.       The Company recognizes the importance of experienced staff in the
initial stages of the Project and porposes to recruit expatriate staff to
fill this need. Korean staff would be assigned as counterparts and the
expatriates retained till the counterparts are able to take over their
responsibilities which would include:
(i) Multi-product operation management; and
(ii) Product and manufacturing technology transfer.
The key expatriate appointee will be the Director of Engineering, supported by
a counterpart who would take over his responsibilities after a fixed period of
time. It is proposed to locate a person with a proven senior management track
record in a multi-product/heavy engineering business, as early as possible so
that he can contribute in preparing for the start-up of operations.
11.       It is proposed that experienced expatriate staff, from the licensors'
staff (if suitable arrangements can be worked out) or from similar facilities
be appointed in line functions for the key product-groups. Their terms would
last at least until the first major contracts in these groups are successfully
executed, and the Korean counterparts are fully conversant with the require-
ments. Other appointments would include staff to undertake dual responsibility
with Korean management for the positions of Director of Engineering, Machine-
shop manager, Foundry and Forge Manager, Manager of Manufacturing Engineering
and Forge Master. The Company plans to recruit at least 10 expatriate manage-
ment-level staff and funds for this purpose have been included in the Project.
In addition, it is anticipated that some staff at the operator and foreman
levels providing assistance and training by example would be required. This
matter is to be reviewed further in the detailed planning stage.
E.   Benefits to Suppliers
12.       Under the Project, HII would acquire substantial experience in
the area of licensing and technology transfer. The Company plans to make
this experience available to its suppliers and other producers. The Project
would require a number of light and medium parts and components requiring
sophisticated production techniques and new technologies. Project design
excludes capacity in these areas. HII would offer seminars for interested
producers to make them aware of the possibilities for supplying parts and
components to the Project. It would indicate to these smaller manufacturers,
suitable products for licensing for use in its own operation and otherwise in
the Korean context. Thereafter it would assist these companies in selecting
licensors and guide them in negotiating suitable arrangements. In addition,
HII proposes to train operators of its suppliers on a cost basis to upgrade
their manufacturing skills and product quality.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 6
F.   Conclusion
13.       HII has already entered into a substantial number of licensing
agreements for its existing operations at Gunpo and Anyang (see Annex 2-5)
and has been able to operate them successfully. Though this experience is
useful, the complexity of the products currently planned is far greater than
that of existing operations. The scale of operations as well as HII's respon-
sibility for overall product-reliability will also be far larger than for
products manufactured at Gunpo and Anyang. The approach discussed above,
while retaining some concepts from HII's experience, has been strengthened
significantly to take account of these factors and is considered appropriate
for successful implementation of the Project. The key elements discussed
above such as training, technical assistance, expatriate appointments and
assistance to suppliers would have to be developed in greater detail as
additional licenses are signed and the final review by the consultants
completed, to facilitate adequate transfer of technology.

KOREA
HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
PROCESS FLOW
A.   Classification of Products
1.        The primary products planned for manufacture at the Heavy Machinery
Project fall into two distinct categories from a manufacturing point of view:
1.   Those which are predominantly machined and assembled; and
2.   Those which are predominantly fabricated.
There is an interface between these two categories for some products such as
generators but the categories serve adequately as a basis for discussing the
process-flow in the plant. The primary products impose a cyclical load on the
plant and therefore other products are planned for manufacture in order to
operate the plant at full capacity. These products would fall in either of
the above categories depending on the availability of capacity.
1.   Machined Parts
2.        Large parts that are predominatly machined include the following:
(i)  Steel-Mill Equipment:  Roll-stand, Rolls, Universal Shaft,
Trunion Shaft for Basic Oxygen Furnace etc.
(ii)  Power-Generation
Equipment:              High pressure Turbine Casing, Rotor Shaft etc.
(iii)  Chemical/Petrochemical
Equipment:              Flange, Pump and Compressor Casings,
Impeller etc.
These parts can be further divided into cubic parts, which are mainly castings
and cylindrical parts, which are primarily forged.
3.        A typical process flow for such products is shown in Chart 1.
Some of the operations shown take place concurrently. The three primary lines
of flow can be illustrated using turbine and turbine generator components as
examples.
Step 1:   The low pressure cylinder outer-casing for the turbine comes
through the fabrication shop where the plate is cut, prepared
and welded (processes covered under Fabricated Components).
The high-pressure shell is cast and the generator rotor is
forged from an ingot. At this stage each component is tested
(not shown on chart) for cracks and other defects.



ANNEX 4-4
Page 2
Step 2:   The fabricated outer-casing is taken through the stress-
relief facility and the high-pressure shell and rotor
are heat-treated in the common facility. At this stage
there are stringent quality-control checks using X-ray
techniques and thorough proof-machining of the castings to
check for porosity and blow-holes etc.
Step 3:   All components are transferred to the heavy machine shop.
The flat surfaces of the outer casing and the high pressure
shell are prepared on the adjustable-rail milling machine.
The rotor is first rough-turned and then machined on the
rail-milling machine. This sequence of operations would
take around 2 months.
Step 4:   At this stage the components are put through more complex
and final machining operations in the heavy machine shop.
The low-pressure outer casing is drilled and then finished
on the line bar machine. The high-pressure shell usually
of chromium-molybdenum-vanadium alloy steels, weighing
between 40 and 70 tons requires special tools and a longer
sequence of: drilling; line-bar machining; adjustable
rail milling; horizontal boring; and drilling. Quality
control inspection is implemented at each stage.
Step 5:   Before transfer to the assembly area each part is thoroughly
inspected for finish and tolerances which are very stringent
given the nature of the product. At this stage all other
components, separately bought or prepared such as bearings,
valve bodies, gears and sprockets are also inspected.
Step 6:   In the sub-assembly stage, the components are assembled
where necessary and practical. The smaller parts such as
the turbine diaphragms assembled onto the casing, the
coil windings and cooling tubes onto the generator-rotor
and the gear-assemblies put together. Each sub-assembly is
tested separately, where essential in operation, such as
in the concrete test-bunker for generator-testing provided
in the shop. Primer painting is also done at this stage.
Step 7:   In the final stage the components are finally assembled,
tested for compatibility etc. and final modifications made.
Thereafter, the product is prepared for shipping in modules
convenient for transportation, after painting in line with
customer requirements, and packed in the packing facility
included in the shop.
2.   Fabricated Products
4.        Large fabricated parts, primarily very heavy pieces and those built-up
from very thick plates include:



ANNEX 4-4
Page 3
(i)  Steel Mill Equipment:  Blast Furnace, Basic Oxygen Furnace,
Mixer, Ladle and Drum Mixer.
(ii) Power-Generation
Equipment:              Boilers, Condensers, Generator Casing
and Turbine Casing for the Low Pressure
Cylinder.
(iii) Chemical/Petrochemical
Equipment:              Heat exchangers, Reaction and Pressure vessels.
These parts can be further divided into three categories depending on the input
materials, tubes, section-steels and steel plates.
5.        A typical process flow for such products is shown in Chart 2 and
the lines of flow on the fabrication end can be illustrated using the flow
for boiler manufacture. The sequence of activities shown could take up to
9 months.
Step 1:   The materials in the form of tubes, section-steels as steel-
plates are pre-heated for marking and cutting. The pre-treat-
ment process comprises a range of surface-preparation operations
such as shot-blasting, depending upon the state of the incoming
materials.
Step 2:   The tubes, plates and section-steels are then marked and cut
to required shape and size on plate-burning tables using a
range of gas-cutting equipment and plasma-arc cutting machines.
Step 3:   The tubes are taken for expansion where necessary.  Generally
the tubes, the section-steels and the drum-plate are prepared
for welding and welded using different technologies such as
Arc, Submerged Arc, TIG, MIG and electroslag-welding under
precisely controlled conditions.
Step 4:   The welded items are heat-treated in order to relieve the
special stresses generated during the preceding operation,
in order to preserve material texture and to increase joint
efficiency.
Step 5:   Machining and like operations follow where the edges of the
tubes are finished and prepared, the edges of the sections
and drum are beveled. There is a full range of drilling
equipment provided in the shop for suitable operations on
the drum-vessel and the end-plate.
Step 6:   At this stage the components are all individually inspected
for quality, strength and against required dimensions.



ANNEX 4-4
Page 4
Step 7:   The boiler-drum and the end-plates are welded together in
a sub-assembly operation which again necessitates a stress-
relief phase.
Step 8:   The components are coated, with rust-preventing primer
and other paints according to customer requirements and then
put through a stringent test-phase.
Step 9:   Final assembly is carried out incorporating the above compo-
nents, bought-out items and others flowing in from the
machine shop and parts-warehouse. Thereafter, the product
is finish-painted, finally tested and prepared for shipping.
6.        The equipment for steel-mills, the blast-furnace, the mixer
and the ladle essentially follow a similar course.
B.   General Considerations
7.        Though the above process-flows describe the general route followed
by the product components, each job would be routed in accordance with the
availability of machines. A great deal of versatility is incorporated into
the Project and more than one machine can generally be used for a particular
operation. The Company is planning to prepare process charts for each product
in accordance with licensor-furnished manufacturing drawings and their own
equipment configurations. Production-planning based on process-charts
adapted to the HII system will be critical to the Project, reflected in
HII's program to build up strong in-house manufacturing and production
engineering capabilities.

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS
A.   Introduction
1.        The products scheduled for manufacture at the Heavy Machinery
Project are largely material-intensive. The value of the total require-
ments of materials and bought-out parts and components is estimated at 54%
of sales value at the steady operational state in 1983. The requirements
will be much higher in early years, amounting to 78% of sales value at
start-up and gradually declining to the 1982 figure. The material inputs
can primarily be segmented into: iron, ferro-alloy and scrap requirements
for castings and forgings; and plate, pipes and tubes for fabrication work.
The Project would also require a range of bought-out parts and components
to be procured locally and overseas. The general approach would be to
import the technically complex parts, and locally purchase parts for which
the technology is available in Korea. The proposed estimates are based upon
detailed data for representative products in each product-group, developed
from information supplied by licensors. A summary presentation of the
Project requirements and supply sources is shown in Chart 1.
B.   Material Requirements
1.   Raw Materials
2.        The planned end-product tonnage in 1983 amounts to 100,000 tons and
can be classified into predominantly machined and predominantly fabricated
products (see Annex 4-4). The primary inputs for first group are high-grade
forgings and castings from the Project's forge and foundry shops. Plates,
pipes, tubes, bars and shapes would form the raw materials for the fabricated
items. These input requirements are summarized in the table below.

1/   Represents the tonnage of the cast and forged items; primary metal require-
ments would be higher due to process losses.
3.        The Company has assessed the local availability of the above materials
and it is expected that the majority of the requirements could be obtained
locally. The supply capabilities of local producers are shown in Table 1. The
scrap requirements for the foundry would be adequately available from internal
generation and from the Hlyndai shipyard. HII plans to issue early enquiries
for small quantities of the basic requirements so that tests can be performed
in laboratories in Korea or where necessary in the facilities of the licensors.
Until the quality is established, HII would import limited quantities to meet
its requirements, simultaneously encouraging the development of local industry.
Special items such as magnetic steels and extra-thick plates would continue to
be imported beyond 1983 until domestic capability is extended to these areas.
2.   Parts, Components and Supplies
4.        The Company will purchase a variety of parts and components for use
in production, such as controls, electrical systems, light castings, forgings
and machined products. At the steady state of operations, in 1983. the
Project's proposed production would require a purchase of US$73 million
equivalent of local and imported parts and components as shown below.

5.        The make-buy philosophy underlying the above requrements covers two
aspects.  Firstly the Company plans to import on a continuing basis, components
that involve a specialized technology and manufacturing process wherein invest-
ment is not justified in view of the Project's limited requirements. These will
include items such as governing and control equipment with hydraulic systems,
solenoid operated high pressure valves and the turbine blades for the last
few stages. Secondly, HII plans to utilize the existing technology base in
Korea as far as possible by subcontracting for locally available items
wherever that is feasible without any risk to production planning and quality.
For example the required light machine capacity has been reduced in the
Project to permit utilization of existing Korean facilities. In this
regard, the Company plans to encourage the development of local manufacturers
by indicating products suitable for manufacture and through assistance in
obtaining license agreements, and in the training of supplier staff.
6.        Consumable supplies would largely be locally purchased from an
adequate existing supply capability. Existing Korean companies would be in a
position to furnish the requirements for refractory, sand additives and a
major proportion of welding electrodes, insulation supplies and paints and
varnishes. Some special electrodes and insulation-related supplies would be
imported. The requirements for lubricants, cutting oils, cutting and heat-
treatment gases would also be supplied locally and are covered in Annex 4.8,
Infrastructure.

7.        The schedule of material and parts and component requirements
indicated above is built up through a pattern of increasing localization
between start-up in 1978 and steady operations in 1983.  In the start-up

phase, the Company would directly purchase a number of major components
in finished and semi-finished form from the licensors and their recommended
suppliers. For example, turbine generator rotors and turbine blades that
are planned for manufacture in 1983 would be imported in the early years.
The Company would build up from a largely assembly-type operation in 1978
to a full manufacturing operation in 1983. For a list of major turbine-
generator components to be imported in the early stages, see Table 2. This
pattern is reflected in the material breakdown and cost data (Annex 7-3) where
imported bought-out parts are increasingly replaced by raw materials for
in-plant manufacture and by locally purchased parts. The planned approach is
considered satisfactory in that it would ensure product quality in early years
and would also be most acceptable to licensors, who are expected to provide
joint performance guarantees on initial contracts.
E.   Sources of Supply
8.        The raw material and component requirements will be supplied from
various sources as shown in Chart 1. HII's existing facilities at Gunpo and
Anyang will be in a position to furnish part of the requirements of light
components and some simple electrical assemblies. Manufacturing concerns
in the Changwon Complex itself are capable of supplying a large part of the
requirements of basic mechanical and electrical engineering items such as
motors, instruments, tools, gears, bearings, springs and fasteners. The
Korea Integrated Special Steel Company, which is presently under construc-
tion in the Complex, is expected to supply part of the stainless steel re-
quirements. The major proportion of the primary raw material requirements are
expected to be supplied from other sources in Korea. These primarily comprise
the national steel company, Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO), and a
number of smaller producers such as Dong Kuk Steel and the Korea Ferro Alloy
Company. POSCO, expected to be the largest supplier, is also located on the
coast around 150 miles from the Project site. As discussed, the imports will
largely be obtained through the licensors and their recommended suppliers in
their respective countries. This will ensure compliance with licensor speci-
fications and minimize production problems.
F.   Conclusion
9.        The Company's planned approach with regard to its make-buy
policies and its reliance on local industry as far as possible is considered
satisfactory. It would also assist in the development of supply industries
to the Project. However, as indicated, localization would only proceed at a
gradual pace and reach around 85% of production cost by 1983 if product quality
is to be assured. Any Government measures to accelerate the pace of locali-
zation of the planned products could have negative consequences.

ANNEX 4-6

ECOLOGY
A.   General Standards and Conditions in Korea
1.        According to the Korean law, "Law on Prevention of Public Nuisance",
as promulgated in November 1963 and amended in January 1971, it is necessary
for all industrial enterprises to conform to the provisions of the law, which
is mainly based on the practice followed in Japan; the standards appear to
be stringent and close to international codes. The provisions in this law
cover pollution by air, gases and particle emissions, by liquid or solid
waste, and by noise levels and odors. The law also stipulates that the
enterprises will have to obtain the necessary approval from the Ministry of
Health and Social Affairs, with respect to pollution control facilities and
its compliance with the said law. A summary of the minimum pollution
standards set by the law is given in Table 1.
2.        The design of the project takes into account all the provisions of
the law, and necessary preventive measures have been incorporated in the
plant facilities. However, HII has not yet submitted its project to the
Ministry of Health and Social Affairs for the latter's approval of the
facilities. With the exception of foundry and forge shop, HII's production
is a clean operation with no adverse effect on the environment. Nevertheless,
HIT has identified all areas where pollution control would be necessary, and
the salient features of the proposed pollution control systems are explained
below.
B.   Air Pollution Systems
3.        The main areas that require air pollution control systems are:
foundry and forge shop (for dusts, fumes, sulphuric acid gases, nitrogen
chemical components and iron particles); heat treatment and drying furnaces
(for fumes, and sulphur and nitrogen chemical compounds from combustion
gases); and sand blasting facilities (for dusts, iron particles and inorganic
substances.) The location of the foundry and forge shop within the overall
plant layout is selected with due consideration to the direction of wind
flow to avoid any pollution within the plant site. In addition, for preven-
tion of dust, fume and particle matter this shop will have a electro-static
dust collector with a capacity of 8,000 Nm /min. The effluent discharge will
have a 0.02 g/Nm  concentration.  The electric arc furnaces will have indi-
vidual "bag-filter" type dust collectors (2,000 Nm /min. capacity each) to
directly absorb dusts and fumes at the top of ths furnace. The concentration
of discharged materials would be about 0.02 g/Nm . For the heat treatment and



ANNEX 4-6
Page 2
drying furnaces as well as for shot-blasting, central multi-hood dust sollec-
tors to control the concentration of discharged materials to 0.02 g/Nm will
be installed. The cost of air pollution control devices for the project is
estimated to cost around US$5 million.
C.   Water Pollution Systems
4.        The waste water can be segregated into four major categories:  (a)
waste water containing lubrication oil, cutting fluids and metallic particles
from machinery areas; (b) waste water containing acid emulsion from boiler
plants; (c) waste water containing paints, welding fluxes and inorganic
particles from the fabrication shop; and (d) waste water from rest rooms.
It has been proposed that each group3will be treated separately before
they are received in the final 600 m /day treatment plant, where the effluent
will undergo chemical treatment (chemical precipitation and segregation of
the heavy and toxic elements, automatic pH adjustment and neutralization of
combined flow.) Sludge residue from the process would be dried by filter
pressing to a moisture content of about 50% before disposal by trucks. The
water will be discharged into the sea and will have a pH value of around
6 to 7 and harmful materials of about 10 ppm. Total cost of the water pol-
lution system is estimated to be around US$1.0 million.
D.   Noise Pollution Control
5.        With respect to noise and vibration, HII has planned to use "rock
wool" or other similar materials as anti-vibration mountings or pads to keep
the noise level down to 4OdBA. However, the noise levels may go up to 8OdBA
in certain areas, particularly in the heavy forging shop, occasionally and
for short periods of time.
E.   Safety and Health Considerations
6.        The project includes necessary safety and occupational health
considerations. Each equipment will have its own safety guards to protect
workers. Proper ventilation and heating systems for each major facility
would be included in the building. A fully equipped fire fighting service
is scheduled to be commissioned by early 1978. A dispensary, with necessary
facilities for minor operations, will also be located within the plant site.
These functions will be under the control of the Personnel and Labor Affairs
Department.
F.   General Observations and Conclusions
7.        The pollution controls and environmental protection plans
included in the project are considered adequate to meet the existing
Korean laws which are similar to those existing in industrialized



ANNEX 4-6
Page 3
countries. Procedures for sampling and monitoring are also being in-
cluded in the overall scheme. Finally, the Company plans to establish
a green belt by planting trees around the plant site to act as an acoustic
barrier for the local residents. This green belt will be capable of
absorbing 50 to 70 tons of dust per year and will help to create an
attractive working environment.

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
MANPOWER AND TRAINING
A.  Manpower Needs
1.        The direct manpower requirements for the Project for the steady
state of operations, past 1983, have been assessed on the basis of the
number of fixed facilities in each shop. The estimate has also been reviewed
against licensor and other similar facility experience through a comparison
of their production volumes with those proposed for the Project. The indirect
manpower has been assessed against the support functions including maintenance
and other production services, engineering and administration. The total needs
are shown below.
HII: Manpower Needs 1983 (Number of Employees)
1.   Direct:  Labor                               4,570
2.   Indirect:  Labor                             1,110
Works Engineers and
Trained Staff                            950
Works Managers                            160
Administration (includes some
Technical Staff)                     990
Sub-total                              3,210
Total Requirements                           7,780
The overall ratio of 59% direct to 41% indirect manpower reflects the level
of technology, required engineering support and the indirect labor support
to the operators of complex high investment machinery.
B.   Manpower Development Plan
2.        Table 1 shows the build up of manpower over the start-up phase
of the Project through the steady state. The build-up schedule takes into
account the planned production activity levels in each year, time for
training activities and the initial learning curve inefficiencies. The
estimates include requirements for expatriate staff to be replaced by Korean
staff as the latter are fully developed to assume the responsibilities of
the various functions.



ANNEX 4-7

1.   Recruitment
3.        No problem is foreseen in recruiting adequate numbers of personnel
for the Project, recognizing that, where necessary, the Company plans to
supplement the existing capabilities of the recruits with additional training.
The Project Construction activity will employ a force of 4,000 at its peak
and average about 2,200 over the construction period. A number of the welders
and equipment operators from this force would be absorbed into the Project.
HII also has a useful source in its affiliated companies.  HII itself, the
Construction Company and the Hyundai shipyard have a proven track record
of erection of complex projects and some of this would be pulled into the
Project. The Gunpo plant and the Shipyard would also provide manufacturing
experience, the shipyard especially being a prime source of fabrication tech-
nology know-how. Some operators and technicians are already being trained
at Gunpo. The Company also plans to recruit some experienced personnel from
other machinery works in Korea.
4.        In addition HII plans to recruit graduating engineers from Korean
universities and craftsmen from the existing technical school system. A
total of 21 technical highschools with a strength of approximately 8,000
students, a third of whom graduate each year, are located within a 30 km
radius of the Changwon Complex. The Government also plans to establish
another technical school (1,260 students) and a vocational training center
(400 persons) for master craftsmen and supervisors, in the Complex. The
potential labor force in the Complex vicinity is estimated at around 450,000
and is considered adequate to support the requirements of the Complex (esti-
mated at 85,000 in 1981), while meeting the needs of other employers in the
area. The mix of these potential sources to be drawn into the Project in the
early stages, when the Company's own training programs would not have been
established, is shown in Table 2.
2.   Training
5.        The availability of a well-trained work force with a suitable
balance of skills is critical to the success of the Project. HII is fully
aware of this requirement and is planning a comprehensive training program.
Korea has achieved excellent standards in basic technician and craftsmen
training through its system of universities and 3-year technical high schools
and training centers. HII recognizes the additional requirements imposed
by the new technology, complex heavy products and stringent quality require-
ments of the Project and plans to supplement existing capabilities with
Company training, both overseas and in Korea.
6.        Overseas Training:  HII together with its consultants and licensors
has developed its overseas training plan into a format of ten general train-
ing programs at the licensors' facilities and at the facilities of suppliers
of key equipment. The licensor-related programs, provided for the license
agreements, fall into two categories, product-oriented and manufacturing and
specialized activity-oriented programs, and are shown in Table 3.



ANNEX 4-7
Page 3
7.        >le product-oriented programs are aimed at providing in-depth
product exmPrience and a broad understanding of the entire spectrum of
manufacturing functions within each licensor. These programs will
basically be for training engineers in the areas of manufacturing and
design engineering, production planning and quality control. The trainee
engineers will essentially visit the licensor facility for the allowed
period and follow the entire manufacturing cycle each from his professional
perspective.
8.        The manufacturing and specialized activity programs complement the
product programs in a matrix fashion, each covering one major manufacturing
activity - machining, fabrication, casting/forging; manufacturing engineering,
production control and procurement - across the operations of all licensors.
These programs would train managers, shop engineers, supervisors and key
operators in the activity across the operations of all licensors. The Company
has also identified the need to supplement licensor training in forging/casting
operations in view of the process-nature of the technology and the limited
experience of some of the licensors. Accordingly, the Company plans to seek a
know-how and assistance agreement with an experienced operating company and
provide for such training therein.
9.        In addition to the above programs, 70 operators of key equipment
will also be trained at the facilities of the supplier with the purpose of
achieving total familiarity with the item of equipment. The proposed approach
to overseas training is expected to provide specialist know-how in products,
manufacturing techniques and machine operations, making available a broad
mix of experience adequate to deal with production and related problems.
10.       Project Training:  The starting point of domestic training of
supervisors and operators will be the core team of engineers, supervisors
and operators who return from overseas training. These trained personnel
will develop the basic training programs to be established and operated
at the Project. The Training center is planned as the first facility to
be completed in the Project, scheduled to begin operations by January 1978.
11.       Four training stages are planned for personnel to operate the
high value equipment. These will be technical high school graduates with
a minimum of three years general machine experience.
(i) Induction course comprising basic class-room training in
machine and supporting functions and utilization techniques;
(ii) Programmed shop training requiring trainers to plan operations
for specific components in parallel with actual planning
and operations on the shop floor, which would then be observed
by the trainees;
(iii) Machine operation training with less critical parts or test
pieces on the shop floor; and



ANNEX 4-7
Page 4
(iv) Apprenticeship or functioning as assistants to the machine
operators till they are capable of operating the machine
competently themselves.
Only the operators of critical machinery would undergo all four steps. It is
planned that a broad range of operators and supervisors will undergo the first
two steps. The detailed training schedule is yet to be finalized but it is
expected to reach upto 300 general trainees and around 100 senior operators
per year.
12.       Another important form of training programmed into the Project
is on-the-job training of Korean staff and management as they serve as
counterparts to expatriates. Expatriate technicians and managers will
be part of the Project till such time as the local staff have picked up
the skills to assume their responsibilities. This approach will supple-
ment overseas training for key managers and technicians.
13.       The training schedule at the Project will also cater to the needs
of interested HII parts suppliers. The Company will train supplier personnel
on request in an effort to upgrade existing supply capabilities along with
assisting suppliers in seeking overseas licenses (Annex 4-3, Technology).
C.   Conclusion
14.       HII's training program as planned is considered generally adequate.
The overseas training program is scheduled to begin in 1977 and would be
developed further as additional licenses are signed. On the domestic side
training has already begun at Gunpo and the Project training facility is
expected to be fully operational by January 1978. This proposed timing for the
training programs is considered satisfactory and would facilitate start-up of
operations.

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
INFRASTRUCTURE
A.   Introduction
1.        In order to ensure a smooth and rapid development of the machine
industry in Korea, the Government has established a large-scale integrated
machine industry complex at Changwon under the control of the Changwon
Industrial Development Corporation (CIDA) -- (see Annex 3-1 for policies and
constituent operations). The Heavy Machinery Project is situated on the
perimeter of the complex in an area originally set aside as a permanent
green-belt. The release of the green-belt for the Project under Presidential
signature, signifies the importance attached to the Project by the Government.
The Government has undertaken to provide the basic infrastructure needs of
the complex including the social requirements such as housing, education
and sports facilities. The Project would derive its basic requirements from
those available for the complex.
B.   Changwon Industrial Complex
2.        The2complex (Map IBRD 12645) covers a total area of 53.4 km  of
which 22.4 km has been planned as industrial area and 20.9 dm as residential
area. Of the industrial area, plant sites encompass 12.6 km , the remainder
being devoted to other uses and being preserved as a green-belt. A total of
49 enterprises are expected to begin operations by the end of 1978 in the
machinery and related fields. The complex will eventually house 104 companies
and provide for the basic infrastructure requirements of all facilities at
full operation:
1.   Water Supply
3.        Rain water is taken from the Nakdong River and the design rate for
abstraction has been set at 200,000 tons/day to account for ultimate require-
ments. The rain water transmission system comprises a 1,650 mm diameter
buried rising main of mild-steel construction, a booster station at Junam
and a 1,350 mm diameter rising main from Junam to the Bansong treatment plant,
7 km away. The treatment process includes: sedimentation with attendant
dosing equipment for removal of solids; rapid gravity sand filters; dis-
infection by chlorine dosing; and pH control by lime dosing. Plant and
machinery is scheduled for complete delivery by June 1977 to be commissioned
in August under the responsibility of CIDA. The initial throughput would be
120,000 tons/day. The Project's process and potable water requirements
have been taken into consideration in determining this throughput. These
will be provided by a 600 mm diameter trunk main which has already been
laid upto within 2 km of the Project site.



ANNEX 4-8

4.        The complex includes a grid substation set up by the Korea Electric
Company with an existing capacity of 400 MVA and a present loading of only
10%. The substation when fully developed will have a capacity of 800 MVA,
adequate to meet the demands of the complex. An overhead 154 kV transmission
system has already been installed from the substation to the harbor facility
and runs 3 km from the site, and would be tapped for the Project.
3.   Transportation
5.        The complex has access to the well connected Korean highway network
with a direct 50 m. wide distributor link to the Mlasan-Seoul Highway. The
primary distributor is fed by a district distributor system of 30 m wide
carriageways. The local distributors from this 30 m wide road are 25 m
wide. The local distributor to the Project site would ultimately form a loop
from the district distribution system in the form of a coastal road and a
direct link to the central area of the complex. The road system has been
designed for traffic loading upto 2.5 million tons/year with gradients
being limited to 3.3%. The roads embody a conventional drainage system.
Harbor facilities, ultimately 7 berths for 20,000 ton vessels lie adjacent
to the complex and only 2 km from the site. The first berth is scheduled
for completion by the end of 1977. The complex is also linked to Seoul
and Pusan by a rail-road network, not planned for use under the Project.
4.   Communications
6.        The master plan for the Complex provides for a fully automatic
telephone exchange facility which will provide a total of 4,000 lines and
50 telex circuits. All major cities are expected to be linked to the system
by the end of 1978; 600 lines and subscriber trunk dialing Seoul-Masan is
already available.
5.   Social Facilities
7.        The complex has allocated around 40% of the total area to residential
and social purposes. The Korea Housing Corporation is participating actively
and 400 apartments were constructed in 1975. A further 960 are under construc-
tion of which 616 have already been completed. All homes would be available
for rent or purchase against a 60% downgpaymen5, the bal2nce to be paid over
15 years. Accommodation comprises 43 m , 50 m and 60 m apartments with all
facilities. The total development program for staff and worker housing on
the complex is scheduled for completion in 1981 and would provide complete
facilities including shops, recreation facilities, hospital and churches for
an estimated population of 300,000.
6.   Sewage and Trade Effluent Treatment
8.        Legislation recently introduced in Korea dictates that all domestic
sewage and trade effluent discharges be treated to comply with specific condi-
tions. Originally it was the intention of CIDA to provide treatment facilities
within the complex. This service has been withdrawn and it will be incumbent
upon the constituent companies to provide treatment facilities at the site



ANNEX 4-8
Page 3
for all industrial and other wastes. Present arrangements for disposal of
solid waste at Changwon are provided through the private sector. A number
of companies, approved by CIDA provide a competitive service in this regard.
7.   Fire-fighting
9.        A fully equipped Fire Station is scheduled to be commissioned by
June 1977 in the complex. The station is located in the center of the main
complex adjacent to the main boulevard and would provide services to the
residential area and strong back-up facilities for the individual services
which must be provided at each individual site.
10.       In addition to the above the Government proposes to set up a
Machinery Development Institute in the complex at an initial cost of US$5
million. The Institute would serve as a Research and Development base for
the constituent industries. Each enterprise in the complex is required to
subscribe to the Institute making it a cooperative venture. In view of the
scale of the complex when fully operational, the initial outlay is considered
too low and it is expected that the Government would provide additional funds.
The plans also include a Technical Training Center to be set up under CIDA
by April 1977. An investment outlay of US$6.0 million has been provided
for this purpose. The center would train craftsmen and supervisory personnel
to feed the complex.
C.   Infrastructure and Inter-plant Services for the Project
11.       The facilities provided by CIDA in the complex would, as indicated,
have to be extended to the Project site. The cost, implementation schedule
and responsibility for extension of the primary services is shown in Table 1.
In addition, the Company has to provide other services itself. The Project
incorporates generation, storage and inter-plant distribution systems as
appropriate for all services. These are discussed below.
1.   Water Supply
12.       HII plans to receive water for use in the Project through a tee-
connection by a 300 mm diameter pipe running for 2 km (refer to Map). The
responsibility for the connection and its estimated cost of US$145,000 is
under discussion between the Government and HII. The connection is scheduled
to be in place by June 1977. The 300 mm diameteS pipe has adequate capacit
to service the Project's requirements of 5,000 m /day. This includes A,200
for plant use, 1,850 m  for living and working human needs and 1,950 m  for
steam generation purposes (for details see Table 2).
13.       The terminal pressure at the site is expected to be 4 atmospheres
which would permit direct feed into two elevated, underground concrete storage
tanks of 5,000 m capacity each. The two tanks would be interconnected for
flexibility and would provide for requirements of 2 days.



ANNEX 4-8
Page 4
2.   Electricity Supply
14.       Power requirements will be provided by the Korea Electric Company
off an existing 154 kV transmission line (refer to Map). The power supply
would be at 154 kV, 3 phase and 60 Hz and would feed into the 154 kV incoming
circuit breakers (see Chart 1). The dual circuit breakers would be provided
by the Korea Electric Company and the responsibility of the remainder of
the network would rest with HII. The dual incoming circuit breaker would
serve as a standby arrangement together with the necessary maintenance
facilities. The circuit breaker will feed into four transformers of 40 MVA
each, the ratio of transformation being 154/22.9 kV. The distribution
network further comprises seven substations attached to the facilities thus
making available three voltage levels of 22.9 kV, 6.6 kV and one low voltage
level at 380 V (not shown).
15.       The total requirements of the facilities are indicated below and
amount to 135,000 kW, around 50% of which is directly attributable to the
foundry.  The electrical distribution system provides for requirements of
upto 150,000 kVa.

3.   Roads
16.       Two access roads are planned to the Project site which will together
form a loop with the Changwon complex road network (refer to Map). The first
road will run along the sea and link the site to the proposed harbor and



ANNEX 4-8
Page 5
indirectly to the central area of the complex. A 30 m. wide paved road is
planned for completion by early 1978 with the possibility of a single lane
by April 1977. The responsibility for its construction at a cost of US$1.5
million rests with the provincial government. The second road (3 km) would
link the site to the central complex area and include a 500 m. tunnel through
the dividing hill. The road is estimated to cost around US$2.6 million but
has not yet been planned in detail. The design for the seaside road does
take into account the load requirements for the Project and its design capa-
city is around 10 tons/axel with headroom of 4.5 m. It was originally intended
to service the site with a rail-link. It was subsequently found to be unecono-
mical and excluded.
4.   Sewage and Trade Effluent Treatment
17.       The Project provides facilities for the treatment of industrial
and other wastes and would be in compliance with existing legislation. It
incorporates an adequate sewage disposal and drainage system that embodies
a number of submersible pumping stations. The effluents from each facility
would be treated by a number of methods such as filtering, absorption, thick-
ening and neutralizing methods. The composition of the discharge and the
required treatment facilities have generally been determined and are detailed
in Annex 4-6, Ecology. The plans for the location of the treatment facilities
are being finalized.
5.   Communications
18.       HII will draw a maximum of 30 outside lines from the complex ex-
change along the electric poles currently in place for the village along the
Project site. The Company will operate a manual switchboard system with an
estimated 500 internal lines supplemented by public and portable address
systems.
6.   Other Utilities
19.       The total requirement for all other utilities/services has been
estimated and is shown in Table 2. The gas requirements will mostly be met
by purchase from Union Gas Company, under construction in the complex and
scheduled for completion by 1977. The distribution system from the Gas
Company to the end-users has not been finalized. Distribution is expected
to be done utilizing tanks and the Project incorporates adequate storage
facilities on site. Compressed air requirements will be generated at four
large stations attached to the Forge/Foundry shop, Light Machine Shop, Heavy
Machine Shop and Fabrication Shops. Smaller compressors will be provided
within the facilities to meet special negds. The to5al requirement for
compresssd air is estimated at 15,000 Nm /hr (7Kg/cm ) or a maximum of around
50,000 M /day. Receiver tanks at the compressor stations are provided for
adequate storage. Distribution of compressed air will be by overhead lines
along with Oxygen and Acetylene lines in the plant. Distribution outside
the plant will be underground.



ANNEX 4-8
Page 6
20.       The steam requirements of 1,950 tons maximum per day will also be
generated on site. The boiler facilities provided for in the Project include
self-contained units with vertical type boilers for the administration and
residential units and a centralized boiler station for process steam and
plant heating.  The centralized station will include 3 boilers with a capacity
of 50 tens/hour at 30 kg/cm , and 2 sets with a capacity of 30 tons/hour at
7 kg/cm .
21.       Fuel and oil requirements will be procured from existing fuel
companies in Korea which will be responsible for delivery on site by trailer
and/or ship. The largest requirement will be for Bunker 'C' oil estimated at
300,000 tons/year. The Project includes over-grsund centralized storage
facilities in the form of two tanks of 10,000 m capacity. Smaller tanks
will be available for storage of gasoline and lubricants and machining oils
will be stored in drums. The boiler stations also include underground servic-
ing tanks for their requirements of Bunker 'C' oil.
7.   Social Facilities
22.       The Company plans to build residential facilities for upto
1,200 of its bachelor work-force, the remainder being expected to reside
in the housing facilities included in the Changwon complex. The Project
includes a dispensary, recreation hall and adequate dining facilities for
the work-force in both the living and the plant areas. It also provides
accommodation for upto 160 visiting expatriate and local technicians.
The Project also includes a Guest House.
D.   Conclusion
23.       The infrastructure provided for in the Changwon complex and
supplemented within the Project is considered to be satisfactory. The
Project has access to an adequate transportation system, water and electri-
city supply system through the complex. The interplant services built into
the Project Design at this stage are suitable and will be reviewed again and
finalized as the facilities are planned in further detail.

/1   Includes 2% duty (after 90% exemption) and 2.5% defense tax.
2.        The base cost estimates are based on mid-1976 prices.  The Project
cost estimates, which are prepared jointly by HII and IMC, are based on
quotations received by the Company, enquiries made by IMC and the Company's
recent experience in the implenentation of Gunpo Plant. Some preliminary
quotations received in March 1976 from potential suppliers were modified
to July 1976 price to reflect the price increase between March and July 1976.
No further modifications are expected as a result of the final review by the

consultants. The details of the cost estimates, which were reviewed by
the Bank on an item by item basis and are considered realistic, are
elaborated below.
B.   Civil Work (Item 1)
3.        The civil works cost estimates are based on detailed assessment of
various items such as land purchase, earth work, site preparation, and water
supply and disposal. These cost estimates are summarized below.
Cost Estimate (US$ 000)
Category                Quantity           Cost/Unit   Local    Foreign  Total
(US$/Unit)
(i)  Land Purchase          3.24 million m      0.87/mr   2,810        -      2,810
33
(ii)  Earth Work             5.9  million m      1.10/m3   6,490        -      6,490
(iii)  Rock Blasting          700,000 m           6.50/mr   4,550        -       4,550

(vii)  Water Supply and Disposal                               630                630
Total                                            17,790       -      17,790
4.        The land purchase includes the price of land and the compensation
to be paid to about 259 families currently living there. The earth work
of about 6.4 million m  includes the reclamation of about 0.5 million m  sf
land presently under water   The filling itself will be aboit 5 million m
Of the total 6.4 million m  earth work, about 0.5 million m   will require
rock blasting; this will cost about 6 times more than normal earth work. MAT
process will be utilized to cover the bottom of the area covered by water
at present. This is done primarily to reduce cost of piling. Piling cost
is included with the building cost. Various types of culverts are required
at the plant site. The cost per meter of hume pipe culverts will vary
between US$70.0/m and US$23.0/m for 1,000 mm and 450 mm pipes respectively.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 3
Box culverts are estimated to cost around US$500/m. About 10.9 km of paved
road with an average width Sf 10 m is required for the project. The cost
of pavement of about US$8/m is used to derive the total cost of road work.
The water supply system, including two 5,000 m storage tanks and necessary
pipe works, is estimated to cost arou2d US$330,000. The waste water disposal,
including a treatment plant for 600 m /day, is estimated to cost about US$300,000.
The civil works will be carried out by HII and Hyundai Construction Company and
these costs are calcualted on the basis of their recent experience in the
country. This being the case, the cost estimates given above are considered
realistic.
C.   Building (Item 2)
5.        The building cost estimates are based on the floor space and piling
requirements of each facility. HII's recent experience in the construction of
its Gunpo Plant is used to derive unit cost of construction of these buildings.
Detailed estimates of building cost by facility are given below.

ANNEX 5-1
Page 4
6.        The above estimates include the foundation work required for each
shop. Since some of the structures required for the heavy building are not
available in the country, they will have to 2be imported.  The unit price of
buildings varies between US$46 and US$123/m because of the difference in build-
ing structure and foundation work. The cost of utility work inside the
buildings is included under the installation cost category. Based on the
actual costs experienced at Gunpo facilities, these cost estimates are con-
sidered satisfactory.
D.   Equipment (Item 3)
7.        For most of the equipment and machinery required for the project,
HII has received qdotations from various suppliers in Japan, Western Europe
and the U.S.A. On an average about 3 to 5 bids were received for most of
the items. Some of these price quotations, particularly for critical items,
were further verified by IMC. In order to reflect the price increase between
March 1976 and mid 1976, the quoted prices of March 1976 of some items were
adjusted to mid 1976 to arrive at the base price estimates. The equipment
cost estimates also include the cost of necessary spare parts and transport
cost to the plant site. The following are the cost estimates for foreign
as well as local equipment (c.i.f., Plant), including spare parts:
Category                    Cost Estimates US$000
Local       Foreign       Total
(i)  Foundry & Forge                 14,200       20,900       35,100
(ii)  Fabrication shop                 5,000        9,200       14,200
(iii)  Heavy Machine shop               3,100       35,400       38,500
(iv)  Light Machine shop               1,200        9,300       10,500
(v)  Assembly and Test Shop           5,300        9,400       14,700
(vi)  Support facilities               3,000        7,800       10,800
(vii)  Others                           4,800        2,200        7,000
Total                 36,600       94,200      130,800
8.        Of the total equipment cost, about 38% would be for the machine
shops and about 27% for foundry and forge shop.  The cost of tooling and
spare parts, which are included in the above estimate, are based on a
percentage of total equipment cost, which ranges between 2% in certain areas
like assembly shop to 7% for heavy machine shop. An allowance of about 3%
of equipment cost of imported items has been assumed to compute freight and
insurance charges. Of the total of US$130.8 million worth of equipment,
about US$47.1 million will account for equipment made in-house using the



ANNEX 5-1
Page 5
knocked down kit approach. An average duty of 20% is normally applicable to
the machinery and equipment to be imported for the Project. By virtue of the
nature of the Project and its location in the Changwon complex it would enjoy
90% exemption from such duties. Accordingly a duty of 2% and the applicable
defense tax of 2.5% have been included in the above estimates.
E.   Installations (Item 4)
This item includes cost estimates for utility installations (with
the exception of water distribution), erection, commissioning, and specific
foundations. Detailed breakdown of cost items are given below:
Category                   Cost Estimates US$000
Local      Foreign       Total
(i)  Utilities                        7,300         -          7,300
(ii)  Erection & Commissioning         2,900         -          2,900
(iii)  Special Foundations              1,700         -           1,700
Total                 11,900         -          11,900
10.       The cost estimates for utilities are based 2n different unit
prices/unit floor space, which varies 2between US$35/m for residential and
administrative buildings to US$14.5/m for production facilities. Based on
Gunpo experience, the erection and commissioning charges have been assumed
at 2.2% of equipment cost. These estimates are considered reasonable.
F.   Pre-operating Expenses
11.       The estimate of this item is based on the Company's past experience
and also takes into account the requirements of this project with respect to
technical assistance, license fees and training requirements. The technical
assistance and engineering category includes around US$1.0 million for 50
man-months of consultancy in the general/machining/assembly and 70 man-months
in the foundry/forge areas. The costs are derived on a man-month base cost of
US$6,040 and US$5,950 and after including travel expenses, overheads and
discounts approximate an average cost of US$8,300 per man-month for the two
areas. The following is the estimate of the cost elements included under this
item:

G.   Physical Contingency
12.       To cover minor scope changes and possible omissions of equipment
and civil works, a 10% physical contingency has been added to the total
base cost estimate, including pre-operating expenses.  This contingency
provision is considered necessary since the final details of the Project
has yet to be developed.
H.   Price Contingency
13.       The base cost estimates are based on mid-1976 prices.  Price
escalation has been added to both local as well as foreign cost estimates,
to provide for future project cost increases. The price escalation is
applied to base cost and physical contingencies. The following annual price
increases for local and foreign costs were used in calculating price contin-
gency.
Annual Rate of Increase
Year                    Local           Foreign
1976                     13%              9%
1977 - 79                12%              8%
1980 onward              10%              7%



ANNEX 5-1
Page 7
14.       Total price escalation is estimated at US$41.0 million (US$20.7
million on foreign exchange cost and US$20.3 million on domestic costs).
This price contingency, which represents about 21% of the base cost estimate,
is considered adequate.

KOREA
HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
HII: WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT
1.        Details on working capital requirements for the project are given in
Table 1 at the end of this Annex. Principal assumptions used are summarized
below. In general, however, it should be noted that turnovers of accounts
receivable, inventories, and accounts payable will be lower than normal in
the early years of project operations when sales and related costs are in-
creasing throughout the year. Normal turnovers will be achieved from 1982
onward when revenues and expenses have reached steady state, or close to
steady state levels.
2.        Minimum Cash:  forecast at 2% of sales.
3.        Accounts Receivable:  are based on the assumed billing pattern for
project sales. That is, 80%,Y of the sales value of work done will be billed
before shipment (in the form of progress billings) and 20% will be billed at
the time of shipment. One half of this will be received at the time receipt
of the equipment by the customer and one-half after completion of acceptance
tests. Turnovers on the two types of billings are assumed as follows:
Progress billings:  7.5 times 1978-80
8.0 times 1981
9.0 times 1982 and beyond
Average turnover on HII's accounts
receivable in 1976 was 8.7 times.
Billings on shipment: 2.0 times on the first 10%
1.0 times on the second 10%
4.        Advances to Suppliers:  HII will be required to make progress pay-
ments to suppliers on bought-out items with long manufacturing lead times.
It is assumed that one-half of bought-out items will be of this nature. It
is also assumed that progress payments total 80% of the purchase cost of
such items, 40% being paid in the year prior to receipt of the goods and 40%
in the year of receipt. Thus, advances to suppliers at the end of any single
year will equal 20% of the total of the cost of the following years' bought-
out parts.
5.        Materials and Supplies:  are based on the following assumed turn-
overs: 5.0 times 1978-80, 5.5 times, 1981, and 6.0 times thereafter. Average
turnover achieved by HII in 1976 was 5.6 times.



ANNEX 5-2
Page 2
6.        Goods in Process:  The average manufacturing period for items to
be produced by the project is assumed to be six months. This reflects the
fact that while the manufacturing period for completed components in much
longer, often one to two years, partial shipments will be made to the
customer during this time. Turnovers are forecast as follows: 2.5 times,
1978-81, and 3.0 times thereafter. Finally, goods in process inventories
are valued at sales value since LIII is assumed to realize income on work
done on a percentage of completion basis.
7.        Accounts Payable:  are based on total cost of sales plus selling
and administrative costs, less labor costs included in these amounts. Costs
of bought-out parts with long manufacturing lead times are also excluded since
the payment method on these items will differ from other purchases. Turnover
on the balances so arrived at are projected as follows: 4.0 times, 1978-79,
4.5 times, 1980-81, 5.0 times thereafter. Average turnover on HII's accounts
payable in 1976 was 4.0 times. For bought-out parts with long manufacturing
lead times, it is assumed that the 20% not made in progress payments (see
para. 4) will be paid in the year following receipt of the goods. Thus,
accounts payable for such items (which represent 50% of bought-out parts
costs) at the end of any single year will equal 10% of the total. cost of
that year's bought-out parts.
8.        Advances from Customers:  are assumed to amount to 80% of the
value of work in progress at year end plus 10% of the following year's
sales. The latter amount represents deposits received by HII on orders
placed by customers.

KOREA
HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Introduction
1.        Three distinct phases of operation can be visualized in relation
to the Project, requiring different forms of organization:
(i) Project Planning and Implementation Phase requring a Project
form of organization directed towards the installation of the
fixed facilities. Negotiation of licenses would also proceed
in this period.
(ii) Operations start-up Phase requiring emphasis on coordination with
licensors and involvement of expatriates to ensure technology
transfer; and
(iii) Steady Operations Phase requiring an organization directed towards
the successful achievement of the Project's objectives.
In the earliest stages, the effort would be directed from Company headquarters
in Seoul with close communication and accountability to the President.
B.   Project Team Organization
2.        The proposed organization for the implementation stage is shown in
Chart 1. As indicated, a large proportion of the staff including all key
management personnel heave already been appointed. The organization is
structured along four construction-related functions and a project planning
and coordinating office. HII and the affiliated companies have a vast amount
of project experience in implementing large projects such as the Hyundai Motor
Plant, the Hyundai Shipyard and the Gunpo Plant and the proposed organization
is based on this experience. The responsibilities of the key elements of the
organization are discussed below.
Consultation Committee
3.        The committee is comprised of all senior and other directors
in the existing organization and advises the President and the Project
leader on policy and other critical matters, bringing to bear the
existing senior management experience in HII.
Project Leader
4.        The Project leader is responsible to the President for all aspects
of Project planning and implementation and directs all operations. In consul-
tation with the President, he deals directly with existing and potential



ANNEX 6-1
Page 2
licensors. The appointee has a proven track record of project implementation,
with over 10 years experience in construction supervision and project manage-
ment. Most notably, he managed the Hyundai Shipyard Project and was largely
responsible for its successful completion.
Directors: Design and Engineering; Construction; Supply; and Finance
5.        The Director for design and engineering is responsible for construc-
tion-related design aspects including site preparation and development, land
reclamation process, infrastructure planning, building works and utility
installation. The incumbent has been a practising Civil Engineer for over
15 years. He worked as the Engineering Manager for Industrial Plant Construc-
tion at Hyundai Construction Company before joining the Project team. The
Director of the Construction oversees all construction activity on the site
and is responsible for all related activities such as mobilization of manpower
and equipment. The appointee to the job has been responsible for the construc-
tion of numerous significant projects for the Construction Company for the
past 12 years.
6.        The Supply Office is responsible for the procurement and delivery
of all construction and ancillary supplies. This office would also carry
out the function of procuring equipment for the Project, in consultation
with the Project Planning and Coordination office. The Director for
Finance and Accounting is responsible for all financial and cost-control
aspects for the Project. The Directors all report to the Project leader
directly.
Project Planning and Coordinating Office
7.        This office carries out the important function of planning for
the Project beyond the Construction phase. It is responsible for facility
design, equipment selection, development of required resources and initial
development of the market. In addition it serves as the interface between
the remainder of the Project team and the Government, other outside agencies
and the existing HII organization. The selected commercial manager has 12
years prior experience in Hyundai Group Companies in administrative and
supply functions. Since 1968, he has been responsible for HII's license
negotiations for existing operations and also served as the Coordinator
of the Gunpo Expansion financed by the Asian Development Bank.
Licensing
8.        The negotiation of licenses has already been undertaken and would
continue to proceed through the first phase. This function is planned to
be handled at the highest level with close collaboration between the
President, the Project leader, the Director Project Planning and Coordinating
and other staff with experience relevant to the license under discussion from
both the technical and commercial points of view.



ANNEX 6-1
Page 3
C.   Operations Start-up Phase
9.        The organization for this second phase will begin to take the
form of the final organization, discussed below. The main difference would
be one in emphasis awarded to various functions. The single most important
function in this phase would be the successful transfer and implementation
of technology. The technical organization and the role of expatriates and
the Director of Technology Transfer would be critical at this stage. The
technical organization chart is presented and discussed in Annex 4-3, as are
the functions of the Director of Technology Transfer, and the involvement of
expatriates.
D.   General Operational Organization
10.       The existing organization of HII (Annex 2-2) is structured function-
ally with the overall responsibilities for the Gunpo and Anyang plants being
combined under one senior Director. The Company plans to set up a divisional
structure with parallel organization for the Project, under the President,
reflecting the size and importance of the Project in relation to existing
operations. The organization would move away from the Project form and be
directed towards the large scale of operations planned under the Project. The
divisional organization for the Project would be functionally oriented with the
greatest emphasis being placed on the critical functions of engineering and
production. The proposed organization is shown in Annex 2-3 and discussed
below.
The Policy Committee
11.       The Company proposes to set up a Policy Committee comprising the
President, Executive Vice-President and Vice-Presidents of the Project
organization, of existing opertions and of corporate functions. The Policy
Committee would essentially be a development of the consultation committee
discussed earlier and would broadly be responsible for two areas:
(i) Basic policy development including development of effective
senior management; and
(ii) Major pricing and delivery decisions involving market situation
and strategy, price and cost strategy and technical delivery
decisions.
In addition the Committee will serve as a strong link between existing and
Project operations, and coordinate matters such as bidding for equipment
to be jointly supplied by the Project and Gunpo.
Vice-President Changwon
12.       The Vice-President would be responsible to the President for the
overall execution of the Project. He would also be responsible to the Policy
Committee for technology transfer and manpower development. He would be
assisted by his team of Senior Directors.



ANNEX 6-1
Page 4
Senior Director Operations
13.       He would be responsible for overall operations management through
Directors of Manufacturing, Engineering and Installation and Service. He
would also be assisted by managers (not shown in Chart) in two key areas:
(i) Manager of Quality Assurance responsible for all aspects of
quality including laboratory services; and
(ii) Manager of Contract Coordination responsible for ensuring
coordination between engineering, manufacturing and instal-
lation and assisting the Senior Director Operations in
preparation of technical and delivery recommendations to the
Policy Committee.
Senior Director Finance
14.       The Directors for Cost Control, and Accounting will report to this
Senior Director who would be directly responsible to the Vice-President for
the Project and the Policy Committee. To ensure integration he would also
have an indirect relationship with the corporate Vice-President, Finance.
Production cost control is expected to be critical to the success of the
Project and accordingly HII proposes to appoint Managers for the functions of
Project Cost Control, Product Costing, Variance and Performance analysis.
Directors of Administration and Marketing/sales
15.       The Director of Administration would be responsible for all
administrative and personnel activities in collaboration with the corporate
office. The proposed Marketing organization and functions, to be centralized
at the corporate level, are discussed in Annex 3-3.
E.   Conclusion
16.       The proposed organization, separate from the existing operations
and integrated at the top through the Policy Committee and additional integrated
functions such as administration, finance and marketing, is considered satis-
factory for the Project. The separation is important in view of the size and
multi-product nature of the Project, quite beyond that of the existing opera-
tions. The coordination at the top should prove useful in drawing in existing
in-house experience and ensuring co-operation between Gunpo and the Project in
terms of resource utilization and component and parts supplies. The functional
form is considered appropriate for the planned production volume and it is
expected that as some product groups gain importance the organization would
be restructured along product-group lines.

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Introduction
1.        The implementation schedule for the Project is shown in Chart 1.
Site development and preparation for commencement of construction is already
underway. Two sheds have been constructed to serve as a site-office and as
dormitory space for the 22 personnel currently located there. The President
has signed an order for release of the green-belt area for the plant, formal
approval from the Government was granted at the end of 1976. A great deal
of planning work had been completed in anticipation of this approval.
Following finalization of details construction activity at a full scale will
commence in the second quarter of 1977 and the Project is scheduled to be
completed by the end of 1979. The Project is expected to reach the steady
state of operation by 1983.
B.   Implementation Steps
2.        As indicated in Chart 1, implementation is planned to proceed in
the following stages:
1.   Project Development
3.        The major parameters of the Project along with equipment require-
ments have been developed. These have been reviewed by HII with the assistance
of consultants in the machining and assembly area (Ingersoll Manufacturing
Consultants, already appointed) and are to be finalized following review by an
operating company in the forge and foundry area (assistance agreement to be
signed shortly). The review and detailed planning effort is expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 1977.
2.   Procurement
4.        The initial phases of procurement upto the prequalification stage
have been substantially completed. Following Bank approval advertisements for
prequalification were placed in a number of international periodicals and the
results are encouraging. The finalization of equipment specifications is
planned to take place in stages in the first two quarters of 1977. As packages
of equipment are finalized, tender documents are being prepared and following
Bank approval bidding documents will begin to be sent out in tMarch 1977. For
further details see Annex 6-3, Procurement.



ANNEX 6-2

3.   Site Development and Civil Works
5.        The next step in this area is the mobilization of adequate re-
sources, manpower and equipment, substantially completed as scheduled by the
end of March 1977. The approach road being built by the provincial government
(Annex 4-8, Infrastructure) will be ready for passage of one truck by May.
The Korea Electric Company has also agreed to provide temporary construction
power at that time. Earth-work including land-filling is scheduled to begin
by April and with other construction work would be carried out by HII with the
assistance of the Hyundai Construction Company. In view of the Company's
recent successful experience at Gunpo, the approach is considered satisfactory.
The equipment to be mobilized is shown in Table 1.
4.   Building Works:
6.        The building works for all facilities will generally proceed simul-
taneously, the residential facilities, training center and transformer station
being scheduled for completion by the end of 1977. HII would import a part
of their requirements of structural steels expected to be on hand by September
1977. HII will do a major portion of the structural work in-house. Piling
and heavy foundation work is scheduled to begin in October 1977. A large
portion of the building works would be completed by September 1978, the
forge and foundry shop by the end of 1978 and the warehouse facilities by
mid-1979. The installation of the main utilities would proceed simultaneously
with the construction of the buildings.
5.   Equipment Ordering and Installation
7.        Machinery order placement is expected to commence in July 1977 after
loan-aproval by the Bank, packages being sequentially ordered through the end
of December. The schedule is consistent with the implementation program,
and takes into account the different delivery periods for machinery. This
proposed timing would apply to directly purchased equipment. License or
manufacturing agreements for the purchase of knock-down kits for equipment to
be fabricated and erected in-house would be discussed and negotiated simul-
taneously. As the critical items of purchased equipment are installed, they
would be put into operation in manufacturing products and in fabricating
parts for the knock-down kic equipment. For example, in the Foundry and
Forge Shop, the 20-ton electric arc and holding furnace as well as the 100-
ton hydraulic press are scheduled to be operational by the end of 1973 and
would subsequently be utilized to manufacture heavy structural elements for
the 100-ton units and for the 800-ton hydraulic press. Installation of
such equipment would proceed through the end of 1979.
6.   Operations Start-up
8.        Start-up of the various facilities is planned to be phased to
maximize the in-house content of the equipment through the knock-down kit

approach and for items such as welding tables. The proposed approach has
the advantage of lowering investment cost and at the same time providing
an opportunity for productive training. As indicated, the training center
would be the first facility to be operational beginning January, 1978 but
actual training of the work-force will begin even earlier especially in the
area of fabrication. Of the plant facilities, the Light Machinery Shop would
come on-stream next followed by the Fabrication Shop and the light equipment
in the Foundry and Forge shop. These facilities scheduled to be fully com-
pleted by the end of 1978 would in fact begin manufacture of products with
the assistance of the Gunpo plant by mid-1978. In this period they would
also be involved in fabricating the knock-down kit equipment for the heavy
portion of the foundry and forge and cranage equipment for the Heavy Machinery
and Assembly Shops. These heavy facilities would be the last to become
operational, the Heavy Machine Shop, the Assembly Shop and The Foundry and
Forge in that sequence. In terms of fixed facilities the Project is scheduled
to be fully operational by the end of 1979.
C.   Conclusions
10.       The implementation schedule outlined above is considered achievable
in view of the Company's past performance, especially in light of its recent
experience at Gunpo where the work is proceeding nearly six months ahead
of schedule. However, the review to be undertaken with the assistance of an
operating company in the forge/foundry area could lead to some minor revisions.

BASIS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.        Details on sales and operating costs for the project are given in
Annexes 7-2 and 7-3. The information contained in these annexes has been
used to prepare the projected income statements for the project alone given
in Annex 7-4, page 2.
2.        Projected income statements for HII as a whole (Annex 7-4, page 1)
are based on those for existing operations (Annex 2-9, page 2) plus those for
the project (Annex 7-4, page 2).
3.        Projected balance sheets for HII as a whole (Annex 7-6) are based
on those for existing operations (Annex 2-9, page 4) plus additional needs
due to the project as determined in the source and application of funds
forecasts contained in Annex 7-5.

ANNEX 7-2
Page 1
KOREA
HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
HII: PROJECTED SALES
A.   Steady State Sales
1.        The sales plan for the project is based on output capabilities
at the 1983 steady state. At that time, the project will have reached fully
efficient operations and, based on installed capacity, available man and
machine hours, will be capable of producting:
(a) Equipment for one 3 million ton steel plant every three years;
(b) Equipment for 1,000 MW of power plant each year;
(c) A complete mix of chemical and petro-chemical plant equipment;
and
(d) Small fabricated items, forgings and castings to achieve full
capacity utilization.
Details of equipment to be produced by the project at the 1983 steady state
are given in Table 1 of this annex.
B.   Selling Price Assumptions
2.        Selling prices assumed for project sales are mid-1976 prices for
similar types of equipment purchased by Korean enterprises from suppliers
in Japan, Western Europe and the U.S. In particular:
(a) Steel Plant: Actual purchase prices for POSCO's third expansion
which is presently under construction, have been used as the basis
of steel plant selling prices. Purchase prices for the first and
second expansions (completed in 1973 and 1976 respectively), ad-
justed to mid-1976 price levels, were used in a few cases where
information on the third expansion was not available.
(b) Power Plant: Actual prices at which KECO has purchased equipment
for their current power plant projects were used as the basis
of selling prices.
(c) Chemical Plant: Selling prices are based on prices from
Japanese suppliers, which have been the main source of equipment
for recent expansion projects in the Korean chemical and petro-
chemical industry.



ANNEX 7-2
Page 2
3.        Selling prices have been inflated from mid-1976 levels using the
following inflation rates: 8%, 1977-79, and 7% thereafter. These rates are
the same as the international inflation rates used for the calculation of
equipment cost contingency allowances.
4.        In the calculation of selling prices, no account has been taken
of the fact that in the later years of the project HII will be bidding for
steel, power and chemical plant on a turn-key basis. Accordingly, actual sales
will include equipment not identified in Table 1, to be manufactured by other
suppliers subcontracted by HII, as well as revenues for construction, erection
and installation of the plants as a whole. The sales forecasts based on the
equipment list in Table 1 are thus conservative.
C.   Sales Build-up to the Steady State
5.        Since it is still too early for Hyundai to have received orders
for equipment to be produced by the project, sales through to the 1983
steady state are based on the assessment of the domestic market detailed in
Annex 3-2. Consideration was also given to the build-up of in-house manufac-
turing capability from start-up in 1978 to steady state operations in 1983.
For example, in 1978, it is estimated that HII wil produce about 49% of its
output in-house, rising to 81% by 1983. Application of in-house manufactur-
ing percentages to annual sales gives an indication of the "value-added" by
HII each year. Thus, even though total sales are relatively high in the
early years of project operations, many of the components will be bought-out
from foreign suppliers rather than manufactured by HII. Details on sales
projections for the project are shown in Table 2 of this annex.
D.   Areas of Conservatism in Sales Forecasts
6.        The sales forecasts given Table 2 are believed to be conservative,
for the following reasons:
(a) Sales are forecast for the original equipment market only.
No account has been taken of potential sales to the replacement
market.
(b) No account is taken of possible export sales. In particular,
HII alone or in association with its licensors, will be capable
of supplying equipment to offshore markets.

HII: PROJECTED OPERATING COSTS
A.   Material Costs
1.        Material costs are based on analysis of raw material and bought-out
parts requirements for 1983 steady state production as obtained by HII from
its licensors. Information on quantities (tonnages) required is given in
Annex 4-5. Quantities have been priced by HII using mid-1976 prices obtained
from local and foreign suppliers/licensors (the latter being the chief source
of bought-out parts). On this basis, material costs in the 1983 steady
state, in constant 1976 prices, are as follows:
Steady State Material Costs
(Constant 1976 US$ millions)
Local       Foreign
Raw      Bought-out   Bought-out

Total Material Costs        139.0         31.2         42.7          212.9
Percentage Allocation          65%          15%          20%           100%
2.        Total material costs amount to 53.8% of sales at the steady state
(US$396 million). Based on information gathered by the Bank, this percentage
is comparable with that achieved by similar heavy equipment manufacturers
in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan.



ANNEX 7-3
Page 2
3.        Material costs in the years prior to the steady state, 1978-82,
were arrived at for each product line in the following manner:
(a)  Raw materials and bought-out parts requirements, 1978-
82, were costed in the same manner as done for require-
ments at the steady state (para. 1). In the early years
of project operations, bought-out parts will be a much
higher percentage of total material costs than at the
steady state. Accordingly, material costs as a percentage
of sales will be significantly greater in the early
years, reflecting the higher cost of bought-out parts.
(b)  Inefficiency factors were applied to raw materials costs
in the years prior to the steady state in order to
reflect higher unit costs as a result of smaller volume
purchasing and larger process losses which can be
expected in these years. The factors applied to base
raw material costs are:
1978 - 150%, 1979 - 140%, 1980 - 120%, 1981 - 120%, 1982 - 110%.
4.        Inflation of material costs is projected at the same rate as that
for sales. This is believed reasonable in light of the fact a high percent-
age of materials will be imported (thereby following international inflation
rates) and that HII, as the sole Korean manufacturer of steel, power and
chemical plant equipment, should be able to recover any material cost in-
creases above those projected through higher prices for its final product.
5.        Based on the above, material costs as a percentage of sales for
1978-83, are projected as follows:
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983
Material Costs as % of
Sales                        77.8%   74.9%   70.2%   64.8%   59.3%   53.8%
B.   Labor Costs
6.        The project will require a total of 7,780 men at steady state
operations in 1983. Of these, 6,790 will be involved in manufacturing opera-
tions, the remaining 990 representing general and administrative staff.
Detailed manpower projections are given in Annex 4-7. Labor costs are based
on actual 1976 wage and salary levels which include fringe benefits and annual
bonuses of between 2 and 3 month's salary:



ANNEX 7-3
Page 3
Average Annual Salaries and Wages
(Constant 1976 Won)
Laborers                                      950,000
Shop Engineers                              3,400,000
Works Management                            3,400,000
Expatriates                                19,200,000
7.        Annual wages of Korean employees have been increased by a factor
of 20% annually, 1977-1978. This is in line with wage inflation in the
Korean manufacturing sector 1971-75 (as per Economic Statistics Yearbook, Bank
of Korea, 1976). For 1980 and beyond, wages are assumed to inflate by 15%
annually. These rates are felt to be reasonable and reflect the expected
real gains in Korean wage rates as development proceeds. Inflation of
expatriate salaries is forecast at 8% annually, in line with international
inflation rates.
8.        Labor costs projected for 1978 and 1979 take into account the
fact that, in these years, HII will manufacture some equipment for the project
in-house, using the knock-down kit approach. A total of Won 0.5 billion
in 1978, and Won 1.1 billion in 1979 has been transferred from labor costs
to fixed assets in these years to reflect the proper allocation of labor
costs to the cost of equipment manufactured in-house.
C.   Direct Overheads
9.        Direct overheads including:  operating supplies, maintenance,
utilities, and freight are forecast at 7% of sales. This is in line with
HII's experience on existing operations. As with labor costs, direct overheads
have been reduced by Won 0.6 billion and Won 1.2 billion in 1978 and 1979, and
charged to the cost of equipment manufactured in-house.
D.   Royalties and Taxes
10.       Royalties and taxes are forecast at 4% of sales.  The royalties
signed for project operations average about 3% of gross revenues, less compon-
ents purchased from the licensor. A flat 2.5% has thus been assumed as the
net royalty fee. By law, a business tax is charged at the rate of 1.5% on
all revenues.



ANNEX 7-3
Page 4
E.   Selling and Administrative Expenses
11.       Selling and administrative expenses for the project are forecast
at 7a' of sales. This is somewhat lower than the 9% presently experienced
in HII's existing operations and reflects the fact that the project will,
to some extent, share common management, services and facilities with
existing operations, thereby realizing certain economies of scale.
F.   Depreciation and Amortization
12.       HII depreciates fixed assets on a declining balace basis, at the
same rates allowed for tax purposes. These are: buildings, 5.6% annually,
and machinery and equipment, 18.9% annually. Nlo depreciation is taken on
fixed asset additions during the year. The annual depreciation charge is
thus based on net fixed assets at the end of the previous year. It is
assumed that no revaluations of fixed assets, which are periodically allowed
under Korean tax law, will occur over the forecast period. This assumption
is conservative in that, although it understates depreciation, taxes are
correspondingly overstated thereby understating cash flow and the after-tax
financial rate of return on the Project.
13.       Deferred charges, representing pre-operating expenses, are
amortized on the same basis as allowed for tax purposes -- 33% each year
on a declining balance basis.
G.   Interest Expense
14.       Interest is capitalized during the project construction period
1977-79. For 1980 and following years, interest expense is based on the
following assumptions on loan amounts and terms (note that interest on the
Bank loan includes a 2% guarantee fee to the Government):
Interest
Amount          Rate              Repayment
(US$ millions)
World Bank              80.0          10.2    14 years including 4 years' grace
Bilateral Credits       46.7           8.0    12 years including 3 years' grace
Foreign Commercial
Banks                 11.9          11.0      7 years including 3 years' grace
Government Loan         79.4          13.0      8 years including 3 years' grace



ANNEX 7-3
Page 5
H.   Income Taxes
15.       An income tax of 40% and a defense tax of 10% are calculated on
pre-tax earnings, resulting in an effective tax rate of 50%. Losses on the
project, 1978-81, are offset against earnings from HIT's other operations.
Also, HII is entitled to an investment tax credit of 8% of the cost of fixed
assets for the Project. This tax credit (Won 9.6 billion) is applied against
income taxes on HII's other operations. It may not, however, be used to offset

FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions
1.        The financial rate of return calculations are based on the incremental
capital cost, operating cost, and revenue streams shown on page 2 of this annex.
All streams have been deflated to 1976 price terms on the basis of international
inflation rates: 8%, 1977-79, and 7% thereafter.
2.        Other basic assumptions used in the financial rate of return calculation
are as follows:
Construction Period:      4 years
Life of Project:          18 years from the date of mechanical completion

ANNEX 8-1

HEAVY MACHINERY PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions
The economic rate of return for the Project has been calculated on
the basis of cost and benefit streams expressed in 1976 constant terms. These
streams are based on those used for the financial rate of return calculation
(Annex 7-8) adjusted to reflect costs and benefits to the economy as a whole.
No shadow pricing of labor or foreign exchange has been used. Adjustments to
the financial rate of return calculations are as follows:
(a) Capital Costs: Business taxes at 1.5% of the value of local mater-
ials have been excluded from local components of capital costs and
working capital needs. The Project is 90% exempt from import duties
(which would normally average 20%) on fixed assets; a defense tax of
2.5%, however, must still be paid. Total duties and taxes of 4.5%
have thus been excluded from foreign fixed assets for the Project.
Imported materials for working capital needs will also be largely
exempt from duties since such materials will be incorporated
into products to be sold to entities such as KECO and POSCO which,
like HII, are 90% exempt from duties on their expansion programs.
Thus, duties and taxes assumed to average 5%, have been excluded
from foreign working capital needs.
(b) Operating Costs: Duties and defense taxes, averaging 5%, have been
excluded from foreign material costs. Business taxes of 1.5% have
been excluded from local material co ts.
(c) Revenues: No changes have been made to benefit stream which are
already valued at international prices.
