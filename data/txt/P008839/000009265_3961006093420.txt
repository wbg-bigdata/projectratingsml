MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED ENTERPRISE SUPPORT LOAN
TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Enterprise Support Loan to the Russian Federation in the amount of US$200 million equivalent to
initiate term lending through commercial banks to private enterprises to help support the continued
transformation of the enterprise sector. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable rate with a
maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace. Cofinancing would be provided by the European
Ban. for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (US$ i1O million).
A. SECTORAL CONTEXT
1.    Eteprise Sector. Russia has embarked on an extensive transformation of its economy. One
of the most far reaching transformations has taken place in the enterprise sector, where the
Government has made dramatic progress in the area of eAivatization. As of March 1994, some 8,500
medium and large enterprises were privatized, under Russia's Mass Privatization Program,
representing close to 40% of the total number of medium and large enterprises and 40% of Russia's
industrial work force. More than one-third of the roughly 250,000 small scale enterprises were
privatized by the end of the first quarter of 1994. In addition, close to a million private businesses
have been registered in Russia, mostly small new entries. Thesa privatized and new private
enterprises urgently need access to funds for investments, working capital, and to technical assistance
to improve efficiency.
2.    In July 1993, at their summit in Tokyo, the G-7 group of governments outlined a Privatization
and Restructuring Program (PRP) to support the Russian Government's program of assistance to
private enterprises. The PRP includes grant and loan resources from international financial
institutions, bilateral sources, and export credit agencies (ECA). Within the PRP framework loans to
private and newly privatized enterprises are to be provided through commercial banks and ECA,
equity through regionally based enterprise funds (REFs), and technical assistance to enterprises
through regionally based Local Privatization Centers (LPCs). LPCs and REFs will be established in
the same regions (one or several oblasts each). Commercial banks, through their branch network,
will be present as well. This provides a core of regions where enterprises will have comprehensive
access to technical assistance, loan finance and equity finance. The joint local presence of banks,
REFs, and LPCs is likely to generate opportunities for cofinancing and other forms of business
cooperation beneficial to the enterprises. The banks will also lend in areas where there are no REFs
and LPCs, In these areas they or the enterprises will have to identify other sources of technical
assistance. This problem will diminish over time as more REFs and LPCs are established. Three
LPCs have been established and 10 are expected to be in operation by the end of 1994. Two REFs
have been established and several more will be established during the next few months. Within the
PRP framework IBRD would provide loan finance to enterprises through the proposed project, while
accrediting and strengthening the commercial banks through the recently approved Financial
Institutions Development Project (FIDP). IFC is establishing a REF in Nizhny Novgorod.



2-
3.    Financial Seor. New banks have proliferated and their number has grown from less than 100
in 1988 to almost 2000 in 1993. Over the short to medium term, commercial banks are likely to
remain the main channel for resource flows from savers to net users. Until controlling stakes in
enterprises can be acquired by outside investors, the banks will also remain the main external control
over enterprise management. Banks' lending decisions will crucially affect the speed and direction of
enterprise restructuring. Among the large number of new banks in Russia, there may be up tc 100
comunercial banks that are evolving into real banking institutions. They are working on strengthening
their balance sheets and their banking skills, and some of them are also trying to reduce their single
borrower and connected party exposure. While their number and the volume of their operatio-ns is
still relatively small, they are growing fast and are involved in profitable and genuine banking
activities- lending to the emerging private sector, lending for foreign trade and raising foreign
currency deposits. Although the banks have some of the best financial and business talent a-ailable in
Russia, they have stili to grow into mature financial institutions through improvements in management
and organization and training of a large number of staff to acquire modern market-based banking
skills. Most banks also lack clearly articulated business plans and their technology is at an early stage
of development. For a core group of commercial banks, these shortcomings are addressed by the
FIDP.
B. Proiect Objectives and Descriptioon
4.    The objective of the project is to assist a core group of commercial banks to initiate term
lending to private enterprises which, in selected regions, will also have access to equity financing
from some ten REFs and technical assistance from some ten LPCs under the G-7 program. The term
finance would be for relatively small capital investments and permanent working capital, leading over
time to substantial improvements in enterprise efficiency, particularly if combined with the
development of enterprise business plans for which the banks will provide technical assistance.
Enterprises may also turn to the LPCs for technical assistance resources when preparing project
proposals and business plans.
5.    Twenty candidate PBs have been preliminarily selected during a multi-stage selection process
carried out since mid-1993 in the context of the FIDP in close collaboration with the Russian
authorities and with the support from a number of donors. The accreditation of these banks is under
way. Additional banks meeting the selection criteria could be accredited during project
implementation, but in order to retain manageability, it is intended to allow participation by at most
35 banks.
6.    The 20 banks are in 9 cities spanning the Russian Federation: four in St. Petersburg, six in
Moscow, one in Togliatti, two in Ekaterinburg, one in Tyumen, one in Omsk, two in Kemerovo, one
in Khabarovsk, and two in Vladivostok. Through their branch networks, these banks serve all major
economic areas of the country. The regional representation is consistent with the emerging
geographic pattern of REFs and LPCs which are being established under the G-7 program in some 10
areas of Western and Southern Russia, Siberia, the Urals and the Far East.
7.    The total estimated loan demand from 11 of the first 20 banks to be accredited is about US$
360 million. This suggests that the combined IBRD/EBRD lending of US$ 300 million will be taken
up. There is upside potential from the other 9 candidate banks as well as from additional banks that
may be accredited, although these are smaller. On the other hand, it is not easy to predict the rate at



-3 -
which the banks will be accredited, nor the quality and number of initial projects they will propose.
Macroeconomic and political uncertainties also need to be considered. An early follow-up operation
would be considered if needed.
8.   TSe principal terms and conditions for the line of credit are:
(a)    Eligible sub-borrowers will be legally separate civilian enterprises with at least 75 percent
private ownership. The acquisition of land, refinancing of existing obligations, and tobacco
re1ated investments will not be eligible for financing. Sub-loans will be made for productive
investment, incremental permanent working capital in industry and services, and associated
feasibility and other studies. Sub-loans for real estate development would be in pilot areas
and according to special criteria and procedures acceptable tc the Bank. Sub-loans will be
evaluated in &acordance with the normal project and credit evaluation procedures of the PB,
including a satisfactory business plan for the enterprise. Subprojects will have to comply
with the environmental standards of the natienal environmental protection agencies and
standards acceptable to the Bank.
(b)    PB will be required to submit to the Bank for approval the following sub-loans: (i) the ficst
two sub-loan appraisals of each PB; (ii) sub-loans above US$ 5 million or greater than 10
percent of the commercial bank's capital or greater than 20 percent of the commercial bank's
capital if the sub-loan cofinances an equity investment by a REF; and (iii) sub-loans financing
real estate development.
(c)    Only commercial banks which have been audited and accredited under FIDP procedures
would be allowed to participate in the credit line. Accredited commercial banks will also
undertake, under the FIDP, an institutional strengthening program and demonstrate
achievement of agreed milestones of prudential standards and performance improvement.
(d)    Government would make subsidiary loans to commercial banks which would borrow under
the following main terms and conditions:
(i)    Funds will be available on a first come first serve basis, up to 100 percent of each
bank's capital.
(ii)   The currency will be US Dollars. The interest rate cnarged will be equal to the base
rate of the weighted average cost of funds to the Government' plus 2.5 percent and
rounded up to the nearest 0.5 percent interval. The base rate will be adjusted semi-
annually and the subsidiary interest rate will be adjusted as required by the above
formula. At present this would imply a rate of around 9 percent p.a. The PBs will
be free to set their lending rates in response to market conditions.
"The base rate is calculated according to the following formula: (2/3)[World Bank VLR] +
(1I3)ILIBOR + 1%1



-4-
(iii)   A signing fee of US$ 25,000 will be payable at the time of signing of the subsidiary
loan agreement and would count against interest charges incurred under the
agreement.
(iv)   The subsidiary loan term will be for 12 years, including a grace period of two years.
Sub-loans will have a maturity of not less than I year and not more than 9 years, will
be in US Dollars with the foreign exchange risk borne by the sub-borrower, will not
exceed US$ 10 million unless otherwise agreed by the Bank, and their grace neriod
will not exceed 2 years. The PB will be required to utilize the liquidity that arises
from the mis-matching of the terms of the subsidiary loans and those of the sub-loans
to the enterprises for financing furiter loans to eligible enterprises for eligible
purposes. Any reflows to the Government will be kept in a separate account and used
only to either service the JBRD/EBRD loans or for relending to the banks under the
terms of the proposed project.
(v)    The commitment period for subsidiary loans under the credit line will be 3 years, and
the disbursement period 5 years, both from IBRD/EBRD loan effectiveness.
9.    The project will be cofinanced with the EBRD, which will provide a loan of US$ 100 million.
The Bank and EBRD loans will be made to the Russian Federation represented by the Ministry of
Finance. The Government will bear the cross-currency risk on the Bank loan and the bank default
riak. Estimated costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events is given in Schedule C.
C. Pr-e  Imlementati
10.   Decisions regarding the accreditation status of banks will be made jointly by the Minister of
Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank of Russia, who will be advised by senior bankers in a
Bank Review Unit (BRU). The BRU will analyze the performance of the PB. report on their financial
condition and compliance with prudential standards, develop corrective action programs with the
management of problem banks and monitor performance under such programs. A Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), reporting to the MoF, will be responsible for the day-to-day
implementation of the project. The same PIU will also administer the FIDP. The PlU's function will
be strictly administrative and supportive, and will not intrude on the business of the PBs. The
Government will sub-contract the PIW's duties and activities to a consulting firm.
11.   The project will be jointly supervised by Bank and EBRD staff. Given the number of banks
involved and the need for prior review of a significant portion of the sub-loans due to the
unfamiliarity of banks and sub-borrowers with term finance, procurement and disbursement, project
supervision input by Bank staff is expected to be substantial, particularly at the early stage of project
implementation. A project supervision plan with the schedule for supervision inputs and the skills
mix required has been developed.

D. Projct ustinaility
12.   The strongest and most promising among the emerging private sector banks will participate in
the proposed project. They will subscribe to recognized prudential and general performance standards
and carry out institutional development programs, including twinning with foreign banks. The
aicreditation process remains open and additional banks could join the proposed project and/or
successor operations. Because subsidiary loans will have twelve year terms, the PBs will be able to
sustain term lending to enterprises through several project cycles.
E. Lessons Leamed from Past Expoerience
13.   In a number of reforming countries in Central and Eastern Europe, severe difficulties have
been experienced in the disbursement of credit lines, due primarily to a financial environment that
deters enterprises and banks from borrowing and lending term resources at market rates. These
problems are also present in Russia. However, loan demand has been measured conservatively, the
proposed project will work through the most competent of the emerging conunercial banks, and it
focuses on ensuring intermediation quality by stressing broad operational strengthening of each PB
and the adherence to agreed prudential criteria. Experience elsewhere suggests the importance of
social considerations in enterprise restructuring. The principal vehicles for addressing the social
dimensions of the privatization and restructuring process 's would be the Bank's Community Support
Project, which is under preparation outside the proposed project, and the Bank's existing Employment
Services and Social Protection Project. Finally, the Bank's limited operational experience in Russia
demonstrates the need for strong implementing capacity and a very substantial implementing effort
from the Bank. Project design and implementation plan take these lessons into full account.
F. Rationale for Bank Involvement
14    The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Russia was discussed with the Board
on May 19, 1994 in the context of the FIDP. At that time, the Bank recommended an Intermediate
Case lending program on the order of $1-1.5 billion annually (not including quick-disbursing
lending). The proposed project is included as one of the operations under the Intermediate Case
program. As described in the CAS, one of the major objectives of the Bank's involvement in Russia
is to support the development of a market-oriented economy based on private sector initiatives. The
proposed project provides an overall framework for assistance to the private sector by external
financing agencies which can make a valuable contribution to supporting the growth of the private
sector in Russia. The Bank has taken a leadership role in mobilizimg support for this framework by
other donors, thereby contributing to the objective stated in the CAS of establishing the Bank as a
trusted adviser to the Government. The proposed project is therefore fully consistent with the Banks
strategy for assistance to Russia. The Status of Bank Group Operations is shown in Schedule D.
G. Agree Actions
15    During negotiations, agr3ement has been reached with Government on all terms and
conditions for the credit line. Conditions of effectiveness for the proposed project are: (i) at least
four PBs have been accredited; (ii) the consulting firm to carry out the PIU's activities has been
selected and a contract with this firm has been signed; (iii) effectiveness of the FIDP loan; and (iv) all



6 -
conditions precedent to the EBRD) loan have . n met. other than those related to the effectiveness of
the Bank's loan agreement.
H. Envik, -ment
16.   The project has been rated Category B. An environmental manual will set out thie criteria for
sub-project classification and environmental analyses reqouired. 'The PIU will be responsible for
disseminating the manual to the PBs and for monitoring compliance. The PBs will ensure that the
sub-projects are appropriately classified and that the sub-project documentation contains the necessary
analyses and remedial measures. The enterprises will be responsible for preparation of enviromnental
analyses, obtaining any licences and permits from the appropriate Russian environmental authorities,
and for the implementation of remedial measures.
1. Pro ect Benefits and Risks
17.   Benefits. The project will assist a core group of commercial banks to initiate term lending to
private enterprises. The term finance will be for capital investments and permanent working capital,
helping some enterprises to achieve substantial efficiency improvements as part of their restructuring
efforts and others to expand and to seize growth opportunities.
18.   Risks. The project faces substantial risks. One risk is the unstable macroeconomic situation
which makes lending and borrowing risky and which in some cases may lead to resource allocation
decisions based on financial signals that differ from economic ones. Some degree of alleviation is
provided by the fact that sub-loans are not likely to finance major new industrial facilities and
equipment, but incremental investments and working capital with relatively short gestation periods.
Larger investments will be reviewed by the Bank, taking into account the economic rate of return,
and sectors with major price distortions would be excluded. Another risk stems from institutional
weaknesses. The private commercial banks are new, some of them are relatively small, and are still
learning traditional commercial bank functions. Term financing would be an added element of risk
for them. Technical assistance and close supervision under the FIDP will be provided to control this
risk. There are also risks associated with lack of loan demand and loan repayments. Regarding the
former, the loan amount has been conservatively estimated based on a carefully designed enterprise
survey and extensive interviews with the commercial banks. With respect to the default risk, the
commercial banks are very risk averse and have thus far maintained acceptable collection rates.
J. Recommendation
19.   1 am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.
