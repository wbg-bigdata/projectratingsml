Memorandum and Recommendation of the President
of the IDA to the Executive Directors
on a Proposed Credit to the Republic of Bolivia
for a Rural Water and Sanitation Project
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development Credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR13.4 million, the equivalent of US$20.0 million, to
help finance a Rural Water and Sanitation Project. The Credit would be on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years.
Country/Sector Background
2.     Bolivia has the lowest water and sanitation coverage in Latin America. According to the 1992
census, coverage for rural populations is only 24 percent for water and 17 percent for sanitation. In smaller
communities and dispersed populations-84 percent of the rural population lives in communities of fewer
than 100 inhabitants-water and sanitation coverage is even worse. In towns that have water supply
systems, service quality is poor and sanitary standards are not enforced. Sewerage systems, where they
exist, are unreliable, and sewage is normally discharged into natural drainage systems without any control.
Water sources, even in remote communities, contain pollution levels that require disinfection to meet Pan-
American Health Organization standards for safe human consumption. The dismal state of water and
sanitation services is responsible for waterbome diseases, which remain the most frequently reported and
widespread illness in the country. Enteric diseases are the second cause of mortality among all age groups,
and Bolivia has the second highest rate of infant mortality in Latin America-75 deaths per 1,000 live
births, according to the 1992 census-with intestinal infections the leading cause. In rural Bolivia the lack
of adequate water supply facilities forces households to devote substantial amounts of time to fetching
water from distant sources, frequently unsafe for human consumption. This burden falls disproportionately
on women and children.
3.    In 1991 Bolivian authorities initiated a major institutional restructuring of the water and sanitation sector
by creating the National Directorate of Water and Sanitation (DINASBA) under the Ministry of Urban Affairs.
The enactment of the Popular Participation Law in 1994 and its relevant implementation decrees decentralized
responsibility for water and sanitation in rural areas to newly established municipal governments and their local
communities. Regional development corporations have been responsible to date for providing technical assistance
to the new entities. Following a recently enacted Decentralization Law in August 1995, the country's
Departmental governments will take on the responsibility hitherto assigned to the Regional Development
Corporations at the start of January 1996.
4.     Bolivia launched a second-generation reform program in 1994. Capitalization and popular
participation are the two key underpinnings of an ambitious strategy to remove the remaining structural
constraints and to allow Bolivia to achieve more rapid and equitable economic growth. The Capitalization
Law establishes the principles for fundamental changes in the regulatory framework of public services,
including water and sanitation. The recently approved Rural Communities Development Project (CR-2772-
BO) will assist the government to implement the Popular Participation Law.
5.    Nongovernmental organizations play an important role in the poor and rural areas of Bolivia.
These organizations manage about US$200 million a year from bilateral agencies and the government-a
considerable sum compared with total government expenditures of about US$1.7 billion. About 400
nongovernmental organizations are organized in three networks. These groups are coordinated by the



- 2 -
national Coordinadora de Redes. NGOs will provide assistance in the implementation of this project as
well as in community development activities.
Project Objective
6.     The project's overall goal is to alleviate poverty in rural areas by enhancing productivity in the
rural areas through improved health conditions and a reduction of the time spent collecting water. Specific
objectives include increasing the coverage and sustainable use of water and sanitation services in rural
communities and municipalities, assisting the local water and sanitation units in developing the capacity to
provide technical assistance to municipal governments and local communities, supporting the sustainability
of water and sanitation services through extensive training of community-level operators and
administrators, and strengthening the capacity of DINASBA to formulate policies, prepare technical
standards, and mobilize financial resources. Both overall and specific objectives will be measured against
well-defined and measurable monitoring indicators shown in Table 3 of Schedule B.
Project Description
7.     The proposed project consists of two main components: (i) rural water and sanitation infrastructure
program; and (ii) technical assistance for building institutional capacity. The infrastructure program (74
percent of total project costs) has two subcomponents, water supply and sanitation. The water supply
subcomponent will provide water supply facilities-both gravity-fed and pumped-as well as shallow wells
with hand pumps and rainwater catchments. The sanitation subcomponent involves small-scale wastewater
collection facilities, treatment and disposal systems, and latrines.
8 .    The technical assistance component (17 percent of total project costs) has three subcomponents.
The first would finance project management to assist the institutions in charge of project implementation.
Tlhis would provide up to 400 staff-months for project management, including consultant services,
equipment, and logistical support to DINASBA and the various departmental water and sanitation units
(UNASBA) throughout Bolivia.
9.    The second subcomponent would finance technical assistance to strengthen sector institutions and
communities in their capacity to provide safe, reliable and sustainable water and sanitation services. This
would finance capacity-building activities ranging from technical advice on operation and maintenance,
management issues, and financial planning to project dissemination and promotion of behavioral changes
through hygiene and environmental education programs. It would also finance a number of studies to
strengthen the sector such as the design and implementation of a cost recovery study as well as the design
and construction of low-cost technologies and community mobilization approaches for specific rural water
and sanitation pilot projects. In addition, this subcomponent would fund a number of impact evaluation
studies, workshops and a management information system to provide feedback so that project
implementation can be adjusted if necessary.
10.   The third subcomponent is a training program that would fund training for stakeholders and
institutions responsible for backstopping water and sanitation services. Municipalities and communities
would receive training in the administration, operation and maintenance, including tariff setting, and water
quality control. This subcomponent would also finance the training of operators and administrators in the
beneficiary communities to administer, operate and maintain water and sanitation services. The training
program includes a certification program to test each trainee who benefits from training, so as to ensure the



- 3 -
quality and consistency of the training. The subcomponent would also finance training for professional and
manufacturers associations to strengthen the human resources that work in the rural water and sanitation
sector.
11.   The project would also finance the repayment of the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance,
and finance the pre-investment studies of the infrastructure program (8 percent of total project costs).
12.   Investment activities initially would be targeted on four Departments: La Paz, Cochabamba,
Chuquisaca, and Potosi. These Departments are characterized by large rural populations-totaling 2.4
million, or about 65 percent of Bolivia's total rural population-and low water supply and sanitation
coverage. Inititally, the project would focus on a few geographic areas within each Department. This would
avoid dispersion of human and financial resources, critical to promoting effective subproject preparation
and ensure early disbursement of funds in the project implementation cycle, giving additional experience for
subsequent years. Project implementation would last four years. The beneficiary communities and the relevant
investment and technical assistance for the first year of project implementation were identified before project
appraisal. Subsequent participation of communities would be govemed by criteria focusing on the priority
assigned to water and sanitation investments in municipal plans, the choice of technology, and the willingness to
pay for the selected service level. The current PPF advance will continue to finance the preparation of investment
programs until Credit effectiveness.
13.   An IDA Credit, equivalent to US$20.0 million-including Project Preparation Facility funds of
US$1.7 million-would help finance 100 percent of foreign costs and 32 percent of local costs. Retroactive
financing of up to US$1.7 million would be permitted for expenditures made in accordance with
procurement procedures agreed to under the project from August 1, 1995, provided that the Credit is signed
no later than July 31, 1996. IDA and the other international donors would finance 70 percent of total
investment costs (i.e., direct construction costs plus the service fee charged by the Social Investment Fund),
which are estimated at US$ 35.7 million. Municipalities would provide 30 percent of the investment costs,
of which 5 percent would be paid to the municipalities by the communities in cash. Each community and its
municipality would enter into an agreement, stipulating the financial terms and conditions of its
contribution to the project. This agreement between community and municipality would include an
additional commitment for in-kind contributions (such as unskilled labor and the provision of local
materials valued against the rural wage rate) by the community to the municipality, equivalent to 15
percent of investment costs. Municipalities would treat the total investment as a municipal asset. The
departmental governments would finance the preparation of subprojects; these costs would equal to about
6.5 percent of direct construction costs. The project cost and financing arrangements are shown in Schedule
A. Project costs and benefits, financing summary, and key performance indicators are shown in Schedule
B. Disbursement, procurement, and withdrawal of Credit proceeds tables, the project timetable, and status
of IDA Credits and IFC Investments are given in Schedules C, D, and E respectively.
Project Implementation
14.   The overall project execution would be under the responsibility of DINASBA, which would ensure
compliance with the Credit Agreement conditions. DINASBA would be responsible for guiding and
monitoring the implementation of the overall project, as well as for managing the technical assistance
component according to terms of reference agreed at appraisal. The Social Investment Fund (SIF) would be
responsible for managing the investment component following the procedures which have been developed
earlier with IDA assistance. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been selected to
procure consultants and equipment required for the technical assistance component. The Departmental



- 4 -
governments would be responsible for financing pre-investment of subprojects with their funds. Project
accounts would be maintained by SIF and UNDP and consolidated by DINASBA for audit purposes.
15.   There are currently several projects being planned that would contribute to the implementation of
the Popular Participation Law. To assure coherence in the approach being taken, the government is
forming a consultative steering committee that would periodically review these projects. Several NGOs
with experience in water supply and sanitation would also provide assistance in the implementation of
investment projects and community mobilization activities.
Project Sustainability
16.    Community participation is the primary design principle of the project and is expected to ensure
sustainability and economic efficiency. Participation will go beyond the traditional community-based
participation model--the mobilization of local groups to ratify decisions made by outsider planners-- to
include ownership of, and responsibility for, decision making in regard to water supply and sanitation
services. Moreover, beneficiary involvement would not be limited to communities, but would also include
municipalities and government institutions at the provincial level to assist in maintaining and expanding
water supply and sanitation systems. The project would make full use of the participatory planning process
devised in the Popular Participation Law, through which communities express their demand for water and
sanitation services, take responsibility for the management of such services, and contribute to both capital
and recurrent costs. Moreover, to ensure that the proposed investments have a high priority for the
community and society, the project relies on the five-year municipal development plans and annual
operating budgets prepared by each municipality. Additionally, least-cost and demand-driven investments
would be pursued by using low per-capita investment grants and by maximizing the financial contribution
of municipalities and communities to the project. Finally, the relatively high cash contribution of
municipalities and communities of respectively 25 and 5 percent of investment cost, full recovery of
operation and maintenance costs by user fees, and the legal transfer of the facilities to municipalities and
communities as an asset will establish the ownership of and commitment to the project by the beneficiaries.
Lessons Learned fiom Previous IDA Involvement
17.   The proposed project would be Bolivia's first large-scale rural water and sanitation project. It
builds on the lessons learned from the--1991-1 994--Potosi Pilot Project, implemented by the UNDP-World
Bank Water and Sanitation Program, and financed by the Dutch Government. The experience gained in
Potosi provides a sound basis for the proposed project, as well as for the sustainability of future efforts.
The key lessons are that:
*      Communities should play a decision making role over the life of the project, from planning to
operations.
*      Community decisions should be based on the willingness to pay for different levels of service.
*     Even the poorest communities are willing to pay for up to 30 percent of the capital investment cost.
*      Communities can be trained to administer and operate facilities with appropriate technology.
*      Sustainability is improved when communities finance and operate their facilities.
*      Rural water and sanitation projects should pay more attention to activities such as demand
generation, community mobilization, and training.



-5 -
*     Non-governmental organizations are much more effective than the government in working at the
grassroots level and have demonstrated efficiency and reliability in undertaking rural water and
sanitation programs.
*     Training and hygiene education in the health, education, and sanitation sectors are essential to the
effective and sustained use of services.
*     Economic efficiency dictates that per capita investment ceilings for water and sewage disposal be
used as a selection criteria for individual subprojects.
*     Economies of scale can be achieved when subprojects are grouped, and when water and sanitation
is provided at the same time.
*     The participation of women must be actively encouraged, since they are usually the main users of
water, and are to a large extent responsible for hygiene practices within the family.
*     Technical support to operation and maintenance is required at the community, municipal, and
department levels.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
18.   The rural water supply and sanitation sector has seen a multitude of projects with different policy
agendas and objectives driven by different donors and nongovernmental organizations. IDA-financed water
and sanitation investments have been undertaken in the framework of four social investment projects, two
with the now-defunct Social Emergency Fund and two through its successor, the Social Investment Fund.
Investments focused on poor, periurban areas. Since 1991, the UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation
Program has financed a pilot project costing US$3 million to benefit about 60,000 people in the poorest
communities of the Department of Potosi. The Potosi project has tested low-cost water and sanitation
technologies, developed innovative approaches to community participation, and implemented an extensive
hygiene education program.
19.    The proposed project would be Bolivia's first, large-scale, sector specific, rural water and sanitation
project financed by any source and lay the foundation for further sustainable development of the sector. It is fully
consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on February 8, 1994, since it
promotes poverty alleviation, supports administrative decentralization, and expands the infrastructure stock. The
government's current strategy of decentralization and the proposed project would capitalize on these efforts.
Agreed Actions
20.    During negotiations, assurances have been obtained from the government that:
*      The policy framework for rural water and sanitation investments has been established by a
ministerial decree.
*      The technical manual for the design of rural water and sanitation projects has been adopted by
means of a directive of DINASBA.
*      Project implementation agreements between the Sub-Secretary of Urban Affairs, the Social
Investment Fund, and each departmental government, all satisfactory to the IDA, have been signed.
*      A project implementation manual, satisfactory to the IDA, has been adopted b y DINASBA.
*      The management team of PROSABAR, satisfactory to the IDA, has been officially appointed.



- 6 -
21.   In addition, agreement was reached on UNDP financing-about US$320,000 in four years-for
the independent monitoring and evaluation of the project, which would be managed by the UNDP-World
Bank Water and Sanitation Program based in La Paz.
22.    Prior to Credit effectiveness, the Government of Bolivia should confirm that:
*      A project implementation manual, satisfactory to IDA, has been adopted by DINASBA.
*      At least three UNASBAs in the country's eligible Departments would have opened bank accounts.
*      A subsidiary agreement for subgrants between SIF and the Borrower with regard to the investment
project has been signed.
Environmental Aspects
23.    The project would not present any significant environmental risks. The only foreseeable adverse impact
is related to increased wastewater from small sewage collection systems, particularly in villages with population
above 2,000. Similarly, minor sewage discharges into border rivers are envisaged as potentially having adverse
impacts. In such cases, a simplified environmental impact assessment would be conducted. Mitigation measures,
including stabilization ponds, would be included into subprojects as a condition for financing. Draft
environmental guidelines and procedures will be included into the Implementation Manual. The project is rated
Category "B".
Program Objective Categories
24.    The project's main goal is to alleviate poverty in rural areas by increasing water and sanitation
services in rural communities, as well as ensuring the sustainability of these services, by training operators
and administrators in beneficiary communities, by strengthening the institutional capacity of regional and
municipal water and sanitation units, and by supporting government reform in the areas of decentralization,
popular participation, policy formulation, and public management.
Project Benefits
25.    The project would benefit approximately 800,000 rural, mostly indigenous and poor people with
improved coverage of water and sanitation services. The key benefits of the project for the beneficiaries are time
savings (from spending less time on hauling water from distant sources) and improved health conditions due to
the provision of clean water, the use of properly designed sanitation facilities, and the adoption of improved
domestic hygiene practices. The project benefits also include the productive use of increased water supply (for
household horticulture). In addition, the community operators who receive training would be able to improve their
position on the rural labor market. These benefits would increase the productivity of rural households. Secondary
benefits include a reduced strain on the country's health services. Beneficiaries place considerable value on the
increased reliability of water supply (year-round rather than seasonal), improved water quality (taste, odor), and
the greater privacy, convenience, and attractiveness of decent sanitation facilities. The economic analysis is based
on a set of conservative assumptions with regard to the quantifiable benefits of this project. On this basis, the
internal rate of retum of the overall project is estimated at 13 percent. The internal rate of return of the water
supply investment component alone, which accounts for almost half ofthe project costs, is estimated at 23
percent.



- 7 -
26.    The project is also expected to produce additional benefits, such as the strengthening of the
Government's ability to formulate and evaluate sector policy; and the reinforcement of Government's initiatives
by supporting government reform in the areas of decentralization, popular participation, policy formulation,
and public management.
Risks
27.    The project faces three major risks. The first relates to the speed of implementation of the Popular
Participation Law. The law, which legally recognizes and empowers local communities, was a major
reform with social and political consequences that are only now unfolding. This risk is minimized by
strengthening the institutional capacity of municipalities and communities to operate and maintain water
and sanitation services, and by fostering the participation of municipalities and communities in the
planning, design, and development of water supply and sanitation projects. This goal is also supported by
the recently approved Rural Communities Development Project.
28.    The second risk concerns the institutional weakness of the project entities. DINASBA is weak, and
has not yet assumed its policymaking responsibility for the sector, instead concentrating its efforts on
coordinating specific programs financed by international agencies. The regional corporations, which will
be replaced by Departmental governments as of January 1996, have only recently been given the
responsibility of providing technical assistance to local governments. The corporations have acted mainly
as project implementing agencies and have limited experience in program planning, coordination, and
supervision. This risk is addressed by devoting adequate resources to strengthening DINASBA and the
UNASBAs. This includes establishing specific project units within each organization, and specific credit
conditionality linked to progressive incorporation of sector institutions, particularly DINASBA, into the
Public Service Law.
29.    A third risk relates to the changed role of the municipality. The Popular Participation Law has
radically altered the powers, responsibilities and fiscal resources of the local governments. The increased
authority could result in the municipalities setting their own, more politically motivated, agenda with regard
to the provision of rural water and sanitation services. However, this risk is mitigated by the use of
eligibility criteria for municipalities and communities to qualify for financing. This assures that the project
reflects the needs and preferences of the community.
Recommendation
I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
International Development Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
