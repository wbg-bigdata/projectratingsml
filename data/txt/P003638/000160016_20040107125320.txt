3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The main project objective was to assist Government to develop a viable commercial seed sector, which
would not only produce high quality seeds in sufficient quantity and variety to satisfy farmers' needs but
also operate through efficient, self-sustained commercial enterprises.

The project objective was clear and well understood by the participating provinces and companies. The
objective was fully in line with government policy towards commercialization of state-owned companies,
the use of improved technology in agriculture and reform of the seed sector and was consistent with the
1995 World Bank's CAS for China (assisting China to implement market-oriented reforms, particularly the
reform and restructuring of state enterprises). Project design covered 14 provinces and about 31 companies.
Project design incorporated lessons learned from the previous Seeds Project (Cr.1577-CHA) and the Henan
Agricultural Development Project (ADP) (Cr.2242-CHA) as well as projects in other countries, in
particular the Seed Development Project (Ln.3891-UA) in Ukraine. All of these showed the benefits from
liberalization of seed production and trading, the need for policy changes, the necessity for training and
technical assistance in introducing new management systems and the benefits to both farmers and
companies from the development of new and improved varieties. This project was proposed in early 2003
by Agriculture and Rural Development Department of the World Bank (WB) to be included in the World
Bank's Agricultural Investment Source Book as an Innovative Activity Profile.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objective remained unchanged throughout project implementation.

3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of three components which were generally well designed to achieve the project
objective. The project was prepared with assistance of the FAO/CP over the period 1993-94, appraised in
1995, approved in June 1996 with Loan/Credit effectiveness in December 1996.

Policy and Regulatory Framework (US$7.16 million ­ 3.9% of the total). This component was designed
to help the Government establish a seed policy and a regulatory framework that would enhance the
competitiveness of the seed sector and encourage international cooperation. The component was to: assist
(i) the Government with assessment and, where needed, strengthening of seed laws, approval of cultivars
for use, authorization for seed production and commercialization regulations and administrative
instructions in respect of official examination and activities, labeling and packaging standards and
strengthening of seed inspection and quarantine provisions; and (ii) the development and implementation of
a suitable legal framework for protection of plant breeders rights legislation and the Government's
accession to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) convention on
intellectual property protection for plants.

Commercialization of Selected Seed Companies (US$177.81 million ­ 95.8% of the total). This
component was designed to support the modernization and rationalization of selected seed companies. The
component was to prepare a core group of about 31 active, technically adept and competitive seed
companies as a foundation for a viable commercial seed sector. These enterprises would introduce new
genetic materials, improve seed quality and strengthen their institutional, marketing and sales networks by
forming liaisons with Chinese and foreign institutions, suppliers and marketing agencies. The project would
encourage joint venture agreements with foreign suppliers to upgrade the seed processing equipment and
technology of the companies. The funding provided covered a wide range of project activities including
improvement of (i) company seed production bases, (ii) variety of seed, (iii) storage and processing
facilities, (iv) internal quality control, (v) company management, (vi) marketing and pricing, (vii) initial




                                                     - 2 -

seed stock, and (viii) seed machinery manufacture by the Shanghai Xiangming Machinery Company.

Institutional Strengthening (US$0.57 million ­ 0.3% of the total). This component was designed to
assist in strengthening institutions so that they can provide effective service and technical support to the
seed sector. The component was to (i) strengthen variety examination, release and protection by support to
the National Crop Variety Examination and Approval Committee Office at the national level and to
Provincial Crop Variety Examination and Approval Offices in six of the participating provinces, (ii)
improve seed quality control and seed certification at both national level and in the provinces, (iii)
strengthen the Central Project Management Office, (iv) support a pilot program including three
participating companies - representing respectively seed companies developing from state farms; prefecture
seed companies; and provincial seed companies, and (v) finance surveys and studies of a relatively simple
nature to provide good data on the relative performance of farmer saved seed, compared with company
supplied seed.

3.4 Revised Components:
The original project components remained basically unchanged with some minor revisions. Following the
January 1999 MTR, Jiangxi province dropped out of the project and Anhui and Hainan provinces joined.
As a result, there were 15 provinces including the municipality of Shanghai and some 36 companies
participating in the project. Other changes included a reduction in the size of the loan as a result of four
cancellations, and some adjustment in machinery procurement made to better match the companies' needs.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
This project was not reviewed by QAG. This ICR rates Quality at Entry satisfactory based on the fact that
the project was (i) fully in line with Borrower's policies, strategy, a timely investment initiative and the
World Bank's CAS for China, (ii) adequately addressing the sector issues and well defined targets, and (iii)
on a realistic implementation time schedule to meet the project objective. The main difficulty with the
project design was its sheer geographic scale. During the latter stages of preparation and appraisal, World
Bank staff had put forward the option of having a project with a regional coverage restricted to a cluster of
provinces. However, particularly in view of the urgent need to upgrade seed production, this was not
considered feasible. Indeed contemporary with the project, Government introduced the Ninth Five-Year
Plan Seed Program (NFYP-SP) 1996-2000 with funding solely from domestic sources amounting to Y3.2
billion (US$390 million) of which 53% was as a government grant for public sector infrastructure
development to produce new varieties, quality control and testing, and the balance as local bank loans for
commercial activities such as processing and marketing. However, with the benefit of hindsight, the
experience of implementation shows that the project design could have been a bit less ambitious.


4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project has been successful in achieving its major objective of producing high quality seeds and
supporting the reform of a leading part of the seed industry in China. Detailed outcome/achievement are
shown in Annex 1. The fact that Government also financed the contemporary NFYP-SP to provide
assistance to those provinces or companies not covered by the project, but borrowing heavily from the
project design, implied that the project's impact was indeed national in extent.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Policy and Regulatory Framework (US$0.57 million ­ 3.4% of the total). In 1994, MOA issued a
regulation for the reform of seed companies, which specified that seed processing companies had to divest
themselves of any seed certification and external quality control functions. This would be carried out by
seed offices or seed stations under government control. With the support of the project, significant policy


                                                    - 3 -

and regulatory development was achieved. Government issued a "Regulation on Protection of New
Varieties of Plants" in October 1997 and set up an office within MOA to prepare detailed rules to
implement and enforce the regulations which are currently being applied. Following these developments,
China became a full member of the UPOV on April 23, 1999. On July 3, 2000, Government published the
"Seed Law of the People's Republic of China" which came into effect on December 1, 2000. This was
followed by four implementation decrees, published on February 26, 2001 for "Variety Registration for
Major Crops", "Management Procedures for Seed Production and Marketing", "Seed Labeling
Procedures", and "Regulations for the Processing and Packaging of Seeds". Further instructions on the
reform of seed testing arrangements were given by MOA in their regulation "Evaluation Methods for Major
Crop Varieties" of 2001. At appraisal, it was also anticipated that China would join the International Seed
Testing Association (ISTA). This was not realized due to political considerations of the fact that China's
Taiwan was still an ISTA member.

Commercialization of Selected Seed Companies (US$0.57 million ­ 96.3% of the total). In all, 34 seed
companies and one agricultural machinery manufacturer participated in the project. The reform of the 34
participating companies was of greater significance than the mere supply of improved seed processing
equipment. In line with government's expressed policies, each participating company had to divest itself of
its seed certification and quality control functions and also reform into a self-accounting autonomous legal
entity, either in the form of a limited liability company or as a shareholding company Ltd. The aim of this
reform was to allow the seed companies to operate as commercial enterprises, rather than agencies under
the direction of local governments. This reform was not uniform across the spectrum of the participants.
Many have become truly autonomous commercial companies. Some, having set up as commercial
companies in name, are still largely subsidiary enterprises of unreformed state owned provincial
corporations. Guangxi Seed Company and Zhejiang Provincial Seed Company remain unreformed State
Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The most important aspect is that in all cases, the project has been successful
in supporting and encouraging movement towards establishment of a commercial seed sector.

In support of the commercialization component, the project provided a large training program for seed
company staff. During implementation the training program was expanded, both to cater to the project
needs as well as responding to the overall NFYP-SP, through bilateral arrangement with AusAid which
provided funding of A$980,000 (about US$600,000) as well as training at Purdue and Iowa State
Universities in the USA. As a result, the project was able to provide a valuable and well received program
of overseas and domestic training and study tours. In total, some 530 person-months (PM) of overseas
training and more than 3,500 PM of domestic training were provided. This not only was of considerable
assistance to the seed company staff, but also highlighted the value of training and provided a model which
the more advanced of the project companies are attempting to continue. In addition to the direct training
benefits, the overseas training and study tours also allowed contacts to be made which in a number of cases
have developed into joint ventures. Unfortunately, staff after training did not necessarily return to their own
companies in a number of cases due to reform and reorganization programs.

In total, some 330 ha of seed production area were developed, more than 65,000 m2 of civil works
constructed and 47 seed processing/packing lines procured , together with associated office, laboratory and
                                                                1


other equipment, vehicles and materials ­ thereby also providing financing of working capital requirements
as detailed in Annex 1. In the initial years of project implementation, the companies gave much greater
attention to land development than had been expected at appraisal. The area provided with irrigation was
over eight times larger than originally planned and access roads were more than nine times the appraisal
estimates. Company management was improved through training program and internal quality control
became rationally rooted. Marketing and pricing of seeds were paid much more attention by all seed
company management. Procured initial seed stock exceeded the SAR target. In addition, the project also
included investment in the Xiangming Agricultural Machinery Company of Shanghai. This has been
satisfactorily completed, although with some procurement problems. The computer aided design and
manufacture equipment provided benefits the company and its clients for a range of agricultural machinery,
particularly harvesters, as well as seed processing equipment.

Institutional Strengthening (US$0.57 million ­ 0.3% of the total). As set out in the SAR, the project
was expected to provide funding for government's seed testing and certification services to be administered
through the seed stations at the provincial and prefecture levels. This goal was also supported by the
NFYP-SP on a grant basis. As planned, the project established a National Seed Testing Laboratory at
NATEC ­ now named as the MOA National Crop Seed Quality Inspection Center and strengthened seed
testing facilities at the provincial level in Guizhou, Shandong, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan and Shanxi
through construction and equipment of laboratories and other facilities. Variety examination, release and
protection has been strengthened under the project. In accordance with "Evaluation Methods for Major
Crop Varieties" issued by MOA which specifies that only major crops are required to be examined, the
original examination practice has been changed from multi levels to only two levels (national and
provincial) and the testing period has been shortened from over three production cycles to no less than two
production seasons. These changes abolished duplicated examination and localized protection, shortened
examination duration and improved general environment for commercial seed operation in seed sector.
Meanwhile, new practice in acceptance or rejection at preliminary registration ensured transparency and
fairness of the variety registration. The PMOs were strengthened through provision of equipment and staff
training. This was successfully carried out however, staff following training were sometimes posted to
other duties. The CPMO was strengthened through provision of office equipment, training and study tours.
The Pilot Program to provide intensified management assistance and supervision to three project entities ­
two in Shandong and one in Guangxi ­ appears to have had little impact on overall project implementation.
Studies undertaken by the project have been useful in providing data on the benefits of good quality seed.
These showed that in Shanxi, there was a 17% saving in seed rate for wheat through use of good quality
commercial seed compared with farmer-saved seed.In Zhejiang rice yields using good quality commercial
seed in 1997 and 1998 were from 5 to 13% higher than farmer-saved seed and 8 to 15% higher than seed
provided by neighbors as set out in government policy.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Calculation of the economic returns of the project investment at ICR adopted the same approach as in
SAR. The quantifiable economic benefits of the project come from: (i) the net value of incremental crop
production, resulting from better varieties of seed: and (ii) the saving of seed from the use of higher quality
seed at recommended seeding rates. The incremental economic benefit is estimated from per hectare
incremental production based on farm budget analysis in a "with and without" the project scenario. As it is
difficult to disaggregate the impact of improved seeds from that of improved irrigation, input supply,
marketing and credit on the increased production, benefits attributed to improved seed are assumed to be
only 25% of the net incremental value of production. Based on the above, an economic analysis has been
carried out for each province and for the project as a whole. The economic rate of return (ERR) calculation
for each province has taken into account all the incremental benefits and costs in an aggregated economic
cash flow, built up in line with physical achievements in the province. The ERRs by province range from
24% to 49%, and the ERR for the whole project is estimated at 34% (NPV at Y1.2 billion with OCC at
12%), which is derived from the weighted average ERR of all provinces. The ERR for the project is lower
than SAR estimate (42%) but is still very robust.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial analysis has been carried out for all selected seed companies and one seed machinery factory.
Incremental benefits are derived from sales generated from operating capacity achieved from past years and
projected values for the future. Taxes are provided by the owners and vary for each operation. In general,
VAT is exempted for seed production while corporate income tax is 33% of taxable income. Most of seed
production activities implemented by the project show satisfactory rates of return. Out of more than 30
enterprises for seeds project, only 4 companies registered financial rate of return (FRR) lower than 12%
(three around 10% and one lowest case at 5 %) with highest at 22%. At provincial level, the FRRs ranged
from 14% to 22% while the project FRR is estimated at 18%. However, the FRRs for individual
enterprises and for the project as a whole are noticeably lower than SAR estimates (ranging from 20% to
30% for individual enterprises and 27% for the whole project). The lower-than-expected FRRs are mainly
attributable to (i) FRRs by enterprises calculated in SAR were based on income before tax, and (ii) lower
than estimated production capacity utilization in the case of the enterprises with lower FRRs due to market
competition.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Project impact on institutional development has been positive and substantial. One of the necessities for
achieving the main objective of creating self-sustained commercial enterprises was that companies become
a limited liability company or shareholding company Ltd. This reform appears to have been taken place as
far as the companies actually benefiting from investment are concerned. Though significant number of the
companies still have quite a high proportion of government ownership with some still largely subsidiary
companies of a non-reformed SOE (provincial seed company) ­ as is the case in both Guangxi and
Zhejiang, about a quarter of them have reduced government's ownership share to less than 50%. About half
of the companies claim to have company business plans for the future. Generally 30-80% of company
revenues are now generated from sale of their own seeds. In support of this reliance on their own varieties,
most companies have made allocations toward breeding of new varieties varying from only 1-2.5% of total
sales value to as much as 8-10% for some more innovative companies. A number of the companies already
have cooperation with foreign companies, and several more are considering joint-ventures. Two companies
stated that had applied for certification as conforming to ISO 9000-2000 company management standards
and one had applied for ISO14000 environmental management standard. The program of staff training,
overseas and domestic visits has had a valuable impact in changing attitudes to company operation,



                                                     - 6 -

particularly in market strategy.

Seed management stations at national, in selected provinces and prefectures have been strengthened under
the project by upgrading office and laboratory facilities, seed quality control and testing equipment and
staff training. The separation of seed management responsibility from seed production and trading
operation allowed government seed administration at all levels to focus their roles on quality control and
ensuring impartiality when providing regulatory service.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The project suffered a number of difficulties due to natural disasters, in particular flood damage in 1998,
typhoon and frost in Fujian in 1999, and drought in Fujian in 2001/02. The Asian financial crisis in 1997
dampened seed market prospects, but at the same time depressed prices of manufactured goods. China's
entry into the World Trade Organization has intensified competition. All the companies had complaints
regarding procurement arrangements through ICR procedures. World Bank procurement method
requirements for ICB had mainly negative effect of slowing project implementation. The ICB arrangements
for the processing lines were time consuming and generally involved several visits to Beijing. The main
difficulties encountered in implementation arose from the need to bulk tenders for equipment and machinery
which has resulted in a need for all the companies to be somewhat regimented and to move together.
Unfortunately, this appears to have often resulted in the rate of progress being determined by the slowest in
the group. On the positive side, the bulking of the processing equipment had advantages in securing
machinery with advanced specification at very competitive prices resulting in significant cost savings.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Provision by Government of a sound, strong legal and policy basis proved critical for the project's success
and for future development of the seed sector in particular the Seed Law, associated regulations and policy
changes. Government's decision on exemption of import duties fort the project was an incentive to the
participating companies. However, with the decline in commercial interest rates in China from about 10%
p.a. in 1996 to around 4.8% in 2003, the adoption of a fixed 6.5% interest rate over the entire
                                                                                           2


implementation period for funds on-lent to companies provided a disincentive to investment and full
participation in the project. The fact that provinces were expected to bear the foreign exchange risk and pay
back the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in US dollars further discouraged use of World Bank funds in the
early stages of the project. Inclusion of Anhui and Hainan after the MTR without any modification of the
Loan/Credit agreements meant that these provinces only benefited from one year of grace before
commencing repayments at a time when they were both in the middle of their investment program. The
option for the Government could have given, on its own, both provinces a longer grace period beyond this
one year. Also, slow reimbursement process affected project implementation negatively particularly of
those companies at below provincial level. As a result, land development and building construction were
largely counterpart fund financed and disbursements of World Bank funds were much reduced.

Government administrative reform, starting in 1996, had the effect of displacing government staff and
decreasing staff continuity in the project. This was particularly unfortunate in cases where staff of the
PMOs were transferred to other duties after completion of their intensive trainings.

Initially, China's joining ISTA was problematic since Taiwan of China was already a member.
Unfortunately, no way was subsequently found for China to become an ISTA member as envisaged at
project appraisal and non-membership of ISTA could be an impediment to developing seed export markets.

                                                      - 7 -

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The CPMO was active and diligent in its role of overall coordination and management of project
implementation, and contributed strongly to successful implementation of the project. However, given the
number of provinces and companies involved as well as the complexity and technical nature of the
procurement required, the task was extremely challenging. Given the project design, the aspect where the
CPMO could have done more is in regard to its prior and ex-post review of procurement on a regular basis.
In general, the PMOs at lower levels and the companies, with strong leadership and competent staff, have
been performed very well. The areas where they could have paid more attention to are (i) maintaining
continuity of staff, (ii) raising more local counterpart funds.

5.4 Costs and financing:
In the SAR, total project costs were estimated at US$185.54 million including an IBRD loan of US$ 80.0
million and an IDA credit of SDR13.8 million (US$20.0 million equivalent). During implementation the
loan amount was reduced through three cancellations, respectively US$9.4 million following the MTR in
April 2000, US$6.6 million in October 2001 and US$1.7 million in April 2003. The undisbursed balance
of US$4.95 million was cancelled at Loan closing. The actual project costs at ICR are US$152.39 million
(82% of the SAR estimates). Of the total project costs, IBRD and IDA disbursements amount to US$76.01
million (76% of SAR estimates), while the government counterpart funds including farmers' contribution
total US$76.38 million (89% of SAR estimates). This lower-than-expected actual project cost is a result of
(i) increased domestic funding sources, (ii) supplementary financial support from bilateral source, and (iii)
inflated project cost from over estimate of contingencies at project appraisal and inclusion of customs
duties which were exempted by the government during project implementation. Detailed project costs and
financing are contained in Annex 2.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is highly likely. The project has successfully dealt with all three major constraints for
the development of a commercialized seed industry in China i.e. policy and regulatory constraint, technical
constraint and financial constraint. Policy and regulatory constraint was removed through issuance of the
Seed Law, associated regulations and policy changes. Technical constraint was relaxed through
strengthened seed production bases and improved seed testing facilities. Financial constraint was reduced
through the project investment and the government's parallel NFYP-SP investment. The project design paid
considerable attention to commercialization of seed sector in China through enterprise reform of
participating seed companies. This attention changed fundamental mentality of seed companies in their
business and yielded satisfactorily achievements. Some companies have already proved to be highly
successful, while a few have made somewhat slower progress, despite their apparent move towards
becoming commercial entities. In general, all the 34 companies taking part in the project are in a financially
stronger position than pre-project and the chances for their continued sustainability are high. The project
has achieved its aim of splitting off the seed testing and certification activities to the government operated
seed stations. In line with government requirements agreed as a condition of the project, these seed stations
are charging companies for their seed testing and certification duties, thereby lightening the financial
burden on government. These will ensure the continued use of investments made for many years to come
and ensure the sustainable development of the participating seed companies' through their improved
marketing competitiveness.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The seed administrative stations have been established in majority of participating provinces. They went
into operation when they were officially separated from the seed companies. These stations have been



                                                      - 8 -

playing their new role as an independent official seed administration and monitoring system with external
quality control responsibilities to regulate the seed industry. The individual participating seed companies
went into regular operation once their sub-projects are completed. By the time of the ICR, about half of the
participating companies claimed to have formal company business development plans with forecast profit
and loss accounts for at least one year and in some cases for 5 years. Companies which have not yet
produced such future projections stated their intention to do so. The CPMO and provincial PMOs
committed to follow-up of development and implementation of such plans including enterprise reform plan
by respective seed companies.


7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Through identification, preparation and appraisal, World Bank performance was generally satisfactory.
The project design was in line with the Government's priorities in seed sector though somewhat
over-ambitious. The size of the project's geographic coverage and the World Bank's procurement
regulations presented difficulties during implementation. Procurement related issues could have been
mitigated by (i) greater emphasis in training of project staff in the World Bank's procurement procedures,
(ii) more active role of the World Bank's Office in Beijing in ex-post review of procurement in the early
years of project implementation and (iii) more decentralized project management autonomy to the
individual provinces and municipality.

7.2 Supervision:
Project supervision by the World Bank was regular, constructive and supportive of project implementation.
World Bank supervision had a major beneficial impact on implementation, often going much further than
normal in providing technical assistance in producing models for tendering procedures and other technical
advice. The extent and quality of documentation provided by the supervision missions was also
significantly above average. The World Bank was supportive in processing partial cancellations of the loan
and was sensitive and pragmatic in extending loan and credit closing by one year to facilitate the
implementation of investment programs in Anhui and Hainan provinces.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall World Bank performance was satisfactory. Project objective was relevant to the Borrower's
needs, development priorities and strategy of the Government and the World Bank. Project design was in
line with the project objective. The World Bank responded to the Borrower's request positively and in a
timely manner. Project preparation, appraisal and supervision were all satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
MOF was very positive in project concept, design and preparation. Attitude of MOA and CPMO during
preparation was fully supportive to convert state owned enterprises into commercial companies. Local
governments, PMOs and participating seed companies were enthusiastic through out project preparation.
The Borrower's initiatives, responsiveness and cooperation ensured a successful project preparation.
Experience has shown that the project design developed by the local teams, with the assistance of FAO/CP,
was good but had too large a geographic scope as a centrally managed project and with limited project
management autonomy given to the participating provinces particularly in handling procurement and flow
of reimbursed World Bank funds.




                                                    - 9 -

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government performance in providing the adequate policy and legal environment for the project was
satisfactory. Subsequent Government strong commitment and support for the project has been good and
consistent throughout implementation. The Government's nation-wide administrative reform program had
some adverse effects on the project implementation specifically the institutional strengthening program
supported by the project.


7.6 Implementing Agency:
The overall performance of the implementing agencies is rated satisfactory. The institutional arrangements
for project implementation have proved generally adequate to bring the project to a successful conclusion,
although the design of centralized project management created considerable difficulties for the CPMO and
the PPMOs. Strong leadership, competent staff and full commitment of PMOs at all levels contributed to
the success of the completed project. The centralized procurement and bulking of equipment in large
packages gave good results as far as prices of imported processing equipment were concerned. However,
significant delays in project implementation occurred in some incidents as a result of excessive time
required for centralized procurement.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. The Government and the implementing agencies
have been committed to the project and were the key to the overall success of the project.


8. Lessons Learned

8.1 A number of key lessons, both positive and negative, were learned during the implementation of the
project which were summarized as follows:

8.2   Government Commitment. The overall project implementation is consistently satisfactory. The
Government's strong commitment to reforms and continuous support to seed sector commercialization
effort have been the foundation of the project design and the pillar for project implementation. Close
cooperation between government agencies at various levels played a key role in project implementation.
Functional institutional arrangement and close involvement of technical specialists also contributed to the
satisfactory project implementation.

8.3 Project Design and Management. Project's simple objective and focused design were considered key
elements for satisfactory project implementation. These enable both the borrower and the World Bank to
make concentrated and joint efforts for measurable targets through step-by-step achievements. The project
would have been an even greater success if the project's over ambitious geographic coverage were reduced
to a more manageable size or the greater autonomy in project implementation and management were given
to the individual participating provinces in the interests of project implementation efficiency.

8.4 Procurement Issues. Procurement issues including one mis-procurement declared by the World Bank
had negative effects on project implementation. This was derived mainly from (i) project staff's insufficient
knowledge of World Bank procurement policies and procedures and contract management and (ii)
inadequate support from the World Bank especially in the early years of project implementation.

8.5 Staff Instability. Staff instability and discontinuity was a major problem for some PMOs where
project trained staff were posted to other duties outside the project. In projects with an important training


                                                      - 10 -

component, an agreement might be necessary among concerned parties that staff included in the project
training program should return to their original or related posts to continue the staff's service for at least a
specified period with minimum predefined exceptions. Failure to have such a requirement runs the risk of
either (i) less than optimum selection of candidates, or (ii) wastage of the training investment through the
loss of the trained staff to other employment, or both.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
In general, we agree with the findings and assessment of the ICR mission. Our main findings and views of
the project are expressed in Annex 8 Borrower's ICR. However, we would like to highlight some key points
as follows.

The project was very successful in many aspects, in particular it had significant impacts on promoting
policy and regulatory reform of the Chinese seed sector, introducing leading seed processing technologies,
enterprises reform and institutional strengthening as well as human resource development.
Commercialization concept was well established in almost all project seed enterprises and many of them are
running very successfully in the present market oriented economy. The project was also an important part
of the coincided Ninth Five-Year Plan Seed Program (NFYPSP) which aimed at upgrading national
network of seed breeding, production, processing and marketing. The design and management style of the
World Bank project were served as examples, particularly in the above mentioned aspects.

There were many factors contributed to the success of the project, among which government strong
commitments in terms of policy reform and providing local counterpart funds, diligence of project
implementation agencies at different levels are the crucial ones among others.

Due to the wide range of the project activities and wide spread geological locations, we believe the project
in the same nature should be given more flexible arrangement on procurement activities so as to improve
the efficiency and avoid any inappropriate practice.

Last but not least, taking this opportunity, we would like to thank the World Bank's efforts during the
whole process of project implementation. The quick responses and constructive advises provided by
relevant officials of the Bank were appreciated very much by both CPMO and lower level project
implementation agencies. We hope such kind of lending operation would be continued in the future.

(b) Cofinanciers:
No cofinanciers were involved in the project.

(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
No other partners were involved in the project.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

1. Introduction. The analysis presented in this annex reassesses the economic rate of return calculated in
the SAR using updated prices, actual project costs, and latest information on seed and crop production. The
methodology of the analysis basically follows that of SAR with increased level of details, as more data are
available compared with SAR. The crop budgets and seed production models for example are developed for
each of 15 project provinces/municipalities to reflect the regional differences. The project costs and
physical achievements were drawn from project records while the future production projections are based
on actual performance of current operations and data from project entities.

2. Project Benefits. The main objective of the project is to assist the Government in developing a viable
commercial seed sector, which can not only produce high quality seeds in sufficient quantity and variety to
satisfy farmer needs but also operates through efficient, self-sustained commercial enterprises. The project
would assist in the commercialization of the seed sector by: (i) helping the Government establish a seed
policy and a regulatory framework that would enhance the competitiveness of the seed sector and
encourage international cooperation, (ii) supporting the modernization and rationalization of selected seed
companies, and (iii) assisting in strengthening institutions so they can provide effective service and
technical support to the seed sector.

3. The major benefits of this project would be threefold. At the sector level, an environment conducive to
commercial development would be developed through policy and regulatory reforms. At the enterprise
level, a core group of seed companies would learn to develop profitable commercial business in response to
domestic and international commercial demand. At the farm level, there would be an improvement in farm
production, yield and incomes. The major quantifiable benefits from the project would be in the area of
incremental production resulting from the improved quality of seeds. In addition, good quality seed would
reduce the existing excess seeding rates.

4. Economic Analysis. The project costs used in the analysis were based on actual costs incurred. For the
purpose of the economic analysis, costs in current price were converted to 2003 prices by applying the
Consumer Price Index (CPI). Project costs include all project investment costs for seed companies and seed
stations (excluding the MOA project office and the Shanghai Xiangming Machinery Company) and the
fixed and variable operating costs of the seed companies, the incremental recurrent cost of the seed stations,
the incremental farm production costs.

5. As described above, the economic benefits of the project would come from: (i) the net value of
incremental grain production resulting from better varieties of seed, and (ii) the saving of seed from the use
of higher quality seed at recommended seeding rates. The incremental economic benefit is estimated from
per hectare incremental production based on farm budget analysis of the future situation with and without
the project.

6. A conservative approach was made in claiming the benefits of the project. In general, a concentrated
area development effort would be needed to realize the full benefits of an agricultural project. Since seed
production under the project would be used in extensive areas, it is unlikely that the full incremental benefit
would be totally achieved without such efforts. For instance, farmers may not have access to the inputs or
support services that would be necessary to fully exploit the benefit of improved seeds. Furthermore, it is
difficult to disaggregate the result of improved seeds from that of improved irrigation, input supply,
marketing and credit. Hence, for this economic analysis, benefits attributed to improved seed are assumed
to be only 25% of the net potential incremental value of production.

7. At SAR, world price projections or average export prices actually realized by China in 1995 were used
to estimate constant farm-gate economic prices for traded inputs and outputs, and economic prices for
non-traded goods were estimated using conversion factors. However, the Chinese economy in 2003, with
much greater openness to international trade and little market distortion, is quite different from in 1995.
The current market prices of both inputs and outputs basically reflect the actual export and import prices
for the products of identical varieties and quality if they are tradable. Furthermore the project area is
continental size (from Hainan to Gansu), one set of the parity prices based on border prices are not relevant
for those interior provinces as the inter- provincial trade is far more important than international trade. As a
result, the financial prices are used as "proxies "for economic prices. Similarly no further adjustments are
made to other non-tradable farm inputs and outputs as no foreign exchange premium exists in China now.

8. Based on the above, economic analysis has been carried out for each province and for the project as a
whole. The ERR calculation of each province has taken into account all the incremental benefits and costs
in an aggregated economic cash flow, built up in line with physical achievements in the province. The
ERRs by province range from 24% to 49%, and the ERR for the whole project is estimated at 34% (NPV
at Y1.2 billion with OCC at 12%), which is derived from the weighted ERR average of all provinces. The
ERR for the project is lower than SAR estimate but is still very economically robust (34%).

9. The re-evaluation of the ERR for each province comprising various production activities is summarized
below with detailed calculations contained in attached tables.

10. Financial Analysis. Financial analysis has been carried out for all selected seed companies and one
seed machinery factory. All financial flows are valued at constant 2003 prices; the actual prices of the past
years are converted to 2003 prices using CPI. Costs and benefits are derived from the data provided by
individual company, and are based on the incremental costs and benefits of the pre-project existing
companies. Costs were separated into investment and operating costs. Investment costs include those of
land development, building construction, equipment, materials and incremental working capital. Working
capital is based on requirements for unprocessed seed storage, consumable materials in stock, work in
progress (including field crop production where relevant), processed and packed production in stock, and
accounts payable.

11. Incremental benefits are derived from sales generated from operating capacity achieved from past
years and projected values for the future. Taxes are provided by the owners and vary for each operation. In
general, VAT is exempted for seed production while corporate income tax is 33% of taxable income
(depreciation as income tax shield accounted for in calculation).

12. Financial Rate of Return (FRR) was calculated, based on the above cost and benefit assumptions for
all seed companies. Most of the seed production activities implemented by the project show satisfactory
rates of return. Out of more than 30 enterprises for seeds project, only 4 companies registered FRR lower
than 12% (three around 10% and one lowest case at 5%) with highest at 22%. At provincial level, the FRS
ranged from 14% to 22% while the project FRR of all subcomponents is estimated at 18%. However, the
FRRs for individual enterprises and for the project as a whole are noticeably lower than SAR estimates
(ranging from 20% to 30% for individual enterprises and 27% for the whole project). The lower than
expected FRRs are mainly attributable to (i) FRRs by enterprises calculated in SAR were based on income
before tax, and (ii) lower than estimated production capacity utilization in the case of the enterprises with
lower FRRs due to market competition.

13. The detailed calculations for FRRs for all participating companies and the project as a whole are
available in project file.

1. Project Profile

1.1 Background

China's seed sector has long been administered under planned economy system, and there is a lack of
legislation or protection of intellectual property rights. Seed production and marketing has been under
government control in the format of exclusive operation, leading to low level of commercialization and
competitiveness. This posed a serious constraint to further development of seed sector under new market
economy system and failed to cater for farmers' demand for better quality, diversified crop seeds. In view
of the above facts and experience gained from Seed Project by the Bank from late 1980s to early 1990s,
Chinese government proposed a nationwide seed commercialization project to be financed by the Bank, in a
bid to create favorable environment for healthy development of seed sector, achieve modernization and
commercialization of seed sector thereby better serving the development of agriculture and rural economy
through: building policy, legislative and regulatory framework, and introduction of advanced seed
production, processing technology, equipment as well as modern enterprise management model from
abroad.

1.2 Milestones for the Project

The project was identified in November 1993, prepared in May and November 1994, pre-appraised in
April and appraised in September-October 1995. Implementation of the project commenced on December
23, 1996, and completed on Jun 30, 2003.

1.3 Size of the Project

The World Bank's financial input for the project totals $ 100 million, including $ 80 million of loan, and
SDR 13.8 million (equivalent to $ 20 million) of credit, involving 31 project implementing agencies in 14
provinces.

2. Objectives and Components

2.1 Objectives

The main objective of the project is to assist the Government in developing a viable commercial seed sector,
which would can not only produce high quality seeds in sufficient quantity and variety to satisfy farmer
needs but also operates through efficient, self-sustained commercial enterprises.

2.2 Components

The project has three major components: 1. policy                and regulatory framework building; 2.
Commercialization of selected seed companies; 3. institutional strengthening

2.3 Mid-term Adjustment

In view of project progress, mid-term adjustment was undertaken in February 1999, the adjustment
proposal was approved by the Bank on February 29, 2000.

2.3.1 Adjustment of project provinces and implementing agencies: as Jiangxi dropped out of the project,
while Anhui and Hainan joined, implementing agencies changed to 35 seed enterprises in 15 provinces.

2.3.2 Adjustment in external seed quality control and commercialization component of the project.

2.3.3 Adjustment in loan amount: credit amount remained unchanged in mid-term adjustment, while loan
was reduced by $9.4 million, leading to adjusted credit of SDR 13.8 million, and loan of $70.6 million
respectively. In addition, the Bank agreed to reduce $6.6 million of loan at request of Shandong, Anhui and
Zhejiang provinces, resulting in $64 million for loan in total. Again, on Apr. 29, 2003, the Bank agreed to
reduce another $ 1,741,145.10 for Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. On August 27, 2002, An amount



                                                     - 26 -

of US$254,737.44 for two civil works contract misprocured by Shanxi province was refunded and
canceled. By the end of June 2003, the total loan amount was reduced to $62,004,117.46.

3. Accomplishment of Project Targets

After 6 years of implementation, project activities described in SAR have been completed, with various
targets achieved.

3.1 Completion of Project

3.1.1 Regulation and Institution Strengthening

In the respect of policy and regulatory framework building, on the whole the set targets have been
accomplished

3.1.1.1 Seed law, protection of new varieties of plants, China's accession to UPOV, etc.

a) "Seed Law of the People's Republic of China" was promulgated on July 3, 2000, and came into effect
on December 1, 2000.

b) Four implementation decrees were published on February 26, 2001, namely, "Variety Registration for
Major Crops", "Management Procedures for Seed Production and Marketing", "Seed Labeling
Procedures", "Regulations for the Processing and Packaging of Seeds"

c) "Regulation on Protection of New Varieties of Plants" was issued in on October 1997, and a special
office was set up under MOA working out detailed rules for implementation;

d) On April 23, 1999, China became a full member of UPOV

3.1.1.2 Changes in crop variety evaluation procedures and relevant regulations.

In accordance with "Evaluation Methods for Major Crop Varieties" issued by MOA, only major crops are
required to be evaluated, and original multi-level evaluation approach has been changed to two levels
(national and provincial), testing period shortened from over three production cycles to no less than two
production seasons. The changes abolished replicated evaluation and local protection, shortened evaluation
duration, resulting in better conditions for commercialized operation in seed sector. Meanwhile, new
approaches of acceptance, and withdrawal at preliminary registration were adopted to ensure openness and
fairness of the variety registration.

3.1.1.3 Institutional strengthening

a) Separation of seed administration from business operation

By June 30, 2003, seed administration stations at all levels had been separated from seed companies in
terms of staff, budget, functions, asset. Seed administration stations at all levels had discontinued seed
business activities, whereas seed companies had been deprived of administrative functions, and focusing on
seed R & D, production and commercial operation.

b) Aus-Aid Training and Technical Assistance project. Aus-aid project of 980,000 Australia $ helped the
project to achieve its objectives on institutional strengthening in terms of provide lots of project related
training programs. A total of 200 persons, 14 months in 20 groups has been sent abroad for training or
study tour, finishing investment of 12,780,000 yuan. Thereinto 8 groups with total 63 persons, 4.5 months
were sent to Australia for training and study tour, as supported by Aus-aid sub-project. Moreover,
Sino-Aus has held 10 training classes with more than 180 participants involved. These training and study
tour activities provided good opportunities for project staff to learn modern enterprises management and
technology knowledge.




                                                    - 27 -

3.1.2 Physical Progress

The project established 330 ha of seed production bases, completed 65780 m2 of civil works, totaling
RMB 330,180,000 yuan. The project procured 47 seed processing/packing lines and other office, testing
equipment, as well as agriculture inputs through ICB totaling RMB 305,000,000 yuan.

3.1.3 Financial Progress

By June 30, 2003, investment totaling RMB 1,260.00 million yuan(about equal to USD152.00 million) has
been completed under the project, including SDR 13.8 million of IDA credit, $ 57.00 million of IBRD loan,
and RMB 630.00 million yuan(about equal to USD76.00 million) of counterpart funds.

3.2 Benefits

3.2.1 Economic Benefits

Implementation of the project enlarged sale of seed production and marketing of the project companies,
thereby increasing profitability as well as farmers' income in project areas.

3.2.2 Social Benefits

3.2.2.1 Propelling Legislation of China's Seed Sector.

During implementation of the project, a series of laws, regulations and corresponding rules were
promulgated, such as "Regulation on Protection of New Variety of Plants", "Seed Law", providing
favorable conditions for commercialization and healthy development of China's seed sector.

3.2.2.2 Accelerating Commercialization Process of China's Seed Sector.

Before the project, the administration mechanism of China's seed sector was characterized by isolation
among provincial, prefecture and county authorities, mixing up of functions among administration,
institution and business operation (three in one), leading to less developed market and lack of competition.
Enforcement of Seed Law resulted in complete separation between seed administration stations and seed
companies. As an enterprise, seed company focuses on seed R&D, production and marketing; whereas
seed stations play administrative role, providing sound environment for healthy, orderly development of
seed sector by strengthening variety management, quality control and market monitoring. Furthermore,
ownership of project companies tended to be diversified.         For example, Hunan Provincial Seed Co.
spearheaded the reorganization of separation from seed station and transformation of the management
mechanism of the enterprise in 1995, and completed it in 1997. Thanks to its modern enterprise system and
advanced production equipment, the Corporation has accomplished excellent performance and expanded its
scale rapidly, what's more, it was listed in Shenzhen Securities Exchange (as Yahua Seed In.), the first in
seed sector of China.

3.2.2.3 Promoting Staff Quality.

Through training and study tour, the implementing agencies gained a better understanding of difference
between China and developed countries in the world, as well as advanced managerial and operational
methodology and technology, and human resources quality and structure was hence greatly improved.

3.2.3 Ecological Benefits

Ecological protection has been given full attention from project design through implementation,
environmental protection measures have been taken to prevent particulate, noise and waste pollutions in
construction of seed production bases, seed processing plants and warehouses for most of implementing
agencies.

4. Major Affecting Factors

4.1. Factors out of Control of Government and Implementing Agencies

4.1.1 Market and Price.

Firstly, enforcement of Seed Law and China's accession into WTO opened up seed market leading to fierce
competition and attendant decline of seed price and profitability of the project. Secondly, Asia financial
turmoil brought about dramatic decrease of farm produce price as well as farmers' enthusiasm in
production which in turn influenced seed price. Thirdly, procurement price of equipment and other goods
are far below prices at appraisal, as a result, financial progress lagged greatly behind physical progress,
and considerable adjustments had to be made in response.

4.1.2 Alteration of Interest Rate.

Legal document of the project requires a rate higher than 6.5% for onlending from provincial Financial
Department to seed companies, compared with recent domestic rate of 6.36% as a result of successive
reductions of domestic interest rate in reaction to economic situation changes, moreover, domestic financing
channels are increasing. All of the above facts eliminated Bank loan's advantage of lower rate and
dampened companies' enthusiasm in utilization of Bank funds.

4.1.3 Natural Disasters.

Severe flood in 1998, frost in 2001, lasting rainy days in 2002 hit some project provinces affected seed
harvest and profitability of the project in these areas, some units even had to drop out of the project.

4.1.4 Procurement of Goods.

Theoretically speaking, bidding is the most economical and efficient procurement method, nevertheless, two
problems existed in this regard: firstly, a great deal of project provinces joined this project leading to huge
quantity of 64 sets of seed processing line procured at one time. Very, very hard work, adding to numbers
of review departments and lengthy review process resulted in relatively long procurement cycle, often than
not, the result was that market changed a lot when the equipment was put into operation, the profit margin
was hence affected; Secondly, inappropriate procurement method such as NCB for goods of small volume.

4.2 Factors under Control of Government

4.2.1 Macro Economic Policy.

Socialist market economy system was adopted in Nov 1993, Seed Law was enacted in 2000, China
obtained full membership of WTO in 2001, all of which contributed a lot to a more standardized and open
market of seed sector, brought both opportunities for modernization and commercialization of seed sector
and challenges from foreign seed players.          At present, central government is undertaking strategic
restructuring in agriculture sector, in support of high quality/efficiency ecologic agriculture mode in an
effort to enhance economic benefit and sustainable development of agriculture. Local governments support
agriculture projects through preferential policies in taxation, which would generate positive effects on
post-project operation.

On the other hand, Seed Commercialization Project loaned by the Bank, as an important component of the
Ninth-Five-Year Plan of National Seed Program, is supposed to enjoy equal treatment as domestic projects.
Nonetheless, domestic projects were rendered preference of low rate loan, while enterprises under Seed
Sector Commercialization Project had to bear all risks of interest and foreign exchange. Unequal treatment
posed great pressure upon enterprises involved in the Project competing on market economy terms.

4.2.2 Sectoral Policy.




                                                      - 29 -

Relevant sectors provided vital assistance and policy support toward project implementation and operation.
Financial authorities tried to raise financial allocation according to regulations supporting agriculture;
taxation authorities exempted customs duties and VAT for imported goods under the project in strict
compliance with preferential taxation policies by government; agriculture sector at all levels provided
technical instructions for the project in conformity to "Technology Promoting Agriculture" policy;
supervision authorities at various levels strengthened publicity and enforcement of Seed Law, protected
seed producers' and farmers' interest, thereby facilitating smooth implementation and operation of the
project.

4.2.3 Counterpart funds.      Due to financial constraints of local governments at various levels and
adjustment of credit policy as a result of Central Government's deepened financial mechanism reform,
counterpart funds and bank loans were unable to be available in time, incurring difficulties in project
implementation.

4.3 Factors under Control of Project Implementing Agencies

4.3.1 Mechanism Reform and Staff Alteration.

Implementation of the project coincided with critical moment of management system reform of seed sector
and government organizational restructuring at all levels, the consequent frequent changes in management
system and staff of seed companies brought about some difficulties.

4.3.2 Difference between Company Operation and Market Reaction

As Seed Law just came into effect, there is not adequate market conception among players in seed sector.
When encountering difficulties in commercial operation, some managers turned to local governments for
protection of their once traditional marketplace.         In addition, lack of long-term planning for seed
companies' development and preparation for competition in international arena produced negative impact
on commercialization of those companies.

5. Project Sustainability and Follow-up Operational Plan

5.1 Project Sustainability:

5.1.1 The Main Achievement of the Project Provided Possibility of Good Sustainability.

Firstly, a series of advanced technology and equipment were introduced, therefore it improved the situations
of seed production base and storage facility and strengthened the internal seed quality control. Training
program under the project helped to upgrade the staff with ability of new knowledge and concept of
administration.

Secondly, in the course of seed company commercialization, the company adjusted the share form, set up
marketing network of their own, collected the capital used in developing company and created favorable
condition for follow-up operation through reform, share system reconstruction, jointly purchasing and
being listed on the stock market.

Thirdly, the project entities utilized project fruits to attract investment and participated in the competition
and cooperation in the international market, therefore the entities built up and developed its strength and
enhanced the project sustainability.

5.1.2 Project Economic Benefits Ensured Project Sustainable Development. Project economic benefits not
only provided capital safeguard for paying back loan but also strengthened investment dynamics ulteriorly
and formed the good circle of investment-development-reinvestment-redevelopment.

5.1.3 Legal framework of the seed sector provided law safeguard to persons who engaged in seed breeding,
seed production and marketing. Thanks to the division of seed company and seed administration station, the

seed company got free of indistinction between functions of the government and those of the enterprises and
widened enterprise development space.

5.2 The Follow-up Operational Plan

5.2.1 To Stabilize Working Group and Remain Working Functions. The project administration
organizations of governments of different levels and their functions would be remained for transition after
the project was completed with the aim of working out and perfecting every administrative and operational
regulation and ensuring the project run well after construction. The group would provide guidance for
project entities to improve and perfect the finished project and facilities and coordinate closely with
financial departments in project loan management and repaying the capital with interest.

5.2.2 Push Ahead of Seed Sector Commercialization Continuously. After the project was completed, the
marketing system reform of seed industry would be deepen continuously, with the focal point of reforming
the local seed company ran individually with the strong regional feature into group-running company to
push the ownership reform and assets reconstruction ahead, and to absorb foreign investment and capital
among the common people to participate in operation. In this way, the situation that the state owned the
most share of the company would be changed and formed rational share system in order to meet the
requirements of marketing operation. The company should fully utilize the marketing network and build up
strategic friend relationship with retailer and wholesaler through agency, jointly-sale and directly-sale with
the aim of realization of chain management and speeding up the own varieties marketing exploration. The
company should also take the good opportunity of entering into WTO to be familiar with international
marketing rules, and participate in the international economic circle actively and try its best to get the share
of the international market.

5.2.3 To Strengthen Technology Innovation and Realize Products Pluralism. At present, most project
companies only have one or two seed varieties of local main crops, the capability resistant to market
venture is weak. The capability of scientific research and market exploration of project entities was
strengthened significantly through the project implementation. The entities should fully utilize this
advantage and take current favorable opportunity to increase the investment of scientific research of seed
breeding and try to increase their own varieties to 50% within 5 to 10 years. At the same time, the entities
should devote major efforts to explore seed breeding of new crops and marketing range to realize products
pluralism.

6. World Bank Performance

6.1 The Design of the Project Was Comparatively Rational.

Detailed arrangements have been made in determination of project aim, the plan of content and progress,
budgetary estimation, capital collection, procurement procedure, payment, special account, project auditing
and environmental effect.

6.2 The Appraisal of Project Was Religious and Scientific.

The selection of project entities, investment direction and scale and benefit forecast was carried out in line
with international tradition strictly. It adopted scientific means to analyze and calculate to ensure the
realization of project aim.

6.3 The Project Implementation Review Was Serious and Conscientious.

During the project implementation period, the World Bank supervision mission went to the project entities
for implementation review and guidance. They gave a lot of more feasible means and technical suggestion
for project implementation. Their conscientious working style, serious attitude, prompt nerve of policy and
flexibility of project task managers, officers and experts of World Bank made deep impression on us and



                                                     - 31 -

the project made significant benefits. The Chinese side was satisfied with the work done by the World
Bank.

7. Main Measures of Project Implementation, Experience and Lessons

In the six-year long project implementation, great progress has been made and improved the development of
seed industry and accumulated a lot of successful experience. But there were still some problems. The main
problems are as follows:

7.1 Main Experience

7.1.1 The government attached highly importance to the project and departments coordinated efficiently. In
the first period of implementation, project-leading group was build up from the central government to the
local government. It strengthened the organization, coordination and direction ability, optimized projects in
policy aspect and provided favorable condition for smooth implementation.

7.1.2 The construction was stable and the management was ordered. Seed Sector Commercialization
Project has set up project management offices at different levels at first. It was equipped by professionals
of plan, finance, monitoring and evaluation, procurement and training with responsibility of routine work,
such as project design, implementation and follow-up management, to ensure the concentration and
consistency of the project work. In the same time of building up the project management offices, perfecting
the regulation step by step. The central project office promulgated regulations such as "Management
regulation of implementation of seed sector commercialization project", "Management regulation of
drawing and reimbursing of seed sector commercialization project". The project offices of each province
worked out corresponding management measures and restricted the financial management of project.
Project capital was put into practice of special household, special fund and special usage to ensure the
smooth implementation of the projects.

7.1.3 Strict standard and scientific implementation. Firstly, layout at high starting point. During the course
of project determination, the layout was conducted with the principle of "seek truth from facts, high starting
point, high technology and market-priority" and composed feasible research report to ensure the feature of
foresight and science. Secondly, high quality construction. In the implementation of project, the quality was
priority. Thirdly, high standard management. The seed processing equipment and office equipment
purchased in the project implementation and civil works improved significantly the conditions of seed
production, processing, packaging, marketing, storage and office work. It improved the production and
marketing capability of project entities and enterprise management level.

7.1.4 To implement brand name strategy and improve enterprise competitive capability. The project entities
paid special attention to their brand name and made firm base for further development. For example, the
brand name "Yahua" of Hunan Yahua Seed Company(Hunan Provincial Seed Company) and the brand
name "Dahua" of Jiangsu Provincial State Farms Group have been famous brand names in seed industry
throughout China.

7.1.5 To increase technical investment and promote enterprise sustainable development. Thanks to Seed
Sector Commercialization Project supported by the World Bank, some project entities set up breeding
scientific research center of their own to realize the integrated operational mechanism of breeding selection,
production and operation and strengthen the sustainable development. Shanxi Province achieved good
results by increasing technical investment continuously: the Shanxi North Seed Company breeds 30 new
corn varieties, 12 new watermelon varieties and 4 new melon varieties successively; the Shanxi Provincial
Seed Company breeds a series of new vegetable varieties with the total amount of 25.

7.2 Main Lessons

7.2.1 Project Design

7.2.1.1 It took a long period from project identification, preparation, appraisal to implementation. Missing
the right-implemented period is the important reason that slow down the whole project progress and
resulted in some project entities refunded the loan.

7.2.1.2 The design did not provided enough support to strengthen research and development of new variety
therefore the market competitive capability was weakened.

7.2.1.3 The foresight of macro-economic environment changes and the trend of Chinese economic
development was not quite precise. For example, the appraisal of physical contingencies and price
contingencies reached 26%, value-added tax and customs reached 14%.

7.2.1.4 However, in the course of implementation, the physical contingencies and price contingencies were
almost zero, and the imported good and facilities could enjoy duty-free policy. The purchasing price was
much lower than evaluated price. Because of this, the budget was much higher than actual expenditure and
increased the payout of promised expenditure. Secondly, it worked the gap of market forecasting. The
analyses of agricultural products market was not penetrating and FIRR of some seed company did not
achieve expected aim.

7.2.1.5 Some finished project could not bring into play or had single function due to deficiency in layout
and selected point of groundwork. It was no good to make the most benefits of project.

7.2.2 Project Management.

7.2.2.1 Influenced by the government and project units reform, great changes took place in project units
personnel and it lacked working continuity badly; some project staff left their position after receiving
training and led to brain-drain; some project units were in need of scientific and standard management and
appeared the phenomenon of irrational utilization of human resources, capital and materials.

7.2.2.2 The Problems of Civil Works. This national project involved a lot of project units within large
range. The progress speed of each unit was different in addition some units did not understand of
procurement procedure and influence the project progress. At the same time, it showed connection between
procurement guidance the World Bank and Chinese economic policy was not closed. It lagged economic
development. This circumstance showed the confliction between enterprise management independents and
effectiveness in a special period. The procurement problems appeared in Shanxi Province because the
project unit was unfamiliar with procurement regulation of the World Bank.

7.2.2.3 A few procurement methods were not appropriate, as led to take much more time and increase the
project operation cost. In the future project operational courses, It is expected that the World Bank would
take flexible measures and take into consideration of actual project situation and operated countries and
adjust the measures in practice.

7.2.2.4 Seed Sector Commercialization Project is the first agricultural project in which procurement
ex-post review was required to be carried out by the Bank. However, in fact, ex-post review procurement
was conducted in late project implementation period near being closed. Some procurement problems could
not be found in time. It is expected that the Bank strengthen procurement training and arrange post review
of procurement in time in the future.

7.2.2.5 Grace Period. Corresponding adjustment on loan grace period was not taken in some provinces
where the new projects were incorporated. Therefore, new project units entered payback period after
two-year of project construction. It generated negative effect on project construction and market
competition for some degree.
