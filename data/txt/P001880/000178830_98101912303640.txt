MAURITIUS
COROMANDEL INDUSTRIAL ESTATE
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report analyzes a project to establish an industrial estate
at Coromandel, four miles southwest of Port Louis, the capital and major
city of Mauritius. The estate, with a total area of about 60 acres would
provide, on a rental basis, land and infrastructure for the construction
of individually owned factories as well as space in standard buildings for
small, medium, and some large scale industry. The total estimated cost of
the project is about US$8 million equivalent, of which close to half repre-
sents foreign exchange expenditures. IDA has been requested by the Govern-
ment to provide a credit of US$4 million for the project.
ii.       The Mauritian economy, dominated by a single agricultural product
(sugar), has been unable to provide sufficient jobs for the expanding work-
ing force. Unemployment is estimated to be 41,000 or 17% of the total labor
force of 249,000 (out of a population of 823,000). In addition, there are
18,500 relief and development workers (7% of the working force) and under-
employment is widespread. Since arable land for all practical purposes is
fully under cultivation, agricultural growth and diversification cannot have
more than limited impact, leaving industrial development as the major feasible
long-term alternative if the unemployment problem is to be solved. Import
substitution possibilities are limited because of the small national market
and, therefore, industrial growth must be strongly oriented to export pro-
cessing activities.
iii.      In recent years, stimulated by a generous package of incentives,
foreign investment in manufacturing has been entering the country at an
accelerating pace. The first industrial zone at Plaine Lauzun in Port
Louis was inaugurated in December 1970 and will be fully developed and occu-
pied by early 1974. Approved new industries are having difficulty in find-
ing suitable rented quarters or land for factory construction. In response
to the immediate unsatisfied demand for industrial space, which is pro-
jected to grow further through the decade, the Government proposes to build
the industrial estate at Coromandel and in the future others in a dispersed
pattern around the island.
iv.       The Coromandel Industrial Estate project will be owned and managed
by the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM), a government-owned institution
established in 1964 which has gained experience in industrial site planning,
development and operation at Plaine Lauzun. The proposed financing consists
of a Government equity contribution in DBM of US$4 million equivalent and
the IDA credit of US$4 million channeled through DBM. The Investment in
the estate would be recovered by rental fees charged the estate occupants
by DBM, which in turn would repay the US$4 million of loan funds to the
Government over 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at an interest rate
of 7.25%. The estate will be developed between 1973 and 1978 and occupancy
starting in 1974 is projected to grow in step with the phased development
of land and buildings. The financial return of the estate project at an
assumed 90% occupancy and competitive rentals is 15.4%.



- ii -
v.        Among the benefits to be generated by the project are 5,000 jobs
by 1980 rising to 8,000 by 1985, most of them involving training and skill
upgrading of unskilled and/or unemployed workers. The industries on the
estate will represent an estimated capital investment of US$58 million and
by the mid-eighties corporate income taxes should approach US$5 million per
annum. Net foreign exchange earnings after allowing for profit remittances
and repatriation of imported capital, on the conservative assumption that
all the invested capital is foreign, should approach US$20 million per
annum in the late 1980's. The estate is also expected to act as a strong
stimulus to indigenous entrepreneurship and small scale industry develop-
ment. Finally, national land use as well as industrial and social infra-
structure planning and implementation will be greatly facilitated in response
to the guided concentration of industry on the Coromandel estate.
vi.       In view of the project's technical and financial feasibility and
its economic benefits, and the agreements reached during negotiations on
necessary assurances as summarized at the end of the report, the project is
suitable for an IDA credit of US$4 million equivalent.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since 1970, as part of its development program, the government-
owned Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) has been leasing space to private
firms in standard manufacturing buildings constructed within the Plaine
Lauzun industrial zone 1/ at Port Louis, the country's capital and principal
harbor (Map). The program has been highly successful and early in 1974
the 110 arpents (115 acres) of the zone are expected to be fully occupied
by factories established in these pre-constructed buildings (15 arpents) and
individually-owned factories on leased plots (95 arpents). In line with
the Government's objective of fostering industry and thereby helping reduce
unemployment, DBM has been planning further industrial site development on
another 60 arpents at Coromandel, four miles from Port Louis, and in May 1972
the Government approached the International Development Association (IDA)
for assistance in carrying out the country's first full-fledged industrial
estate at this location. The project would consist of the development of
land and the provision of the necessary infrastructure for the settlement
of industry including pre-constructed standard buildings to be leased to
manufacturing firms. The project is estimated to cost about US$8 million
equivalent, of which IDA would contribute half or US$4 million.
2/
1.02      The consulting firm SCET-International -  was selected by DBM
in June 1972 to prepare a study to determine: (i) the most suitable location
for the industrial estate, and (ii) its technical, financial and economic
feasibility. An interim report was submitted in December 1972, and the final
report, confirming the feasibility of the project, was completed in January
1973 3/.
1.03      This report is based on the SCET study and the findings of an
appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. C. Goderez (chief) and M. Iskander
(industrial economist) of the Industrial Projects Department which visited
Mauritius from January 31 to February 10, 1973.
II. BACKGROUND
A. The Problem - Unemployment
2.01      Mauritius is a small island (720 square miles) located some 500
miles due east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The population of 823,000
in 1972, while increasing at a rate of only 1.8% per annum (compared to 3%
in the 1950's), makes the island one of the most densely populated areas
1/ An industrial zone is an area reserved for industry but without the
central management and common service facilities of an industrial
estate (see para. 2.20 for further discussion).

in the worid. The economy is overwhelmingly dependent on a single crop -
sugar - which during 1967-1970 contributed 33% of GDP, 40% of total employ-
ment and 90% of exports. From 1962 to 1969, the economy stagnated and GNP
at market prices was only US$200 million in 1971 or about US$250 per capita.
As a result of firm sugar prices worldwide and the determined efforts of the
Government to accelerate industrial investment, the GNP trend is now rising.
Government projections of a 7% annual rate of economic growth up to 1975
are not unrealistic provided sugar prices continue firm and industrialization
continues its upward trend.
2.02      There is, however, a serious problem of unemployment and under-
employment.  Registered enemployed and relief and development workers totalled
59,500 in 1972 or about 24% of the labor force.  (Comprehensive registration
of unemployed in the last two years probably picked up a substantial number
of hidden unemployed who were not included in the 1969 statistics given in
the table, para. 2.03). Statistics on the underemployed are unreliable but
cannot fail to be very high in a sugar-based seasonal economy. One study
in 1961/62 revealed that 7,000 men during the height of the sugar cropping
and milling season and 12,700 during the intercrop season were working less
than 30 hours per week. Agriculture alone cannot solve the problem, de-
spite efforts at diversification into other crops such as tea and ginger,
since available arable land is already practically 100% under crop, 95% in
sugar alone.
B. Government Strategy
1. Employment Targets
2.03      The land constraint and continued population growth have led to
the economic development strategy adopted by the Government designed to
accomplish a major structural change in the econamy to ensure full employ-
ment by 1980. Agriculture's share in the economy, at present about 25% of
GDP, is projected to decline to 17% by 1980 while the share of manufacturing
is to rise from 15% to 23% of GDP. Industrializatiotn, therefore, is the key
long term factor if the full employment goal set by the Government and
tabulated below is to be met (Annex 1):

Total      231,000   278,000  325,000                5.3



The table indicates that employment must grow by a total of 130,000 jobs
over the decade, or at an annual rate of 5.3%, if the working force, in-
creasing at a rate of 3.5% per annum, is to be fully employed by 1980. To
achieve this goal, manufacturing employment will have to increase at 9.4%
per annum to compensate for slower growth sectors. (If the unemployment
and relief and development worker figure was as high in 1972 as indicated in
para. 2.02, manufacturing employment will in fact have to grow faster than
9.4% per annum between 1973 and 1980 if the government target is to be met.)
2.04      To deal with the problem of interim unemployment, the Development
Plan includes a government work program called "Travail Pour Tous" (TPT)
which may receive IDA support through a Rural Development Project currently
being appraised. Only projects deemed economically or socially productive
are undertaken and these are typically roads, buildings, land clearing and
reforestation, bench terracing to increase land availability and rural
water supply. Besides providing necessary employment, and added national
benefit is derived - upgrading of labor skills such as carpentry, brick-
laying and plumbing, creating a resource which will be in growing demand as
the industrialization process accelerates. It is expected that as private
industrial investment grows, the TPT program will be phased out after a
peak in 1975 and disappear by 1980.
2. Industrial Production for Export
2.05      Because of the small national market, import substitution activi-
ties have limited potential and in fact the possibilities in this area have
been substantially exhausted. Production for export, based primarily on
imported raw and intermediate goods, appears to be the only feasible alter-
native and the main promotional thrust has been aimed at attracting export
processing activities of the type that have flourished in Korea, Hong-Kong,
Taiwan and Singapore. Mauritius' major comparative advantage is its ample
supply of labor at wage rates about one-third of those in Hong-Kong and
Singapore. This advantage is likely to be prolonged for the foreseeable
future even though some upward pressure on wage levels can and should be
expected because of the predicted economic growth and increasing job opportuni-
ties. The same factors are, however, operating in competing countries so
that the relative advantage of Mauritius should continue.
2.06      Additionally, factories already established including gem cutting,
carved furniture, packaging products, thread and garments among others, have
demonstrated the high level of trainability inherent in Mauritian workers.
But the success of the campaign initiated in the late 1960's to attract
industrial investment to the island must be attributed as well to other
factors equally as important as the quality and low cost of labor. These
are embodied in a global program of incentives reflecting the Government's
determined and pragmatic approach to industrial promotion.



-.4-
3.  Export Incentives
2.07      Among the incentives offered are tax holidays of generally 5 to
10 years, no import duties on capital goods and raw materials, credit availa-
bility, subsidized power and water rates, free repatriation of capital and
dividends, government contributions to the cost of export market surveys,
trade fairs and trade missions, and prepared industrial sites offering low
cost rental space in first-class reinforced concrete buildings or, alter-
natively, loans of up to 50% of building costs repayable over 10 years. Not
the least important incentive is the Export Processing Zones Act of 1970,
which facilitates for government approved and certified industries the in and
out movement of goods, based on ex post facto scrutiny by the National
Comptroller.
2.08      The comprehensive incentive "package" offered may perhaps be more
concessionary than is necessary to achieve the desired stimulation of invest-
ment but has been considered justifiable by the Government in order to
maximize the attractions of Mauritius to foreign firms. As noted later in
this report, it appears to have been successful in terms of investment flow
and job creation and, therefore, changes in terms and conditions should be
approached with caution. It may be advisable to reconsider whether or not
concessionary rates on power and water, for example, are really necessary.
Scheduling of future capital repatriation to help ensure net positive foreign
exchange earnings from `e inception of each project might also be feasible
without significant deterrent effects on investment. For tile next few years,
however, at least until Mauritius becomes better known to the world business
zommunity, it would probably be prudent not to alter significantly the
present package. 1/
2.09      Associate membership in the European Economic Comnunity is pendin-
(ratification of this status is expected in May/June 1973) and Mauritius
based industry is looking forward to easier access to that major market area.
Australia has conceded preferential tariff rates on certain Mauritian pro-
ducts and exports to that country and to South Africa are growing. Long range
prospects for export growth to the U.S.A. and other developed countries will
be enhanced once the Generalized System of Preferences of UNCTAD comes into
effect.
2.0       A potential investor planning to produce for the world market cannot
.lo pbut find Mauritius a desirable location. The incentives and advantages
r.merated above, coupled with a pleasant sub-tropical climate, ease of imm'
on for expatriate managers and relative political and social stability,
3roven to be effective in attracting a growing number of firms.  This
basic reality -which supports the feasibility of the proposed project
st Coromandei.
/5j  + Scott (Oxford) in a report "@The Promotion of Export Processing
odus,ries in Mauritius", June 1972, opined that the current system of
.~.s.entives is yielding in net social benefits about 90% of the optimum
-:.* could be achieved, indicating that potential incremental social
.-.enefits are small in any case.



-5-
C. The Manufacturing Sector
1. Present Position and Growth Trends
2.11      In 1969, manufacturing contributed about 15% to GDP and 13% of
total employment (25,000 jobs approximately). The sector is dominated by
sugar milling and related industries which generate about 60% of value added
and 50% of manufacturing jobs; sugar and tea processing alone in 1969
accounted for 26% of the sectoral work force. At the other end of the spec-
trum, small scale manufacturing, defined by the Census of Industrial Pro-
duction as establishments employing 10 or less, comprises 95% of total enter-
prises (3,471 out of 3,660 in 1968), employs about the same number of
workers as the 189 larger enterprises (over 10 workers per enterprise, not
including sugar and tea processing) but contributes only 15% of manufacturing
output. Except for a government owned sack factory and feed mill, the sector
is entirely privately owned.
2.12      During the 1960's, growth in manufacturing was almost entirely in
import substitution, with the exception of the major agricultural based
sugar and tea industries.  During the 10-year period 1963-1972, eac1 /year an
average of 8 primarily import substituting "development companies" - were
established, generating at their inception about 50 jobs per enterprise
(Annex 2). On the other hand, from 1970 to the end of 1972, following the
introduction of the export incentive system (para. 2.07), an average of 7
export processing companies per year were created primarily with foreign
investment averaging some 100 jobs/enterprise (Annex 3), or double the employ-
ment per plant compared to the development companies.
2.13      While the rate of implantation of development companies has been
falling off significantly, and may be expected to diminish further since
possibilities for additional import substitution are now virtually exhausted,
the trend for export processing companies has been rising sharply. On the
basis of latest estimates available (Dec. 1972), the number of export proces-
sing certificates granted, and projected to be converted into operating plants
in 1973 and 1974, totalled 29 corresponding to 14 or 15 new companies per year
if all are indeed installed. Allowing for some slippage, it may conservative-
ly be expected that, combined, about 16 development and export processing
companies will be established annually in the near future.
2.14      An interesting and very significant conclusion of the SCET market
study is the high proportion of investments anticipated from firms already
established in the better known export-processing zones of Hong Kong,
Singapore, Taiwan and others. The success of those nations has raised wages
to levels which are progessively more unfavorable compared with those of
Mauritius and the politically tense atmosphere of Southeast Asia makes Mauri-
tius' relatively remote location - which otherwise would be a disadvantage -
appear attractive by comparison.
1/ Locally financed companies which are granted "development certificates";
these carry certain incentives such as tax holidays, credit availability,
and reduced tariffs on imported capital goods and materials.

2. Expected Growth of Manufacturing Emplo]yent
2.15      In this section, the manufacturing sector will be treated as com-
prising all manufacturing (small, medium and large) industries, excluding
sugar and tea processing for which zero employment growth is anticipated in
the 1970-1980 decade. Between 1967 and 1970 the total number of manufacturing
jobs increased at a rate of approximately 3% per year and it was only from
1970 onward that - primarily due to the influx of export-processing companies -
the rate tripled to 9% per year. Total manufacturing employment is estimated
to have reached about 22,500 at the end of 1972, of which 11,700 were employed
in medium/large scale industry and 10,800 in small establishments and artisan
shops. On the basis of the detailed study prepared by SCET, it is further
estimated that between 1973 and 1980 some 22,300 and 5,200 new jobs will be
created respectively in medium/large and small enterprises so that by the end
of the present decade the manufacturing labor force will have reached some
50,000 or about 83% of the Government's manufacturing employment target of
60,400 in 1980 (Annex 4). Based on the evidence available, there is a high
probability of equaling or exceeding the predicted growth over the next
several years and a lower, but still reasonable, probability of maintaining
t *- Awth during the second half of the decade.
2.16      The expected employment creation in medium/large enterprises - of
prime concern to the evaluation of the estate project - is based on the
following major assumption: (a) the average number of medium/large enter-
prises to be established annually in Mauritius will continue to be about 16
as in the recent past; (b) the average employment intensity per plant will
be maintained (i.e. at the start of operations, for development companies
about 50 persons per plant and for export processing industries about 100
per plant);  (c..  'he composition of the mix between development and export
processing companies will shift markedly in favor of the latter; and (d)
additional employment creation of about 10% per year will occur in the al-
ready existing enterprises as tiiey expand. As a consequence, incremental
employment in this segment of industry is expected to increase from about
1,600 per annum to 4,300 per amnunm between 1973 and 1980, or by 15% per
year, and by a total of about 22,300 new jobs as mentioned in para. 2.15.
3. Industrial Land Requirement Forecast
/_.lm     Rational land use planning is particularly important in Mauritius
since there is no land reserve to absorb or to mitigate the effects of non-
optimal and haphazard land use. A start has been made in land use planning
but a much more comprehensive approach is needed and should involve the
various relevant government agencies (Ministry of Town and Country Planning,
Ministry of Agriculture, DBM and others) in a coordinated program. This
issue is dealt with in greater detail in the Rural Development Project
Appraisal 1/. Meanwhile, even in the absence of a comprehensive land use
plan, the Coromandel project contributes to the objective of rational land
use for industry.
I/ Rural Development Project Appraisal, Report No. MAS-161, June 5,
Annex 2, para. 9.



-7-
- 7 -
2.18      Assuming generally accepted average ratios of job creation per
unit of land for the types of enterprises likely to be established in Mauri-
tius, it is forecast that about 446 arpents of additional factory land will
be required between 1973 and 1980 (Annex 4).
4. Availability of Industrial Land
2.19      Under the current Development Plan (1971-1975), nine primary
and four secondary smaller areas totalling 660 arpents have been reserved for
industry (Annex 5). These include the Coromandel site of 60 arpents but
exclude the 110 arpents of the Plaine Lauzun industrial zone which has already
been fully allocated. Even assuming a faster industrial growth than des-
cribed in the preceding paragraphs, the above areas will amply satisfy in-
dustrial land requirements into the early 1980's. Taking into account that
many larger enterprises and a significant number of medium-sized establishments
are likely to purchase land and develop factory sites independently, notwith-
standing the overall land limitation in Mauritius, the planned industrial
sites provide an adequate reserve well into the 1980's. The above areas are
either unused government-owned Crown Land readily available for development
or marginally productive private sugar crop land.
2.20      With the exception of Coromandel, all of the reserved areas are
still designated as industrial zones and it is unlikely that all will in fact
be converted into estates. An industrial zone is a delineated area reserved
for industry where companies buy or lease land from private or public owners,
build factories and individually negotiate supply of services such as power
and water with the public utilities. There are no common services, central
management or special facilities such as pre-constructed standard buildings
ready for occupancy, auxiliary power plants, central water storage and sewage
treatment as in industrial estates. The centrally planned and managed estate
concept offers many advantages, especially to smaller firms seeking rented
space in buildings or small parcels of leased land for construction.
2.21      Nevertheless, as already stated, some firms may be expected to
establish plants independently either because of company preference, or
because their operations do not meet estate standards. For example, these
standards normally exclude certain chemical processing industries which
even with the best available pollution control technology disseminate odors
or irritants and need to be isolated. Generally, the firms preferrring
estate locations will be of small to medium size (50 to 200 employees), en-
gaged in light manufacturing (apparel, furniture, electronics and other light
assembly activities, packaging products, jewelry and ornaments) and inclined
to limit their investment to equipment and working capital without tying up
substantial capital in land and buildings. SCET estimated that 80% of the
new companies, and in particular the export processing firms, would prefer
the prepared space and services of an estate and be acceptable as occupants.
This distribution pattern appears reasonable based on experience in other
countries and the recent history in Mauritius, and implies that of the total
projected demand of 446 arpents between 1973 and 1980 (Annex 4), 80% or 360
arpents should take the form of estates. Coromandel will provide 60 arpents
within the next few years and the need for further estate projects in the
other reserved locations should be continually assessed and implemented as the
growth in demand justifies the investments needed.



III.  THE PROJEC'T'
A. Site Location and Size
3.01      Although the 60 arpents at Coromandel had already been optioned
early i2n 1972 bv DBM on the basis of its own evaluation, the SCET feasibility
study started with a comparative analysis of altervaative sites. Available
alternatives were weighed in accordance with the foilowing criteria: land
values, transportation arteries, proximity to the major center of Port Louis,
labor availabiLity, land characteristics (load bearing capacity, surface,
and tinderground features affecting construction. costs), c.ost of external
infrastructure connections (power, water, telephones, drainage and sewage
disposail). A first review narrowed the preferred choices to four - Coro-
mandel, Vacoas-Phoenix, Curepipe and La Cure (Map) - which were then surveyed
in depth to select the one most suitable.  it was conclude- that Coromandel
is indeed the most economic and therefore the preferred site. DBM purchased
the land in February 1973 and preparatory work nas begun to develop it into
an industrial estate.  Among its outstanding advantages are:
(a)  Land was purchased at a very favorabIL;& -Price of Rs 15,000
(US$2,900)0/arpent which is well below the current market
price of Rs 60,000/arpent (DBM estimate).
(b)  It is unoccupied and unexploited and had been considered only
marginally productive for sugar cane.
(c) Located at the southern edge of the District of Port Louis, it is
on'ly 4 miles from the urban center but easily accessible to the
major labor force of Port Louis by regular bus service which can
be expanded as needed.
(d)  It is bounded on the east by the pri rr highway connecting Port
Louis with the airport, which is 30 uulle,i   a .ay, and on the north,
west and south by secondary roads (Annex
(e) Land is only slightly sloping (4 to 6'l); grading costs will there-
fore be minimal and surface drainage adequate.
(f) High voltage power distribution lines cross the property.
(g) Sufficient water of the requisite quality iS readily available from
nearby sources.
3.02      In view o`t the projected high demand for industrial sites parti-
cularly in the proximity of Port Louis, DBM has taken an option on an addi-
tional 120 arpents adjacent to Coromandel, at La Tour, parts of which would
be allocated to housing and other social infrastructure. No development
work will be undertaken at 'a Tour until 1974 at the earliest when DBM will
have to decide whether it wants to expand the Corom&ndel estate through



- 9 -
addition of La.Tour or develop a new estate at some other location. Expanding
Coromandel has obvious advantages in reducing infrastructure costs, but the
possibility of excessive congestion must also be taken into consideration and
financial savings in developing the larger estate in one continuous project
might be more than offset by the additional social costs of urban congestion.
These aspects require further study and, during negotiations, DBM has agreed
to consult IDA before proceeding with development of La Tour.
B. Development Plan
3.03      A detailed analysis of the physical part of the estate is contained
in the SCET Study; the layout of the estate and a brief description of its
infrastructure are given in Annex 7.
1. Plot Plan, Factory Buildings and Number of Enterprises
3.04      The site will be subdivided into 25 plots for industry and one plot
for a management and commercial center. Average plot size will be 1.9 arpents
but the layout provides optimum flexibility for plot sizes to range from 0.5
to 4 arpents per enterprise, or even more, depending on individual require-
ments. Following the strong demand for ready-made factory buildings at Plaine
Lauzun, over one third of the estate will be reserved for this type of factory
building, i.e. primarily for small scale enterprises. Also for these the floor
area per factory can be kept very flexible from a minimum size of 2,000 sq. ft.
to a multiple thereof. All plots and subdivisions have access to the internal
road network and to the various utilities (para. 3.05) that will be provided
on the estate. The projected pattern of land usage and of the number of fac-
tories expected to settle on the estate is given below:
PATTERN OF LAND USAGE, AVERAGE FACTORY SPACE, AND NUMBER OF ENTERPRISES
Land    Estimated      Average Floor    Number of
Area   Floor Space  Space Per Factory  Factories
(arpents)  (sq.ft.)       (sq. ft.)
(a) 12 to 15 Standard
Buildings (small/medium scale
industries)               27      900,000           7,500            120
(b) Individual Factories
(medium/large scale indus-
tries) 1/                 20      300,000          30,000             10
(c) Management/Commercial
Center                     4       60,000             -                -
(d) Roads, Utilities and Land
for Common Use             9         - _                            _

1/   Owner financed, although DBM may extend construction loans out of its
general funds.



- 10 -
3.05      The number of factories that will in fact locate on the estate is
difficult to predict and the above total of 130 enterprises must be considered
a rough approximation only. While the number is based on experience gained
at the Plaine Lauzun industrial zone, it will vary with the type of industry
that will actually settle on the estate. The individual and the standard
factory buildings will be of reinforced concrete construction to withstand
the cyclonic winds of the area of velocities of 160 miles/hour and more. The
standard factory buildings will have one to three floors and will largely
follow the design that at Plaine Lauzun has proved satisfactory both from the
point of view of utility and low cost of construction. Individual factory
buildings will have to comply with certain architectural guidelines to pre-
serve the aesthetic character of the estate.
3.06      The Management/Commercial Center will be a building to house
DBM's on-site operating staff, a canteen, bank, post office, and possibly
several retail stores. A building and grounds maintenance shop would also
be included to store maintenance equipment, tools and materials. Production
shops such as foundries and forges are not envisaged as estate-owned facili-
ties, but might appear as privately-owned ancillary industries.
2. Other Infrastructure
3.07      Provision of utilities (water, sewage, power and telecommunications)
and responsibility for their implementation will rest with the respective
public utilities and will therefore not form part of the cost of the project;
an exception is the sewage treatment plant which will be constructed by the
estate and on its account. Preliminary design standards as included in the
SCET study are in line with normal practice in Mauritius and, as they will
generally follow those at Plaine Lauzun, are already known to be acceptable
to foreign private investors.  These standards were discussed during negoti-
ations and agreement was reached on satisfactory arrangements to be entered
into with the utility companies on the timely construction of their facilities.
C. Type of Estate Enterprise and Employment
3.08      The type of export-oriented industries that can be expected to come
to the estate will be determined by two principal factors: (a) the availabil-
ity of low-cost and quickly trainable labor and (b) the relatively high trans-
portation costs overseas. Production therefore will be geared to the manu-
facture or partial processing of a wide variety of products, from electronic
components to toys, with a high value added, where labor inputs are signifi-
cant and where the value of imported materials and components and of the ex-
ported product is high as compared to their weight and/or volume. Most of
the processes therefore can be expected to be highly labor-intensive. Annex 8
gives a spectrum of the type of products that might be expected to be manu-
factured on the estate, together with the countries from which the technical
know-how would be supplied. Using the same industry mix as at Plaine Lapzun
and the same average ratio of 6.7 workers per 1,000 sq. ft. of floor space as
experienced there, Coromandel when fully occupied could employ some 8,000 people.



IV. PROJECT COST, CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE AND FINANCIAL PLAN
A.   Project Cost and Construction Schedule
4.01      The cost of the project, detailed in Annex 9, is summarized
below:
CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES
Local Foreign  Total    Local  Foreign  Total        %
(Rs. million)            (US$ million)
Land                    0.90      -     0.90      0.17      -      0.17     2.1
Infrastructure          1.51   0.97    2.48       0.28    0.18    0.46      5.8
Buildings              12.22  13.18   25.40       2.26    2.44    4.70    59.2
Engineering and
Supervision           0.65    -       0.65     0.12       -     0.12      1.5
Sub-total            15.28  14.15   29.43      2.83    2.62    5.45    68.6
Contingencies
- Physical             1.44   1.42    2.86       0.28    0.27    0.55      6.8
- Price Escalation    6.48   4.00   10.48        1.20    0.74    1.94    24.6
Total               23.20  19.57   42.87      4.31    3.63    7.94   100.0
4.02      The cost estimates were prepared by SCET in January 1973 on the
basis of actual costs incurred in the ongoing construction of similar works
on the Plaine Lauzun industrial zone. Land was purchased by DBM in February
1973 and construction is expected to commence by mid-1973 and to end by
December 1978. Initial contracts for construction will be let for only
portions of the total work, including 40% of the standard buildings between
(about 300,000 sq. ft. of leasable floor space), the Management/Commercial
Center (60,000 sq. ft.), and 60% of leasable land (12 arpents) plus 60% of
roads and other infrastructure. As presently planned this contractual phase
will be completed by the end of 1975 and the remainder of the buildings and
the infrastructure will be built between 1976 and 1978. Phasing construction
over a 5-year period is designed to insure full occupancy of land and build-
ings as soon as they are ready. Given current forecasts of supply and demand
for industrial land and buildings, the construction period is somewhat
lengthy. However, the construction plan is flexible enough to allow the estate
management to adjust the speed of construction in the light of realized and
prospective rates of occupancy.
4.03      Physical contingencies of 10% of project costs (before contingen-
cies) - and excluding land which has already been purchased - are included
in the above estimate. Price escalation (starting with Jan. 1, 1974) has
been based on current trends, i.e. 12% per year on local currency expenditures
and 8% per year on foreign exchange expenditures. With these contingencies
and particularly since it is likely that the overall construction period



- 12 -
can be compressed, cost estimates are considered realistic. Nevertheless,
during negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that it
wtll supply any funds - both local and foreign - that may be needed to com-
plete the project, on terms satisfactory to IDA.
4.04      Various estimates have been made by DBM and SCET (Annex 10) of the
foreign exchange and local currency components of the building construction
and infrastructure works. The above split of about 54% local and 46% foreign
probably underestimates the foreign exchange requirements which may be as
high as half of total project cost. The IDA credit of US$4.0 million is
based on the assumption that the foreign exchange component will be a maxi-
mum of 50% of project cost.
B. Financing Plan
4.05      The project will be financed as follows:
FINANCING PLAN
Rs million         US$ million
Government equity contribution          21.4               4.0
Proceeds of IDA credit                  21.4               4.0
Total              42.8               8.0
The US$4.0 million equivalent contribution by the Government would take
the form of an equity subscription in DBM.
4.06      The IDA credit would be made to the Government, which would onlend
the proceeds to DBM at an interest rate of 7.25% per annum and repayable over
20 years including 5 years grace, the latter corresponding to the approxi-
mate duration of construction. T'o avoid putting additional risks on DBM on
account of its agency role of executing the project on behalf of the Govern-
ment, during negotiations the Government proposed and it was agreed that it
would guarantee DBM against project losses. This would be accomplished by
the Government reimbursing DBM for project operating losses incurred in any
fiscal vear in excess of cumulative earned surplus from project operations.



- 03 -
V.  PROCUREMENT, USE OF CREDIT AND RATE OF DISBURSEMENT
5.01      The proceeds of the IDA credit will be used for expenditures on
the construction of roads, standard buildings and other infrastructure works,
but not for the purchase of the estate land and the engineering contract.
The land has already been acquired and the engineering contract will be
negotiated with S.I.G.M.A., a local firm of engineers, at a fee of 2% of the
value of civil works. S.I.G.M.A. is well known to DBM as competent firm
which has successfully carried out important public works in Mauritius and
is considered qualified by IDA.
5.02      Tender notices for goods and services contracts (excluding the
engineering contract) will be made known to all local embassies and consulates
of the Association's member countries and Switzerland, in addition to adver-
tisement in Mauritius.
5.03      IDA funds will be disbursed against certified progress payments
on eligible contracts. The ratio of IDA to government contributions in these
contracts will be 52/48; this takes account of the Government's additional
payments for land and the engineering contract. Quarterly disbursement
forecasts of the credit are shown in Annex 11. As indicated in para. 4.04,
a minimum of 91% of the credit is expected to be used for foreign exchange
purchases but this could possibly reach 100%.
VI. PROJECT AND OPERATING CAPABILITY
A.  DBM - Financial Capability and Estate Development Experience
6.01      DBM, the proposed owner and executing agency of the project, is
an autonomous public sector institution, established in 1964 to foster
industrial and tourism development and agricultural diversification. Share
capital of Rs. 10 million (US$1.85 million) is owned 80% by the Government
and 20% by the Bank of Mauritius (Central Bank). As of June 30, 1972, total
resources of DBM were Rs. 71 million (US$13.2 million), consisting of Rs. 22
million capital and reserves; Rs. 18 million debentures and bonds outstanding;
Rs. 29 million government loans; and Rs. 2 million deposits. Annual dis-
bursements have increased at an average rate of 20% between 1965 and 1972.
In mid-1972, DBM obtained a US$3.5 million IDA credit of which US$400,000
was allocated to the construction of standard buildings at Plaine Lauzun
and US$100,000 to finance the Coromandel industrial estate feasibility study.
Industrial building construction and leasing has been underway at Plaine
Lauzun for some years and DBM has gained considerable experience in planning,
executing and management of standard buildings as well as in general super-
vision of the industrial zone at Plaine Lauzun. Annex 12 gives more back-
ground on DBM's activities, financial position and prospects.



- 14 -
6.02      Management of the estate by DBM is, furthermore, advantageous
because of the combination with possible loan financing of individually
owned factory buildings and equipment for estate enterprises. Assuming
that estate enterprises will borrow as much as 60% of the value of their
equipment and up to 50% of the cost of buildings, total loan requirements
between 1974 and 1980 could reach approximately Rs. 162 million (US$30 mil-
lion) or an average of about Rs. 23 million (US$4.3 million) per year. The
average figure, however, would follow a growth curve so that annual require-
ments in the mid-1970's will be lower, perhaps in the US$2 to 3 million
range, and may rise to US$5 million or more late in the decade. Approvals
of .1ans to medium/large scale enterprises by DWI were US$1 million in
FY1971 (ended June 30, 1971), US$1.5 million in FY1972 and are expected to reach
US$4 million in FY1973, a probably exceptionally high figure. Assuming that
a current "normal" rate of lending is about US$3.5 million per year, and con-
sidering that about 70% of DBN's portfolio is in manufacturing, DBM seems now
to be lending to this sector at about the rate predicted for the immediate
years ahead at Coromandel - US$2-3 million per year.
6.03      Although DBM is the primary source of development lending, in addi-
tion the six conmercial banks in Mauritius have recently begun to participate
with DBM on a 50:50 basis in development loans of up to 7 years to medium/large
scale industry at the same interest rate as DBM's (8.5%). Commrrcial bank
credits to industry, including short-term, increased by 70% in FY1971 and
anotlher 58% in F9Y1972, reaching Rs. 55 million in June 1972, corresponding to
17.8% of total credits outstanding (Rs. 308 million). 1/ If we assume that
10% of this industrial credit is medium-long term development finance, it
would appear that Rs. 5.5 million (US$1 million) has been channeled into in-
dustrial development finance by the commercial banks out of total resources
of i's. 308 million (US$57 million). This activity has started only in the
last two to three years and can be expected to grow. The resources of DBM
plus the resources and growing involvement of the commercial banks appear
to be adeeuate to meet the estimated demand for industrial equipment and
factory building finance at Coromandel.
B.   Project Execution
6.04      Additional staff is needed for the project and a separate unit will
be established within DBM with prime responsibilities for project implementa-
tion. DBM plans to recruit a civil engineer as a full-time Project Manager
and a project accountant, responsible for the day-to-day management of the
project. Both will work under the overall supervision of the Head of DBM's
Industrial Section and be supported by other DBM staff as may be required
1/   Bank Supervision Report, March 11, 1973, "The Development Bank of
Mauritius."



- 15 -
from time to time. An important function of the accountant will be to
set up separate project bookkeeping and accounts to facilitate financial
control and future evaluation of the estate's performance.
6.05      As in the past at Plaine Lauzun, further technical expertise will
be supplied by a Mauritian architect who will be responsible for building
design, preparation of building tender documents, evaluation of bids and
supervision of construction. The architect would report to the Project
Manager and act as the owner's (DBM) representative in all dealings with the
contractors. S.I.G.M.A. will provide engineering design services, i.e.
detailed engineering of the Coromandel development plan. The five partners
are experts in land surveying and land use planning, structural design and
engineering, soil mechanics, hydraulics, road building and factory, commercial
and residential building design (Annex 13).
C.   Operations
6.06      As early as possible but not later than mid-1974, a Manager of
Promotion and Sales, and later in that year, when the first occupants are
expected to enter Coromandel, an Estate General Manager will be added to
the management team with the necessary staff. These arrangements, together
with the overall support of DBM, are expected to provide adequate assurances
that the project will be executed properly, and were confirmed during
negotiations. Further competence of DBM in estate management is planned
to be acquired through study trips to Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Israel,
among others. DBM's Industrial Section Head has already undertaken the
first of such trips.
6.07      Despite the encouraging demand forecast, DBM plans to start addition-
al promotional efforts to attract foreign investment and thereby help ensure
full occupancy of the estate as quickly as possible. Such efforts would
include: (i) preparation of up-to-date promotion brochures; (ii) interna-
tional and national advertising of the Coromandel estate and the investment
incentives; (iii) enlisting the cooperation of chambers of commerce, interna-
tional banks, foreign government trade promotion organizations, and interna-
tional development institutions (e.g. African Development Bank and UNIDO),
in order to maximize contact with the world business community. Attendance
at trade fairs and visits to foreign countries together with private Mauritian
buisnessmen are intended to be arranged to make contact with possible invest-
ors. Occasionally, it might also be justified to contract consultants in
certain priority target countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore,
Australia, South Africa, Germany, France, England, Japan and the U.S.A., to
conduct promotional programs.
6.08      Admittance to the estate will require DBM approval.  DBM will
appraise the viability of each applying company as it does in its other
operations, independently of whether or not it will be asked to provide



- 16 -
financing for equipment purchases. Since one of the prime objectives of
the estate is to overcome the unemployment problem in the country, preference
will be given to the establishment of labor over capital-intensive manufac-
tures. Furthermore, criteria for settlement on the estate, including the
establishment of ecologicalistandards, architectural guide-lines and building
regulations as well as standard lease contracts and general estate rules,
are being developed and will be submitted in a form satisfcory to IDA
before end-1973.
6.09      Although special assistance to occupant firms in training their
employees to higher skills is a feature of some estate projects in other
developing countries, no similar activity is planned at Coromandel. Foreign
firms have been training specialized staff as needed at company expense and
there does not seem to be any strong pressure to increase the already at-
tractive incentive package (para. 2.07) by a government supported training
program tied to either Coromandel or Plaine Lauzun. Industrial training
programs do exist under the aegis of the Ministries of Education, Labor and
Immigration with, in some cases, support from UNDP and the ILO and additional
programs are being planned.1/ These training programs have been providing a
flew o~f i^ntice skilled workers (carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers) as
welw, as more skilled personnel (technicians including draftsmen, machinists,
instrument mechanics). Training in commercial administration is available
on the university level. In view of the existing and apparently broadly
based national training effort, it was concluded that no special program
was needed as part of the project.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Income
7.01      Land and buildings will only be leased.  Currently, undeveloped
land, to the limited extent available in the Port Louis area, is being leased
at an annual rental of Rs. 6,000 to 8e,00 per arpent. By mid-1974, when
occupancy will begin, a land lease rate at Coromandel of Rs. 10,000 per
arpent cf developed land is assumed; this is considered a conservative assump-
tion and competitive with alternative sites in the Port Louis area.  Based
on past trends and projected demand, the annual lease rate can reasonably
be expected to increase by at least 8% per year for the foreseeable future.
Lease rates will be fixed for a three-year term (the customary period already
established at Plaine Lauzun) and at each three-year renewal thereafter it
Is assumed for purposes of the financial projections that the rate will be
increased by 25%. By way of comparison, at the most recently established
export processing zones in Taiwan, occupants have to pay an annual land rental
of about Rs. 35,000 per arpent.

Assessment", October 24, 1972, p. 14-25.

7.02      Building rentals are projected to start at Rs. 5.0/sq.ft/year.
Rentals at Plaine Lauzun have recently been increased to about Rs. 4.0/sq.
ft./year, and DBM plans to increase this to Rs. 4.5-5.0/sq.ft. during the
course of 1973. Starting rentals at Coromandel can therefore be reasonably
set at Rs. 5.0/sq.ft. in 1974. As with land leasing, building rental contracts
will be at fixed rates for three years, renewable thereafter every three
years with an assumed 25% increase in rent for each three-year period. This
is a conservative assumption when compared to the inflation assumed in esti-
mating project cost (Annex 14).
7.03      The starting land lease and building rental rates, being competitive
with other rates in the Port Louis area, are readily acceptable to potential
occupants. Although the assumed increases of 25% every three years are con-
sidered conservative, the actual lease terms need not necessarily contain such
a rigid formula, but rather provide for a reassessment in the light of actual
experience. The guiding criterion should be competitiveness. In addition,
to protect the financial position of the estate, agreement was reached
during negotiations that there will be consultation with IDA, whenever, for
any reason, the return on total capital employed falls below 10% per annum.
This leaves open the question of what measures should be adopted if the
project fails to yield such a return. Corrective action might involve measures
quite distinct from changes in rentals. This rate of return test, in effect,
establishes a revenue "floor" which assures coverage of debt service and
operating costs as well as the use of capital in the project in as productive
a way as elsewhere in the economy.
7.04      The total revenue build-up and flow from land leases and building
rentals is detailed in Annex 15. Although the demand forecast indicates
that 100% occupancy is a reasonable likelihood, all projections of income
have been set at 90% occupancy of developed land and buildings.
7.05      Annex 16 lists the management and general overhead breakdown under
(i) salaries and general overhead, (ii) insurance, (iii) building and ground
maintenance and (iv) international promotion. These expenses will start in
1974 and build up to Rp. 930,000 per year by 1979, the first year of "normal"
operation after completion of construction, corresponding to 15% of revenue
in that year. Thereafter, it was assumed that operating costs could be
maintained at the same rate, (i.e. 15% of revenue). A special provision of
Rs. 100,000 per year for international promotion is limited to the five-year
period 1974-1978, although this activity may have to be continued if occupancy
runs significantly lower than predicted. Additional operating costs are
(i) depreciation of 5% per year on infrastructure and buildings and (ii) 7.25%
interest on the outstanding loan. The depreciation rate of 5% per year - a
conservative building depreciation rate - has been applied to the total
project (less land, which is not depreciated) since buildings account for
over 90% of the project cost and any adjustment for differing rates applic-
able to other infrastructure items would have been insignificant.

--ations in 1974 and 1975,when revenue on leased buildings will begin to
build raising net in-ome and cash surplus to Rs. 3.2 million and Rs. 8.6
million respectively in 1979, net income and cash surplus continue to in-
crease on account of highe- rental rates reaching a hefty Rs. 13 million
and Rs. M10 million respectively in 1993, the last year of debt repayment.

7.08      Debt service coverage starts at a comfortable 2.2 in 1979, the
first year of debt amortization, and increases thereafter to 3.0 in 1983 and
6.2 in 1993, the last year of debt amortization.
C.   Balance Sheet Forecasts
7.09      Projected balance sheets of the estate operation are summarized
below from Annex 19. The starting year corresponds to the beginning of the
second and last construction contract period (para. 4.02):

7.10      Liquidity, or the current ratio, of the project is satisfactory
throughout the period of repayment of debt. The earned surplus credited to
the project will accrue in the total earnings of DBM from all its operations
and be rolled over in its normal lending program.
7.11      During negotiations assurances have been obtained that independent
audits will be conducted of the estate operations in a manner satisfactory
to IDA.
D.   Financial Return and Viability Tests
7.12      The financial rate of return of the project was calculated with
costs and revenues in constant 1973 rupees (Annex 20). Based on 90% occu-
pancy over a 20-year project life and a residual value equal to the book
value of investment, i.e. land valued at the actual price paid in 1973
(Rs. 900,000) and no residual values for the buildings and infrastructure,
the rate of return is 10.3%. Compared to the most recent estimate of op-
portunity cost of capital of 8%1/, the project is acceptable. However, land
values, which have more than doubled since DBM optioned Coromandel in early
1/   M.F.G. Scott,  "Estimates of Accounting Prices in Mauritius", April 1972
(mimeographed paper), p. 14.



- 20 -
1972, will continue to increase, and the re4z.:)-ocejl.    gs will have a
useful life far beyond 20 years especially if they are properly maintained,
as is assumed in the project operating costs. If we assume a realistic net
present value of Rs. 900,000 for the land and a residual value of half the
initial investment cost for buildings and infrastruicture, the rate of return
increases to 12.4%. In addition, if we assume that rental rates will in-
crease by 3% per year to reflect the increased scarcity of industrial land
and buildings, the internal rate of return is 1534ZO This last case is the
most realistic one, since it accounts for both residia; values in the build-
ings and the scarcity value of the land.
7.13      Actually, there are two important interdependent variables which
affect income and profitability. These are (i) rate of occupancy and (ii)
land lease and rental levels. Assuming 80% occupancy and a rental rate
of Rs. 5.0 per sq. ft. (equivalent in total revenue to '10X  occupancy and
a rental rate of Rs. 4.0 per sq. ft.), the rate of return is 13.0%.  This
is regarded as a realistic lower bound, for the fol.owving reasons: (a)
DBM has a long waiting list for buildings at Plaine Lauzun at rental rates
of Rs. 4.0/sq. ft./year and soon to rise to 3s, s   45-5.01sq, lt,year; (b) the
Coromandel estate will meet only about 13% of thie estimated demand for
standard buildings for the period 1973-1980, and no other estate projects
are currently planned.
7.14      Although considered very unlikely to occur, a further return test
was made assuming that construction ceases after the initial contract period
(1973-75) because of lagging investment and lower than expected occupancy.
Based on a reduced cost of US$2.7 million and 75% occupancy over 20 years,
the financial return is 8% indicating that even on this basis the project
is feasible.
7.15      The projections based on constant terms not only show favorable
rates of return but the projected debt service and current ratios are
also more than adequate.
DEBT SERVICE AND CURRENT RATIOS IN CONSTA.'NT TERMS PROJECTIONS
1980     1981      1982      1983     1984
Debt Service Coverage            2.4       2.4      2<4       2.4       2.4

7.16      In reality, the return of 10.3% derived from the constant rupee
projections (Annex 20) understates the financial return of the project.
On the basis of current rupee projections outlined in para. 7.01-7.10, and
again assuming only 90% occupancy over 20 years of project life and no residual
value, the return would be 15.0%.



- 21 -
7.17      In conclusion, the analytical tests of project profitability
demonstrate that the project is viable and justifiable. The sensitivity of
the project to occupancy rates lower than projected is apparent, but it is
very unlikely that occupancy would in fact drop to a point at which the
financial return would be less than 8Z (assumed opportunity cost of capital).
In any case the project yields substantial economic and social benefits as
described in the following chapter.
VIII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS
8.01      A rigorous measure of the national benefits generated by the project
would require a "with and without" ("with the project" and "without the proj-
ect") comparative analysis. This in turn would require credible estimates
of the effect of the project on the rate of factory investment from which all
costs and benefits are derived - and this cannot really be quantified with
any degree of accuracy. Undoubtedly, many industries have been and would
continue to be established in Mauritius even if no estate were ever built.
Prepared sites and services accelerate the investment decision process and
in some cases might be a plus factor inducing a company "go" decision on
investment which otherwise might have been "no go" or "wait".  In the absence
of an accepted methodology to quantify the incremental benefits of the "with"
situation, the paragraphs following will make qualitative judgements of the
hard-to-quantify benefits and numbers will be used only for reasonably
credible estimates.
A. Acceleration of Industrial Investment
8.02      The project will facilitate and accelerate factory investment,
particularly by foreign firms acting alone or in joint ventures with local
capital. Assuming (i) an average capital/output ratio of 3.5 1/ for the
type of industries foreseen and (ii) output (value added) of US$3,000 2/ per
employee at full occupancy in 1979, capital invested in the estate industries
will be US$58 million and value added per annum US$17 million. Although the
full amounts cannot be attributed wholly to the estate, it is clear that many
of the foreign firms are specifically attracted to the ready availability of
standard buildings and the infrastructure services. Since the bulk of the
investment will be foreign capital inflow, a substantial part of the total
new investment can be attributed to the estate. It is also reasonable to
assume that local capital, which otherwise might leave the country in whole
or in part, will be a significant fraction of the whole.
1/ The current ratio for existing export processing industries in Mauritius.
2/ Currently, value added per employee is under US$2,000 but this will be
increasing as efficiency improves and more sophisticated processes and
products are introduced.



- 22 -
B.   Employment
8.03      The completed project will house industries providing employment
for 5,000-6,000 by 1979, rising to a peak in 1985 and beyond of perhaps
8,000. Approximately 14% of the new factory jobs needed nationally between
1973 and 1980 (38,000) would, therefore, be created on the estate 11. The
situration level by 1985, equal to 170 jobs per arpent, is high in comparison
to usually accepted criteria and can be explained by the high allocation of
land (57%) to multi-level standard factory buildings for smaller and more
labor intensive activities. A very high percentage of workers will be trained
to higher skills and earning power than they have had in the past. Construc-
tion workers may average 1,000 to 1,200 during the construction period of
1973 to 1978. As in the case of investment, a substantial part of the new
investment is directly the result of the establishment of the estate.
C.   External and Internal Economies
8.04      The concentration of industries on the estate, as opposed to the
haphazard and dispersed pattern which would occur otherwise, greatly
facilitates rational planning and installation of external infrastructure
(power, water, sewage, roads, etc.). Costs will be lower since external
networks will be less dispersed and time schedules for planning and imple-
mentation compressed.  Within the estate, there will be internal economies
resulting from lover cap'tal investment per factory because of common
utilities and services.
D.   Social Benefits
3.05      With estate management in control of the quality, cleanliness and
appearance of factories as well as standards of employee services, the
working environment will be greatly improved. Among the common facilities
foreseen are (i) a central canteen (many small firms make no provision for
lunch facilities), (ii) an employees association and athletic field. Air
pollution control standards will be enforceable and the common sewage treat-
ment complex will eliminate liquid and solid waste problems. Town planning,
including housing and transportation, schools, hospitals, and other social
infrastructure can be developed efficiently for the concentration of workers
which might correspond by 1985 to a family population of about 35,000.
E.   Indigenous Entrepreneurship Development
,..<.6., A number of the industries already established are joint ventures
o; -mixed foreign and local capital. Future growth can be expected to show
a --7sing trend in local participation as domestic capital accumulation
and .ocal management tapabilities grow.  In the small scale industry sector,
growth will assuredly accelerate in response to the need for ancillary supply
1f!  As noted in para. 8.01, a more meaningful figure would be the job
aation i"with" the estate less the job creation "without" the estate,
the incremental jobs attributable to the estate.



- 23 -
of services, parts and components to the larger industries. DBM is already
implementing an organized program of small scale industry development by means
of a special lending program (maximum loan is Rs. 10,000 at a concessional
interest rate of 4.5% per annum and pay-back of up to 10 years) and the Coro-
mandel estate, by concentrating a large number of small enterprises at one
location, will provide a framework for more efficient transfer of technical
and financial assistance, management training and marketing guidance. With-
out the establishment of Coromandel as a focal point for these programs,
these programs would not be as successful or, at the least, would be more
expensive for an equivalent result.
F.  Fiscal Benefits
8.07      Industries will generally be certified as "development" or "export
processing" and these enjoy income tax exemptions of 5-8 years and 10 or
more years respectively. Fiscal income in the form of taxes on profits,
therefore, will not be realized until the 1980's. Assuming a 4/1 ratio of
gross product value (GPV) to added value or GPV of approximately US$100 million
in the mid-1980's 1/ and taxable profits of 10% on sales of US$10 million,
corporate income taxes at 45% would equal US$4.5 million per year. Of
course, without the expense of the estate some increase in tax revenues would
occur from those enterprises that would be established anyway. The question
is whether the net benefits (i.e. tax revenues minus estate expenses, capital
and operating) are greater with the estate or without it. Since it has
earlier been indicated that the bulk of new investment will be in the form of
foreign capital inflow and that many enterprises are specifically attracted
by the advantages of the estate, it is probable that the net benefits with
the estate are greater; notional estimates under several assumptions tend
to confirm that conclusion. Personal income taxes will add to the fiscal
income but no effort has been made to estimate this amount. Finally, the
estate is projected to yield an operating profit and this will accrue to the
Government as the owner of DBM.
G.   Foreign Exchange Earnings
8.08      Net foreign exchange (FE) inflow attributable to the estate based
industries can only be roughly estimated. The basic assumptions are (i)
that profits after taxes will be entirely repatriated and (ii) capital
investment will be repatriated over time as permitted by the incentives
granted. The estimate implies that all investment is foreign capital. If,
in reality, some portion of the investment were to be indigenous, profit
repatriation and capital repatriation would be reduced and the net foreign
exchange inflow would be increased. Value added approximately represents
the foreign exchange earned over the above the cost of imported materials.
The inflow and outflow estimates for the post construction operating period
is tabulated below;
1/   GPV in 1980 would be an *stimated US$68 million; allowing for dollar
escalation and increasing productivity, GPV rises to US$100 million
(estimated) in the mid-1980's.

IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, the Government of Mauritius agreed to:
(a) Consult with the Association prior to taking a decision to expand
the Coromandel estate at La Tour (para. 3.02);
(b) Onlend the proceeds of the IDA credit of US$4.0 million to DBM
on terms satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.06);
(c)  Provide local currency finance of US$4.0 million equivalent to
DBM as equity and in a timelv manner as required by the progress of
the project (para. 4.05);
(d) Finance any cost overrun of the project, both local and foreign
currency expenditures, on terms satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.03);
(e) Arrange to finance and cause to be implemented in a timely manner
the necessary external and internal infrastructure installations
specified as public utility responsibilities (para. 3.07);
(f) Cause DBM to establish a management unit with the necessary outside
assistance for execution and operation of the estate and support
it with additional DBM staff as required (paras. 6.04-6.06);
(g) Arrange for DBM to set up separate project accounts (para. 6.04)
and have them audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Associatior (para. 7.11);



- 25 -
th) Set initial land lease and building rentals acceptable to IDA,
maintain these rentals at competitive levels and consult with
IDA whenever the rate of return on total capital. employed in
the project falls below 10% per annum (para. 7.03);
(i)  Reimbure DBI in any fiscal year for losses in excess of the
cumulative earned surplus from estate operations (para. 4.06);
and
(j) Prepare, prior to December 31, 1973, tormal criteria governing
acceptability of industries as estate occupants and estate building
standards satisfactory to TDB (para. 3.07 and 6.06).
9.02       In view of the foregoing agreements, the project provides a suit-
able basis for an IDA credit of US$4.0 million equivalent to the Gover,amelnt
of M'auritius on normal IDA terms.

ANNEX 7
MAURITIUS
COROMANDEL INDUSTRIAL ESTATE
NOTES ON DEELOPMENT PLAN
1.   Plot Plan and Buildings
The original SCET plan of constructing 740,000 square feet of
standard buildings on 22 arpents means, using the 2-floor basic block
building design already developed in Mauritius, that about 37% of land
assigned to this purpose will be covered.   This is somewhat lower than
necessary, especially in a country where the general land constraint is so
critical.   A building/land ratio of 40-45% with variable design buildings
would be more economic and still not create an overcrowded effect.   To
avoid monotony, building designs should be varied to include single level
saw-tooth roof construction (preferred for certain industries) as well as
2 and 3 level flat roof construction for a total floor space of at least
800,000 square feet in standard buildings.
SCET also assumed that 100,000 of the 400,000 square feet of
individually occupied factory buildings would be built by DBM and rented
to manufacturers.    This is risky for a facility which should be generally
suitable to a series of different occupants.   A building designed for a
specific company is usually not an optimum design for a second company lessee
and is often rejected by the latter or accepted only after costly modifi-
cations.   DBM's resources should, therefore, be channelled either into
standard buildings or as loans to firms wishing to construct their own
buildings.   Designs of individual company owned or leased buildings would
be approved in advance by the estate management to ensure preservation of
estate standards of appearance and quality.   Total floor space in this
category of 400,000 square feet on 25 arpents, or a building/land ratio of
36% also appears somewhat lower than necessary and could be increased to
at least 40% without compromising good industrial design standards signi-
ficantly.
The final land use plan envisaged covers the construction of
900,000 square feet of standard building space on 27 arpents, (800,000
square feet specified in first paragraph above plus 100,000 square feet
shifted from individual factory category to standard building category),
300,000 (or perhaps up to 400,000 depending on designs) square feet of
individual factories on 20 arpents, 60,000 square feet for the Management/
Commercial Center on 4 arpents and 9 arpents allocated to roads and utilities.
2.   Terracing
The physical land survey produced a contour map of the topography
showing all elevations and slopes.   Land development costs include the
estimated cutting, fill and terracing as part of the estate investment,
relieving occupants of this responsibility (and cost) and permitting imme-
diate construction after lease signing.

3. Roads
The network (attached map) consists of a ring road serving
the widest part of the estate with two extensions for access from the
Mahebourg Highway and the Richelieu Approach Secondary Road and a third to
the south west extremity.   This plan appears to be an optimum solution to
the need for internal and external movement of -oods and -personnel.
Roads will be 23 ft. wide, sufficient for 2 l.anes of truck (or bus) move-
ment, flanked on both sides by 6.5 foot wide sidewalks and rainwater
drainage culverts.   Internal road construction will be chargeable to the
project.   Electrical, water, waste disposal and telephone/telex lines are
planned to run under the sidewalks and installation will be phased with
road construction.   A high order of planning will be needed to ensure
coordinated inputs from several public utilities and this responsibility
rests with the supervising engineers.
4t. Water
Water consumption estimated by SC'ET was a maximum of 150,000
gallons per day with a peak flow of 4 gallonls per second. This is low
by usual standards. With a peak work force of 8,000, an average of
4O gallons per worker per day would indicate a need for 320,000 gallons
total per day. It is recommended that both the external piping to the
estate boundary and the internal service network be sized for double
the SCET figures, that is, 300,000 gallons/day total and a peak flow
of 8 gallons/second. The external and internal network would be the
responsibility of the public water authority', and occupants would be
billed on individual meters. Several water zources are available and
the detailed external design will be fixed after the completion of a
national water survey by an English consul-ing team in September, 1973.
No provision has been made for an elevated water storage tank to assure
positive pressure at all times, to take care of peak surges in demand
and to provide a permanent reserve for fire fighting. This feature will
be studied further before making a decision but its estimated cost has
nevertheless been included in this appraisal.

The collection network and treating plant have been designed
for 100% effluent of water entering the estate, disregarding recycling
and losses, assuming 80% industrial and 20% sanitary waste.   Aggressive
waste treatment (acid, alkali, cyanides, etc.) will be the responsibility
of the originating firm which will be required to install proper treatment
in each plant before discharging to a common sand filter for ultimate
disposal into the nearby Grand River North-West.  All sanitary waste will
be biologically degraded and chlorine treated in the common sewage treatment
plant at the northwest corner (lowest point) of the estate before discharge
to the river.



7-3
6.   Drainage
Rain water will be collected in the culverts along the roads,
boundaries and low points of the estate and run by gravity to the lowest
point (northwest corner) to join the industrial and sanitary waste for
discharge to the river.   Design capacity of the system is equal to the
heaviest flow anticipated during the cyclone season to avoid flooding.
7.   Power
The Central Electricity Board (CEB) has estimated the maximum
power demand at 4,000 Kw.  Using accepted average ratios of power consump-
tion per 1,000 square feet for light/medium industry, checked against the
experience at Plaine Lauzun, the study confirmed the CEB estimate.   There
does not seem to be any problem anticipated in supplying this demand. The
existing high tension (HT) lines (22,000 v.) will be relocated to go around
the estate rather than through it (in the latter case, easements reduce the
usable land significantly).   A HT line will be run underground from the
transformer station across Mahebourg lighway to a control station at the
northeast corner of the estate.   From the control station an underground
HT ring will be laid with a series of transformers (22,000 v. dropped to
400/230 v.) located above ground so that each transformer serves 2 or 3
plots. Low tension (LT) cables will run from each transformer to individual
users.   Parallel with the underground HT ring will be an LT ring for
public lighting.   Installation costs of both the external and internal
facilities will be borne by the public utility and users charged for connec-
tion and consumption according to existing rates.
8.   Telecommunications
Demand for telephone lines has been estimated at 200 lines
assuming 100-150 small and 40-50 medium/large industries.   As with the
other utilities, the internal network will be underground with junction
boxes spaced for each 2 to 3 plots.   The system will be installed by the
telephone company at its own cost and companies will be billed directly
for connections and service.

Buildings
1.        The DBM architect originally estimated (in 1972) that factory
buildings had a foreign exchange content of 45%. Subsequently, in January
1973, a contractor provided a detailed breakdown for a typical factory
building at Plaine Lauzan as follows:
Percentage of                  FE Content
Item               Total Building Cost       (% of item)  (% 0o  Totrl)

38% represents direct FE expenditures and was raiaed to 40% to allow for
an estimated 2% import content on locally purchased content. This, however,
appears too low. The major local items - sand, aggregate, lime and gypsum -
would have a very high imported equipment and transport depreciation component
plus high imported fuel coats on lime and gypsum and it is likily that 41 or
42% would be more accurate.
2.        Estimates applicable to hotel construction provided by the save
contractor showed that a better quality building has an FE content of 5C%.
3.        Future factory buildings at Coromandel are likely tq have features,
not included in the contractor's estimate with-a trend to hicn ontet.
Some buildings will be three levels, requiring at least one freight elevator,
or perhaps two. Air conditioning, more adequate sanitary plumbing and improved
serviceo generally - all with high import content - can be anticipated in
response to occupants' needs. Taking theme factors into account, the FE
component could rise to about 50%.
4.        SCET, presumably working with the ame data as enumerated above,
estimated that buildings at Coromandel would be 60% FE expenditures, but
this appears to be unrealistically high, even assuming improved building
quality compared to Plaine Lauzun.



10-2
5. -It was the conclusion of the Association that FE expenditures at
Coromandel for buildings could safely be estimated at about 50% or perhaps
slightly higher.
Other Infrastructure
6.         SCET estimated a FE component of 40% for infrastructure but this
Ancluded power and other items with high FE content which have since been
allocated as public utility expenditures. Even if the true FE content were
to drop to 35%, however, the 50% figure for buildings cannot shift significantly
since infrastructure represents less than 10% of project cost.
7.         An overall FE:LC distribution of somewhere between 45:55 and
50:50 is a reasonable estimate for the project as a whole. As a conservative
assumption a ratio of 50:50 was adopted for this appraisal.

ANNEX 12
MAIURITIUS
COROMANDEL INDUSTRIAL ESTATE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS - STATUS
Origin and Purpose
1.        The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM), a government-owned
institution, was established in 1964 as the successor to the Mauritius
Agricultural Bank (MAB). Its objective is to promote industrial develop-
ment and agricultural diversification, and to encourage the participation
of private capital, both local and foreign, in the island's development.
Organization
2.        DBM's Board, as establiEhed in an amendment to the Ordinance
which created DBM, includes representatives of the Ministries of Finance,
Commerce and Industry, plus five to seven members from the private sector
chosen by the Government. The composition of the Board is given in Table 1.
W*hile the Ordinance which created DBM empowers the Minister of Finance to
define DBM's general policy directives, the Board of Directors may, however,
if it considers that such directives might prejudice DBM's financial position
require that the Government guarantee DBM against any loases it might incur
in following such directives. This guarantee has already been provided in
the case of a loan program to small scale industries. Despite this strong
link with the Government, DBM has been given sufficient autonomy to make
individual investment decisions based on the merits of each proposal.
Staff
3.        DBM's organization chart is shown in Table 2. There are two operations
departments, one each for industry and agriculture, which report directly to
the Managing Director. Between them they have twelve permanent professionals;
staff members in the Industrial Department received their training abroad
while those in the Agricultural Department received training at the Mauritius
College of Agriculture.
Procedures
4.        DBM's project appraisals are satisfactory, though improvements could
be made in its economic assessment of projects and, in some cases, market
evaluations.
Operations
5.        A breakdown of DBM's total approvals, commitments and disbursevents
from July 1, 1966 to June 30, 1971 may be found in Table 3. Eighty-eight
percent of total loan and equity commitments over the last five years were
to the industrial sector, and 12% to the agricultural sector. This distribution
is in accord with the guidelines given to DBM when it was created, i.e., that
it should de-emphasize investments in the agricultural sector - except
insofar as it might help to diversify production - and concentrate on employment-
creating industrial projects.



12-2
Industry
6.        DBM's assistance to the industrial sector includes:  (a) term
loans to medium and large scale industrial enterprises primarily to finance
the acquisition of fixed assets;  (b) equity investments in the same type
of enterprise;  (c) loans to small scale enterprises and (d) construction
and rental of factory buildings.
7.        Two-thirds of industrial commitments were term loans and one-third
equity investments. DBM's average annual commitments (excluding the 25%
of its commitments to tourism, shipping and fishing) have amounted to about
a qaarter of manufacturing investment. About two-thirds of DBM's loan
commitments to industry since it started operations went to manufacturing
enterprises, one-fifth to service companies - of which hotels were the most
important - and one-eighth to companies engaged in fishing and agricultural
processing. A breakdown showing the distribution, by industrial activity,
of DBM's approvals to date may be found in Table 4.
8.        DBM's average size commitment to industrial customers is about
Rs. 200,000 ($39,OD0). lbpayment terms are normally 10 years without grace
period, though terms of up to 15 years and grace periods of up to 4 years
have been extended when required.
9.        DBM's interest rates to industrial customers were, as a matter of
policy, lower than those charged by commercial banks up to November 1971,
when DBM rates were increased from 6.5% p.a. to 8.5% p.a. DBM's present
lending rate to industrial enterprises is, therefore, now in line with market
interest rates.
Small-Scale Industries
10.       DBM's small-scale industrial lending program was initially started
by the Ministry of Education as part of its training program for small scale
businessmen. Up to the third quarter of 1971, DBM acted only as an agent
for the Ministry of Education, which appraised all loans. Since then, DBM
is entirely responsible for the program from appraisal to loan recovery.
DBM's commitments under this program during the past five years only amounted
to an average of Rs. 20,000 annually, or less than 1$ of total commitments.
All loans to individual businessmen of under Rs. 10,000 (or under Rs. 50,000
in the case of cooperatives) are guaranteed by the Government, which, in return,
has asked DBM to grant customers a concessional interest rate of 4.5% per annum.
Industrial Estates
11.       The Government has asked DBM to undertake a program of constructing
and leasing buildings suitable for industrial enterprises. DBM has so far
built over 200,000 sq. ft. of factory space in four buildings at Plaine Lauzun,
and has another 48,ooo sq. ft. under construction. Factory space is leased
in units of 2,000 sq. ft. or multiples thereof.



12-3
Financial Position
12.       Summarized Balance Sheets may be found in Table 5. DBM's
financial structure is sound and improving. During FYl972-,DBM's equity
increased from Re. 19.1 million to Rs. 20.3 million. Long-term debt, net
of sinking fund, increased from Rs. 27.0 million to Rs. 33.8 mlllion and
the net long-term debt/equity ratio increased from 1.8:1 to a still moderate
2.0:1. If government subordinated loans are counted with equity, the net
long-term debt/equity ratio is about 1:4. Liquidity has improved: the
current ratio increased during FY1972 from 0.9:1 to 1.1:1. Reserves
(Rs. 10.3 million) and provisicns (Rs. 1.8 million) amount to almost 30%
of the loan and equity portfolio outstanding.
Profitability
13.       Sumnarized Profit and Loss Accounts are given in Table 6.
Administrative expenses increased by one-third in FY1972 reflecting an
increase in staff to handle increasing volume. As a percentage of average
assets, administrative expenses increased from 1.24% in FY1971 to 1.40%
in FY1972, which is still reasonable. In spite of this increase, profits
before provisions increased slightly from Rs. 1.26 million in FYl971 to
Rs. 1.28 in FY1972, equivalent to 6.7% of equity. No dividends have been
paid.

NOTE ON CAPABILITY OF S.I.G.M.A.
1. Introduction
S.I.G.M.A. is an engineering practice whose services include
the study and early planning of preliminary projects and the execution
of civil engineering works; they also include computational engineering
and applied mathematics.   S.I.G.M.A. stands for "Structures, Informatique,
Genie civil & Mathematiques Appliqu4es".  Their services offer studies in
surveying, hydrology, hydrogeology, soil mechanics and, more generally,
all studies necessary for the establishment of civil engineering and
building projects.
S.I.G.M.A. endeavours to keep up with the latest technical
progress by making use of all modern methods available to consulting
engineers.   Automatic calculation on computer is, in particular,
employed to a maximum.  Arrangements have been made for setting up in
the near future their own soil mechanics laboratory.

S.I.G.M.A. also undertakes research and design works of
ground water and surface water rights.   The design of
hydraulic networks is done by computer, thus enabling their
optimization.
(iv)   Surveying
S.I.G.M.A. employs two sworn land surveyors, four assistant
land surveyors and is, therefore, in a position to undertake
all land and engineering surveys and contour mapping.
S.I.G.M.A. will recommend to prospective investors, sites
for new industries.   Survey plans are plotted from computer
records.
(v)   Affiliations
S.I.G.M.A. is affiliated to several highly specialized
foreign organizations, with which it cooperates in large
scale as well as in very specialized schemes.
4i. computational Engineering and Applied Mathematics
S.I.G.M.A. has developed a number of programs for calculations
on computer, which have been written from mathematical models of its own
design.  S.I.G.M.A. possesses general and special programs.
Amongst programs of general interest they offer matrix inversion
programs from four different methods (Direct Method, Guass-Seidel Method,
Conjugate Gradient Method and Monte Carlo Method), programs for the inte-
gration of differential equations (RUNGE-KUTTA Method) and programs for the
generation of particular transcendental functions such as JACOBI's elliptic



13-3
integrals of first, second and third kind, which are used in studies
of soil mechanics.   Programs for the determination of Eigen values
of matrices.
The special prograus include those for statistical tests, of
multiple regression of spectral and factorial analyses, optimization
of closed network design in waterworkq, programs for surveys, for the
design of waterworks, programs for the design of beams and girders and
programs for hydrological and climatological surveys.
These calculations are performed on an ICL 1901A computer
with a memory of 8K words and employing 4 tape readers, a card reader
of 500 cards/minute and a printer of 600 lines/minute.

be in addition to other government programs aimed at the same general
objective.

the first year of "normal'! operation after the construction period
(1973-1978).
