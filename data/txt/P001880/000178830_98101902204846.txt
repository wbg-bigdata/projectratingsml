INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMEN ASSOCIATION
REPORT AI1D RBJOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO MAURITIUS FOR AN
INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
14         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Mauritius for the equivalent of US$4.o million on standard
IDA temas to help finance an industrial estate project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         A report, "Wauritius - h-Year Development Plan - an Assessment"
(NE-30a) in three vcilumes, was circulated on November 2, 1972 (R72-240). Country
data are provided in Annex I.
3.         Yauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily dependent
on one crop: sugar. For decades it was considered a typical case of the vicious
circle of underdevelopment:  the population pressure on land was associated aith a
stagnation of investment and output;  the very limited size of the national market
seemed to prevent the establishment of domestic industries; the vagaries of
weather, and the generally unfavorable outlook for sugar demand at thattime,
inhibited attempts at increasing production and reducing unemployment.
4.         The present outlook is more encouraging and Yauritius may soon be
'viewed as a typical case of a rapidly developing nation ihich capitalizes on the
availability of cheap labor.  In recent years, the Government has taken advantage
of favorable export sales of sugar over a few years to devise a development
strategy which builds upon this asset. Recent economic and social performance
indicate that the Governient's efforts and policies have been successful in
initiating promising changes in development prospects.
S.         In view of the land shortage and the limitations of the domestic market,
the 1971-1975 Development Plan aims at diversifying production towards manufacturing
for export and tourism, and at influencing the choice of production techniques
to utilize available labor more fully. The Plan provides for a substantial step-
up in the investment program, an increase in GDP growth rate to 7 percent annualy,
as caopared to an avei-age of 2 percent in the previous three years, and aims at
the elimination of unemployment in the late 197Cs.   GDP has groin in excess of
the target rate in 1971 and 1972.
6.         Value added in manufacturing is expected to increase at an average
annual rate of about 11 percent by attracting foreign capital and managerial talents
along the pattern set by Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan.   Developments during the
last few years have show~n that lthuritius' labor force can be trained to carr out
precision work; wages are below those of Hong Kong or Singapore. A number of tax
incentives and cQ-cessions are provided to export-oriented industr,y, including an
Ebcport Processing Zone where imports of raw materials and seti-finished goods cani
be processed. These measures have provred successful and the pace at which industries
have been maving to Mlturitius in the last two years is promising. Given types of
manufacturing which lend themselves to labor-intensive technology and the use of



- 2 -
such technology, job creation in manufacturing, together writh its secondary
ermployment effects can, it is believed, produce an increase in employment more
rapid than the growth of the labor force.
7.          Sugar production dominates the whole economy; it occupies more than
90 percent of cultivated land and contributes about 90 percent to rerchandise
exports. Mauritius' 1971-1975 Development Plan also aims at greater
diversification in agriculture.   However, about 85 percent of potentially arable
land is occupied.  Possible increases in the production of food crops and
livestock will thus have to be obtained on marginal sugar land. as well as on new
land that may be developed under projects such as the proposed rural developmnent
project referred to in paragraph 16 below.   A new high-hield variety of sugar is
to be introduced at the time of replanting; it should allow, in -the long run,
tc reduce land under sugar -while providing for the 2 percent annual increase in
sugarcane production projected in the Plan. As world consumption of sugar is
currently expected to rise faster than production, Yauiritius' export prospects
for sugar continue to be favorable.
8.          Owing to the eradication of malaria and a sharp decline in the death
rates after the Second World War, population grew at about 3 percent annually
until the mid-1960s. The crude birth rate reportedly fell from about 40 per
thousand in the early sixties to around 25 in the seventies., partly owing to a
successful birth control program, but the previous high rate of growth will lead
to a large and increasing number of people entering the labor force for nany years
to come. The labor force is expected to grow during the seventies at a rate of
9,000 per annum compared with about 7,000 annually at the end. of the sixties.
Niet emigration of workers is currently about 900 annually and the lack of employ-
ment opportunities has resulted in an increase in unerployment. It is estimated.
that about 16 percent of the total labor force is currentty unemployed and under-
erployment is considerable in agriculture.
9.          A major determinant in increasing jlob opoortunitties and sustain;ing
econlomdc grov-th will be Mauritius' ability to carry out higher volumes of
investment successfully.   During the sixties,total investment stagnated and actual
capital expenditure in the public sector averaged about 70 percent of budget
estimates.  Shortages of design and engineering capacities in a number of
Miristries have slowed do-gn project preparation and implementation.  The current
Plan aims at a major departure from thijs situation.  Gross investment is to be
more than doubled and public capital expenditure -treb-Led in 1974 the amount spent
annually in the late 1960s.   The Government acknowrledges that these targets are
ambitious; a number of measures to improve the efficiency of the administration
and a substantial increase in external technical assistance are underway.
Future levels of investment will depend to a great extent upon the ability of
t'he Government to devise and implement policies conducive to an improvement in
i*ts absorptive capacity.
A further determinant in increas-ng Job cppcrtun,t4es vJl1 be the
cvnc.rnment s swage policy.  Mauritius; competitive position as a center for
processing raw m-aterials and semi-finished goods rests on its low wages and good
orcductivit-. iAaintenance of the island's present advantage must be a major
element in the GovernmentIs incomes policy.   The rece:nt proposal by the
Government to increase cianl service salaries by an average of 30 percent, foll ow-
ing a 12 percent increase in 1971, is exqpected to lead to increases in the private



-3-
sector.  These increases, however, have to be seen against the background of
stable salaries through the sixties, during which the general price level
increased by about 25 percent and as a measure for a more equitable sharing of
recent increases in profits in the sugar industry. To ensure that the wage
increase results in improved income distribution without leading to inflationary
pressures and other adverse effects on savings and investment, Government is
expected to accompany this salary increase with various institutional and fiscal
measures. The magnitude of the salary rises should reduce profits and may increase
the export prices of manufactured goods. The Government is conscious that
wage increases must be reconciled with the objective of increasing employment by
attracting new industries, but the proposed increase is not expected to reduce
substantially Miauritius' competitive advantage.
11.         Recent trends in national savings have been favorable.   This resulted
in part from the 13 percent annual increase in export earnings from sugar between
1967 and 1972. In the same period, the savings rate increased from 14 percent
to about an estimated 17 percent. Although most of the savings wsere provided by
the private sector, public savings played an increasing role, particularly due
to Government efforts to reduce recurrent expenditures, Whereas national
savings were more than sufficient to finance the low level of investments in the
1960s, they are not expected to finance more than 80 percent of the investment
program of the current Plan. Even if particular efforts are made to mobilize
national resources, it is unlikely that the Government would be able to finance
more than half of the expected public investment program. Foreign assistance
should therefore continue to finance a substantial portion of total project costs
inrluding some local expenditures in appropriate cases where the foreign
component is low.
12.         Public capital inflowfs are expected to provide about US$70 million
to the public sector over the 1971-1975 period, as compared to US$17 million
over a similar pre-Plan period.  This anticipated increase in foreign aid
disbursements would be accompanied by greater diversification of the sources of
aid. The United Kingdom, which used to provide about 90 percent of total
foreign assistance, is expected to remain the principal contributor, though its
share is ornly expected to be around 40 percent in the current Plan period. IDA
will provide a further 15 percent.   The association of Mhuritius with the EEC,
which became effective on June 1 of this year, may also involve some additional
aid from the European Development Fund. The balance of aid is likely to be shared
among a variety of donors such as France, India, the Peoples Republic of China
and the United States.
13.         Official foreign reserves went up from US$13 million to US$70
million between end of 1967 and end of 1972. They currently are equivalent to
more than seven months of merchandise imports. While they are likely to decline
if the investment program is carried out as expected, they should remain at a
rather high level.  Eport prospects are currently favorable.    Foreign exchange
earnings from tourism are expected to rise from about US$7 million in 1972 to
US$9 million in 1975.  If the increase in the price of sugar occurs as expected
and weather conditions remain favorable, and if industry continues to expand,
Mauritius' future export earnings should be able to make a major contribution
to the achievement of the country's new development strategy.
14.         Service payments on external public debt were about 4 percent of
foreign exchange earnings in 1972. Assuming that most of the external borrowing



- 4 -
during the next few years is on concessionary terms, the debt service ratio
should rise only modestly. W-hile Phuritius' debt service burden is not high,
poverty and the uncertainties about future export earnings, which depend on
sugar prices and the development of new industries, combine to justify continued
sUpport on TDiT terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.          Lhe Bank made a loan of US$7 rriLllion to MNauritius in 1963 for a
po-wer project, before the island gained independence in 1968. This loan,
guaranteed by the United Kingdom, has been fully disbursed. Since independence,
two IDA credits totalling US$8.7 million have been made, one in April 1971 for
agriculture (US$5.2 million - Tea Development Authority), and the other in June
1972 for industrial development (US$3.5 million - Development Bank of Mauritius).
The IFC made a loan of US$600,000 in June 1971 for the construction of two
beach hotels. Annex II contains a summary statement of the Bank loan, IDA
credits and IFC investment, as of April 30, 1973, as well as notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
1l.         Future lending by the Bank Group is designed to support the strategy
embodied in the Development Plan.   The proposed project specifically aims at
nelping Mauritius promote the growth of export-oriented industries.   At the same
time, a rural development project has beer negotiated which would assist the
island in achieving the mnajor employmnt objectives of the Plan while also promoting
develcpment in rural areas. In addition, a recent forecast of the industrial
lending and investment operations of the Development 3ank of Mauritius (DBM) shows
tnat a second IDA credit to DBM is likely to be required by December 1973.
Further projects currently under preparation would be designed to expand infra-
structure facilities such as Port Louis harbor, w.ater supply and sewerage, and
pcssibly poiwer, in order to alleviate what would otherwrise soon become serious
constraints to further industrial growth.
PART III - THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
17.         In 1969, namnmfacturing contributed about 15 percent to GDP and 13
percent to total employment. The sector was dominated by sugar milling and
related industries, which employed about half the workers in the manufacturing
sector and generated about 60 percent of the manufactuiring value added.  Smiall
firms employing 10 persons or less comprised 95 percent of total enterprises,
but contributed only 15 percent of manufacturing autpuit. Eccept for a
Government-owned sack factory and a livestock feed mi:Ll, the sector is entirely
privately ouned.  Domestic resources financed most of the capital requirements
and direct investment from abroad iwras very small unti:L 1970 when export
processing industries began to settle in Ihuritius fodLlowing the enactment of
the Export Processing Zone Act.
18.         During the 1960s, growth in manufacturing was almost entirely in
impDort substitution, with the exception of the major agriculturally based
sugar and tea industries. Up to 1970, the Government! s main means of stimulating
industrial development consisted in the granting of Development Certificates to
entrepreneurs, which entitled the recipient to a five to eight year tax holiday,
import duty exemption on capital goods, and protection against competing imports



through customs duties or quantitative restrictions.
19.         Pecause of the small size of the domestic market, i=rort substitution
has lirdted notential and such possibilities have been substantially exhausted.
The major scope for industrialization ncw lies in the transformation of imnorte6
raw materials and intermediate products for export markets.   The dextenit y and
high ouality of the Mauritian labor force and its low cost compared with connetinn
ount,ries is a considerable asset, particularlY for industries where labor cost
corstitutes a large percentage of value added, such as manufacture of office
rmachijnerv, transistors, textiles, clothing, footw+ear and 'toys, and manufacture
or assembly of components under sub-contracts.   Such goods shoald preferably have
a high value in relation to volumr since transport costs will be significant.
The authorities are encouraging cooperation between established manufacturers
abroad and loccl bus_inesosmen  to have some entrepreneurinal skill. but 1aA
tecLnical knc :-how and expcrt marketing orgranization.
26'.        T'Te nwir euinhasis of the current Bevelopmenvnt Ran (1971-1975),
eartizularl., in its strategy of emlo>rent creation, is to encourage export
rocesszng indu.stries,  In Novenmber 197), the Ec=ort Processinrg- Z'one Act wmas
intbroduced offering generous incentives including subsidized power and wsater ra',es,
a five-y,ear ta.c holiday on dividen6ds, emerption from inrort duties on raw-
rnateral ^s atnd canital goods, and guaranteed foreign exchange for raw mater.al
incorts and for repatria-ting profits and capital.  These incentives nave been
successful in attracting industries to Nauritius, but ma- perhars be mcre
concessionary than wouLd be necessary to achieve the desired stinmlation of
investment.  For tne next few years, however, at least until lhurltius becomes
better knom  to the world business comrunity, it would be prudent not to alter
significantly the present incentive 'pacl=age .
,o far, tLiS poDclicy has troven very- successful in 'erms Of tlc

'nheas coeraYans duriar 1073 anid 1974,
022        'NeTw industries are, however, havinrg- difficulty in finding suitable
space.  Rat-ional land use planning is of extreme importance in M'auritius i.here
the land ccnstraint is so critical.   Assurinrg generally accepted average
ratios of job creation per urnit of land for the types of enterpi ses likely to
be established in Nauritius, it is forecast that about 4L46 arpents L/of
additional factory land will be required between 1973 and 1980. IUder the
1971-75 Development Plan, a total of 660 arpents has been reserved for industry.
Some industries, particularly larger enterprises, can be expected to purchase
land and develop factory sites independently but, given the overall land
limitations and the advantages cf prepared site and services, the bulk of new
industry is likely to concentrate on estate complexes, where land or buildings
are ready for occupancy and common services are provided.   The first industrial
zore at Flamne Lauzun in Port -Luis, inaugurated in Deceniber 1970, will be fully
1/  One arpent - 1.043 acres



- 6 -
developed and occupied by early 1974.
?3.          Between 1967 and 1970, the total nuLmber of' manufacturin- jobs
;ncreased at a rate of about 3 percent per. year and it aias only from 1970 onwards
that - prinarily due to the inmflux of export processincg com.anies - the rate
tripled to 9 percent per year. Total ran>rfacturing eq lomitent is esticxted tc
hav:e reached about 2_,500 at the end of 19?2, of .irch 11,700 i-Tere eaploZyed in
medium/large-Scale industry and 10,800 in small establishments and artisan
shops.  On the basis of a detailed stud> prepared by- the consulting firm SC=2-
International of France, it is f\urther estirmated that 'between 1973 and 1980,
some 27,500 new ,obs ii1l be created, representing about )OC) percent of the
expected increase iJn the labor force.  By 1980, the mnxlufacturhng labor force Will
have reached some 50,000 or about 83 percent of the Plan's manufacturing
_prloyinent target.
2h.         Associate membership in the 3uropean Economdic Comrmunity became
effective on June 1 and IMuritius based industry is looking forward to easier
access to that major market area.  Australia has conceded preferential tariff rates
on certain Mauritian products and exports to that country, as well as to South
Africa, are growing.  Long-range prospects for export growth are good.
PART IV - T-E PROJECT
25.         A report entitled "Ihuritius - Appraisal of Coromandel Industrial
Bstate" (No. 178-YAS), dated June 8, 1973, is being circulated separately to the
D-cecutive Directors. A credit and. project summary is provided in Annex III and
the location of the Project area is shoYTn on the attached map (No. IBRD ]la535).
26.         Based on a feasibility study prepared by the French consulting firm
SCET-Tnternational and financed under IDA Credit No. 313-KAS (Development Bank of
ivhuritius), the Project was appraised by an IDA mission wi-ch visited Mauritius
from January 31 to February 10, 1973. Negotiations twere held in Washington at
the end of ISy 1973. The Mauritian delegation consistted of Mr. R. Pyndiah,
F'inancial Secretary and Chairmann of the Poard of the D-evelopment Bank of
Mauitius and Mr. L. E. Venchard, Solicitor General.
27.         The Project would establish an industrial estate at Coromandel, four
miles southwest of Port Louis, the capital and major city of Mauritius.   It Tould
aim at meeting demand for industrial space, w*hich is projected to grow further
through the decade, and at promoting the growth of export-oriented industries and
creating productive employment opportunities.
28.         The proposed Project consists of the following major elements:
(a) Land
The development of 60 arpents of land to be sub-
divided into 25 plots for industry and one plot for a
management and commercial cente.r.  Average plot size is



- 7 -
1.9 arpents. The layout provides optimnm flexibility for
allocating from 0.5 to 4 arpents per enterprise, with all
subdivisions having access to the internal road net;wmork.
(b) Buildings
The construction of:
- ±2 to 15 standard buildings, writh an estitated floor
space of 900,C00 sq.ft., on 27 arpents of land, designed
for easy subdivision and rental to small/medium factories;
- a managenrnt and commercial center, with an estimated
floor space of 60,0cc sq. ft. on 4 arpents of land:
- In addition, 20 arpents of leased land w-ould be available
for construction of company-oimed factories with an
estimated floor space of 300,000 sq. ft.
(c) In-frastructure
The construction of a ring road around the estate -tcith
extensions for access to the existing highway and secondary
roads; the installation of a sewage collection network arid a
sewage treatment plant; the installation by the public water
authority of internal and connecting water pipes for an
estimated naxirmrn denand of 300,000 gallons per day with a
peak flow of 8 gallons per second; the installation 4y the
Central Electricity Board of external and internal power
facilities to meet an estimated maximun demand of 4,000 kw,
and the installation, at the telephone companyts own cost, of
about 200 telephone lines.
29.         The Coromandel Industrial Estate will be owned and managed by the
Development Bank cf IAuritius (DEM), a Gavernment-cwned institution established
in 1964 to foster industrial and tourism development and agricultural diversif-
ication.  DPIPs share capital of Rs 10 mnfllion(US$1.85 million) is owned 80
percent by the Eauritius Goverrment and 20 percent by the Bank of Yauritius
(Central 3ank). As of June 30, 1972, total resources of DEM were Rs 71 million
(US$1L.2 million), consisting of Rs 22 million capital and reserves, Rs 18
million debentures and bonds outstanding, Rs 29 million Government loans and
As 2 nillion deposits.   Early in 1972, DPM received a US$3.5 million credit from
the Association, of which US$400,000 was allocated to the construction of
standard buildings at the Plaine Lauzun industrial zone, and US3100,000 to
finance the Coromandel industriel estate feasibility study.   The development of
the Elaine Lauzun industrial zone, for vtich DBM had been made resporsible by the
lovernrmnt, has been underway for same years and DPM has gained considerable
experience in planning, execution and managenent of works of this lind.
30.         Because of the magnitude of the proposed Project, a separate urit will
be established vithin DBM with responsibility for implementation.   DBE plans to
recruit a civil engineer as a fulltime Project Manager and a project accountant
to set up separate project accounts. Both w-7ill wTork under the overall supervision
of the Head of DBYP s Industrial Section and will be supported by other DEM staff



- 8 -
as may be required from time to time.  As in the case of Flaine Lauzun, further
teclnical exoertise will be supplied by a Thuritian architect, who will be
responsible for building design, preparation of building tender documents,
evaluation of bads and supervision of construction.   . local engineering firm
wuculd carry cut the detailed engineering, tendering and supervision of civil
works other than buildings.   Tt is contemplated that by midd-1974, a Y'anager of
Fromotion and Sales, and later that year, when the first occupants are expected
to enter Coromandel) an Estate General MIanager will be added to the management
team.  DesDite the encouraging demand forecast, DBM plans to undertake additional
promoticnal efforts to attract investors and thereby help ensure full occupancy
of the estate as quickly as possible.
31.         The Coromandel Industrial Estate will be developed over five years
from 1974 to 1978.  Occupancy, starting in 197I , is projected to grow in step with
the phased development of land and buildings.  The 5-year construction period is
a conservative assumrtion in that it presumes that only about 13 percent of the
expected demand for factory space i-n INauritius over that period would be met by
the Coropmandel Estate, and that Pall or near-full occupancy would be aLtained by
t.-e end of 1980. 1levertheless, only about 40 percent of the total works woould be
ccntracted for construction betweer 1974 and mid-' 976 and the remainder would be
built in the Deriod remaining through 1978.  Rentals will be maintained at
competitive levels and are projected to result in a financial return slightly hi-her
than 15 percent annually, assumiLn  a 90 percent rate of occupancy.  ahould the
return fall below 10 percent, DEY would consult with the Association on approoriate
corrective mqeasurcs.
3'_         i ctal project cost is estimated at US$8.0 nmillion equivalent,
including about USq4700,00 for taxes and duties. The breakdovn of this cost is
estimated as follows:

agreement would be a condition of effectiveness. The balance of the project cost
amounting to US,,$.O million would be provided byr the G.overrment in the form of



an equity contribution to DBM. In addition, thne Government has agreed to
guarantee DBM against any net cunmn_ative loss in operating the estate.
33.        The proceeds of the IDA credit nill be used for expenditures on the
construction of buildings, roads and other infrastructure works, and contracts
for these items will be awarded under international competitive bidding in
nccordance *-rth the IDA Guidelines for Procurement.  Disbursements for
infrastructure wcrks and building construction will be made against 52 percent
of total expenditures on these works. The land has already been acqu4 red 'Di-
DBI and the engineering cortract will be negotiatcd. with a local engineering
firm.
31.,       The i ndustries to be established on the estate are expected to create
5,000 jobs by 1980 ris-ing to 8,000 by 1985, most of them involving trairing n rc
skill upgrading of unskilled and/or unemployed workers.  The industries on thbe
estate will represent an estimated carital investment of US4`t',58 million and by
the ntd-l980s, corporate income taxes should approach US45 mnllion per arnum.
NoIet foreigr exchange earrings after alowiang for profit remittances and
repatriation of irrported capital, on the conservative assumption that all -the
invested canital is foreign, should approach US320 mnllion per annum in the
late 1980s.  The estate is also excected to act as a strong stimulus to indigenous
entrepreneurshir afnd small-scale industry develooment.
35.        The financi.a' return of the project, on a constaint i7apee basis
.-ss-mtng 9?0 percent occupancy over a 20-,year period, is 15.4 percent.  *+t 5C;
rercent occuancyr, the return would. decrease to 13 percent, but this outcome is
unlikely in viewT of the expected high demand, and also because the land
cevelopmnent and building construction schedules are adaptable to the rate of
oc cunancir.

36.         The draft Development Credit Agreement betiseen vauritius and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and the Develop-
nent Bank of Yauritius, the Recommendatior of the ConnIttee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the

to the akecutive Directors separately.  The draft Development Credit and Project
Agreements corform substantially to the pattern of the Association' s agreements
for similar projects.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI/
Credit 239-MAS - Mauritius Tea Development Authority Project; $5.3 Million
Credit of April 9, 1971; closing date: December 31, 1977
This Project constitutes the second phase of Mauritius' smallholder
tea development program. Field development is satisfactory but a substantial
increase in cost has occurred, amounting to 51" over the appraisal estimate
mainly because of a sharp increase in wages (60/) and in costs of factories.
In agreement with the Governmnent, the percentage of disbursement and the
allocation of credit proceeds have been revised to maintain disbursement of
the IDA credit until the Project is completed. In addition, difficulties
are being encountered in getting people to settle on areas allocated for
smallholders.  The Government is currently reviewing the scope of the Project
in the light of the continuing decline in tea prices.
