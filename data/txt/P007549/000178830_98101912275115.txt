The appraisal mission consisted of Messrs. I.A. Menezes, J.R. Bentjerodt,
D. Cook (IDF), T. Iizuka, and P. Murgatroyd who visited Mexico in May/June
1977. While in the field, the mission received assistance from Messrs.
L. Vera, T. Hutcheson (IDF), K. Challa (IDF), and J.L. Forcina (LAC Region).
A further visit was made by Messrs. Menezes and Murgatroyd in July 1977
for discussions of certain project issues.



I. THE TOURISM SECTOR
Tourism Assets
1.01      Mexico is one of the world's major and most richly endowed tour-
ist destinations. Its varied attractions include architectural remains of
a series of major civilizations, entertainment ranging from modern to
traditional music and dance, a wealth of contemporary creative arts, oppor-
tunities for shopping that include handicrafts and haute couture, an agree-
able climate, excellent beaches along the Pacific and Caribbean sea coasts,
and street scenes that reflect the varied cultural background of Mexico's
populace. In addition Mexico is the most accessible foreign destination
for tourists from the US and Canada, one of the world's richest tourist
generating markets.
Tourist Arrivals--Trends and Characteristics
1.02      The proximity to the US and Canada, their growing prosperity and
close business ties with Mexico, the availability of direct air access to
various destinations in Mexico, and rapid expansion in facilities combined
to make for rapid growth of tourism to Mexico. The number of visitors in-
creased by an average of over 10% per year from 1960 to 1974, reaching 3.4
million in 1974, not including border tourism. Foreign visitor's growth
has also been fairly even. In no year from 1961 until 1974 when the energy
crisis hit, was the growth rate less than 8.6%. Visitor arrivals to Mexico
declined from the 1974 peak of 3.4 million to 3.2 million in 1975 and 3.1
million in 1976, but are showing recovery in 1977. This decline--the first
since 1953--was due to worldwide economic recession and to Mexico's uncom-
petitive position resulting from an overvalued peso 1/ (Annex I, Tables 1
to 5).
1.03      Mexico's accessibility by land, sea, and air, has been a major
factor in the growth of the tourism sector. Air traffic has grown faster
than total visitor traffic--at an average annual rate of 16% in the 1970-74
period and 8% in 1970-76--as a result of a decline in air costs and ani in-
crease in direct flights from major North American cities to Acapulco, Meri-
da, Guadalajara, La Paz, and Puerto Vallarta.  Arrivals by eir constitulted
40% of total arrivals in 1970 and are expected to be over 50% in 1977. Ar-
rivals by car, mainly from the border states, generate almost 65% of US
tourism to Mexico. This traffic is less significant in evaluating the de-
mand for tourist facilities as many are students or people visiting friends
or relatives who use few tourist facilities. In 1975 a typical visitor
coming by air spent US$11.25 a day for accommodation, a typical visitor by
land only one-fifth that much.
1/    Visitor traffic in 1976 was also affected by the Jewish boycott and
by the US Bicentennial celebrations and the Montreal Olympics.



-2-
l.04      Although about 85% of foreign visitors are from the US (Annex I,
Table 2), the proportion of visitors from Japan and Europe is increasing
steadily.
1.05      According to a study carried out in 1975, the main reasons for
coming to Mexico were: pleasure, 68.1%; visiting family, 18.1%; business,
6.0%; and visiting friends, 3.4%. Many trips are made for more than one
reason and include more than one destination. About 22% of all visitors
enter Mexico via the Mexico City airport and 35% declare Mexico City their
final destination.
1.06      Beach based tourism has grown considerably in recent years.  Ar-
rivals at Acapulco doubled in 10 years from 764,o00 in 1965 to 1,552,000 in
1974 and have continued to grow. The popularity of the resort towns of
Puerto Vallarta and Mazatl6n has also increased (Annex I, Table 3).
1.07      The volume of overall tourism is greater than shown by statistics
on visitors from abroad. A large border traffic--over 60 million crossings
of US residents into Mexico--is officially treated separately. Although
most of these visitors cannot be considered tourists, since they stay brief-
ly and do not use tourist facilities, roughly four million are calculated
to stay overnight in Mexico and can be rightly called tourists. 1/ Given
the importance of this border traffic--revenues derived from it totaled
US$1,600 million in 1976--and the little that is known of its characteris-
tics, the Secretariat of Tourism is initiating a study to determine its
size and nature.
Domestic Tourism
l.08      Domestic tourism in Mexico is also quite important, and with the
increasing affluence of Mexico's middle class and the initiation of a five-
day work week, this market is growing rapidly. Although no precise data are
available, its growth rate is estimated to have been similar to that for
foreign visitors. In 1976, some 20 million hotel visits by Mexican resi-
dents were recorded, amounting to some 40 million guest nights. At the ma-
jor resorts, Mexicans constitute an estimated 50% of guests in hotels of
international class and 65% in hotels of lower quality. The three largest
cities, Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, with 13.5 million inhabit-
ants in 1975 (half the country's urban and most of its high income popula-
tion), generate most Mexican visitors to domestic resorts.
1.09      The number of Mexicans traveling abroad increased from 273,000 in
1970 to 526,000 in 1975. After the September 1976 devaluation of the peso,
many foreign trips were canceled and the number of Mexicans traveling
abroad fell in 1976. As a consequence, trips to local resorts have become
even more popular.
1/    There are some 20,000 hotel rooms available in border towns that
accounted for an estimated 5.4 million tourist nights.



-3-
Seasonality
1.10      Because climatic conditions make Mexico a year-round resort area,
the flow of visitors shows only a minor degree of seasonality. Small peaks
occur in December, July and August and a low in September, when it rains
(Annex I, Table 4). As a result, tourist facilities generally experience
average annual occupancies much higher than those prevailing in many other
tourist destination countries.
1.11      The popularity of Mexico for conventions and "incentive travel",
and the skillful management of its convention capacity have helped reduce
seasonality. Total hotel convention capacity of 34,000 includes approximate-
ly 14,500 in Mexico City, 8,500 in Acapulco, and 550 in Canciun. Convention
centers are planned for Ixtapa (2,500), Mazatl'an (2,000) and Merida (2,000).
Average Length of Stay and Expenditures
1.12      In 1976 foreign visitors spent an average of US$23 per day, with
air travelers spending more (US$36 a day in 1976) than those arriving by
land--US$14 a day (Annex I, Table 5). The typical foreign tourist who comes
by air and stays not more than three weeks spends even more (US$43 per day).
1.13      In 1976 foreign visitors spent a total of 35 million nights in the
country, an average of 11.4 nights per visitor (Annex I, Table 5). There is
no significant difference in length of stay by season. Foreign visitors
coming by air for pleasure or business stayed an average of eight days.
Hotel visitors average four nights in major tourist areas (Mexico City, Aca-
pulco, Puerto Vallarta), suggesting that many tourists visit two or more
destinations in the country.
1.14      The table below shows the breakdown of visitor expenditures for
1975. For visitors coming by air, lodging expenditures constitute 29% of
total expenditures; for those coming by land, only 18%. Some food expendi-
tures are incurred in hotels, but it is estimated that significantly less
than half of total expenditures are captured by hotels. A particularly im-
portant role is played by handicraft and souvenir shopping, which accounts
for about 13% of total expenditures, generating an annual income from such
items of more than US$100 million (para. 1.39).

Size of Hotel Industry
1.15      Hotel and other accommodation capacity has steadily expanded.  In
1976 there were 6,450 lodging establishments with 195,000 rooms, compared
to 3,314 establishments with 90,981 rooms in 1961. Since 1970 capacity has
increased at an annual rate of more than 6.5%. The fastest increase in
rooms has been in the first-class category. In 1976 about 88,000 rooms were
categorized as international standard, about 45% of the total rooms regis-
tered. 1/ Two thirds are located in four of the 32 states in the country:
Federal District of Mexico City, 26%; Guerrero, 23%; Jalisco, 8%; and Quin-
tana Roo, 6%. Rooms are equally divided between city and seaside resort ho-
tels, but resort hotels are li:kely to become predominant. There is a trend
towards building hotels with larger capacity. Annex I, Tables 6 to 9 show
the present situation, growth rates, and distribution of accommodation by
type and category.
Occupancy Rates
1.16      Hotel occupancy statistics are available for the main destinations,
not for the whole country. Although occupancy rates have fallen over the
last two years with the decrease in foreign visitor arrivals, in 1975 they
were still high (ranging from 60 to 75%) and were spread evenly over the
year, particularly in Mexico City and in first-class hotels. In the first
half of 1977, occupancy rates returned almost to the record level of 1974
because of a strong recovery of the foreign market and a big increase in do-
mestic demand.  Annex I, Table 10 shows relatively high occupancy rates for
first-class hotels in established beach resorts. Very little is known about
lower class hotels (classes C, D and E), which mainly cater to Mexican cli-
entele; many are small family-type operations, and some remain open only
during the peak season. Their annual occupancy rate is estimated at 50 to 65%.
Operations and Profitability
1.17      A favorable factor for hotel operations in Mexico is their rela-
tively low operating costs. Though payroll and related expenses have in-
creased by 8 to 12% annually in recent years, current ratios of these costs to
total sales are relatively low, in the range of 15 to 25%. Food costs are
kept below 35% of food sales, and beverage costs between 17 and 25% of bev-
erage sales. Cost ratios of other expenses and overhead are similar to
those of international standard hotels in other countries (Annex III). Giv-
en these favorable operating cost factors, well managed hotels in Mexico at-
tain high gross operating prof'it (GOP) ratios of 30 to 40% of total sales.
1.18      Net profitability of' hotels varies considerably; a sound hotel
project, after the third year, can expect to earn an annual rate of return
on equity of about 8% in real terms. Profitability is not as great as the
1/    In Mexico, as in other countries, the system of categorizing hotels
suffeisfrom several flaws, and is neither systematically applied nor
universally accepted. T'he appraisal mission had to use its own
judgment in hotel categorization questions.



high level of occupancy would suggest, in part because average room rates in
Mexico are relatively low. An analysis of sample hotels indicates that av-
erage annual occupancy rates of large international standard hotels in 1977
were between 75 and 82% and average room rates from Mex$650 to Mex$850 a day.
Lower class hotels had lower occupancy rates (50 to 65%) and charged up to
Mex$400 a day. Room rates are fixed by the Government, in principle for
four-year periods; in practice they are reviewed more often, particularly in
view of the unprecedented inflation that Mexico has experienced recently. A
20% across-the-board increase was granted after the September 1976 devalua-
tion and another 10% in early 1977. Since rate regulation is not intended
to curtail hotel profits, further increases are likely to be granted as re-
quired. Because of Mexico's very competitive position in terms of prices
and the favorable demand-supply position that is developing, hoteliers are
expected to be able to negotiate higher room rates with their clients, par-
ticularly tour operators, without losing business or lowering occupancy
rates in the near term.
Investment Costs
1.19      The cost of constructing hotels in Mexico varies according to size,
type, category, and location. Although construction costs increased by 8 to
10% annually in the early 1970s, and by 25 to 30% between 1976 and 1977 after
the devaluation of the peso, they are still very reasonable when compared to
other destinations. It is estimated that in 1977 prices, average investment
costs per room for new hotels in Mexico ranged from over uS$40,ooo for luxu-
ry-class hotels to less than US$25,000 for economy-class hotels. A luxury-
class hotel in the Caribbean would cost over US$55,000 per room.
Ownership and Management Patterns
1.20      In Mexico, ownership and operation of hotels of international class
are typically in different hands. Most of the leading hotels are owned by
Mexicans, although a few are owned by foreign interests. Some are owned by
an individual or a group of individuals, and some, especially large interna-
tional standard hotels, are owned jointly by individuals and financial in-
stitutions.
1.21      The more important Mexican hotel companies which both own and op-
erate hotels are Nacional Hotelera, Hoteles Camino Real, Consorcio Aristos,
and Promotora Mexicana de Hoteles. Nacional Hotelera, of which FONATUR is
the principal shareholder, operates 29 hotels (3,076 rooms) of which it
owns seven (1,800 rooms). The Camino Real Group, of which a considerable
share is owned by Banco Nacional de Mexico, operates several hotels (2,170
rooms) under a management contract with Western International, a US group,
which also owns stock in the company. The Aristos Group, owned by a real
estate developer based in Mexico City, operates hotels in Mexico City, Can-
cun, and Ixtapa. Promotora Mexicana de Hoteles, owned by a Mexico City
automobile dealer, operates four hotels in Acapulco, and one in Mexico City,
all under a management contract with the Americana Group of the US.
1.22      Unlike ownership patterns, hotel operation in Mexico is often in
the hands of foreign companies or of Mexican companies with substantial for-
eign connections under lease or management contracts. The typical lease



- 6 -
contract provides for a rent of 15 to 18% of total sales with the hotel com-
pany providing equipment and working capital. The typical management con-
tract provides for a management fee of 2 to 5% of total sales and an addi-
tional 8 to 10% of gross operating profit. Operating companies generally
prefer a management contract because it entails less financial risk than a
lease contract.
Financing
1.23      Mexico's well developed banking system, comprising almost 200 pri-
vate, mixed, and publicly owned institutions, has played a major role in
supporting the growth of the productive sectors of the economy, including
tourism. The banking system has traditionally been able to mobilize large
amounts of savings because of a stable currency and sound interest rate
policies, maintaining positive real interest rates and a small premium over
rates offered by US banks. It has also intermediated successfully between
the public's preference for relatively short-term savings instruments and
the need to provide medium- and long-term funds for investment projects.
1.24      Notwithstanding the progress achieved by the banking system, cer-
tain structural weaknesses were apparent in the early 1970s. One was the
traditionalism in credit allocation. Financial institutions tended to re-
quire guarantees substantially in excess of the legal minimum (133% of the
credit granted). Even credit for projects requiring term financing was
judged mainly by the solvency of the sponsor, with little weight given to
the appraised risk and income-earning characteristics of the project. This
behaviour, though understandable as a way of reducing credit risks, tended
to concentrate credit in firms and sectors that had proved themselves, to
the detriment of new firms and activities. It was primarily to overcome
this weakness that the financial authorities developed a system of trust
funds, whose resources came mainly from reserve requirements kept with the
Banco de Mexico, to allocate credit to specific activities not receiving
adequate credit from the banking system. One such fund, FONATUR, was cre-
ated to channel money to the priority sector of tourism.
1.25      In general, trust funds channel only a small portion of total
credit. The funds are most useful in the long run in influencing the bank-
ing system in its allocation of credit that does not flow through the funds
themselves. Thus FONATUR can demonstrate that banks can risk tying up
funds for 12 to 15 years in hotels when the project and its market are pro-
perly evaluated.
1.26      Since 1973 increased inflation and tighter control of credit ex-
pansion and interest rates have slowed the growth of financial savings and
reduced credit availability (particularly longer-term credit). Nonmonetary
liabilities of the banking system fell from 32% of GDP in 1972 to 22% in
1976, largely because of a failure to adjust interest rates rapidly enough
in the light of inflation rates that increased from the 4 to 5% per annum
characteristic of the 1960s to 24% in 1974, 15% in 1975, and 16% in 1976.
The continuing high rate of inflation led to the devaluation and subsequent
floating of the peso in late 1976.
1.27      Expansion of FONATUR's lending activities and the continued sup-



-7-
port it has received from the present administration reflect the Goverrnment's
intention to channel funds to activities whose access to credit on appropri-
ate terms is limited, particularly during periods of credit shortage as is
the case at present. Much of the hotel expansion in Mexico in recent years
has been due to the active role of FONATUR, which has supplied the bulk of
hotel credit by rediscounting term loans of private and public financial in-
stitutions. These institutions usually finance up to 50% of total invest-
ment costs, though in some cases they have lent as much as 65%, with maturi-
ties up to 12 to 15 years. Medium-term loans for less than five years and
short-term loans of six months or less are available from commercial banks
for additional capital needs, e.g., working capital, but they are limited in
amount and carry high interest rates (18 to 22%).
1.28      Equity for hotel projects comes from various sources: individual
investors, financial institutions, and more recently the Government. Since
1971 equity has been raised predominantly in Mexico, in part because of a
change in the law that required a majority holding by Mexican investors in
new corporations. This and the current banking practice of requiring debt/
equity ratios of 50:50 have put a burden on investors to come up with sub-
stantial equity capital. In many countries loans covering 70 to 85% of ho-
tel costs are not uncommon, since around 85% of total hotel investment costs
are often in fixed assets.
1.29      Despite difficult market conditions of the past two to three years
and increases in construction and operating costs, investors have been will-
ing to provide equity funds for the expansion of existing hotels and con-.
struction of new ones. Hotels may not generate high net profits, but in-
vestors envisage other financial advantages from investing in them: tax
shelters, hedges against inflation, substantial cash flow, and possible long-
run capital gains. Both investors and FONATUR are aware of the financial
difficulties investors face during the first few years it takes for a hotel
to attain levels of operation sufficient to generate positive cash flows.
Development of Other Facilities and Services
1.30      Tourist facilities other than hotels have also flourished wi-th the
continued expansion of tourism. The number of travel agencies in Mexico in-
creased by 62% in four years, from 468 in 1972 to 758 in 1976. The number
of agencies catering to the transport needs of tourism has also grown rapid-
ly: from 43 in 1973 to 320 in 1976 for specialized transport; from 159 to
205 in the same period for rent-a-car agencies. The number of restaurants,
bars and similar facilities increased by about 14% between 1972 and 1976.
1.31      Mexico has given priority to developing its land, sea, and air
transport network. During the period 1971-74 about US$2 billion was spent
on road construction, increasing paved roads from 71,250 km in 1971 to
175,540 km in 1974.  A ferry network has been developed, largely to link
Baja California with the Mexican mainland. Accessibility by air has also
improved, with 44 commercial airports now in operation.  International air-
ports were recently opened at Zihuatanejo and Canclun. Mexico City's air-
port, which in 1974 handled about 50% of all flight arrivals from abroad,
is being modernized and expanded. Although Mexico City, Acapulco, and some



- 8 -
other cities have good air connections with the US, Canada, South America,
and Europe, some air access problems have developed for other Mexican desti-
nations in the last few years. These relate not to infrastructure but to
air policies. Because of the lack of a new bilateral civil aviation agree-
ment between Mexico and the IJS since 1970, some airports were not being
served with the frequency and variety that made Mexico City and Acapulco
major tourist destinations. A new bilateral agreement has been signed in
January 1978 which dramatically increases the number of points that can be
served. For scheduled services the agreement includes new or expanded rights
from 33 US cities to one or more of 21 Mexican destinations, particularly
tourism resorts on the west coast and in the Yucat'an peninsula. Furthermore,
the agreement will permit the free flow of charters between the two countries
without many restrictions.
Institutional Aspects
1.32      Until recently, there was no single entity at the federal level
charged with the responsibility for developing tourism. This responsibility
was shared, among others, by the Department of Tourism, the National Council
of Tourism, INFRATUR, and FOGATUR. Each of these had both specific and over-
lapping responsibilities and there was little coordination among them. Al-
though the law that created the Secretariat of Tourism ( Turismo ) in 1974
entrusted it with a coordinating role for all aspects of sectoral develop-
ment, including promotion and training, it is only recently that the Secre-
tariat appears to be taking over this role. In 1976 the National Council of
Tourism had a network of 15 offices abroad plus one in Acapulco, while the
Secretariat had 19 delegations abroad and 126 in the country. The Council
also had a budget higher than that of the Secretariat. The Government seems
determined to strengthen Turismo so as to ensure effective coordination; the
Council has been brought under the wing of Turismo, which in due course is
likely to absorb its functions. The Secretary of Turismo is now Chairman of
the Board of FONATUR, and fur-ther changes can be expected in the direction
of closer coordination.
Employment and Training
1.33      The tourism sector employs between 300,000 and 400,000 people di-
rectly, about 2% of the labor force. Some 180,000 work in hotels, 76% of
them at the lower level, 18% in administration, and 6% in management. Most
have received little or no formal training. People in top management jobs
have often been trained abroadl.
1.34      Though the greatest need is for training for lower and intermedi-
ate jobs, existing institutions train people mainly for higher levels. The
organization most geared to the needs of the sector is the Mexican Institute
for Social Security, which has 11 schools offering 16-week courses for lower
level staff. A large number of its recent graduates found work in the tour-
ism sector. In August 1976, 17 universities offered programs (eight of them
recognized by the Secretariat of Public Education) leading after four years
to the degree of licenciado in tourisn administration or planning. Most of
the 700 graduates in 1976 had difficulty finding jobs in the tourism sector.
Practical training is lacking at all levels, partly because of labor laws
and regulations and partly because of the orientation of curriculum planners.



1.35      Turismo very broadly estimates the demand for trained staff for
1976-82 at 15,000 people a year, of which 11,600 for lower level jobs. The
present training structure cannot meet this demand. The new administration
recognizes the need for studies to determine the amount and kind of demand
for trained personnel, improve curricula, and provide more practical train-
ing. Turismo and FONATUR have agreed with the Bank to carry out the needed
studies not later than June 30, 1979.
Economic Importance of Tourism
1.36      The major contribution of tourism is to the balance of payments
and the generation of employment. Tourism foreign exchange earnings peaked
at US$842 million in 1974 and amounted to US$821 million in 1976. 1/ This
constituted 13.9% of exports of goods and services in 1974 and 12.1% in 1976:

1.38      Between 300,000 and 400,000 jobs are directly generated in tourism
(para. 1.33), i.e., in activities that sell goods and services to tourists.
Although most workers in tourism are relatively unskilled, wages and bene-
fits relative to skill levels are high. A survey undertaken in Acapulco in
the early 1970s showed income of employees in tourism activities was 50%
higher than average income. Acapulco, though it has other industries, is
dominated by tourism; earnings in tourism nationwide are probably similar to
those in other modern sector activities.
1.39      Handicrafts are an imnportant component, particularly with respect
to the distribution of the benefits of tourism. In 1975 total sales of
handicrafts were estimated at Mex$1.6 billion, affecting the lives and in-
comes of at least five million Mexicans (including producers, market inter-
mediaries, and their families) of the poorer income segments of the popu-
lation. Mexican crafts are we:ll known for their diversity, colorfulness,
and quality and are rightly considered and advertised as a major tourist at-
traction.
1.40      Producers of crafts can be divided into various categories: over
half belong to Indian ethnic groups; another 30 to 40% are mestizos. A
small percentage can be considered craftsmen-artists who make a living based
on the fame acquired from their individual products, but most are nameless.
For most craft producers, agriculture is the basic occupation. Since on the
average, however, there are over 200 days a year during which a family isnot ful-
ly working in agriculture, some communities or families have specialized in
craft production. Also, the amount of family effort devoted to crafts de-
pends on the yields and income from agriculture. For instance, in 1975, a
bad year in agriculture, the number registered as artisans at a large handi-
craft institution showed a sizeable increase.
1.41      There are several institutions involved in preserving, producing
and marketing crafts at various points in the production cycle. The largest
and best known is the National Fund for Craft Development (FONART), created
in 1971. Its role is to rescue, conserve, diffuse, and improve all expres-
sions and objects of popular art and tc support the producers of this art.
It disseminates information through regular publications, a weekly televi-
sion program, and exhibitions. Its major task, however, lies with the pro-
ducers. The first step in its work with producers is the organization of a
"solidarity group," which collects orders, organizes and distributes work,
and is eligible for credit, training, and other support; each group estab-
lishes minimum quality requirements and prices. The producers receive half
payment on delivery of the products and the other half the following month,
a payment system that guarantees a more stable income per month and gives
FONART a continuing relationship with the artisans.
II. FONDO NACIONAL DE FOMENTO AL TURISMO (FONATUR)
A. Role, Management, and Organization
Background
2.01      In recognition of the major importance of tourism to Mexico as a



- 11 -
generator of foreign exchange earnings and employment, and of the need to
promote a more rapid and better integrated development of the sector, the
Federal Law for the Development of Tourism was enacted in January 1974. Its
three main provisions strengthened the powers and responsibilities of the
Department of Tourism (subsequently made a full ministry) to plan and coor-
dinate the growth of national and foreign tourism; formed an interministerial
commission on tourism development; and created FONATUR to be responsible for
formulating and implementing projects to improve or expand facilities
throughout Mexico.
2.02      FONATUR was established as a trust fund of the Federal Government
under the administrative supervision of Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA),
the major public sector development financing institution, through the merg-
er of two existing trust funds, INFRATUR and FOGATUR. INFRATUR (Fondo de
Promocion de Infraestructura Turistica) had been established in 1969 to pro-
mote and carry out tourism infrastructure development and by 1976 was suc-
cessfully implementing two major projects at Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo and Canc'un
with assistance from IBRD and IDB. FOGATUR (Fondo de Garantla y Fomento al
Turismo) had been created in 1965 to finance hotel construction and related
tourism facilities directly and by discounting loans made by financial in-
termediaries. Its volume of operations had grown very slowly, amounting to
only Mex$375 million in 1973. These two trust funds were merged: (a) to cre-
ate a single institution able to implement the Government's tourism develop-
ment plans and to coordinate more effectively the integrated development of
tourism infrastructure and superstructure; and (b) to revitalize and great-
ly expand the financing activities for which FOGATUR had been responsible,
in light of the limited capacity of the banking system to provide hotel fi-
nancing in adequate amounts and terms out of its own resources. FONATUR's
Operating Regulations empower it to engage in all the activities previously
performed by INFRATUR and FOGATUR and to undertake studies and implement
projects pursuant to national tourism development goals.
Board and Credit Committee
2.03      Responsibility for the overall direction of FONATUR is vested in
its nine-member Board (called the Technical and Fund Allocating Committee),
which is chaired by the Secretary for Tourism and comprises representatives
of the Secretariats of Programming and Budgeting, Treasury and Public Cred-
it, National Patrimony and Industrial Development, Banco de Mexico, Nacio-
nal Financiera, S.A., and three representatives of the private sector (the
Confederation of the National Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Perma-
nent National Agrarian Congress and the Congress of Labor). The Board meets
four to six times a year to approve operating programs and budgets, set;
policies and guidelines for FONATUR's financing and infrastructure opera-
tions, and generally oversee operations. Approval of individual credit; op-
erations is delegated to a four-member Credit Committee comprising repre-
sentatives of the Ministries of Tourism and Finance and of Banco de Mexico
and NAFINSA (normally the Board members or their alternates); this committee
meets monthly and is the key decision-making body for FONATUR's hotel financ-
ing operations. 1/
1/    Authority to approve loans of less than Mex$2 million (about US$90,000)
has been further delegated to FONATUR's Director General.



- 12 -
Organization and Management
2.04      FONATUR's day-to-day operations are managed by its Director
General, appointed directly by the President of Mexico. Reporting to the
Director General are three departments: the Development Department,
responsible for tourism infrastructure development; the Operations Depart-
ment, responsible for hotel credit, equity investment, and related fi-
nancing activities; and a third department under the Controller which pro-
vides accounting, financial management, and personnel administration
services to the operating departments.  Past experience has shown FONATUR's
management to be experienced and competent. An organization chart is
presented on page 13.
Staffing
2.05      On June 1, 1977, FONATUR's staff totaled 453, including 246 peo-
ple employed on fixed-term ccontracts most of whom are employed in the in-
frastructure operations of the Development Department. The Operations De-
partment has only 37 staff members, 22 of whom are professionally qualified
accountants, engineers, economists, and architects, but it receives back-up
assistance (e.g., in conducting marketing studies) from other FONATUR de-
partments and, to a lesser extent, from outside consultants. The Operations
Department is organized in three subdepartments responsible for lending op-
erations, financial promotion and equity investments, and sales of developed
land. Although the credit operations subdepartment with 14 staff mem-
bers is the largest, FONATUR will need to expand it further to enable it to
better cope with its planned increase in activities, including supervision,
operational analysis, and technical assistance. FONATUR has had little
difficulty in attracting and retaining experienced and well-qualified pro-
fessional staff.
B. Development (Infrastructure) Department
(i) Objectives
2.06      The primary objective of FONATUR's infrastructure development op-
erations has been to diversify tourism destinations in Mexico, both to fa-
cilitate a more rapid growth of tourism capacity and to ensure a more equi-
table regional spread of the economic benefits of tourism. Initial efforts
were concentrated on the development of Cancun on the coast of Yucat'an and
Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo on Mexico's Pacific coast. More recently, FONATUR has
initiated similar developments in Oaxaca and in Baja California.
2.07      With respect to its infrastructure developments, FONATUR's finan-
cial objective has been to recover its investments and earn a reasonable
rate of return by selling developed land to investors at appropriate prices.
Land has either been sold on a cash or deferred-payment basis (e.g., 15 to

20% down, balance over five years, 12% interest p.a.) or has been sold in
exchange for equity participation in new hotel projects. While its infra-
structure developments are still in the initial stage, FONATUR has earned
a significant amount of revenues generated from the sale of land and relat-
ed operations. With growing investor interest in the new resorts, FONATUR
should have little difficulty in achieving a satisfactory return on its in-
frastructure investments.
(ii) Characteristics of Operation
2.08      In 1970 FONATUR (then INFRATUR) chose two areas to develop after
an elaborate exercise that took into account market, economic, touristic,
social, and other factors. These were Canc'un and Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo. In
January 1972, the Bank lent US$22 million equivalent to help finance the pro-
vision of infrastructure for Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo. Earlier, in August 1971,
the Inter-American Development Bank had made a loan of US$21.5 million for
similar facilities at Cancun.
2.09      The project at Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, in its first stage provides in-
frastructure to support the development of 3,500 hotel rooms and 500 single-
family houses. The project comprised three main elements: the first in-
cluded the principal infrastructures--roads and streets, water and sewerage
systems, electric power and telecommunications--needed for the tourism area
at Ixtapa; the second consisted of infrastructure for the town of Zihuatane-
jo, which would develop as a service center and secondary tourist attraction;
the third was the construction of an international airport. The project also
made provision for hotel training. The Canciun project was similar in pro-
portion but included the construction of a whole new town because of the
absence of urban areas nearby. More recently initiated are infrastructure
projects in Oaxaca and Baja California. The Oaxaca development is at an
early stage, and to date only modest investments have been made. The pro-
ject in Baja California is similar in size to those in Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo
and Canc'unand envisages the construction of infrastructure facilities that
would support the development of 2,100 hotel rooms, 4,050 apartel rooms, and
960 condominium units and tourist villas at two sites: Loreto and San Jose
del Cabo. The Bank in July 1977 extended a loan of US$42 million to help
finance the infrastructure for this project.
(iii) Evaluation of Performance
2.10      FONATUR's Development Department is well managed, has established
a good reputation, and has acquired considerable experience and knowledge
of the tourism sector. After encountering some delays due largely to land
acquisition problems, the Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo project is now nearing comple-
tion, with all of the Bank's loan expected to be disbursed by June 30, 1978.
The airport has been open for more than a year and is serving both Ixtapa-
Zihuatanejo and the rapidly expanding industrial town of Lazaro Cardenas, an
hour's drive from the airport. Physical facilities of the town of Zihuata-
nejo have been greatly improved. Its population has grown from 4,000 to
over 10,000 and is expected to continue to grow faster than estimated at the
time of appraisal. In the tourist zone of Ixtapa, two hotels are open for
business (534 rooms) and several others are under construction. By 1979



-15 -
about 2,600 rooms are expected to be available.
2.11      In Canc'un, as of mid-1977, 2,800 hotel and condominium rooms were
completed and several hundred more were under construction. The new town
developed nearby now has a population of over 10,000. Early in 1976 IDB ap-
proved another loan of US$20 million to finance the second stage of the Can-
cun project, which is underway.
2.12      The Baja California project, for which the Bank is providing as-
sistance, is being implemented on schedule.
2.13      Between 1973 and 1976, FONATUR disposed of 62% of the land it planned
to sell in the first stare at Cancuin and 15% at Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo. Pro-
motional efforts to sell land have been intensified in Ixtapa this year.
Prices average Mex$345 (US$15) per square meter for residential sites,
Mex$115 (us$5) for commercial, and Mex$690 (US$30) for hotel sites. FONATUR
plans to increase these prices by 12% a year to cover inflation and appreci-
ation in land values. These prices are competitive with those in other tour-
ist areas in Mexico.
2.14      With the Canc'un, Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Oaxaca, and Baja California
projects in the pipeline, FONATUR does not intend at this stage to open up
any new resort areas but to concentrate on fully developing and utilizing
the investments already made or underway.
C. Operations (Lending) Department
(i) Objectives
2.15      Unlike its infrastructure developments, FONATUR's hotel financing
activities are nationwide. The objective is to encourage and facilitate ex-
pansion of tourist accommodations and related services, in line with nation-
al goals for tourism development, by ensuring that long-term financing on
adequate terms is available for economically sound and financially viable
projects. To meet this objective FONATUR: (a) encourages the interest of
banks and other financial intermediaries in hotel financing by helping them
appraise projects and rediscounting their loans for such projects; (b) under-
takes sector studies and assists hotel investors structure their projects
and obtain financing from third parties; (c) makes equity investments in and
direct loans to selected hotel projects if full financing cannot be obtained
from other sources; and (d) finances directly or through intermediaries the
development of other services necessary to promote or complement hotel in-
vestments.
2.16      Apart from its Operating Regulations which specify the financing
activities it is legally authorized to undertake, FONATUR does not have an
explicit statement of its policies on hotel financing, but a broad framework
of policies and priorities is implicit in the decisions taken by its Board,
Credit Committee, and management. FONATUR believes its primary role should
be as a second-tier institution, discounting loans made by financial inter-
mediaries for the development of all categories of hotel accommodation
throughout the country provided that analysis shows the project to be sound-



16 -
ly designed, financially viable and reasonably efficient economically.
Equity investments and direct lending are regarded as less important activi-
ties and have been concentrated mainly in Cancun and Ixtapa where FONATUR
had felt it necessary to stimulate further investment by the private sector.
While the quality of the investment portfolio appears quite sound, individ-
ual investments have been structured and approved case by case without the
discipline of a formal policy framework to help decide the extent of FONA-
TUR's equity participation, minimum participation required from private
sector investors, FONATUR's total exposure in terms of equity and direct
loans, or whether the intention is to invest permanently or sell its equity
to private investors as soon as feasible. Similarly there are no formally
established policies on the circumstances in which FONATUR will make direct
loans or the terms of such loans. FONATUR's management has now reviewed
and clarified its financing policies and appraisal criteria, particularly
with respect to equity investments and direct lending, and has agreed to
incorporate these in its Operating Regulations. These statements, which
provide FONATUR with a much improved policy framework (Annex IV), have been
discussed during loan negotiations, and have subsequently been approved by
FONATUR's management and Board.
(ii) Characteristics of Operations
2.17      (a)  Lending Operations: During the four years 1973-76, FONATUR
approved 428 credit applications totaling about Mex$3.6 billion to help fi-
nance construction of about 21,000 new hotel rooms, renovation of 3,000
existing hotel rooms, and some miscellaneous tourism investments, represent-
ing a total investment of about Mex$8.9 billion:

2.18      As of December 31, 1976, Mex$2,520 million of the approved credits
(70%) had been disbursed; an additional Mex$540 million (15%) will be dis-
bursed in 1977 and 1978; and Mex$525 million (15%) had been or will be can-
celed.



- 17 -
2.19      The table on page 18 summarizes the 1973-76 loan approvals by size,
purpose, hotel category, interest rate, and maturity. Over 60% of the value
of these approvals has been for loans of over Mex$10 million and for new ho-
tel rooms; 79% of the value has been for Category I and II hotels. Typical
terms were 9.5% interest (rate received by FONATUR--final borrowers pay at
least 2 percentage points more) and 10 to 15 years' maturity.
2.20      The 428 approvals were distributed among 128 different cities in
all but one of the states in Mexico. Annex I, Table 11, lists 21 cities
that received about half the projects and over 75% of the value of approv-
als. FONATUR worked with 56 different financial intermediaries over the
1973-76 period. The most active of these, processing 70% of the value of
all approvals, are listed in Annex I, Table 12.
2.21      (b)  Equity Investments: FONATUR's equity investments have expand-
ed rapidly (Annex I, Table 13), increasing from Mex$44 million in 1974 to
Mex$444 million in 1975 and Mex$1,045 million in 1976.  About 60% of total
equity investment is in Cancun and Ixtapa in hotels built by FONATUR as part
of its effort to promote these projects. A further 13% represents the
transfer to FONATUR of the Government's participation in the Nacional
Hotelera chain.
2.22      At the end of 1977 FONATUR will have a controlling equity interest
in 18 hotels (excluding the hotels owned by Nacional Hotelera) and a minor-
ity participation in three more. These hotels are managed by professional
operators who regularly submit detailed budgets and accounts to FONATUR.
The Canciun investments are already profitable, and the Ixtapa investments
are expected to be so in 1978. Only the new hotels built at archaeological
sites are unlikely to show profits for several years (para. 2.25).
To date, most hotels in which FONATUR has equity have reinvested annual pro-
fits rather than declared dividends.
2.23      It is FONATUR's policy to make equity investments only in support
of priority programs when private investment for these projects is not
forthcoming. All of FONATUF's equity investments in projects, except the
highly profitable Club Mediterranee in Canciun, will be sold if buyers can
be found who will pay an acceptable price. With the exception of some ad-
ditional investments in the resort areas it has developed, FONATUR plans to
minimize its equity investment activities in the future.
(iii) Evaluation of Performance
2.24      (a)  Lending Operations: Lending operations performance has been
improving over the past years. Although the staff needs to be expanded
with the increasing workload, management and organizational structures are
adequate. Implementation of the revised Operating Regulations (para. 2.16)
would formalize present practices and articulate new policies in areas where
none exist. The quality of some aspects of appraisal work would be
strengthened (para. 2.27). Documentation of underlying expenditures would
be required from the intermediaries as a condition of disbursements
(para. 2.36). Supervision and technical assistance would be expanded for
all of its subprojects (para. 2.37). Budgeting will be strengthened
through computerization of the loan portfolio and adoption of three-year

cash flow budgeting (paras. 2.39 and 2.40).
2.25      (b)  Equity Investments: Operational, financial, and management
control of equity investments is generally satisfactory. FONATUR's record
of building 13 new hotels in 1977, all within time and budget limitations,
is impressive. The sale of five projects during the year at satisfactory
prices demonstrates an active commitment to using equity investment only
where and when private investment is not available. The Nacional Hotelera
chain, made up largely of hotels not built by FONATUR, is not yet profitable
and should be subject to the same financial management monitoring as FONA-
TUR's other projects. The six new hotels at archaeological sites were built
at least partly because of political demands and may not be profitable for
some time. This particular investment, however, represents only a very
small portion of its total equity investments. A clearly defined statement
of policies in this area should help FONATUR resist such pressure in the
future.
(iv) Internal Systems, Procedures, and Policies
2.26      (a)  Project Appraisal: For loans made through financial interme-
diaries and presented for discounting to FONATUR, the task of project ap-
praisal is shared by FONATUR and the intermediary. In practice only a few com-
mercial banks and intermediaries handle a sufficient volume of hotel lending
to warrant their employing tourism specialists. Consequently, many interme-
diaries devote their attention mainly to examining the creditworthiness of
the borrower and the broad financial aspects of the project which are ade-
quately covered by them and rely on FONATUR's help for appraising the con-
struction, design, marketing, and other technical details. Thus most inter-
mediaries start working with FONATUR early in the appraisal process and de-
lay approval of a loan until FONATUR's appraisal has been completed. Simi-
larly many of the smaller hotel investors approach FONATUR directly for
advice and assistance during the project preparation stage. FONATUR regards
such technical assistance as an important aspect of its support for the tour-
ism sector.
2.27      FONATUR appraisals are undertaken by teams of two professionals,
an economist/financial analyst and an engineer or architect, who visit the
project site often with a representative of the intermediary. Their ap-
praisal is comprehensive and covers investment, operational, financial, and
marketing aspects. However, the results are summarized in a standardized
report format that has several defects as a document for decision making.
It is difficult to distinguish which aspects are of special importance for
a particular project, and the treatment of some aspects appears superficial.
The procedure should be strengthened by tailoring the appraisal document to
the characteristics of individual projects and when appropriate: (a) devot-
ing greater attention to the managerial and administrative competence of
the proposed hotel operator; (b) including balance sheets and sources and
uses of funds statements in financial projections; (c) analyzing in greater
depth the market and marketing aspects; and (d) including a more explicit
and quantitative treatment of economic aspects rather than relying on quali-
tative judgments. The shortcomings are caused in part by the heavy travel
and analytic workload of appraisal staff, each of whom is involved in 20 to
25 appraisals a year. FONATUR's management has agreed that a more flexible,



- 20 -
issue oriented appraisal format should be developed and has begun to experi-
ment with new approaches. It has also agreed to upgrade its appraisal pro-
cedures and expand the staff of its Operations Department as required to
effectively carry out FONATUR's programs.
2.28      Appraisals of direct loans are handled in much the same way as
loans through intermediaries except that FONATUR devotes more attention to
questions of credit risk. Appraisals of prospective equity investments are
handled by a separate subdepartment, which carries out its evaluations in
greater depth. Apart from a failure to treat the economic and social as-
pects explicitly, these appraisals are generally thorough and of good
quality.
2.29      (b)  Interest Rate Policy: Since 1974 banks and financieras 1/ have
increased their interest rates in response to higher inflation, and because
of increased uncertainty about their future resource costs, many banks have
switched to a system of floating interest rates related to the index of the
average cost of funds to financieras (the ACF index). 2/
2.30      Until recently, under FONATUR's interest rate structure, the ulti-
mate borrowers paid fixed peso interest rates of 10 to 13% for 10 to 15
years, including a grace period of two to three years. Loans for condomini-
um development were for shorter periods (five years) and at a higher inter-
est rate (14%). The interest spread for the financial intermediaries was 2
to 3%, depending on the size of the loans. These interest rates were set in
July 1974 and were 2 to 4% below those charged by commercial banks at that
time for medium- and long-term loans financed out of their own resources.
The rates were fixed and did not allow FONATUR to break even on its credit
operations.
2.31      Under the proposed project, the Government and FONATUR have agreed
that:
i. FONATUR would charge floating rather than fixed interest rates,
such that interest rates on outstanding loans would be adjusted
periodically to reflect changes in the ACF index;
ii. FONATUR would on-lend to intermediaries at interest rates whose
weighted average is approximately equal to the ACF index (cur-
rently 14.1%). This would mean that the final borrowers would
pay an average rate of 16% which would subsequently vary accord-
ing to the ACF index. (A similar scheme has been introduced,by
another trust fund, FONEI, to which the Bank has lent in the
past.) Given present projections of future rates of inflation
(20% in 1978, 12% in 1979, and 7% thereafter) and the relation
between inflation and the average cost of funds to financieras,
this new structure should result in average interest rates
charged to hotel investors equivalent to 2 to 3% in real terms
S/ Investment or Development Banks.
2/  This index is published monthly by the Banco de Mexico.  It re-
presents the average interest rates paid by financieras to savers
on short and medium notes and bonds.



- 21 -
over the life of FONATUR's subloans.  As a first step in
this direction, FONATUR's Board and the Government increased
FONATUR's interest rates in June 1977, whose weighted average
was approximately equal to the ACF index current at that
time (Annex I, Table 14). No changes in the interest rate
have, however, been made since then. During negotiations, the
Mexican Government and FONATUR have agreed to make the next
adjustment before September 1, 1978 and thereafter
allow it to float in accordance with the changes in the
ACF index; and
iii. FONATUR would require larger investors to bear the foreign
exchange risk on the part of their total debt requirements
financed out of cofinancing resources that FONATUR is plan-
ning to raise from foreign commercial banks (para. 4.14).
2.32      The above principles reflect a substantial improvement over past
policies. While slightly below commercial levels, the new interest levels
are commensurate with promoting desired levels of investment in the hotel
sector to compensate for modest financial returns to hotel investors and
the lack of fiscal or other incentives available to the hotel sector.
2.33      (c)   Procurement Procedures and Cost Controls: FONATUR's proce-
dures for controlling procurement and project costs are satisfactory. For
smaller projects, procurement control is delegated to the intermediaries,
which for many items tend to rely on the prospective borrower's judgment,
experience, and self-interest to select contractors and equipment that are
competitive in price and quality and appropriate for the purpose in view.
However, FONATUR applies certain construction cost criteria, so that bor-
rowers cannot inflate their resource needs.
2.34      FONATUR requires the larger prospective borrowers to submit with
the loan application at least three bids for civil works and a short analy-
sis evaluating each bid and enabling bids to be compared. Bidders are re-
quired to have experience in hotel construction and a solid financial posi-
tion. Supply and installation of fixed equipment is normally carried out
by specialized contractors registered with FONATUR. The borrower is re-
quired to obtain quotations from at least two such contractors and to pur-
chase furniture, fixtures and non-fixed equipment from a list of qualified
suppliers and local manufacturers registered with FONATUR.
2.35      For the more important and the largest subprojects, and those in
which FONATUR has a majority equity interest, FONATUR employs the services
of a local consulting firm specialized in construction management. This
firm is well equipped to supervise the entire execution of any hotel pro-
ject. Its experience includes involvement in building 38 medium-size and
large hotels in Mexico in the last five years. The firm has developed de-
tailed parameters for the design of hotels and procedures for preparation
of bidding documents and for cost control of hotel construction and, equipment.
2.36      (d)   Disbursement Policies and Procedures: Disbursement schedules
and legal documentation, usually in the form of signed notes required as



- 22 -
guarantees, are set up in conjunction with appraisal and approval processes.
No commitment fees are charged. Disbursements are made to intermediaries on
request, and they disburse this money immediately to the borrower. In the
past no documentation of underlying expenditures or physical inspection hab
been specifically required as a condition for disbursement. Intermediaries
have been held generally responsible for assuring themselves that the money
was spent as intended. On direct loans FONATUR is often involved in the
construction process and has opportunities through physical inspection and
direct control of expenditure decisions to provide evidence of expenditure.
During negotiations, FONATUR agreed to require receipt of documentation of
underlying expenditures equal to or exceeding the amount of FONATUR dis-
bursements. It also agreed to place a limit on the elapsed time between
the date of FONATUR's authorization of the disbursement and the date of
initial expenditures by the final borrower.
2.37      (e)   Supervision of Subprojects: Intermediaries have the primary
responsibility for supervising indirect loans. FONATUR engineers and finan-
cial analysts however, are made available for supervision and technical as-
sistance on request for problem projects. FONATUR has agreed that more
emphasis should be put on supervision and technical assistance for its sub-
projects. During negotiations, FONATUR agreed to initiate a reporting
system whereby each intermediary would submit to FONATUR a written report
at least quarterly summarizing the status of each subproject loan, together
with selected data on occupancy rates, average tariffs, and financial re-
sults.  Direct loans are usually made to subprojects in which FONATUR has
an equity participation, and professional managers of these projects are
required to submit budgets and detailed monthly financial reports.
2.38      (f)   Loan Collection Procedures: Intermediaries are responsible
for loan collection on their subprojects and for paying FONATUR on agreed
schedules whether or not they have received anticipated payments from the
borrower.  For direct loans, which represent 15% of the total value of loan
approvals, FONATUR gets repaid directly by the borrower. Collections pre-
sent little problem for FONATUR: only Mex$l.9 million, less than 0.1% of
the loan portfolio, was in arrears on December 31, 1976, and this has since
been repaid. FONATUR usually agrees to the few requests for rescheduling
received from intermediaries or borrowers. It is often unaware when borrow-
ers are delinquent in their payments to intermediaries, but this weakness
will be corrected by the new reporting system (para. 2.37).
2.39      (g)  Accounting and Budgeting: Financial statements and summaries
are prepared monthly and submitted to management before the end of the next
month. Accounting and financial control are generally adequate. Though no
provision for bad debt expense is accrued, historical experience suggests
this is justified. Consultants are designing a system for dealing with an
accounting deficiency: the lack of a method for writing off capitalized in-
frastructure project development costs or for associating these costs with
revenues from land sales to measure relative profitability of projects on
an interim basis. FONATUR is computerizing its loan portfolio which should
facilitate the adoption of an accrual system for interest income and ex-
pense--an improvement over the present cash basis accounting for these items.



- 23 -
2.40      Budgeting within FONATUR is the responsibility of the Controllers
Department. Budgeting for equity investments is separately monitored by
staff of the Investment Promotion Unit. Annual income and expenditure and
cash flow budgets are prepared and updated monthly with actual data. New
forecasts for the remaining months are not regularly made. Since new ap-
proval decisions affect cash flow over a three-year period, FONATUR has
agreed to prepare and put into effect new three-year cash flow budgets
for each year.
2.41      (h)  Audit: FONATUR's financial statements are audited annually
as of June 30 by the firm of Mario Su'arez del Real, whose past performance
has been acceptable to the Bank. None of their reports on FONATUR's ac-
counts has had qualifications. Audited financial statements prepared by
auditors acceptable to the Bank, will continue to be submitted to the Bank
within five months after the end of each fiscal year.
III.  FONATUR'S FINANCIAL POSITION
A. Financial Position of the Development (Infrastructure) Department
3.01      Annex I, Table 15 summarizes the financial position of FONATUR's
Development Department as of December 31, 1976. The financial position of
the Development Department is sound, with adequate working capital generat-
ed from its operations during the period 1972-76. Total assets increased
from Mex$241 million in 1972 to Mex$2,261 million in December 1976, of which
82% (Mex$1,860 million) represented budgetary contributions from the Govern-
ment. Net working capital generated amounted to Mex$380 million in 1976
and the current ratio of 4.8 to 1 provides FONATUR with adequate liquidity
for its ongoing operations.
3.02      It is only recently that FONATUR has begun disposing of its devel-
oped land, and no income statements are as yet available (para. 2.39) to
judge the profitability of each of its individual tourism infrastructure
projects. The situation is further complicated because FONATUR has sold
land to developers in exchange for equity, valued at about Mex$45 million
as of December 1976. Balance sheet data indicate a significant surplus
earned in cash flow terms from the sale of land and other developed facil-
ities, increasing from Mex$18 million in 1973 to Mex$236 million in Decem-
ber 1976 on a cumulative basis before adjustments for cost deduction.
After writing off the costs of land sold and related expenses, however, the
balance sheet shows a deficit of Mex$124 million as of December 1976 (An-
nex I, Table 22). Such a deficit is to be expected since FONATUR's infra-
structure operations are in the early stages of development. Substantial
surpluses from the sale of land are projected during the 1977-81 period.
B. Financial Position of the Operations (Lending) Department
3.03      (a)  Balance Sheet and Capital Structure: Balance sheets for the
years 1974-76 are shown in Annex I, Table 16. Total assets more than tri-
pled from Mex$l.l billion in 1974 to Mex$3.5 billion by December 31, 1976.
Both loans outstanding and equity investments increased rapidly, reaching



- 24 -
Mex$2.3 billion and over Mex$l billicn respectively in 1976; these large in-
creases were funded by Mex$1.5 billicn in additional borrowings from Banco
de Mexico and Mex$850,000 in Government equity contributions. The Capital
structure on December 31, 1976 included about Mex$2.2 billion in debt,
Mex$l.l billion in equity contributions, and Mex$O.l billion in retained
earnings. The long-term debt to equity ratio of 1.7 to 1 is sound.
3.04      (b)  Liquidity: The current ratio of 4 to 1 and net working capital
of Mex$270 million provide adlequate liquidity for ongoing operations.  They
do not allow for funding of undisbursed commitments of about Mex$540 million
or disbursements on new loans without continued new borrowing and Government
equity contributions. The sources and uses of funds statement shown in An-
nex I, Table 17 indicates that disbursements substantially exceed loan re-
payments received because of increasing lending levels and unexpired grace
periods. Repayments received, however, are greater than principal payments
to Banco de Mexico.
3.05      (c)  Profitability: Income statements shown in Annex I, Table 18
indicate a mixed earnings record, with a profit of about Mex$20 million in
1975 offset by a loss of similar size in 1976 leaving 1976 retained earn-
ings at the 1974 level of about Mex$100 million. The loss in 1976 was due
to significantly increased interest expense on new borrowings from Banco de
Mexico (most recent borrowings at 12%) which were not passed on to borrowers
in higher interest rates and a Mex$10 million loss on equity investments,
largely in Nacional Hotelera. Gross income of only 5.8% of total assets is
due to low revenues generated by relatively new hotel investments and inter-
est rates that had not been adjusted since 1974. Administrative expenses
have been consistently held below 1% of total assets. Although the
June 1977 increases in FONATIE's interest rates will have little effect on
1977 earnings, profits are expected because of improvements in equity invest-
ment results. Operational profitability, and financial structure indica-
tors are given in Annex I, Table 19.
C. Overall Financial Position
3.o6      Since FONATUR's budgeting, planning, and recording of lending is
done on a calendar year basis, analysis of historical and projected finan-
cial position and prospects is based on the calendar year. Balance sheets
for calendar years 1974-76 are shown in Annex I, Table 20.
3.07      Both Development Department and Operations Department activities
expanded rapidly over the three-year period, total assets increasing from
Mex$2 billion on December 31, 1974 to Mex$5.4 billion on December 31, 1976.
By the end of 1976, 40% of FONATUR's assets were invested in the Develop-
ment Department and 60% in the Operations Department. Long-term debt to
equity ratio was a conservative 0.7 to 1. Current ratio of 3.1 to 1 and
net working capital of Mex$540 million are adequate for ongoing operations
but do not provide sufficient liquidity for funding undisbursed commitments
without continued new borrowings and Government equity contributions in
1977. Capital structure consists of borrowings from Banco de Mexico
(Mex$2.2 billion), Government equity contributions (Mex$3 billion), and re-
tained earnings which in 1976 showed a deficit of Mex$30 million.



- 25 -
3.08      Consolidated income statements show profits in 1974 and 1975 and
a loss of about Mex$20 million in 1976. Income statements do not properly
reflect Development Department activities at this juncture and hence do not
provide an overall view of the profitability of FONATURts activities. The
historical financial statements, therefore, approximate Operations Depart-
ment performance.
IV. PROSPECTS
A. Tourism Demand
4.o0      Mexico's experience indicates that the size of Mexico's tourism
and its growth depend heavily on the neighboring US travel market. Over 85%
of all foreign visitors to Mexico come from the US. The number of US visi-
tors going abroad, excluding Canada, increased from 4.7 million in 1967 to 9.8
million in 1975, an average growth rate of 9.6% per year. Until 1973 the rate
of growth was 13.2%, but in 1974 and 1975 the rate declined as a result
of the recession in the US. With the resumption of growth of the US econo-
my, albeit at a slower rate than in the past, and with the steep devaluation
of the peso in the fall of 1976, 1/ the growth of foreign tourism to Mexico
can be expected to resume, though probably less dynamically than in the past.
4.02      The present administration projects foreign tourism to Mexico to
grow at an annual average rate of 9% over the next 10 years beginning with
1977. This implies that the number of foreign visitor arrivals will in-
crease from 3.1 million in 1976 to 4.5 million in 1980 and 7.3 million by
1985. Although these projections may be an attainable target in the light
of past experience and the continued dynamism of air travel 2/, this report
assumes an annual average rate of 6% over the same period; representing an
increase in arrivals from 3.1 million in 1976 to 4.0 million in 1980 and
5.3 million by 1985. These assumptions may be conservative, but reasonably
so in view of the still rather unclear long-term effects of the energy cri-
sis on short and long-haul travel. On the basis of these assumptions and
assuming the average length of stay to remain at 11 nights, the volume of
foreign tourism to Mexico would increase from 35 million tourist nights in
1976 to 44 million in 1980 and 58 million in 1985.
4.c3      Foreign visitors' demand for accommodation facilities, however,
is projected to grow faster (between 7 and 7.5% per year on average between
now and 1981) than total visitor's traffic because the composition of for-
eign visitors is expected to continue changing in favor of air visitors who
use accommodation facilities to a greater extent than other visitors
1/   The peso was devalued from 12.5 to around 20 to the US dollar
in late August 1976 and has since fluctuated in the low to
mid-twenties.
2/   The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that US air trans-
portation will continue to grow much faster than the economy
in general, i.e., at about 8% per year on average up to 1980.



- 26 -
(para. 1.03). The demand for accommodation facilities by Mexican visitors
is projected to grow at a similar rate. 1/ The number of visitors that do
not demand commercial accommodation is projected to grow at a rate of 4 to
5% a year.
4.0o4     As tourism demand increases, new hotels will have to be construct-
ed and other facilities and services expanded. The Government has given
the tourism sector high prior-ity and plans to invest further in it. Much of
this investment will be channeled through FONATUR. The following table
shows the expected demand for and supply of hotels in Mexico over the next
five years. 2/

*1 Based on rooms under construction, FONATUR's hotel investment program,
and hotels expected to be built without FONATUR's financial assistance
(1,000 rooms a year). In addition, 400 rooms, or 2 per 1,000 are esti-
mated to be retired from supply each year.
**/  In 1976, foreign visitors accounted for 50% of the guest nights spent
in international class hcotels and 33% in lower category hotels.
For 1977 foreign guest nights are projected to increase by 7.5% and
Mexican guest nights by 12%, in line with estimates for the first half
of 1977. For 1978 and 1979 both foreign and Mexican guest nights are
projected to increase by 7.5% per annum. For 1980 and 1981, however,
growth rates are projected to fall to 6.4 and 5.9% for foreign guest
nights and 5.5 and 5.1% for Mexican guest nights; this is because hotels
are expected to be full during the high season, therefore restricting
growth to new hotel rooms available and to growth of off-season traffic.

These projections are consistent with the Government's determined efforts
to increase direct flights from major traffic-generating points to tourist
destinations in Mexico, and with the projected overall growth of tourism.
They assume a substantially improved utilization of existing capacity to
levels that Mexico has already experienced in the past and that seems to
be economically efficient (para. 5.07).
B. FONATUR's Infrastructure Operations
4.o5       With the three large projects it has in Cancun, Ixtapa-Zihuata-
nejo and Baja California and the development in Oaxaca, FONATUR has no
plans to open up new areas,. Instead it plans to consolidate its position
in the areas it has financed and developed by: (a) promoting the develop-
ment of superstructure and other facilities needed, and (b) investing in
extensions to infrastructure to complete the second and third stages of
each of the three large projects. Given the expertise it has built up,
however, the Government may rely on FONATUR to provide (as a minimum) tech-
nical assistance for solving the infrastructure problems that some of
Mexico's existing destinations are now facing.
C. FONATUR's Lending Operations
h.o6       The projections for the demand of hotels and other commercial
accommodation covers a five-year period, 1977-81 (para. 4.04). The pro-
posed project is limited to financing these facilities over a three-year
period, and only to FONATUR-assisted projects which would cover about 85%
of total needs. It is assumed that the remaining 15% would be built with-
out FONATUR's assistance and financed by other means or institutions.
FONATUR's projected lending program for the three years (1979-81) is
shown in the table on page 28. Assumptions used for the projections
are listed in Annex II. Total loan approvals net of cancellations
1/ This is consistent with the experience of resort hotels, and is part-
ly the result of a growing middle class, improvement in accessibility
to resorts from the main urban centers in Mexico, the introduction of
a five-day work week, and more recently, the devaluation of the peso
which has made holidays abroad more expensive. With respect to the
last point, expenditures of Mexican visitors going abroad decreased
from Mex$400 million in 1975 to about Mex$380 million in 1976, after
having grown at 16.5% a year since 1960, and at 19% per annum since
1970.
2/ Foreign visitors are estimated to have spent 23 million nights in ho-
tels and other commercial accommodation facilities and 12 million
nights in non-commercial facilities in 1976, i.e., with friends and
relatives. Included in the foreign hotel guest nights' estimates in
the table are 5.4 million nights spent by foreign visitors in border
town hotels, which are not included in Mexico's official tourism
statistics which cover only visitors to the interior of the country
(para. 1.07). These border tourist guest nights are projected to grow
at the same rate as those of foreign visitors to the interior of
the country.

for the 1977-79 period are projected at about Mex$6.1 billion in current
pesos, of which about 90% is for construction of 20,800 new hotel rooms.
This is an average 15% annual increase in the number of new hotel rooms for
which credit was approved in 1976 and is well within FONATUR's capacity to
handle, particularly with the expansion in staff that is planned. (Between
1973 and 1976, FONATUR financed the construction of 21,000 new hotel rooms
and the remodeling of another 3,000; para. 2.17.) The value of FONATUR
loans is expected to average about 37% of total project investment costs
and to elicit an additional Mex$10.4 billion in investment in the sector
from owner equity and intermediary lending sources. Very few projects were
approved during the first six months of 1977.  In May 1977 FONATUR had a
backlog of unapproved loan requests of about Mex$3 billion for financing
60 projects.
4.07      The following table shows the composition of the lending program
by category:

About 15,500 (74%) of the hotel rooms will be Category I and II, in the so-
called international categories. FONATUR hopes to increase the proportion of
projects in the lower Categories IV and V, but this change in emphasis will
have little impact before 1979, as the 1977-78 program is composed mainly of
projects already identified. Average investment cost per new hotel room
(both new and expansion projects) is about Mex$540,000 or US$23,500 in 1977
prices.
D. FONATUR's Equity Investments
4.o8      The table on page 30 presents a rough projection of FONATUR's eq-
uity investment program over the 1977-81 period based on estimated cash and
land requirements for new investment, projected receipts from properties al-
ready sold, projected earnings and dividends from existing properties, and
an assumed continued future sale of investment properties in line with an-
nounced policies. The 1977-81 projection suggests that FONATUR will make an
additional Mex$5.7 billion in equity investments and sell Mex$2.1 billion
from the present portfolio over the five-year period. Net earnings on the



- 30 -
portfolio for the period are projected at Mex$555 million.

4.10             (i)  Equity Investments: Cash requirements for the Opera-

through budgetary contributions, although some of the Bank loan funds may
be used for equity investments (para. 5.02).

1977-79 lending program  table on page 28) are Mex$6.1 billion, summarized
as follows:

4.12      The table on page 28 also shows Mex$3.6 billion (50% of the pro-
jected requirements) being funded by the Government through a continuation
of Banco de Mexico's annual lending of Mex$500 million in 1977 prices, and
Government equity contributions to the lending program equal to 10% of dis-
bursements of new loans. Government officials have indicated that this
funding level is feasible. Assurances were obtained from the Government
during negotiations that counterpart contributions would be made available



- 32 -
to FONATUR for carrying out its program,
4.13      It is projected that remaining funding requirements of about
Mex$2.8 billion will come from external sources and from net debt service
inflows relating to the new lending program. Projected external sources
are Mex$490 million in cofinancing (US$20 million), Mex$675 million from
IDB or other sources (US$25 million), and Mex$1,295 million from IBRD
(US$50 million).
4.14      (c)  Cofinancing:  NAFINSA is making arrangements to borrow US$20
million from foreign banks that will be used to finance FONATUR's program.
Terms on these funds are expected to be somewhat better than obtained by
the Mexican Government in recent borrowings. The loan would be for a period
of eight years with repaymernts beginning 42 months from the date of signa-
ture and at an interest rate of 1.5% over the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate
(LIBOR) on a floating basis. In addition to using funds from foreign banks,
FONATUR plans to promote cofinanced lending directly to some of the larger
subprojects.
4.15      Cofinancing has been secured in the form of a line of credit that
can be drawn down as required. Borrowers will take the foreign exchange
risk on the cofinancing funds they receive and will pay FONATUR an interest
rate equal to that charged by the cofinancier plus a margin, averaging 1%,
to cover administrative costs and bad debt risk.
4.16      While FONATUR would like to establish amortization schedules for
cofinanced loans approximating its own debt service repayment requirements,
it is unlikely that this can be done successfully because of the inability
of subproject borrowers to amortize debt in less than 12 to 15 years for
hotel projects. The Bank has therefore proposed to adjust its own amorti-
zation requirements to allow FONATUR to repay cofinancing loans on a
priority basis.
4.17      FONATUR expects to have positive net debt service inflows of
Mex$355 million over the 1977-81 period from new lending. which will help
fund the program. Based on 'FONATUR's new interest rate schedules (approved
in June 1977), average subproject lending terms are expected to be 13%
interest received by FONATUR, and 12 years to pay including a 2-1/2 year
grace period. By September 1L, 1978 FONATUR's interest rate schedules will
be adjusted up or down with :increases or decreases in the indexed average
cost of borrowing' funds by financieras.  Final borrowers would pay interest
charges reflecting, on average, the ACF plus two percentage points,
F.   Financial Prospects
4.18      (a)  Development Department: Forecasts of balance sheets, income
statements, and sources and application of funds for FONATUR's Development
Department are presented in Annex I, Tables 21, 22 and 23. Projections for
the period 1977-81, while ref'lecting the costs of large new investments in
Baja California and the urban area of Zihuatanejo, do not take into account



- 33 -
the income that would eventually be generated by these investments. In Ba-
ja California the infrastructure would not be completed until 1980/81 and
for the town of Zihuatanejo, the method of disposing of the land has not
been finalized. Furthermore, the initial investments made in the project
areas would also benefit the second and third stages of the project, but the
relevant revenues do not appear within the 1977-81 period. Even so, the fi-
nancial projections for 1977-81 indicate that FONATUR is financially healthy
with adequate internal cash generation.
4.19      FONATUR expects to sell all of the land developed in the first
phase of each tourism infrastructure project (Cancun and Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo)
by 1981. The department's net operating income would increase to Mex$315
million in 1978 and Mex$424 million in 1979. The department would show a
surplus of Mex$54 million for the period ending December 1978, increasing
to Mex$711 million by 1981. The annual rate of return on total investments
would be 15.6% in 1978 and 17.3% in 1979, decreasing thereafter to 1.6%
in 1981. After 1981 the rate of return increases again because of income
generated from the Baja California project and the second stage developments
in Cancun and Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo. Since FONATUR will incur relatively small
development expenses on these activities, significant cash surpluses should
be produced.
(b) Operations Department
4.20           (i)  Balance Sheet and Capital Structure: Projected balance
sheets for the five-year period 1977-81 are shown in Annex I, Table 24.
Total assets are projected to increase at an annual rate of 32%, reaching
about Mex$14 billion in 1981. Lending program and equity investment grow
at relatively similar rates, reaching Mex$7.4 billion and Mex$4.6 billion
respectively by the end of the period. Projected sources of funding for
future expansion as shown in Annex I, Table 25 include about Mex$3.5 billion
in loans from Banco de Mexico, Mex$3.4 billion in Government equity contri-
butions, Mex$2.5 billion in external borrowings, and the remainder from in-
ternally generated sources. The capital structure at December 31, 1981
would include Mex$6.9 billion in funded debt, Mex$4.5 billion in paid-in
capital, and Mex$1 billion in retained earnings. The long-term debt to eq-
uity ratio drops from 1.6 to 1 in 1977 to 1.4 to 1 in 1981.
4.21          (ii)  Liquidity: The current ratio and net working capital
position for the projected program drop steadily through 1980, reaching a
low of 1.2 to 1 and Mex$155 million respectively before improving in 1981.
The projections assume minimum funding requirements necessary to achieve the
desired program. The program would have to be reduced to maintain acceptable
liquidity if funding sources are reduced.
4.22         (iii)  Profitability: Projected income statements (Annex I,
Table 26) show small profits in 1977 and 1978, depressed largely because of
negative interest spreads on past loans. After 1978 profitability should
increase steadily as the result of higher interest rates and improved profit-
ability of new hotel equity investments as they become established. Admin-
istrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in 1978 and to decline



- 34 -
as a percentage of average total assets thereafter. 1/   Net income for the
five-year period is expected to generate about Mex$900 million in retained
earnings which will be reinvested to help fund the new program. From the
negative level of 1976, profitability is expected to steadily increase,
reaching 7.6% on equity and 2.9% on average total assets by 1981. Opera-
tional profitability and financial structure indicators are shown in
Annex I, Table 27.
4.23      (c)  Overall Financial Prospects:  Projected FONATUR consolidated
balance sheets, income statements, and sources and uses of funds statements
for the 1977-81 period are shown in Annex I, Tables 28, 29 and 30. The bal-
ance sheets show a strong capital structure and liquidity position. The
long-term debt to equity ratio remains at 0.6 to 1 and the current ratio
does not fall below 2 to 1 during the period. Income statements show a loss
of about Mex$100 million in 1977 due to relatively slow development of in-
frastructure land sales, followed by profits during 1978-81 averaging about
Mex$450 million annually. Of sources of planned funding for the five years
on-'an overall basis, Mex$6 billion (38%) will come from borrowings, Mex$5.6
billion (36%) from equity contributions and Mex$4 billion (26%) from net in-
ternal funds generation. Planned uses for this funding include Mex$6.6 bil-
lion (42%) for new lending, Mex$5.9 billion (38%) for new equity investment,
Mex$2.1 billion (13%) for new infrastructure development, and Mex$l billion
(7%) for increases in working capital.
V.   THE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT LOAN
A. The Loan and its Objectives
5.01      Considering that during the forthcoming years, credit in general
will expand rather moderately, while the demand for it may increase steeply,
Mexico's bank credit for the private sector may run short of the require-
ments, and therefore hotels cannot count on its demand for long-term loans
being met wholly by local banks' own funds. Similarly, lending by foreign
banks is not expected to be substantially higher than in the past. The fi-
nancing of hotels therefore has to continue to rely to a large extent on
FONATUR. However, given the budgetary constraints being exercised to stabi-
lize the economy, FONATUR which fully depends on government funding and
credit, is not assured in the next few years, of its required financing.
5.02     The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million would be used to cover a
portion of the foreign exchange costs of expansion of accommodation and other
tourism related facilities financed by FONATUR. The loan would constitute
less than 10% of the total investment projected for the period 1977-79, and
about one fourth of the estimated direct and indirect foreign exchange cost
of the program. Assuming all of the Bank loan would be used for lending
rather than using some of it for equity investments, it would amount to
/   This is after FONATUR empLoys additional staff to carry out the ex-
panded supervision and technical assistance functions that are re-
commended.



- 35 -
about 20% of the projected value of FONATUR's loans and would support the
construction, improvement, and remodeling of about 22,000 rooms.  FONATUR
will not use more than US$12 million of the Bank loan proceeds for equity
investments and direct loans. Similarly, not more than US$4.5 million of
the loan could be used for non-accommodation projects. In cases where FONA-
TUR makes investments and loan financing available to the same project, the
total amount of Bank financing will not exceed the foreign exchange cost of
the project, estimated to be 30% on an average. Furthermore, the Bank will
not disburse more than US$10 million equivalent out of the proceeds of the
loan in respect of subloans made prior to changes in the interest rate pol-
icy scheduled to take place by September 1, 1978.
5.03      The main beneficiaries of the loan would be private sector enter-
prises investing in hotel and other tourism facilities. The loan would help
the Government to continue to fill a critical gap in hotel financing by sup-
porting financially and economically sound hotel subprojects that might
otherwise not be implemented. The Bank could thus make a useful and timely
contribution to Mexico's balance of payments and employment. Moreover the
proposed Bank loan is encouraging additional long-term financing from abroad
under cofinancing arrangements.
5.o4      The Bank loan would be for a term of 17 years.  The borrower would
be NAFINSA, which would transfer the proceeds of the Bank loan to FONATUR
on approximately the same terms that it borrows from the Bank. Responsibili-
ty for repaying the loan through NAFINSA would be that of FONATUR which would
also bear the foreign exchange risk. The Mexican Government would guarantee
the loan. The commitment period of the loan would be two to three years.
5.05      The proposed free limit for FONATUR loans to subborrowers under
the loan is US$700,000 enabling the Bank to review approximately one third
of all FONATUR rediscounted lending projects for which Bank funds are used.
In addition, all projects involving FONATUR equity investment for which Bank
funds would be used, would be submitted to the Bank for prior approval.
While the quality of FONATUR's appraisal processes and the homogeneity of
its lending program justify this fairly high free limit, the discipline in-
herent in Bank review of the larger projects will assist FONATUR in more
rapidly achieving desired improvements in appraisal methods and more rigor-
ously examining potential equity investments.
5.06      Because of the difficulty of estimating the direct and indirect
foreign exchange costs of a number of small and large subprojects, the
Bank would reimburse a standard 40% of disbursements made by FONATUR for
approved projects. This disbursement percentage would be substantially
lower than the estimated average foreign exchange component of the average
hotel project. Only expenditures made within 180 days prior to the date on
which the Bank receives an application to disburse on a subloan or invest-
ment would be eligible for Bank financing. The Bank's normal 90-day limit
would be modified because in most cases FONATUR's double intermediation
makes it a longer process. Because Bank's financing would amount to less
than 10% of total investment, and because of the large number of small con-
tracts involved, disbursement for subprojects will be made against a certi-
ficate of expenditure, the documentation for which is not submitted for re-



- 36 -
view, but is retained by FONATUR and available for inspection by the Bank
during the course of project supervision missions. In addition, FONATUR
would be required to make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, for the
audit of expenditures covering disbursements under this procedure. The
terminal date for submission of subprojects under the loan would be Decem-
ber 31, 1980, the closing date for disbursements, December 31, 1981.
Promptly after completion of the project, but not later than one year after
the closing date of the loan, FONATUR shall prepare and furnish to the Bank
a completion report on the execution and operation of the project.
5.07      The proposed Bank loan will be repaid on a fixed amortization
schedule, adjusted for repayments to cofinanciers.
B. Project Justification
5.08      For purposes of economic evaluation, the investment program is
defined to consist of 20,800 hotel rooms to be partially financed by
FONATUR's 1977-79 lending program, some 3,000 rooms not financed by FONATUR,
and of all other related goods and services such as restaurants, local
transportation, handicraft shops and infrastructure facilities which would
be used by tourists staying in the hotel rooms to be constructed under the
program. The results of this evaluation is necessarily approximate as
there is no precise knowledge about each and every hotel to be built under
the program. Nevertheless, such information as is available is sufficient
to deem the analysis meaningful and indicates that the expected economic
impact of the investment program will be high. Based on an assumed econom-
ic life of 30 years, the economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated at
14%.  This rate relates to the economic impact of the last unit of the pro-
gram and therefore allows one to conclude that the size of the program is
more or less optimum. By being higher than Mexico's opportunity cost of
capital (estimated at close to 10%), this rate indicates that it might be
economically desirable to allocate additional investment resources to tour-
ism. However, in view of the uncertainties surrounding these calculations,
the present program's size can be considered as adequate. The question of
optimum size requires a more refined analysis, which needs to be done in
connection with addressing the related questions of whether the present set
of taxes, credit arrangements, and promotional policies is such as to maxi-
mize economic returns from tourism. Ideally one would want to determine
prices and occupancy rates of tourist facilities and the level of Govern-
ment efforts in promotion that are consistent with such an optimum program.
To enable the Government to tackle some of these questions, a market and
economic study seeking to gather and analyze the necessary information is
being undertaken under the Baja California tourism project, which has been
partially financed by the Bank (Loan 1420-ME).
5.09      FONATUR has agreed to carry out a screening of proposed subpro-
jects on explicitly economic grounds, as well as on financial and technical
criteria. Economic screening of most hotel subprojects, which constitute
small components of larger subprograms of hotels of a similar type, is most
efficiently accomplished by verifying that their revenue and cost structures



- 37 -
conform to those of the subprogram of which they are a part. The economic
analysis of the subprograms would ascertain the target revenue/cost struc-
tures, occupancy rates, and program's size. FONATUR has agreed that once
the economic study referred to above is complete (end-1978), FONATUR will
identify subprograms for particular regions and categories of accommodation,
and determine the criteria which will apply to subprojects. In the mean-
time, FONATUR has agreed to finance particular hotel subprojects which have
revenue and cost structures typical of those of the program appraised by
the Bank only if they also are expected to have incremental occupancy rates
of at least 55% and 47% respectively for international class and other
hotels. For subprojects whose revenue and cost structures are atypical of
the program, or whose investment costs come to US$15 million or more, FONA-
TUR will carry out a complete economic evaluation (i.e., estimate receipts
and costs external to the hotel which are due to construction of the hotel,
and the receipts and costs which are incremental to the economy as con-
trasted with the receipts and costs which are actually expected to occur in
the hotel). For the project to be acceptable, the resulting rate of return
should be at least equal to the opportunity cost of capital in Mexico.
5.10      The project is expected to generate substantial foreign exchange
even though half the guest nights in the facilities are spent by domestic
visitors. By year eight, the program would generate annual net foreign
exchange earnings of US$117 million. During the life of the investments,
such earnings would total about US$3 billion. The program is expected to
generate over 32,000 permanent jobs directly and another 33,000 indirectly.
Most significantly, the indirect employment impact would be on the handi-
craft industry, which is calculated to affect five million of the poorest
Mexicans. The ratio of investment costs of the program to direct employ-
ment in man-years (both streams discounted at 10%) is US$2,200 per man-
year, which compares favorably with the urban poverty lending benchmark for
Mexico on employment generation grounds. In order to pay special attention
to the objectives of creating employment for less skilled persons, and of
avoiding facilities which are overdesigned and overcostly for their target
markets, FONATUR has agreed to carry out an analysis of the financial and
economic impacts of appropriate hotel technologies and designs to meet
specific target markets.
5.11      Besides the impact of the proposed loan in developing accommoda-
tion capacity, the project is expected to have substantial institution-
building effects on FONATUR. The proposed loan will enable the Bank to par-
ticipate in both of FONATUR's major activities and assist FONATUR to expand
its operations and upgrade some aspects of its lending policies, criteria,
procedures, and practices.
C. Project Risks
5.12      The main risk in implementing the proposed program is a fall in
market demand. Such a fall would have to be substantial to endanger the
economic viability of the program. A reduction in the rate of growth of
demand for Mexico's accommodation facilities from 7.5% a year, as has been



- 38 -
conservatively assumed in this report, to 5% would reduce the economic rate
of return from 14 to 10% under the assumption that the same program is im-
plemented. It is unlikely, however, that such large an expansion of ca-
pacity will occur if the demand for accommodation slows.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached and assurances
obtained on the following:
(a)  that FONATUR will upgrade its appraisal proce-
dures of subprojects, including devoting more
attention in their appraisal reports to eco-
nomic, market and managerial aspects of subpro-
jects (paras. 2.27 and 5.09);
(b) that FONATUR will take steps to expand its
Operations Department's staff as required to
carry out its investment program (para. 2.27);
(c) that FONATUR will upgrade its disbursement and
budgeting practices and put more emphasis on
supervision and technical assistance for each
of its subprojects (paras. 2.36, 2.37 and 2.40);
(d) that audited financial statements satisfactory
to the Bank will continue to be submitted with-
in five months after the end of each fiscal year,
which would include audit of expenditures
covering disbursement under procedures satisfac-
tory to the Bank (paras. 2.41 and 5.06);
(e) that FONATUR will be provided with the necessary
counterpart funds to implement its proposed in-
vestment program (para. 4.12);
(f) that FONATUR will apply a new interest rate
schedule by September 1, 1978 that will be allowed
to float and on average be approximately equal
to the average cost of funds to financieras (ACF).
Final borrowers would pay two percentage points
above the ACF (paras. 2.31 and 4.17);
(g) that FONATUR will not use more than US$12 million
of the Bank loan proceeds for equity investments
and direct loans, and not more than US$4.5 mil-
lion for non-accommodation projects, and that the
Bank funds that would finance FONATUR' s participa-
tion in any single project whether in the form



- 39 -
of equity or loans will not exceed the
estimated foreign exchange cost of the
subproject (para. 5.02);
(h) that not more than US$10 million equivalent
out of the proceeds of the loan will be used
in respect of subloans made prior to the
change in interest rate structure scheduled
to take place by September 1, 1978
(para. 5.02);
(i)  that promptly after completion of the project,
but not later than one year after the closing
date of the loan, FONATUR will prepare and
furnish to the Bank a completion report on
the execution and operation of the project
(para. 5.06);  and
(j) that FONATUR will carry out the hotel training
and employment studies by June 30, 1979, and
consult with the Bank on the terms of reference
and the recommendations of the studies
(paras. 1.35 and 5.10).

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FONATUR'S OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT
FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS 1977-81
A. Operational Forecasts
Lending Program Approvals
1.        Approvals are based on FONATUR's projected program calling for
an average 15% annual increase in the number of hotel rooms financed.
Projections for 1977 and 1978 are based on actual identified projects ad-
justed by a probability factor.
2.        Inflation assumptions used were 32% in 1977, 20% in 1978, 12%
in 1979, and 7% thereafter.
Disbursements
3.        Subproject loan disbursements are assumed to be in five equal
quarterly installments beginning the first quarter after approval for
fourth quarter 1977 approvals and the second quarter after approval for
all other loans. As most 1977 approvals are scheduled for the fourth
quarter of the year, disbursements on the new program in 1977 are low.
Terms and Conditions
4.        All new loans will be made on the average terms for the 1977-78
projected approvals of identified projects, i.e., 13% interest, and a 12-
year maturity, including 2-1/2 years of grace. It is assumed that the
new interest rate schedule will be implemented for all new loans and that
the index of the average cost of funds to financieras will remain con-
stant over the period.
Equity Investment Activity
5.        New investment activity is assumed equal to FONATUR projections
of cash and land requirements for new investment. Sale of investments is
assumed to average Mex$200 million in 1977 prices each year, or 45% of
1977 sales, at book value to be paid in five equal annual installments
with 10% interest.
Borrowing
6.        Banco de Mexico--Mex$500 million constant pesos a year at 13%
interest with an 8-year maturity, including 2-1/2 years of grace, and
equal semi-annual payments of principal and interest. Cofinancing--US$12



- 74 -
ANNEX II
million in early 1978 and US$8 million in 1979 at 8.5% interest (LIBOR plus
1.5%) with an 8-year maturity including 3 years of grace, and equal semi-
annual payments of principal. Inter-American Development Bank or other
sources--US$25 million at 8-1/2% interest to be disbursed in 1980 to supple-
ment other funding sources. World Bank--US$45 million at 8.5% interest with
repayment conditions based on skewing to accommodate cofinancing repayment
requirements. Disbursements are a fixed 30% of FONATUR disbursements on
eligible subprojects with no retroactive financing. 1/
Equity Contribution
7.        It is assumed the Government will contribute equity equal to net
cash requirements of FONATUR's equity investment program plus 10% of dis-
bursements for new loan approvals.
B. Financial Forecasts
Interest Income
8.        Assumptions are actual on existing portfolio, an average 13% on
new loans, and 1-1/2% of average total assets for short-term investments.
Interest Expense
9.        Based on terms and conditions of existing and projected borrow-
ings, assuming no change in the indexed average cost of borrowing funds
by financieras.
Equity Income
10.       As projected by FONATUR less Mex$30 million a year in 1977 prices
in write-offs under the equity method of accounting for investments.
General Administrative Expenses
11.       Assumed to increase 15% in constant prices in 1978, and to re-
main equal in constant prices thereafter.
1/   Because of the current uncertainties related to the IDB loan, the
Mexican representatives requested the Bank to increase the amount
of the loan from US$45 million to US$50 million, and to increase
the disbursement percentage from 30 to 40%. These changes do not
materially affect the analysis and the recommendations of this
staff appraisal report.



- 75 -
ANNEX II
Provisions
12.       In accordance with FONATUR practice and historial experience, no
provision is made for bad debt.
Foreign Exchange Risk
13.       It is assumed that FONATUR will take no foreign exchange risk
on cofinancing. While FONATUR will bear the foreign exchange risk on the
IBRD loan, it is assumed that any costs related thereto will be reimbursed
by NAFINSA.
Appropriation of Net Income
14.       It is assumed all net income will be reinvested.

ANNEX III
MEXICO: TOURISM DEVELOPMENT LOAN
ANALYSIS OF HOTEL PROFITABILITY
1.        A variety of indiv-idual hotels were analyzed to evaluate the fi-
nancial profitability of current hotel investments in Mexico. Operating
results vary significantly from one hotel to another. Nevertheless, cer-
tain assumptions and estimates were made both to evaluate the likely pro-
fitability of future investments in hotels and to determine appropriate
financial criteria for hotel financing purposes.
Types of Hotels
2.        Hotels were classified by size and cost of investment in 1977
prices as follows:
Investment Cost
Number of          Per  Room                  Total
Type         Rooms          Mex$       us$    Mex$ millions  US$ millions
I            300        920,o000   4o,ooo        276.0           12.0
II           200        690,000   30,000         138.0            6.o
III          100        46o,ooo   20,000          46.o            2.0
IV           100        345,000   15,000          34.5            1.5
The categorization of hotels is closely related to the quality of facili-
ties and the prices to be charged, which are usually based on investment
costs. It is, therefore, appropriate to use the investment costs as a
basis for classifying the types of hotels for the purpose of hotel profit-
ability analysis.
Assumptions
3.        Operating projections were based on the following assumptions:
Occupancies: In keeping with the current experience average oc-
cupancies have been conservatively assumed to level off at 75% for Type I,
70% for Type II, 65% for Typeb III, and 60% for Type IV. These occupancies
have been assumed to be achieved in the third year of operations.
Room Rates: Based on the current experience of hotel operations
in the country, average room rates in 1977 prices have been assumed to be
as follows:



- 77 -
ANNEX III
Average Room Rates
Type                   in Mex$      in US$
I                       800         34.78
II                      600         26.09
III                     4oo         17.39
IV                      250         10.87
Although a 20% increase in hotel tariffs was granted after the devaluation
of the peso in September 1976 and another 20% in 1977, room rates charged
by hotels in Mexico are still very competitive in US dollar terms. Given
the high rates of inflation, however, the Government will have to be pre-
pared to review hotel tariffs more often than in the past so that it does
not put hoteliers in a weak bargaining position to negotiate higher room
rates vis-a-vis the tour operators, if necessary.
Non-Room Receipts: Sales from food and beverages, and other op-
erational departments for each type of hotel have been estimated based on
their sales ratio to room sales or total sales, reflecting the operating
results experienced by different types of existing hotels. The ratio of
food and beverage sales to room sales has been estimated to be 1.2 for
Type I hotels, 1.0 for Type II hotels, Q.8 for Type III hotels, and 0.6
for Type IV hotels. Sales from other operational departments including
valet service, telephone and other miscellaneous items have been estimated
to be 2% of the total sales for Type I and II hotels, and 1% for the other
types of hotels.
Operating Costs: One of the most favorable factors for hotel op-
erations in Mexico is the relatively low operating costs. Although payroll
and related expenses have increased substantially in recent years, the
cost ratio to gross sales annears to be relatively low  in the range pf
19-25%.  The daily average wage per employee is 100-156 pesos (US4. 3-
6.50). The average number of employees per room has been assumed to be
1.2 for Type I, 1.0 for Type II, 0.75 for Type III, and 0.35 for Type IV.
Food costs are estimated in the range of 33-40% of food sales and bever-
age costs in the range of 17-25% of beverage sales. The departmental op-
erating expenses and undistributed expenses are similar to the operating
results experienced by international standard hotels in other countries in
terms of cost ratios to gross sales, with the exception of relatively high
utility expenses. Despite recent increases in utility charges, hotels in
Mexico have been maintaining these expenses at reasonable levels, of about
6-7% of gross sales (see table on next page).
Capital Costs: Capital costs of hotels vary depending on the
amount of capital employed, and the terms and conditions of loans. For
purposes of this analysis, debt/equity ratios for each type of hotel have
been assumed to be 65:35 for Type I, 60:40 for Type II, and 50:50 for the
other two types. Long-term loans at an interest rate of 13% in current
terms for 15 years, including a 3-year grace period are assumed. Annual
depreciation will be over 33 years for building, 10 years for furniture,
fixtures and equipment, and five years for amortization of deferred expenses.

ANNEX III
Management Fees: Most of the leading hotels in Mexico are oper-
ated by hotel management companies, either domestic or foreign. For the
purpose of this analysis, Types I and II hotels have been assumed to be
operated under management contracts, with a management fee of 3% of total
sales plus an additional fee of 8% of gross operating profits. Types III
and IV hotels have been assumed to be operated by owners or under other
arrangements which do not require management fees for the purpose of hotel
profitability analysis.
Other Assumptions: Internal rates of return (IRR) have been cal-
culated in real terms for a 22-year period, including a 2-year construc-
tion period and conservatively assuming a real interest rate of 3%. Annual
rates of return have also been calculated in real terms. Annual reserves
for replacement costs have been estimated at 25% of annual depreciation.
Profitability
4.        Rates of Return: Based on the above assumptions, hotels can
achieve a satisfactory level of gross operating profits in the range of
30-40% of sales. The internal rate of return (IRR) varies considerably
ranging-from 3.3 to 9.2% on total investment and from 3.4 to 15.2% on eq-
uity, reflecting the impact of investment cost, capital structure, occu-
pancy room rate and operating cost, and the type of management. Similar-
ly, the annual rate of return (net profit/equity) varies for each hotel,
from 2.3 to 10.8% on equity in real terms in a typical year. The results
of the calculations, shown in tables 1 to 4 of this annex, also demon-
trate that the rate of return is higher for first-class hotels than for
economy class hotels, despite the fact that the ratios of gross operating
profits to total sales of the better hotels are lower than for budget ho-
tels. The results of IRR calculation for each type of hotel are summa-
rized below:
Hotels                               Type I   Type II   Type III   Type IV
IRR on investment
.with Management fees                 7.0      5.1        4.6        3.3
without Management fees              9.2      6.8        6.4        4.8
IRR on equity
with Management fees                11.0      5.8        5.3        3.4
without Management fees             15.3      8.6        8.2        5.7
5.        The rate of return is also sensitive to the debt/equity ratio
which affects the financial leverage of hotel investments. For example,
the Type I hotel which has a debt/equity ratio of 65:35 can expect to
generate higher rates of return on equity than the Type III and Type IV'
hotels which have a debt/equity ratio of 50:50. Using higher interest
rates, from 3 up to 6% in real terms, sensitivity analysis indicates that
the increased interest rate does reduce the IRRs for Type I hotels more



- 80 -
ANNEX III
than 2%, but reduces the IRR for other hotels less than 1%.
6.        For investment decision making, the IRR can be used as an indi-
cator to evaluate the best possible return on available funds among various
investment opportunities. Since hotel investment decisions involve a
large commitment of funds for a long period, the IRR is a valuable crite-
rion for the evaluation of hotel profitability. An equally important cri-
terion commonly used by lendlers and investors is the likely financial re-
sult of a hotel on an annua:L basis. Annual financial rates of return (ROR)
provide information on the dlegree of dividend payment capability and also
a measurement criterion for the assessment of the financial viability of
hotels. The above analysis indicates that a sound hotel project can ex-
pect to achieve an ROR of 8% on equity in real terms by the fifth year of
operation, which would enabLe the hotel to start paying dividends at a rate
of 6% on its equity.
7.        Break-even: Break--even analysis is a useful  method for provid-
ing the level of operation at which a specific hotel project covers its
costs during the initial year of operation. Based on the above projec-
tions, cash flow after debt service break-even points has been calculated
for each hotel in the fifth year of operation as shown below. Since re-
venue and cost assumptions, particularly in regard to room rates, and op-
erating and capital costs, vary for each hotel, break-even levels differ
considerably.
Break-Even Occupancy in the Fifth Year of Operation
Hotel                                 Type I   Type II   Type III   Type IV
With Management fees (%)              65         62         53         49
Without Management fees (%)           61         60         51         46
The break-even occupancy level is yet another one of the indicators to
measure hotel profitability. The demand and supply situation should be
carefully analyzed for each hotel subproject financed by FONATUR by size,
type and geographical location, to determine whether hotel projects can
achieve satisfactory levels of occupancy, i.e., 10-15% higher than break-
even occupancy in a typical year of operation. It should be noted that
in this demand and supply analysis average projected room rates should be
examined as to reasonablenes.s in terms of demand and in relation to in-
vestment costs.
8.        Debt Service Coverage: In addition to the profitability analysis
of hotel projects, another important aspect of the financial analysis is
to assess the liquidity of the project. Even if a hotel project is con-
sidered viable over its economic life, based on an IRR analysis, it could
fail if the project cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet its finan-
cial obligations, particular:Ly during the critical early years of opera-
tion. The results of operat:ing projections indicate that most hotels



- 81 -
ANNEX III
should generate adequate income to cover debt service starting from the
first year of operation (the year in which amortization of principal
usually begins) increasing to a debt service ratio of more than 1.5 in
the fifth year of operation. This indicates that all types of hotels in
the case study have adequate liquidity despite the fact that IRRs on
Type II and IV hotels are somewhat low.
Conclusion
9.        The above analysis of a representative number of hotels indi-
cates that well conceived hotel projects in Mexico are financially viable.
As indicated in the results of operating projections for each type of ho-
tel in the case study, international standard hotels with 200 or more
rooms can expect to attain relatively high occupancies as well as reason-
able room rates and will be able to generate adequate financial returns.
For smaller and less expensive hotels, it may be more difficult to
achieve high occupancies or room rates. These hotels are not strong
enough to compete with large international standard hotels to attract mass
foreign tourism and to a large extent rely on domestic tourism. Despite
such a handicap, these small hotels appear to be financially feasible and
could expect to generate substantial cash income.

ANNEX IV
MEXICO: TOURISM DEVELOPMENT LOAN
FONATUR's LOAN AND INVESTMENT POLICY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        On April 16, 1974 a Trust Fund known as the National Tourism
Development Fund (FONATUR), was set up in Nacional Financiera S.A. (NAFIN-
SA).  Its Operations Department is governed by Operating Regulations ap-
proved by the Secretariat of the Treasury and Public Credit (Ministry of
Finance).
2.        The new objectives of the tourism sector and the activities
which are FONATUR's responsibility under the Federal Tourism Development
Act make'it appropriate to clarify and amplify the Operating Regulations
by specifying certain guidelines and criteria so that the various sections
of these regulations may in due time be revised, particularly those re-
lating to financial operations, whether loans or investments.
II. OBJECTIVES
3.        The types of operations authorized by the Secretariat of the
Treasury and Public Credit are contained in Article 14 of the present
Operating Rules of FONATUR.
4.        The principal objective of the various kinds of financial oper-
ations is to promote the expansion of the supply of tourist accommodation
and the number and range of complementary installations in such a way as
to have the maximum impact on the economic development of Mexico and to
help both improve the balance of payments and create jobs in the different
regions of the country.
5.        FONATUR seeks to achieve this general objective through:
(a) promoting the financing by intermediary banks of
tourist installations and facilities by means of
rediscounting loans;
1/   A rough translation from the Spanish version.



- 87 -
ANNEX IV
(b) stimulating investment by the private and public
sectors through temporary, minority contributions
of equity;
(c) making loans, either directly or through financial
intermediaries, for the construction and operation
of facilities other than those for lodging but
directly connected with tourist services, when such
facilities are considered essential for expanding
and consolidating tourism supply in an area or
region with high priority for tourism development; and
(d) providing technical and financial assistance for
the planning, design, construction, financing and
operation of tourist accommodation and other
complementary facilities.
6,        Within the context of Article 14, and in accordance with govern-
ment plans, special emphasis will be given to operations related to channel-
ing domestic and foreign savings to investment in recreational tourism
facilities, or to assist enterprises in the tourism sector that issue shares
or obligations to the public, either through commercial banks or the stock
market.
III. CREDIT OPERATIONS POLICY
7.        The general rules and criteria for making loans and carrying out
the various financial operations are contained in Articles 14 to 27 of the
Operating Regulations.
8.        These rules aim to guide credit operations towards the implementa-
tion of economically efficient and financially viable projects that are also
consistent with the priorities laid down in the Tourism Sector Development
Plan, which aims to achieve a balanced growth of tourism activities.
9..       FONATUR will not approve loans to refinance debts, except in cases
where the outstanding liability is small in proportion to the total invest-
ment and the latter is not being fully utilized, and is thus not fulfilling
the economic and social objectives for which it was designed.
10.       The normal activity of FONATUR's Operations Department will
basically be the financing of hotels; however, it will also participate in
financing condominiums, suites, time-sharing hotels, apartels, trailer
parks and other kinds of tourism installations. Loans will basically be
made through intermediary financing institutions; however, when projects
are consistent with the objectives and priorities of the national policy for
tourism, consideration will be given to direct financing, subject to the
authorization of the Secretariat of the Treasury and Public Credit.



- 88 -
ANNEX IV
IV. LENDING CONDITIONS AND TERMS
11.       The criteria governing the amounts and characteristics of loans
are determined by the resources available to FONATUR and by the require-
ments of the projects.
12.       The maximum amounts of loans, the amortization period and the
grace period are laid down in the Operating Rules (Articles 21, 23, 25 and
26), and subsequent policies approved by the Technical Committee. Depend-
ing on the kind of project, amortization periods may vary between four and
fifteen years, and grace periods between one and three years.
13.       Rates of interest to the final borrower and the percentage for
the participating institutions (intermediaries) currently vary from 11%
to 17% and from 1.75% to 3%, respectively.
14.       FONATUR intends to simplify the interest rate structure.  It will
be periodically revised, subject to the agreement of the Technical Committee
and the approval of the Secretariat of the Treasury and Public Credit, in
such a way that an automatic adjustment mechanism will be established which
will allow interest rates to always reflect the Average Cost of Funds to
financieras (ACF).
15.       There will be no special restrictions as regards the rate of in-
terest and other terms imposed by intermediaries on the undiscounted portion
of the loan made from their own resources. However, efforts will be made
to provide the most appropriate terms and conditions for the final bor-
rowers.
16.       Should borrowers not fulfill their obligations, penalties will
be applied according to the policy and procedures laid down in the General
Securities and Credit Operations Act.
17.       FONATUR will make direct loans only for projects where there is
no intermediary institution, whether because no such institution exists in
the relevant locality or because the projects in question lie in areas of
new tourism development which are in the national interest to develop.
18.       The terms and conditions of direct loans shall be similar to those
applying to the final borrowers in operations financed through intermediary
institutions.
19.       FONATUR will promote the granting of loans in currencies other
than the peso for those projects, which on account of their size and loca-
tion, are in a position to generate foreign exchange. In this case, the
exchange risks will be borne by the borrower, while FONATUR receives only
a small fee for administering the funds.

ANNEX IV
V. PROJECT APPRAISAL
20.       For appraising tourism projects it is aimed to establish an in-
tegral system covering the phases of planning, design, construction and
operation, so as to guarantee the profitability and efficiency of the pro-
ject.
21.       The project will be subject to detailed appraisal as regards their
technical feasibility, demand conditions, economic and financial viability,
social effects, and the administrative capacity and financial solvency of
the borrowers. The assessment of demand must be supported by a detailed
market study of the tourism prospects in the region where the project is
located. In cases where the study has been carried out more than a year
previously, it will have to be updated.
22.       Cash flow projections, including working capital, must be included
as part of the financial analysis and must be used in determining the ap-
propriate conditions for the loans.
23.       Hotel projects which FONATUR considers atypical, after appraising
their particular characteristics, will be the subject of a comprehensive
economic and financial appraisal that will include a calculation of the
economic rate of return on the project.
VI. TECHNICAL SUPERVISION AND ASSISTANCE
24.       The financial intermediaries will be responsible in the first in-
stance for supervising the progress of operations financed by the interme-
diaries and discounted by FONATUR. This supervision by the intermediary
institution will cover all phases of the project, particularly those relat-
ing to the construction of installations and their operation and marketing.
25.       Technical assistance will be given to the financial intermediaries
in order to help them improve their appraisal procedures and bring them
more into line with those used by FONATUR. This will be done by establish-
ing groups of experts in the field of analysis of hotel loans and tourism
projects in general. In preparing and selecting these experts the advice
of specialized bodies will be sought.
26.       Technical assistance will be given to borrowers who in FONATUR's
opinion require it in order to help them plan their investment needs and
draw their loan applications.
VII. INVESTMENT OPERATIONS POLICY
27.       Direct investments by FONATUR, through the provision of equity
capital or subscription of stock issued by companies operating in the tour-



- 90 -
ANNEX IV
ism sector, will be made when they are in line with the priorities of the
Tourism Plan and if they promote regional development.
28.       In these direct investments the emphasis will basically be on
supporting domestic investors, so that FONATUR's participation will comple-
ment rather than replace their stake. These investments will be temporary,
and in most cases minority holdings. In associating itself with private
investors, FONATUR will aim to ensure that the transfer is made under such
conditions as to guarantee that the investment is not held beyond a reason-
able period of time. FONATUR's participation in equity capital will not
exceed a maximum of 33% of the capital stock, as stipulated in Article 24
of the Operating Rules. Cases where FONATUR is considering, by way of ex-
ception, a larger investment shall be submitted for the approval of the
Technical Committee.
29.       FONATUR will designate specialists to supervise the operations
described in the previous paragraph and their results, and will require
periodic meetings of boards of directors or technical committees.
30.       FONATUR must ensure that its loan operations are financially self-
sufficient by taking appropriate measures as regards the size and mix of
its loans, the duration of direct investments, the amounts of funds avail-
able to support loan operatiorLs and the periods of their availability, and
the rates of interest charged to borrowers. As a minimum requirement, the
Operations Department must balance its accounts each year on a net income
basis.
31.       FONATUR must maintain a system of financial planning and budget-
ing to enable its activities to be coordinated, implemented, systematized
and supervised. (In particular, the planning and budgeting system will be
used to ensure the sources of funds are available to cover loans which it
is planned to make during the next three years).
32.       Following normal financial practice, FONATUR in its planning and
its accounting, must set aside adequate funds to cover possible losses on
bad debts and direct investmen-ts.
33.       To assist in financial planning and in the supervision of their
operations, the intermediary institutions must submit reports not less
than every three months on each operation involving FONATUR: loan authori-
zations and disbursements, arrears, and such operating details as average
rates per room, rates of occupEncy in their client companies' hotels, etc.
34.       FONATUR must guarantee that the goods and services required for
its projects are acquired on reasonable terms in relation to prevailing
market prices, by means of requests for tenders and any other procedures
for comparing prices. At the time of authorizing each loan, FONATUR and
its client will agree on a disbursement schedule based on the construction
period and other important considerations. Before any disbursement, the

ANNEX IV
borrower shall provide FONATUR with documentary evidence that the funds
will be used for the purposes proposed.
35.       Once a year FONATUR shall carry out an audit of its Operations
Department using independent auditors.

MEXICO: TOURISM DEVELOPMENT LOAN
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Introduction
1.        Although the program to be financed by FONATUR and the Bank con-
sists mainly of accommodation for visitors, these facilities would require
public sector investments in infrastructure and other services. In addi-
tion, visitors would be using other facilities such as restaurants, shops,
and local transportation which will be financed by the private sector with-
out any assistance from FONATUR. Therefore, for purposes of economic eval-
uation, the investment program is defined to consist of 20,800 hotel rooms
to be partially financed by FONATUR's 1977-79 lending program, some 3,000
rooms not financed by FONATUR, and of all other related goods and services
such as restaurants, local transportation, handicraft shops and street and
beach vending, and infrastructure which would be used by the tourists stay-
ing in the hotel rooms to be constructed under the program. Although it is
impossible to precisely locate and categorize the program's hotels and their
ancillary facilities, there is a sufficient degree of uniformity in Mexico's
tourism facilities from one resort to another to make the economic evalua-
tion of the investment program as a whole meaningful.  Besides, almost 50%
of the hotel subprojects wit'hin the program have already been identified.
The project's evaluation wilL therefore be based on typical costs and reve-
nues derived from observations of a substantial number of such hotels and
ancillary facilities throughout Mexico and estimates of costs and revenues
of projects already in the pipeline.
2.        The net benefits of this investment program consist of expendi-
tures on tourist facilities and services by visitors who stay in hotels,
with the program, less the costs to Mexico of undertaking it, less the
difference between receipts and costs of tourist facilities without the
program. After the hotels and other facilities included in the investment
program have come on stream (i.e., after 1981), it is assumed that the
supply of such facilities grows in line with demand. 1/   The "without
the program or project case" assumes that none of the FONATUR-financed
1/   This assumption is reasonable since by 1981 hotels and ancillary fa-
cilities will reach occupancy rates that seem to be economically ef-
ficient and to generate for private investors attractive financial
returns to encourage sufficient investments to maintain the said
occupancy rates without any subsidies.

ANNEX V
hotels and thus none of the ancillary facilities designed to cater to their
clients would be built or services provided. Only about 1,000 hotel rooms
of lower categories, which are built every year outside FONATUR's own
funding program (represented by small expansions financed entirely out of
retained earnings or owner equity from other sources) are included in the
"iwithout the program or project case."  It might be noted that the calcula-
tions can also be used to judge whether the size of the program is more
or less optimal (para. 27), since the returns calculated approximately apply
to the "last unit" of capacity constructed.
Nature of Benefits
3.        The expenditures of visitors to be accommodated in hotels built
under the program are not fully incremental to Mexico, since the hotels
to be built under the program are likely to divert some demand from
existing hotels and also to cause lower prices (price softening) than
would occur "without the program."
(a) Diversion of Demand: As regards demand diversion, it can
be expected that some of the visitors would come to Mexico even without
the program given the already numerous and varied selection of destina-
tions in the country and the fact that some accommodation capacity would
not be fully utilized for part of the year (during the low season).
Revenues generated by these "diverted" visitors have therefore to be sub-
tracted from the program's total benefits.
4.        In order to arrive at demand diversion factors, it is assumed
that none of the hotels and other facilities in the program will help
tap new markets or help "create" demand. This means that the potential
visitors' demand for Mexico is considered as fixed irrespective of
what happens with Mexican tourist facilities and that a new hotel can
count as incremental only those revenues generated when other hotels
are full. This is, however, a conservative assumption--which confers
a negative bias to the ERR calculation--for two important reasons.
First, a new hotel is likely to generate some incremental traffic during
the low season since tour operators--who have considerable influence on
tourist's selection of the country they will visit--may commit themselves
to send more visitors to a hotel, resort or country during the off-
season, if the hotel provides more hotel rooms in the high season, when
the demand is stronger and when tariffs are higher~. Second, several
resorts in Mexico are in an infant stage of development where hotel
capacity expansion may be conceived as creating rather than diverting
demand from other hotels in the resort. These resorts with their own
unique assets are in a position to encourage direct air access from var-
ious points in the tourist-generating markets and to attract the interest of



- 94 -
ANNEX V
large tour operators. 1/ However, such infant resorts might still divert
some demand from other established Mexican resorts; nevertheless, an alter-
native assumption that no demand diversion takes place for 20% of the new
capacity is tested in the sensitivity analysis (para. 28).
5.        In addition to revenues generated during the high season, some
low-season revenues are considered incremental for all facilities and there-
fore are not included in the demand diversion estimates. This is the case of
some weekends and holidays when hotels achieve occupancy rates high enough to
constrain demand. Based on an analysis of daily occupancy rates of sample
hotels in various Mexican resorts, the following relationship between aver-
age monthly occupancy rates and the number of days the hotel is full during
the month is estimated:
Average Monthly              Number of
Occupancy Rate  (%)            Days Full
40 or below                    0
45                             1
50                             3
55                             3
60                             4
65                             5
70                             7
75                             9
80                            11
85                            18
90 or above                   26
6.        This relationship was used to estimate the proportion of days when
hotels could be expected to be full at various yearly occupancy rates for a
typical seasonality pattern in Mexico. On the basis of such proportion and
the expected daily occupancy rates, it is estimated, for example, that about
18% of low-season visitors are incremental at 75% yearly occupancy rate
(high season with 95% occupancy rate during six months; low season with 75%
during two months, 60% during one month and 40% during three months). Taking
all the above factors into account, the demand diversion factors are 28.5% of
total guest nights in the case of international class hotels (ICH), 2/ and
24% in the case of hotels of lower categories (LCH). ICH will thus achieve
an incremental (marginal) yearly occupancy rate (i.e., net of diversion) of
55% and LCH of 47%, as compared to average occupancy rates of 77 and 62%
respectively.
1/     Resorts like Ixtapa, Manzanillo and Baja California, and to some ex-
tent Cancun, fall under this category. It is estimated that at
least 20% of the project's investments would be located in these
resorts.
2/     ICH are hotels of categories AA, A and B; LCH the remainder.



- 95-
ANNEX V
7.        However, since prices and expenditures during the high season,
i.e., when hotels are full, 1/ are higher than during the period when demand
diversion takes place, 2/ diversion of revenues represents only 17% of total
revenues for ICH and 16% for LCH. In addition, the facilities from which
demand is diverted will face not only lower revenues as compared with the
'8without the program" case but also lower variable operating costs (variable
costs represent some 45% of operating costs when hotels are in full operation).
Diverted operating costs represent some 5.5 and 6% of total revenues in the
case of ICH and LCH respectively. Taking this into account, the net effect
of demand diversion is calculated at 11.5 and 10% of total revenues.
8.        For tourist expenditures outside the hotel on items such as local
transportation and restaurants, the same demand diversion factors are used,
as such facilities are expected to expand pari passu with hotels and the in-
crease in tourism traffic.
9.    (b) Price Softening:  Regarding the softening of prices, a capacity
expansion compared with no expansion will in general lead to a reduction in
the prices which could otherwise have been charged. A number of uncertain-
ties surround the relationship between prices charged for goods and services
inside Mexico and tourist flows to its resorts. This is why econometric
analyses of price elasticities of tourism demand pose intricate problems
even in the absence of the structural changes flowing from the energy crisis.
It has to be kept in mind that only a portion of total foreign visitors' ex-
penditures in the course of a trip to Mexico are incurred in the country,
the remainder corresponding to items such as the cost of international air
travel and fees paid to tour operators and travel agents which are retained
in the country of origin. In addition, large tour operators playing an oli-
gopsonistic role in the market might prevent Mexico from fully reaping in
the short run the benefits of higher prices that would conceivably result
from a lack of expansion. This happened in Mexico after the devaluation. 3/
Moreover, as stated above, some expansion of capacity (as in the case of in-
fant resorts) will create demand (tap latent demand), and price firming
rather than price dilution can be expected on this account. The increased
promotion efforts that come with a larger capacity also tend to stimulate de-
mand. Recognizing that estimates of price softening are subject to consider-
able uncertainty, it is assumed that the program's price softening effect
1/ Full capacity should be understood as somewhere around 90% occupancy
rate, since imperfect information results in problems to secure re-
servations at higher occupancies, a situation that turns potential
visitors away. Although it varies from place to place, high season
corresponds roughly to the November 15 to May 15 period. The rest
is off-season.
2 Hotel prices net of commissions in the low season are conservatively
projected at only 55% of the high season level.
3/ In the long run, this element plays a diminishing role.

ANNEX V
will represent 10% of total tourist expenditures, which are subtracted
from the project's net benefits. Only reductions in prices in the case of
foreign expenditures are taken into account since in the case of Mexican
visitors, the price dilution effect is more than compensated by an increase
in their consumer surplus. Alternative assumptions about this effect, in
which price softening represents 15 and 20% of the total foreign expenditures,
are tested in the sensitivity analysis.
10.       The combined effect of demand diversion and price dilution is quite
large. They represent a reduction of more than 15% of total visitors' ex-
penditures (including those of Mexicans) and around 40% of the program's
total net benefits once hotels and other facilities in the program reach full
operational stage. This large reduction reflects the big difference between
the average economic profitability of the current stock of facilities oper-
ating in tourism and that of the facilities forming part of the expansion
program. The ERR of the program without this reduction is also calculated
in the sensitivity analysis (para. 28). Such ERR provides an estimate of
the average economic profitability of Mexico's investments in tourism.

The level and pattern of daily expenditures are based on expenditure surveys
undertaken by Banco de Mexico for foreign visitors all over the country and
on expenditure surveys undertaken by FONATUR in Canc'un and Zihuatanejo for
Mexican tourists. The first survey indicates that foreign visitors staying
in all hotels (i.e., including a larger proportion of visitors staying in
LCH than in the project) spent some US$43 per day in 1975 and 1976. The
figure of US$39.9 used for economic evaluation purposes leaves some room for
the possible eroding effects on dollar expenditures that could have occurred
after the August 1976 devaluation. In contrast to this negative factor,
however, growing occupancy rates expected to result from a more favorable
demand-supply balance should push prices upwards over the next few years as



- 97
~~ 7       ~~~~~ ~ANNEX V
is already evident. For example, average expenditures per day in the first
quarter of 1977--at the time when hotels' occupancy rate rose sharply--al-
ready recovered from the dip of late 1976 as compared to the corresponding
pre-devaluation quarters.
12.       As regards Mexican tourists, FONATUR surveys indicate that their
daily expenditures are equivalent to those of foreigners when staying in ho-
tels of similar categories. The slightly lower estimate for average expen-
ditures per day for Mexicans is because they stay in hotels of lower catego-
ry in a larger proportion than foreigners. In fact, Mexicans represent 50%
of guest nights in ICH and 65% in LCH; but even within ICH and LCH one can
expect to find more Mexican visitors in lower category hotels. These visi-
tors' average daily expenditures are in line with the market projections
presented in the main body of this report.
13.       As regards the destination of expenditures, the above figures are
also in line with the prices of room and other hotel services used in the
annex on profitability of hotels.
14.       In order to arrive at total revenues generated by the program, the
average daily expenditures are multiplied by the number of foreign and Mexi-
can guest nights in hotels built under the project. The number of guest
nights is based on average occupancy rates of such hotels, which in turn de-
pend on the total balance of supply of, and demand for, accommodation facil-
ities in Mexico, and on the build-up of occupancy rates for new hotels (see
main text). During the first year of operation (1979) it is expected that
there would be around two million guest nights generated, increasing to some
9.7 million by 1984. As occupancy rates of hotels depend heavily on the
market assumptions made, a more conservative market projection has been test-
ed in the sensitivity analysis.
15.       Indirect taxes are currently estimated to represent on the average
4% of total visitors' expenditures in Mexico. A similar figure has been re-
tained for the purposes of this evaluation.
16.       In addition to expenditures of visitors, incremental charges paid
for the infrastructure facilities built under the program such as water sup-
ply and sewerage facilities, 1/ have been entered in the program's revenue
stream.  These revenues have been estimated at 7.5% of the corresponding in-
vestment cost beginning in the third year of operation. Since no operating
cost has been calculated, the revenues actually correspond to net revenues
yielding an internal rate of return on investments of around 6% which is

ANNEX V
broadly consistent with the operating experience of such facilities in new
Mexican tourist resorts. The weight of these revenues in the entire pro-
Ject's evaluation is, however, quite small.
Investment Cost Assumptions
17.       The relevant investments consist not only of hotels to be financed
under FONATUR's program, but also of other hotels and other ancillary visi-
tor facilities such as restaurants and souvenir shops and the necessary in-
frastructure to support the hotels and related facilities.
18.       As regards hotels, the average cost per room is estimated at
US$17,800, US$22,800 and US$18,400 in constant prices for FONATUR's 1977,
1978 and 1979 program respectively. These figures are expressed in mid-1977
prices and amount to 83% of the financial costs of hotel rooms. These fig-
ures differ from those used irL the financial analysis in that they exclude
interest during construction (about 6% of total cost), indirect taxes (about
2% of total cost), part of the- market price of land (about 4% of total cost
or half the land's average market value), 1/ and one third of unskilled la-
bor wages included in the construction costs (about 4.8% of total cost). 2/
Total investment in hotels is projected at US$410 million.
19.       Investments in ancillary tourist facilities selling goods and ser-
vices directly to visitors are projected at US$67 million on the basis of an
incremental net investment/sales ratio of 0.60:1 (with investments taking
place one year before the increment in sales and with tips excluded 3/)
with no allowance made for deduction to sales derived from demand diversion.
Sales are projected using a typical daily expenditures breakdown (para. 11)
and guest night projections (para. 14).  These ratios are consistent with
survey information on such facilities collected by FONATUR and the appraisal
mission.
20.       Infrastructure investments are projected at US$42 million on the
basis of US$2,000 per hotel room in the program. Since site development
costs are included in hotels' investments, these infrastructure works con-
sist only of expansion of basic infrastructure including distribution net-
1/ Most of the land to be used for hotel construction has little alterna-
tive use, which is particularly the case of beach resorts. The remain-
ing amount, which represents the opportunity cost of land, is assumed
to be equal to the discounted stream (at the program's economic rate
of return) of the land's annual rental value.  Any possible distortion
introduced by this assumption would be immaterial.
2/ In view of the sizeable unemployment and underemployment problem
throughout Mexico, shadow wages for unskilled labor are estimated at
67% of market wages. In the case of semi-skilled and skilled labor,
however, shadow wages equal to market wages are assumed.
3/ Tips, including those generated in hotels, are assumed to represent
3% of total expenditures in the case of both foreign and Mexican visi-
tors.

works. No major investments that would not be built "without the program",
such as new airports, are deemed necessary for the implementation of the
program.
21.       Yearly replacement costs, starting from the third year of opera-
tion, are estimated at 1.5% of investment cost for hotels, at 6% for other
superstructure facilities, and at 1% for infrastructure. These total US$10
million a year.
Operating Cost Assumptions
22.       The operating costs for hotels are derived from the financial fore-
casts outlined in Annex III. Two modifications to these forecasts are intro-
duced in the economic evaluation. First, unskilled labor is shadowpriced
at 67% of market wages, which represents a reduction of 5% of operating
costs; second, indirect taxes on hotels' purchases are deducted from operat-
ing costs, which represents a further reduction of 1.4% of such costs.
23.       Operating costs of other superstructure facilities and tips are
estimated at 75.2% of sales during their first year of operation, decreas-
ing to 62.5% of sales in the fourth year.  These ratios are based on the ex-
perience of existing facilities throughout Mexico. In the case of tips, the
economic cost is taken at 50% of revenues, under the assumption that for
some workers in the tourism trade, part of their tips represents an integral
part of their earnings, without which they would not work in the sector.
Internal Economic Rates of Return

1/  The present value of some of the cost and revenue streams discounted
at 10% is the following (US$ million): investment costs (506.8); ho-
tel operating costs (1,017.8); operating costs of other facilities
(581.7); demand diversion effect (288.8); price softening effects (125.3);
hotel revenues (1,602.6); revenues from other facilities and tips (971.7);
infrastructure revenues (23.5); and indirect taxes (105.7).

ANNEX V
25.       Based on these streams and an estimated economic life of 30 years
(no residual value is taken into account), the internal economic rate of re-
+1-r. (ERE) is J4).5%. The average economic life of the hotels built under
the program implicit in these calculations is 27 years, while that of some
other facilities is much shcrter, as they are replaced several times
(para. 21).
26.       This ERR which is higher than Mexico's opportunity cost of capital
(estimated at close to 10%) indicates that the program is undersized (at
falling marginal returns) and that not enough investment resources are allo-
cated to tourism. However, in view of the uncertainties surrounding these
calculations, the present program's size can be considered adequate. The
question of a program of optimum size is, of course, a much more complicated
one which would have to be addressed in connection with the related question
of whether the present set of taxes, credit arrangements and promotional pol-
icies are such as to maximize tourism returns to Mexico. One would ideally
want to determine prices and occupancy rates of tourist facilities plus the
level of government efforts in the promotion field that are consistent with
such an optimum.  In order to enable the Government to tackle some of these
questions, a market and economic study seeking to gather and analyze the
necessary information will be carried out under the Baja California Project
which is being partially financed by the Bank (Loan 1420-ME).
27.       In the meantime, however, FONATUR has agreed to incorporate in
its subproject's appraisal guidelines an analysis of economic viability
based on some of the considerations outlined in this annex. In fact, the
basic criterion in ascertaining subproject's economic justification will be
to judge if the subproject fits into the proposed investment program, i.e.,
if the hotel's cost and revenue structures are typical of those of hotels in
the program and if the prices it is expected to charge and the incremental
(marginal) occupancy (i.e., net of demand diversion) it is expected to
achieve are consistent with those of the program (the hotel program is to
be understood here, as throughout the economic evaluation, to include hotels
expected to be built in Mexico during FONATUR's planning horizon--currently
three years). In so doing FONATUR will bypass the process of incorporating
into the analysis of every hotel subproject the costs and benefits associ-
ated in the investments other than hotels, as well as the price dilution ef-
fects of capacity expansion, all of which would be part of a "complete" eco-
nomic evaluation of such subprojects. However, this "shortcut" solution
still captures the essence of a "complete" economic evaluation. In addition,
it would help FONATUR to focus on basic elements of the economics of the ho-
tel industry--prices, occupancy rates and costs--and encourage it to monitor
better the developments of the sector. However, for hotel projects that have
an atypical cost or revenue structure or are larger than US$15 million,
FONATUR will prepare a "complete't economic evaluation and compare the result-
ing economic rate of return with the opportunity cost of capital (estimated
at 10%). Also, FONATUR will have to re-do the "complete" economic evaluation
of the hotel program from timeM to time to incorporate whatever changes in
market developments oroutlook and in prices and costs that may have occurred.
In addition, not later than four months after the results of the economic
study mentioned above become available (estimated at the end of 1978) FONATUR
will refine the "shortcut" solution by establishing cut-off prices and incre-

mental occupancy rates by-hotel categories and regions. FONATUR will iden-
tify subprograms of,hotel projects by regions and categories, evaluate them
economically (in the "complete" sense) and apply the subprograms' cut-off
rates to the "shortcut" economic screening of hotels in such subprograms.
Sensitivity Analysis and Project's Main Risks

fits is presented in the following table:

29.       While the proposed program's ERR is not very sensitive to changes
in investment costs, it is quite sensitive to changes in operating costs.
However, the risk of operating costs increasing by as much as 20%, with no
parallel increases in revenues, is considered small. First, prices of tour-



- 102 -
ANNEX V
ist goods and services in Mexico have always followed the local inflation
trends quite closely, and in the future, it is expected that corrections
of the exchange rate will prevent Mexico's tourist prices going out of li--
with international prices. Second, the operating efficiency in Mexico's ho-
tels is not likely to suffer from the hotel expansion proposed--which is in
fact small for Mexican standards (an average of around 3% of total hotel
capacity per year)--as hotel management and other skills are already develop-
ed. On the contrary, such efficiency might well improve in the future in
line with Mexico's economic and technical development. As can be observed
from the Sensitivity Analysis table, a fall in prices (costs remaining un-
changed) would also cause a severe drop in the ERR. A fall in prices of,
say, 10% over the life of the investments is considered unlikely, however,
since the prices which are being used in the base case are quite low com-
pared with the standards of competing destinations abroad. Indeed, there
may be opportunities for Mexico to raise its prices, especially because oc-
cupancy rates of tourism facilities are expected to increase.
30.        The main risk facing the program consists of a possible drop in
demand. Such a drop would have to be substantial to endanger the economic
viability of the program, however, since if demand prospects for accommoda-
tion lag behind current forecasts so will capacity expansion, since the
Government does not intend to introduce any special incentives to maintain
the momentum in hotel investments if they would become unprofitable. 1/
In addition, FONATUR has undertaken to use appraisal criteria that would
tend to discourage investments where and when demand outlook would render
hotel subprojects economically unjustified (para. 27).  Financial and eco-
nomic profitability would therefore tend to be reestablished.  2/  Still, a
reduction in the rate of growth of demand for Mexico's accommodation facil-
ities from 7.5 per year to 5.0% per year would bring the ERR from 14.5 down
to 10.3% under the assumption that the same program is implemented as it
would take longer for hotels and other facilities to reach the occupancy
rates projected in the base case. On balance, the proposed investment pro-
gram can be described as of low risk.
Foreign Exchange Revenues
31.        The program is expected to generate substantial foreign exchange
despite the fact that more than half of guest nights spent in the accommoda-
1/   One should normally expect that Mexican entrepreneurs, as in the past,
will quickly change their perception of future hotels' profitability
if Mexico suffers a market deterioration. In some countries, however,
governments have responded to falling demand with more generous incen-
tives, thus encouraging investments beyond what is economically justi-
fied.
2/   The hotel construction program here considered can be viewed as part
of a readjustment process following two years of falling demand; hotels
are now expected to expand more slowly than demand over the next sever-
al years (hotels are projected to expand at 3.1% per year, as compared
to an increase in demand at a rate of 7.5% per year).

tion facilities are accounted for by Mexican visitors. Based on the project-
ed expenditures of foreign tourists (net of demand diversion and price dilu-
tion effects) and on estimates of a foreign exchange component (direct and
indirect) of 30% of investment and 10% of operating costs respectively, the
foreign exchange revenues and costs are expected to be as follows:

The program would generate annual net foreign exchange earnings by year four
that would reach US$116.7 million by year eight. During the life of the
program such earnings would total almost US$3 billion. The present value of
net foreign exchange earnings is about US$700 million.
Employment Effect
32.        The program will generate over 30,000 permanent jobs (of which
over 10,000 for women) once it is fully operational, around 60% of which
will be in hotels, 33% in other superstructure facilities which will be es-
tablished to cater to tourists' demands, and the rest in construction (main-
tenance and replacement after it is fully operational) and infrastructure
facilities, as shown in the table shown on next page.
33.        The ratio of investment cost to employment stream in man-years
(both discounted at 10%) is US$1,750 per man-year, 2J which compares fa-
vorably with the urban poverty lending benchmark for Mexico on employment
generation grounds.
_/   Incremental investments in the construction industry, estimated at 2%
of total program investment costs, are included. If employment in
construction are excluded, the ratio would be US$2,200 per man-year.

34.       In order to enable FONATUR to pay special attention to the objec-
tives of creating employment, funds have been included in the proposed pro-
ject (US$100,000) to carry out an analysis of the financial and economic im-
pact of alternative hotel technologies. The objectives of the study would
be to:
(a) identify the most economically efficient hotel technologies
for different target markets, paying special attention to
the objectives of creating employment for less skilled per-
sons, and of avoidingJ facilities which are overdesigned and
over-costly for their target markets;
(b) indicate if there are important distortions between the eco-
nomically most efficient technologies and the financially
most profitable ones., and, if so, in what departments of the
hotel these distortions have their greatest effects; and
(c) make recommendations upon measures to increase the appro-
priateness of technology, should the study indicate this problem.



- 105 -
ANNEX V
These measures might include, but not be limited to, changes in import duty
rates on equipment, changes in building standards for hotels, changes in
criteria used to classify hotels, formulation and publication of guidelines
on acceptable types of design and equipment for hotels of different vocations
and categories to be financed by FONATUR. The technological trade-offs to
be investigated would include those among floor space (and construction
cost), equipment and labor employed.
35.       In addition to direct employment, the program will have an indirect
employment impact. On the basis of Mexico's input-output tables 1/ develop-
ed in 1960, one could expect such impact to be of similar or slightly larger
magnitude than that of direct employment. (More significantly, an important
effect will be on employment in the handicraft industry, which in 1975 was
estimated to affect the life of some five million Mexicans from among the
society's poorest segments.) Thus, both from the point of view of direct
and indirect employment, the program will have a beneficial impact on the
life of Mexico's poor by generating significant employment at moderate in-
vestment cost.
Impact on Government Finance
36.       The investment program calls for substantial investment from the
Federal Government and its financial agencies. Up to the fourth year, total
Government's investments (including both fixed investments in infrastructure
and financial investments in hotels' equity and loan capital) are expected
to reach some US$320 million. The Government's accumulated cash flow will
only become positive in the eighth year--as shown in the table on page 107--
but will increase at a rate of some US$100 million per year thereafter to
reach over US$700 million in the fifteenth year. The present value of the
Government's net cash flow is US$344 million.
37.       In projecting this cash flow, it has been assumed that funds from
the Bank and IDB are untied to the project. The same has been assumed for
half the funds from private cofinanciers. Debt repayment has been estimated
on the basis of the loan conditions laid down in FONATUR's financial analy-
sis, except for the interest rate which is assumed to represent 2% per year
in real terms. Indirect taxes have already been estimated in para. 15. As
regards direct taxes, they have been estimated at 15% of gross operating pro-
fits starting from the fifth year of operation in the case of hotels and
from the second for other facilities. The return on investments in hotels
are calculated to be 8% beginning in the fifth year of operation and in the
case of infrastructure facilities, 7.5% beginning in the third year.
1/   According to data from Mexico's 1960 input-output table, the relation-
ship between direct and indirect employment in tourism is around 1:1.3.
