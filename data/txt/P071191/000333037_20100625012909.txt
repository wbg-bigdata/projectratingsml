F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The main objectives are to:
  (a) enhance the quality of life in the proposed cities, Ahwaz and Shiraz, particularly in
poor areas by: (i) improving access to satisfactory water supply and significantly
increasing coverage of sanitation services; and (ii) improving environmental, hygiene and
health conditions, as well as promoting reuse of treated effluents;


                                               ii
  (b) strengthen and develop the capacity of Ahwaz and Shiraz Water and Wastewater
Companies (WWCs), and assist the latter in improving their efficiency, sustainability and
financial autonomy; and
  (c) initiate sector reforms, particularly with respect to institutional arrangements, the
regulatory framework, demand management, as well as prepare a sanitation strategy.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background: The Islamic Republic of Iran graduated from the Bank's
borrower status in the early 1970s after the country prospered with increased revenue from oil.
However, in 1991 the lending started again due to the effects of the war with Iraq, debt crisis and
a large earthquake, all of which resulted in declines in income levels.

In the 1990s, Iran embarked on a far-reaching political, economic and social reform program. A
very broad spectrum of Iran's political actors and society in general had embraced the overall
principles and processes of the Third Five Year Development Plan (FYDP) 1999-2004. Complex
debate had centered on the speed, the dislocations, burden and social implications of the reform
process, in particular with respect to the planned removal of energy sector subsidies.

Achievements during the period of the Third FYDP were impressive. Iran had high foreign
reserves, practically no external debt, no major balance of payments pressures and a moderate
fiscal deficit. Growth had been robust with real GDP growing on a 6 percent average during
2000/01 - 2002/03, reaching 7.4 percent in 2003/04. Efforts to move from an economy driven by
state dominance and subsidies to increased private sector participation had some success, though
private Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and domestic investment remained low by international
standards.

Sector Issues. At appraisal, the main issues affecting the water sector in Iran were identified
through various assessments. They were: low water use efficiency in urban and rural settings;
limited participation by stakeholders in development planning and management; large needs for
rehabilitation and development of hydraulic infrastructure for sustainable water usage; problems
of pollution caused by the discharge of untreated wastewater into public waterways and aquifers;
and weak institutions involved in the sector and limited coordination among stakeholders.
Moreover, significant lack of sewerage infrastructure in urban areas, especially in areas where
water tables are high, was evident.

Ahwaz--with population of about 950,000 (in 2004) and projected to reach 2.2 million by year
2027, Ahwaz is one of the most important economic centers of Iran as it is located in an oil-rich
region and hosts a number of large industries. The Karoun River, the largest river in Iran, flows
along Ahwaz and divides the city into two separate drainage zones: the eastern zone and the
western zone. Karoun River serves as sources of drinking water for Ahwaz City and neighboring
cities downstream. At appraisal, 99% and 60% of the population were connected to public water
supply and sanitary sewerage, respectively. Areas without sanitary sewerage either used seepage
pits or discharged their wastewater in open channels, rivers or in open grounds creating health
hazards. Ahwaz at appraisal had only one wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with a capacity to
treat wastewater generated by only about 140,000 persons.

The pollution of the Karoun River is a major problem and a priority issue not only for Ahwaz but
for the whole province. The discharge of untreated municipal and industrial effluents, the
drainage from agricultural lands, and the uncontrolled discharge of solid wastes directly into the
river and its tributaries have considerably degraded the water quality of Karoun River. Available
treatment facilities have proved to be insufficient to produce adequate drinking water quality. At

                                                1
appraisal, water from well fields was being transferred around 70 km and blended with the river
water in order to reduce the concentration of contaminants and make it treatable. However, the
maximum water that could be obtained from well fields represented only less than 10% of Ahwaz
water demand and as such could not improve the degraded water quality to acceptable levels.

The poor water quality is largely contributing to high diarrhea prevalence that reaches 50%
during peak months. Out of the total gastro-enteritis cases in Iran during the year 2000,
10% were reported in Ahwaz, which accounts for only 1.5% of the total population.
Furthermore, estimates of water production and consumption rates indicated a very high
percentage of unaccounted for water--UFW (over 36%) due to poor conditions of the
existing distribution network. These situations called for urgent need for rehabilitation
and expansion of the water and wastewater systems in Ahwaz, especially considering the
fast growing population in the city.

Shiraz--with a population of 1.2 million (in 2004) and projected to grow to about two million by
2027, Shiraz also faces considerable water and sanitation problems. It was estimated that more
than 99% of the inhabitants were connected to the city's water supply network. Water quality
monitoring indicated that the water supply was of acceptable quality and in compliance with
national and WHO standards. The major problems identified at the time were the high percentage
of UFW (around 35%) and the need to rehabilitate a considerable portion of the network. Other
problems identified were the relatively low water quality (mainly high levels of hardness and
nitrates) of alluvial groundwater sources and the insufficient water pressure in some zones of the
distribution network. The total water demand of the city at appraisal was estimated at
288,600m3/day and was expected to reach 474,400m3/day by the year 2027. Although Shiraz
could supply its residents with adequate water at the time of project preparation, with burgeoning
population, the city was projected to run short of water and its capacity needed to be expanded in
treatment and storage, as well as in the transmission and distribution network to meet the future
water demand.

Lack of adequate wastewater collection, treatment and disposal were the main environmental
concerns in Shiraz. At appraisal, only 8% of the population was connected to the wastewater
collection system. Due to the high water table and low soil permeability, the use of existing
seepage pits has been unsatisfactory causing groundwater contamination. It was reported that
around 21 wells have been decommissioned in the recent years due to contamination, mainly in
areas where groundwater is relatively high. Significant proportion of the wastewater was
discharged in the seasonal rivers of the city or in open drainage channels that ran through
residential areas. During the dry periods, the channels became open wastewater collectors
emitting noxious odors, attracting mosquitoes and affecting the health of the residents. The
wastewater collected by the existing sewers was conveyed along Khoshk River that divides the
city in two parts and ultimately discharged in Maharloo Lake. The project was deemed critical in
order to improve public health conditions and to reduce the contamination of the water resources.

Rationale for Bank assistance: Past involvement of the Bank in Iran water sector had been
limited and fragmented. As a result, significant knowledge gaps had emerged. Opportunities to
reverse this trend were sought in the context of the April 2001 Interim Assistance Strategy (2001-
2004, Report No. 220050 IRN) through dialogue, leading to the identification of promising Bank
financed infrastructure projects in water supply and sanitation, and irrigation. The emphasis in the
dialogue slowly changed from a narrowly focused provision of commercial financing to a
potential strategic partnership in development as Iran was embarking onto a reform agenda aimed
at promoting growth in a socially and environmentally sustainable way and focusing on

                                                 2
competitiveness and inclusion into the global economy. The objectives of the Fourth FYDP and
the needs for implementation of the reform agenda had opened new opportunities for partnership
in terms of technical assistance and a lending portfolio aimed at well targeted interventions
focusing on integrating people, institutions and resources while combining infrastructure with
knowledge for the water sector.

Problems such as the unreliable water supply systems, the inconsistent quality of drinking water,
the poor performance of water distribution networks and the lack of adequate wastewater
collection and treatment systems coupled with rapid growth of population and expansion of urban
centers has prompted the Government of Iran (GOI) to consider water supply and sanitation
projects as a high priority. The GOI's priorities and reform agenda initiated in the third FYDP
and planned for deepening during the fourth FYDP was considered as an opportunity for the
Bank to use the large infrastructure needs in the sector to promote capacity building and
institutional development, and also promote reforms in pricing policy of water supply and
sanitation services consistent with the cost recovery objective.

Following the discussions that took place during the preparation of the Interim Assistance
Strategy, the GOI and the Bank agreed to adopt the main conclusions of the sector strategy note
which emphasized institutional reforms such as clarification and demarcation of the
responsibilities of the institutions involved; streamlining of financial policies; implementation of
a tariff scheme consistent with the cost recovery objective; optimization of investment; selecting
appropriate least-cost technologies; addressing environmental and health concerns; and
implementing an integrated water resource management. It was further agreed by the GOI and the
Bank that the abovementioned strategy would be implemented in the following three phases:
a) Phase I: Execution o f the water and sanitation investment projects for the two cities of
    Ahwaz and Shiraz (2004-2009) and preparation and initiation of sector reforms, including
    supporting the GOI with TA programs and studies covering the following areas: demand
    management, customer education, institutional reforms, the regulatory framework, tariffs and
    cost recovery, technology and investment priorities, sanitation strategy and integrated water
    conservation. A new tariff policy was planned to be drafted during this phase with WBI
    assistance.
b) Phase II: Execution of the water and sanitation investment projects for the four cities of
    Rasht, Anzali, Sari and Babol (2005-2010), launching of the studies prepared in phase I, and
    implementation of the new tariff scheme initiated and prepared in phase I.
c) Phase III: Implementation of reforms prepared under the first two phases. Investment
    projects were planned to be prepared for other new cities under an adaptable program loan
    (APL).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The main objectives of the project were to:

    a) enhance the quality of life in the two cities, Ahwaz and Shiraz, particularly in poor areas
       by: (i) improving access to satisfactory water supply and significantly increasing
       coverage of sanitation services; and (ii) improving environmental, hygiene and health
       conditions, as well as promoting reuse of treated effluents;

    b) strengthen and develop the capacity of Ahwaz and Shiraz Water and Wastewater
       Companies (WWCs), and assist the latter in improving their efficiency, sustainability and
       financial autonomy; and


                                                 3
      c) initiate sector reforms, particularly with respect to institutional arrangements, the
         regulatory framework, demand management, as well as prepare a sanitation strategy.

Key Indicators were:

          Unaccounted for water (UFW)
          Working ratio
          Incidence of water borne diseases
          Quality of receiving water bodies
          Number of water connections (% of population coverage)
          Number of wastewater connections (% of population coverage)
          Percent wastewater treated
          Km of water pipes rehabilitated

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The objectives were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The intended beneficiaries of the project were a population of about 2.4 million people, living in
two large cities, Ahwaz and Shiraz, representing about 3.5% of the population of Iran. While the
water systems were well developed and coverage was almost total in the two cities, sewerage
coverage was very low and the need to develop adequate sewage systems was urgent. Because of
the deleterious effects of the prevailing state of living conditions and the environment, the
construction of modern sewage systems was expected to generate significant health and
environmental benefits.

The implementation of the project would address the water and sanitation needs of the population
of the two cities. The topographic characters of these cities and the downstream effects of water
and sewage flow were such that the most polluted areas were the ones inhabited by the poorest of
the population. Traditional water-related diseases such as helminthes, hepatitis A, conjunctivitis,
skin diseases, and to a lesser extent typhoid and cholera were quite prevalent.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Background. The two cities of Ahwaz and Shiraz were selected for eligibility under the
project from a list of prioritized urban areas included in the fourth five-year development plan.
This selection was based on the criteria of existing environmental conditions, including important
environmental externalities going beyond the city's geographical boundaries, sewerage conditions
and threat to health, and progress in project preparation. The degree of pollution or pollution
threat was the main selection criterion.

Although the design of the project was realistic given the momentum of the reform agenda at the
time (which started during the third FYDP and planned to be further deepened during the fourth

                                                6
FYDP), in hindsight, the: (i) project design was overoptimistic (e.g., tariff increase by over 20%)
as the agreed upon tariff reforms did not materialize and therefore the financial sustainability of
the WWCs could not be fully achieved; and (ii) time frame was too short to complete the project
as designed given the lack of capacity by the Client, including lack of knowledge by the client of
World Bank's fiduciary procedures, in order to implement such large and complex project in five
years.

Soundness of background analysis. As part of project preparation, sector background was
studied, main sector issues were analyzed in depth, and government strategies to deal with these
issues were also considered.

The project was classified as Category "A" because of the construction and expansion of water
treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants, the re-use of sludge and treated effluents, the
potential impact from the discharge of industrial effluents, the presence of archeological sites in
Shiraz and the overall complexity of the project. The Environmental Safeguard Category OP 4.01
on Environmental Assessment was triggered. EAs including EMPs were prepared for Shiraz and
Ahwaz. OPN 11.03 "Cultural Property" was also triggered for Shiraz. The project received an
exemption for OP 7.50. Overall, environmental aspects were well included in the project design.
On safeguards, the project was socially inclusive as it was expected to benefit all consumers,
including the poor, and environmental considerations were taken into account in project design.

In addition, various alternative approaches were evaluated under the Project in terms of strategic
(public utilities or private sector approach); technical (number and location of treatment works,
on-site sanitation, alignments for the trunk main systems, method of pipe-laying, pipe materials,
and phasing for program implementation); and financial and economic (NPV and ERR)
principles. Neither the local legal and institutional environment nor the international conditions
were found favorable at the time for the jump-start into advanced forms of private sector
involvement such as build-operate-transfer (BOTs) or concessions as deep reforms needed to be
implemented in advance in areas such as procurement regulations, foreign exchange regulations,
banking, and labor regulations. From technical viewpoint, the option of on-site sanitation was
found unfeasible in Ahwaz and Shiraz due to high water tables.

For the wastewater treatment works, alternative treatment processes--activated sludge, oxidation
ditches, oxidation ponds and aerated lagoons, and site locations--were evaluated with the
activated sludge method proved to be the least cost solution. The comparison between the
different alternatives took into account investment and long-term O&M costs. Various options
have also been analyzed on the handling of sludge. For the wastewater treatment works,
considerations have also been given to conventional financing versus a DBO contract. It was
proposed to apply the DBO approach in order to optimize the design and to ensure proper O&M
of completed works.

Long-term development plans had been designed for the expansion of water and wastewater
systems and facilities in Ahwaz and Shiraz over the period 2004-2027. These plans were
formulated to serve a population of about 2.2 and 1.9 million, respectively, in Ahwaz and Shiraz
by year 2027. They were scheduled to be implemented in four phases and this project covered
works proposed under Phase I. The objectives and the components to support their achievement
were clearly connected.

Lessons Learned from previous Bank-assisted projects. The experience with the Tehran
Sewerage Project highlighted the need to: (i) establish strong project management capacity
through locating TSUs within government entities and WWCs rather than outside and to retain

                                                7
       institutional capacity within government institutions; (ii) plan and finance the necessary
       household connections to the water distribution and wastewater collection networks; (iii)
       familiarize the Borrower's staff with Bank requirements, including those related to safeguards;
       (iv) have an appropriate tariff scheme to ensure the financial viability of the WWCs; and (v)
       consider a selective use of the private sector.

       Risk Assessment. The overall risk of the project was rated as Moderate in the Project Appraisal
       Document (PAD). The ICR team agrees with this assessment. The PAD had identified several
       potential risks and mitigation measures as deemed appropriate at the time. At project completion,
       many of these identified risks had materialized. The table below shows the risks and mitigation
       measures identified in the PAD along with an assessment of the risks by the ICR team.

      Moreover, some potential risks were not properly identified and addressed, including:

              Project implementation delays that could result from lack of coordination in obtaining
               permits from the municipality and traffic police, and land acquisition issues, which
               resulted in long delays.
              Project readiness and feasibility of implementation completion within the project
               lifetime--at project appraisal, it was assumed that the design work carried out by
               consulting firm in Ahwaz--hired by the client--could be used. However, the original
               designs had to be changed and new designs had to be done--this needed more time. The
               Bank team had tried to encourage the Borrower to use qualified design consultants during
               project preparation. As such, the project team should have included the associated risk
               with poor quality design.

      Adequacy of participatory processes. During project preparation, meetings were conducted in
      Ahwaz and Shiraz to discuss the technical, financial, environmental and social issues associated
      with the project. These meetings were attended by the WWCs, design consultants, members of
      the city councils, municipalities, WWCs and various other stakeholders. The EMP public
      workshop discussions were well conducted, informative, and well attended by officials and
      members of the public, men and women. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and
      Community-based Organizations (CBOs) were involved, and the project had created a space in
      which elected councils (comprising in many cases active and committed citizens), individual
      citizens and the WWCs could enhance participation.

      2.2 Implementation

      The project was not restructured, and no changes were made to the design. The Bank conducted a
      Midterm Review (MTR) in October-November 2007. The main objectives of the MTR were to
      assess the project's original development objectives against a review of project implementation
      to date, including the factors affecting the achievement of the project's goals. In addition, the
      MTR reviewed the fiduciary aspects of project implementation, including financial
      management, procurement and safeguards, and agreed with the Borrower on the necessary steps
      to ensure the achievement of the project objectives until the closing of the loan.

       The tariff freeze took place as a result of a new policy by a newly elected parliament and government, after
      award of the loan.


                                                           9
During the MTR it was also concluded that the project objectives were still relevant and that no
changes were needed to the original objectives. However, after reviewing the progress to date
and future project implementation plans, the MTR team believed that a two to three year
extension of the closing date of the project, or some of its components, was needed to complete
the ongoing and planned works, including the implementation of the Design-Build-Operate
(DBO) contracts for the treatment plants.

Project implementation was affected by the following factors:

Factors outside government control or implementation agency

(i) Due to imposition of the financial sanctions by the US in dealing with Iran, Special
Accounts (SA) denominated in US$ had to be switched to Euro, and this resulted in delays in
disbursements and project implementation. In addition, these sanctions limited the ability of
local firms to submit bid securities which also contributed to delays in project implementation.

(ii) Multiple UN sanctions discouraged potential bidders from outside Iran, thereby limiting the
pool of competitive bids and leading to increased project costs. In addition, because of the
heavy reliance on local bidders, the quality and timeliness of many of the works suffered.
Finally, in connection with the sanctions the Bank put in place an additional system for
screening the purchase of equipment under the project (specifications had to be reviewed against
the list of prohibited items and entities identified by the relevant UN Resolutions), and this added
another layer of clearance which also contributed to some delays early on.

(iii) The decision by the Bank not to extend the closing date of the project left the project
(especially in Ahwaz) incomplete and under-funded as a result of which the project objectives
could not be fully achieved. Although the Bank believed at the MTR that a two to three year
extension of the closing date was needed to complete the ongoing and planned works, the Bank
did not grant a closing date extension nor did it communicate this decision to the
borrower with enough advance notice for them to make proper transition arrangements. In
sum, the Bank did not use all the tools at its disposal--including extending the closing date of the
project--to ensure full achievement of the project development objectives.

(iv) Following the civil unrest of June 2009, travel restrictions were put in place, and the task
team was unable to conduct supervision missions during the last few months of the project's life.
This travel restriction limited the task team's ability to provide timely support to the project on
the ground, and the Bank's technical and fiduciary supervision during this time relied on reports
provided by the Borrower.

Factors subject to government control or implementation agency

(i) Shortfall in project financing. Because of cost-overruns due to increased construction and
material costs, underestimation of project costs at appraisal, the project faced a significant
shortfall in project financing, especially in Ahwaz. In order to fulfill the minimum objectives
stated at appraisal, more funding was required from the government to finance the
implementation of priority projects already identified.

(ii) Delays in counterpart funding. Availability of counterpart funding was another contributing
cause for implementation delays. Shortfall in the allocation of the government counterpart


                                                10
contributions, particularly for the wastewater packages, had a negative impact on the project's
cash flow.

(iii) Municipality and traffic police permits. Obtaining permits from municipalities and traffic
police was a persistent issue both in Ahwaz and Shiraz and a cause of delay for the
implementation of the contracts awarded.

(iv) Change in designs. In Ahwaz, implementation was slow because of change in designs due to
poor quality of original design during project preparation, increase in costs, weak oversight and
management of contracts.

(v) High turnover of staff in the Ahwaz TSU and weakness in the ability of the AWWC's
technical department to provide adequate support affected project implementation.

(vi) Low tariff and lack of tariff adjustment. Both SWWC and AWWC were not able to achieve
the levels of financial performance that was projected during project preparation. This was mainly
due to the fact that the original financial projections for them relied on substantial increases in
tariffs from 2005 onwards, which did not materialize due to a shift in the newly elected
government's policy.

(vii) Procurement delays. Delays in the procurement of the major packages and weak oversight
within the AWWC management (especially for contract management) affected the overall
progress of implementation.

(viii) Weak capacity of the consultant. The original consultants of the project (especially in
Ahwaz) were of low capacity to handle the workload increase as the result of the Loan. However,
since selection of new consultants was time consuming, the original consultants were used to
their capacity at the beginning. Eventually new consultants were selected for some of the tasks
including DBO of treatment plants, detail design and supervision of water and wastewater works
as improvements and changes in design were required midway through project implementation.
The most notable change was the requirement to construct a new water treatment plant in Ahwaz
instead of rehabilitation of the existing one due to: (a) cost estimate of rehabilitation was almost
the same as the cost of new construction, and (b) rehabilitating the existing water treatment plant
would have required shutting down the plant, which in the absence of alternative sources of water
for the population was found unfeasible.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. This project was prepared before the World Bank implemented a more rigorous
approach towards the M&E of its programs. As such the design of M&E has some limitations,
including the selection of appropriate indicators and target values to track the achievement of
PDOs and intermediate outcome indicators. That said, the project supported arrangements for
M&E performance indicators, including population coverage of water supply and sanitation
services; quantity of wastewater treated and quality of receiving water bodies; level of recovery
of costs of operation and maintenance (O&M) and capital expenditures, as measured by the
working ratio; and UFW.

Appropriate indicators are missing to track the level of achievement of the project under some
components. For example, provision of water supply and sanitation services to the poor has been
indicated in the PDO, and there should have been some indicator to track the achievement of this


                                                11
objective. Similarly, the inclusion of incidence of water borne disease as one of the PDO
indicators proved difficult in terms of easily establishing the baseline data and tracking its
achievements over time. The use of quality of receiving water bodies as one of the PDO
indicators also proved difficult as many other pollution sources (industrial waste, agricultural
runoff and solid waste) also affect the quality of receiving water bodies and improvements in the
water quality of such large water bodies may not be significant and could take longer (beyond the
project's life), and therefore this may not have been an appropriate indicator under such situation.
A simpler indicator (e.g., few water quality parameters) at appropriate locations to track water
quality improvements (attributable to the project) could have been established.

The M&E design also lacked adequate targets for some indicators in order to enable tracking the
level of project achievement. For example, indicators such as incidence of water borne disease
and quality of receiving water bodies did not have adequate targets against which project
performances could be measured. Similarly, for some of its indicators, the M&E design did not
have adequate baseline data established at the beginning of project implementation. The team
clearly communicated with the implementing agencies to facilitate establishment of baseline data
and continued monitoring of the indicators.

M&E implementation. TSUs were regularly collecting most of the data according to the
indicators developed during project preparation. These data were closely monitored and the actual
figures were compared with the target values. For example, data on unaccounted for water,
number of water and wastewater connections, working ratio, percentage of wastewater treated
and length of water pipes rehabilitated were monitored and analyzed.

M&E utilization. Appropriate data collected from quarterly reports of indicators was evaluated
and used for decision making on project activities. For example, prioritization of activities was
made based on the data collected by the TSUs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard issues. An environmental assessment was prepared for the project, including
preparation of the EMP, which was adhered to during project implementation. The environmental
impact of the investments was generally positive and there were no compliance issues in both
Ahwaz and Shiraz. In addition, several resettlement/land acquisition reviews were also carried out
during implementation. Land Acquisition Plans (LAPs) were prepared wherever land
expropriations were involved. In addition, wherever resettlement of people, including
displacement of livelihoods, was involved, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared. For
example, in Ahwaz, the land for pumping station (AS23-1) located on Jomhori Boulevard (with
surface area 800 sq. m) was a residential house that belonged to two individual owners and
agreement with them was reached, a down payment was paid, and the property was expropriated.
Since the deal involved resettlement of at least eight individuals, an abbreviated Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP) was prepared.

Safeguard Policy (OP 4.11) for cultural heritage sites was triggered for the project given Shiraz's
historic value in Iran. The Shiraz WWC engaged the Department of Cultural Heritage from the
beginning and shared with them the detailed map of the project. Upon careful review of the
Project's map, the Department of Cultural Heritage gave permission indicating that the project in
no way would be harmful to historic sites within or around the city.

Fiduciary issues. Despite several trainings offered in relevant subjects and hiring of an
international consultant to assist with building capacity, procurement was very slow in Ahwaz at

                                                12
the beginning of the project. The procurement activity in Ahwaz only picked up after two years
into the project, when the new qualified procurement staff was recruited. Also the differences
between local regulations and Bank guidelines, delayed the preparation of first set of bidding
documents in both Ahwaz and Shiraz. There were also delays in providing counterpart funding,
which resulted in protracted delays in paying contractors and hence delayed progress of
implementation at both Ahwaz and Shiraz.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(a) Transition arrangements. Projects under similar conditions would normally get extension of
closing date to ensure full achievement of the PDO. However, in the case of Iran, despite earlier
assessment at the MTR by the Bank that the Project needed two to three year extension of closing
date, the Project came to closure unexpectedly leaving many critical components of the project
incomplete. As such no specific transition arrangements are in place. However, up until the time of
this ICR preparation, project implementation has continued without any significant problems--
implementation of major contracts signed during the last phase of the project life such as WWTP
DBOs and pumping stations are ongoing. The ICR team has requested from the Government a plan
of action on how it plans to complete the project, including funding and timeline of project
implementation. Unfortunately, the Borrower did not send us this information in time to attach it to
the ICR. With proper financial support, it may take about three years for the new DBO contracts to
be completed and made operational. Shiraz has new wells, providing good quality water, and the
network has been completed, and the Shiraz WWC will be responsible for maintaining the network.
In Ahwaz, the water network is not yet completed. In Shiraz the sewerage network is completed
while in Ahwaz work was still ongoing.

       Institutional. Staffing and management will be provided by the AWWC and SWWC for
        regular operations.

       Financial. The Council has now approved a "targeted subsidies law" which might help
        alleviate the tariff issue. This law calls for full coverage of O&M costs and eventually
        paying for full cost of water, to be implemented over a period of time. This law will also
        provide a targeted subsidy to low-income families, but charge full cost from those who
        can afford to pay.

(b) List of performance indicators. Same set of indicators used during project implementation
will continue to be used after project closure. However, both AWWC and SWWC could include
the poverty dimension on top of existing indicators to assess the impacts of their projects on
poorer segments of the society. AWWC and SWWC may also simplify the indicators to track
quality of receiving water bodies by selecting appropriate and simpler indicators that are easy to
track.

(c) Future Impact Evaluation. As the baseline survey on health was already done in 2008, it will
be important to conduct an impact evaluation on health and environment jointly a year after the
sewerage system has been in place and fully operational, including all house connections,
pumping stations and WWTPs. Based on how the Borrower plans to complete the remaining
project activities, impact evaluation could take place three to five years from now. Likewise, it
will be important to have an impact evaluation of the financial sustainability of Ahwaz and Shiraz
WWCs after the sewerage system has been in place and fully functional.




                                               13
(d) Studies. The project supported a `diagnostic and performance improvement study' for the two
WWCs in order to help the Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs review their performance and draw up a
business plan for their improvement. After protracted delay of implementation, the study was
contracted to an international consulting firm in early 2009. However, after the firm delivered its
inception report, due to travel restrictions to Iran, the company could not travel to Iran and
continue its work, and the contract was eventually cancelled. As the study, if implemented
properly, will have a positive impact on the companies' performance, the companies are highly
encouraged to continue with this study.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives  of providing more water and sanitation services to more people, especially with
the focus on the poor; improving the efficiency, sustainability and financial autonomy of the
implementing agencies; and preparing for next steps to implement wider sector reforms - are still
clear, relevant, and important to Iran's economic and social development. They are also timely
and appropriate to the current needs of the country's water sector. For example, modern sewerage
system will have direct benefits for those who are most exposed to contaminated runoff and
uncollected sewerage.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Unsatisfactory.

As demonstrated below, the project has many achievements to its credit, such as the reduction of
UFW, increase in the number of water and wastewater connections, rehabilitation of water pipes,
construction of reservoirs and wells, and construction of sludge storage tanks for the existing
WWTPs in Shiraz. Similarly, in Ahwaz the project achieved an increase in the number of water
and wastewater connections, rehabilitation of water pipes and WWTP in Choinebeh, and
construction of the majority of sewerage networks and some pumping stations. In addition, the
capacity of both SWCC and AWCC has been considerably strengthened because of the project.

The project was however not fully successful in achieving its development objectives. For
example, the UFW while improved in Shiraz has deteriorated in Ahwaz; working ratio and hence
financial sustainability of both Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs has significantly deteriorated; quality of
receiving water bodies has not improved; and critical components of the project, including
treatment plants, pumping stations and pipes are either incomplete or under construction and not
fully operational. As such some critical targets of PDOs indicators have not been fully met at the
time of project closing date.

Lack of completion of the project as envisaged at the project design will disproportionately affect
the poorer segments of the society as the majority of the remaining components of the project (in
both Ahwaz and Shiraz) are located within these clusters of communities--mainly because the
project by design has focused on poorer clusters--further undermining the realization of the
project development objectives.




                                                14
The details of the project's achievements are as follows:

A. Shiraz sub-project
 (i) Improving access to satisfactory water supply and significantly increasing coverage of
sanitation services
       The percentage of UFW has been reduced to 25%, compared to the baseline value of 30%
        and target value of 27%.
       Number of water connections has increased by 147,021 new connections, compared to
        the target of 22,000 connections.
       Number of wastewater connections has increased by 119,313, compared to the target of
        50,000 new connections.
       All 235 km of water pipes targeted at appraisal was rehabilitated.
       20 wells were drilled, each producing on average about 50 l/s, compared to the target of
        17 wells.
       Construction of one 3000 m3 reservoir is completed and operational and the other two is
        progressing, compared to a target of four reservoirs. Construction of one remaining
        reservoir is being financed by the SWWC.
       Construction of 30.5 km of wastewater trunk mains is complete, compared the target of
        95km.
       Construction of 556 km of laterals and interceptors has been completed, compared to a
        target of 740 km.
       All 32 sludge storage tanks have been completed.
       Construction of two modules of WWTP with total capacity of 100,000m3/day has started,
        compared to a target of completing two modules of WWTP.


(ii) Improving environmental, hygiene and health conditions.
    Health and hygiene: The project has facilitated in increasing the public access to safe potable
    water. In addition, after the completion of several storage tanks as well as the rehabilitation
    and development of the network, some of which are under construction, water quality and
    network pressure will be enhanced and water shortage and UFW will be reduced, resulting in
    a better quality of life.



    As for wastewater system, given the project's incomplete status, currently the only benefit
    that can be attributed to the project is the marginal improvement in the percentage of
    wastewater treated due to rehabilitation of the existing WWTP and wastewater connection
    from houses to this WWTP (which improved percent wastewater treated in Shiraz from 10%
    to 25%, compared to 60% target). Such improvements in the percent wastewater treated
    should improve the environmental quality of the receiving water bodies and also the quality
    of irrigation water from these water bodies--making reuse of treated effluents a viable water

                                                15
    source. That said, provided that the Borrower timely finances the remaining components of
    the project and the wastewater system becomes fully operational, the targets set at the project
    design could be met. At this point however, all the targets at the project design remain future
    targets at best.



    A health study about the water borne diseases among children 6-60 months was done in
    2007-2008 in selected areas in the city to assess the projects effects on health conditions. As a
    follow-up study has not been done at project closing, it is not possible to assess the impact of
    the project in reducing water borne diseases.


    Quality of receiving water bodies: baseline date has been established and a monitoring
    of natural water bodies is under progress. So far, test results of 25 rounds of analyses of water
    quality has shown no appreciable improvement of water qualities of water bodies, which is
    not surprising given that WWTPs are yet in place and fully operational.



(iii) Promoting reuse of treated effluents.
Based on the existing plan, the main part of treated wastewater will be used in agriculture, which
compensates water shortage for agriculture uses and helps the extension of agricultural activities.
In addition, a part of the treated wastewater can be discharged to the Maharloo Lake which has a
key role for supplying its environmental flow. Produced sludge will be used as fertilizer and
conditioner in agricultural lands. However, as it stands now, most of these activities have not
been accomplished under the project, and therefore this objective has not been fully achieved.

B. Ahwaz sub-project
(a) Enhancing the quality of life in Ahwaz.
(i) Improving access to satisfactory water supply and significantly increasing coverage of
sanitation services
       The percentage of UFW has increased to 40, compared the baseline value of 36.3 and the
        target value of 27%--indicating that the water supply system in Ahwaz has deteriorated
        over the project lifetime.
       Number of water connections has increased by additional 79,853 new connections,
        compared to a target value of 19,000 new connections.
       Number of wastewater connections has increased by 99,175, compared to a target value
        of 23,500 new connections.
       131.1km of water pipes was rehabilitated, which was 49.3% of the target of 266 km.
       Rehabilitation and extension of existing 3 WTPs (two completed and one ongoing),
        compared to 3 planned at appraisal.



                                                 16
       Construction of all five concrete reservoirs is ongoing, with one 50,000 m reservoir
        completed at WTP # 2.
        Implementation of six pumping stations financed by the project is ongoing; two more
        pumping stations are being financed by the AWWC, compared to a target of 16 pumping
        stations.
       Construction of 158 km of laterals and interceptors has been completed, compared to a
        target of 326km.
       The construction of a new WWTP has just begun while the expansion and rehabilitation
        of the existing WWTP at Choneibeh is almost completed, compared to a target of
        rehabilitation of Choneibeh WWTP and construction of another new WWTP.


(ii) Improving environmental, hygiene and health conditions.
Health and hygiene: Similar to Shiraz, the project has facilitated in increasing the public access to
safe potable water. In addition, after completion of several storage tanks and rehabilitation and
development of the network some of which are under construction, water quality and network
pressure will be enhanced and water shortage and UFW will be reduced, all of which will
contribute to a better quality of life. Similar health study was conducted in Shiraz as was done for
Ahwaz.



Environment quality: At the present, only a small portion of the collected sewerage is treated in
the Choneibeh WWTP and the rest is discharged into the Karoun River and Maleh stream.
Development and completion of the project activities, especially the main trunks and WWTPs,
would improve environmental quality.

(iii) Promoting reuse of treated effluents and sludge.
Currently, most of the raw sewerage is being discharged into the Karoun River and the Shadegan
international Wetland. However, once the project is completed and becomes fully operational, the
plan is to treat the wastewater and discharge the treated effluent into these water bodies. Also, the
produced sludge is planned to be used as fertilizer and soil conditioner. Given the project's
incomplete status, currently the only benefit that can be attributed to the project is the marginal
improvement in the percentage of wastewater treated due to rehabilitation of the Choneibeh
WWTP (which improved percent wastewater treated in Ahwaz from 5% to 17%, compared to
50% target). Such improvements in the percent wastewater treated should improve the
environmental quality of the Shadegan international wetland and also the quality of irrigation
water from the Karoun River--making reuse of treated effluents a viable water source.

Environmental monitoring: A plan for monitoring of water resources' quality (surface and ground
water), discharges, influent and effluent of emergency WWTP was prepared and implemented. At
present the baseline environment data has been established and the Karoun Department of
Environment (KDOE) continues to monitor water quality. Ahwaz WWC is expected to provide
the required financial resources and manpower to continue the monitoring program.

(b) Strengthening and developing the capacity of Shiraz and Ahwaz WWCs.

                                                 17
The capacity building component of the project has been successfully implemented and the
objectives have been appreciably achieved. The TSU was setup in such a way that about 50% of
its staff, including TSU managers, is from the WWCs and the rest from private sector, including
individual consultants, to promote cross-learning and capacity building of SWWC and AWWC
staff. The project supported a total of 104 week-long specialized training courses (prepared and
delivered jointly by the IHE UNESCO, Delft Water Institute, and Shahid Abbaspour University
of Technology in Tehran), from which more than 4000 experts, including the staff of SWWC and
AWWC, in the sector nationwide benefited. In addition, the project supported study tours abroad,
from which about 390 persons benefitted, including the staff of SWWC and AWWC.

The Shiraz and Ahwaz WWCs also benefited from various studies conducted under this project,
such as the environmental monitoring, industrial waste compliance action plan and emergency
operation plan. By participating in these studies, the staffs of the WWCs were exposed to these
new approaches towards improving the reliability of water and sanitation services delivery
system. In addition, the M&E system developed under this project could serve as good practices
for future water and wastewater projects. Moreover, the purchase of various environmental
monitoring equipments, including laboratory equipments, and O&M tools have improved
AWWC's and SWWC's operations. Some staff of WWCs benefited from the on-job trainings
offered regarding data collection, quality control, data analyses and interpretation, which also
contributed to capacity building of the WWCs.

However, the Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs have not been able to achieve the levels of financial
performance that had been projected during project preparation. This is mainly due to the fact
that the original financial projections for the WWCs relied on substantial increases in tariffs
from 2005 onwards, which did not materialize due to a shift in the new government's policy.
Working ratio of 1.23 and 1.19 at the end of the project were higher than the baseline value of 1.0
and 0.92, respectively, for Ahwaz and Shiraz, and much higher than the target value of 0.75.
 C. Initiating sector reforms, particularly with respect to institutional arrangements, the
regulatory framework, demand management, and sanitation strategy
The following activities under technical assistance of the project (under the responsibility of
NWWEC) were conducted in order to support sector reforms:
Institutional Optimization Study for Water Sector in Iran: was carried out in Iran in order to
identify inefficiencies within the Iranian water institutions, looking at how the various water
agencies in the country coordinate their activities and how decisions are made, water allocation
and use, and demand management. This greatly contributes towards initiating sector reforms by
identifying inefficiencies within the sector and optimizing the delivery of services, and better use
of the available resources.
National Wastewater Financing and Investment Strategy: this study looked at the feasibility
analysis of the investment needs and investment planning in the country by identifying the
investment needs, financing requirements and available resources, and how to achieve these
investment needs. As such, the study also looked at various potential financing modalities for
wastewater, including tariffs (and the need for tariff adjustments), government financing, and
private sector participation. The study's results could play a key role in reforming the water and
wastewater tariff structure throughout the country and in reducing the working ratio to the level
of 0.75, which were among the project objectives.

                                                18
Capacity Building in the Sector: the project financed national level training for about 4,000 sector
professionals through one-week courses in various subject areas. The contract that was managed
by UNESCO-Delft Water Institute also provided study tours to some 390 top officials in the
sector. This contract was very successful in bringing cutting edge knowledge to a wide group of
sector professionals, including to those from Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs.

Bank Supported Seminars and Workshops. The project also supported successful demand driven
workshops in Iran, including:

       WBI Workshop: a 4-day workshop on Business Planning, Asset Management and Non-
        Revenue Water successfully took place in Tehran in May 2007. About 500 sector
        specialists benefited from this workshop - which was organized with the help of the
        NWWEC. Overall, the NWWEC management expressed full satisfaction with the quality
        and usefulness of the workshop and repeated its interest to continue in the provision of
        this type of training.
       Economic assessment of wastewater projects and innovative wastewater collection and
        treatment technologies: a workshop was also organized in Iran to showcase the economic
        assessment of wastewater projects as well as innovative wastewater collection and
        treatment technologies used in Brazil. The workshop was well attended by many water
        and wastewater practitioners from across Iran.
       Procurement Workshop: one-day workshop on BOT, DBO and Turn Key projects,
        contracts, as well as contract management was held in June 2008. About 30 sector
        specialists - including private consulting firms - attended the workshop, which was
        organized with the help of NWWEC. Overall NWWEC provided positive feedback to the
        quality and usefulness of the workshop, and expressed its interest in having additional
        workshops on this topic. All of the materials and presentations were made available to the
        participants in English and Farsi.

       Workshop on experiences in Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in water and wastewater
        and Build Operate Transfer (BOT) contract management: in December 2008, the Bank
        organized a two-day workshop on the evolution of PPP in the water and sanitation sector
        with specific guidance on the procurement and implementation of BOT projects in the
        sector in Tehran. The workshop was well attended by more than 100 sector specialists
        from various departments/ ministries, including utilities, private sector, ministry of
        energy and finance, etc. An evaluation by NWWEC confirmed the relevance and
        importance of the seminar subject matter to the needs of those in attendance.

3.3 Efficiency

At appraisal, a detailed financial, economic and cost-benefit analysis of the project was
conducted. According to this analysis, the benefits expected under the project from the provision
of modem sewerage systems were better health for the targeted population, protection of the
limited water resources, provision of an alternative source of water for irrigation and reduction in
the cost of environmental degradation. The main health effect would be a significant reduction in
water-borne diseases, mainly in diarrhea and dysentery. As a result, it was estimated that the
project would be beneficial--estimated internal rate of return of over 20%. The financial analysis
showed that the project would generate sound financial benefits (financial rate of return of over
10%) to the Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs from several sources, including increased water sales and
disposal of wastewater, income from connection fees made possible from the new water and


                                                19
wastewater connections and the increased tariff that will be implemented in order to meet
financial performance targets agreed to between the GOI and the Bank.

As many of the project activities were not completed at the time of project closing date, for the
ICR assessment, it was not feasible to do an economic and financial analysis and compare the
target values with the actual values at the end of the project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

Based on the discussion given in Sections 3.2, the overall outcome is rated as Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impact: During construction phase of the project, a significant number of temporary jobs
had been created. In addition, several permanent jobs have also been created for facilities'
operation and maintenance that will be increased after project completion. Further, the project,
once completed, will supply reliable water (treated wastewater) for irrigation which can result in
development of agricultural activities and productivity, and consequently increase farmers'
income. However, because of the incomplete nature of the project, and because the majority of
remaining activities were to be conducted in the poorer sections of the community, the impact of
the project on poverty could not be fully evaluated.

Gender Aspects: N/A

Social Development: With improved access to clean water and sanitation, especially in schools,
mosques, and public areas, there will be definite impact on social development. Baseline on
health indicators was completed in 2008. However, as the project was closed without an
extension, another survey after the project closure could not be conducted to find the impact of
the project on social development, especially on health.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The staff of NWWEC, AWWC, and SWWC, including the staff of Ahwaz and Shiraz TSUs have
benefited from the training programs, seminars and workshops conducted under the project on
procurement, financial management, environmental management, utility management and
safeguard matters. This in turn has contributed to capacity building of these institutions.
Moreover, the capacity of national and local consulting engineers and contractors has been
strengthened because of the experience gained from the project. Workshops conducted on asset
management, use of condominial approach as a low-cost technical solution, sewerage system and
other relevant topics have succeeded in creating awareness on the need for improving operational
efficiency of WWCs through non-conventional low-cost approaches.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not done.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Substantial

     Financial sustainability of AWWC and SWWC. For covering the recurrent costs of WWCs,
      an increase in tariff is essential. However, the lack of tariff adjustment in recent years has
      led to the erosion of the financial position of the Shiraz and Ahwaz utilities. This issue is
      considered to be tied to political reasons and the government is covering the difference
      between the revenues and expenses. However, in December 2009 the GOI approved a new
      law on Targeted Subsidies, according to which the tariffs for public services, including
      water and wastewater, are to be collected fully from the subscribers (based on cost prices)
      and the subsidies are to be paid in another and more direct manner to low income families.
      According to the new law, the increase up to the real cost will be realized incrementally
      within three years.

     Both in Ahwaz and Shiraz, DBO packages for WWTPs had been approved and contracts
      awarded. Construction of these critical components of the project (if timely funding is
      made fully available) will take up to 36 months. This is a risk which would not have risen
      had an extension on the implementation time been granted.

       The intensity of the risk would depend on the government's priorities for allocating
      sufficient resources for timely completing the wastewater treatment plants. If the
      government decides to provide adequate funds, the risk could be minimized. Under the
      project, these treatment plants could have been completed and made operational within
      three to four years. If they are not funded properly, they could take significantly longer time
      for completing. In that case, the risk will be higher.

       The poor are disproportionately affected due to lack of completion of the project
      components as the majority of the remaining sub-components of the project (both in Ahwaz
      and Shiraz) are located in poor neighborhoods. It should be noted also that the proportion
      of completed projects is also higher in poorer neighborhoods given the focus of the project
      on the poor.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was
moderately satisfactory. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the
adequacy of project design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic,
and institutional, including procurement and financial management. A number of alternatives
were considered for the project design. In addition, lessons learned from the Tehran Sewerage
Project were incorporated into the design of this project.

                                                 21
Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided the
technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and to develop a good project design. The
Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to ensure quality
preparation and appraisal work (see Annex 4). A detailed feasibility study on the project was
conducted during preparation and the framework for land acquisition was also completed during
this period. The project was consistent with the government priorities in the sector at the time.
The Bank had a consistently good working relationship with the Borrower during preparation and
appraisal.

However, although the design of the project was realistic given the momentum of the reform
agenda at the time (as discussed under section 2.1), in hindsight, it is clear that the project design
was overoptimistic in terms of its expectations for tariff adjustment (over 20%) and completion of
the project within five years, especially given the lack of any demonstrated capacity to implement
such large and complex project in such short time, and lack of knowledge by the client of World
Bank's fiduciary procedures. Likewise, even though most of the risk factors were identified and
their mitigation measures were adopted, some other potential risks as mentioned in Section 2.1
were not properly identified and addressed.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

A Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP-I) was carried out in September 2009 by a
QAG panel of reviewers for the project. The panel rated the quality of design, Bank supervision,
focus on development effectiveness, supervision inputs and processes, and candor and realism of
ISRs as Satisfactory, and quality of implementation and the likelihood of achieving DOs as
moderately satisfactory/likely. QAG noted that:

       "The DOs are appropriate and relevant to the country's circumstances, and they focus on
        key priorities of the government.
       Physical infrastructure is well defined with clear outputs and outcomes. Connection
        targets were satisfactory, but utility outcomes (working ratios, unaccounted-for water) not
        realistic; effluent re-use did not have a target.
       The design includes adequate capacity building measures such as a strong training
        component and technical support for implementing agencies. The PAD candidly
        recognizes the lack of clarity in the institutional responsibilities and the limited technical
        capacity of institutions.
       Measures proposed during the MTR to remove bottlenecks to project implementation
        were appropriate and carefully detailed.
       The team has been consistent on pointing to implementation issues and their
        consequences for the achievement of the project's DOs.
       The likelihood of achieving the PDOs has been rated Moderately Satisfactory. This is
        based on the assumption that an extension of the closing date, if it were to be requested,
        will be granted, which the panel supports. It should, however, be clear that holding the
        project to the original time-frame is likely to result in a less than satisfactory PDO
        outcome."

The project's achievements discussed under 3.2 were possible through intensive and persistent
follow-up by a strong task team. The team was candid in its assessment of the project's failings
and achievements, and focused on the project's development impact. The task team regularly


                                                 22
prepared Aide-Memoires (AMs), alerted the government and the implementing agencies about
issues found during project execution and facilitated prompt corrective action. The
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in
terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation progress.

The Bank allocated sufficient budget and staff resources, and the project was adequately
supervised and closely monitored. The Bank's procurement and financial management staff
worked with the TSU staff to explain the rules and procedures to be applied during project
implementation, with regard to procurement of goods and works, and selection of consultants,
accounts and audits, based on the Loan and Project Agreement. The task team carried out an
MTR relatively on tie (in October-November 2007). Several workshops were conducted in
subject matters including BOT, DBO and Turn Key projects, contracts, as well as contract
management and procurement.

One important aspect of the Bank's performance and contribution was the continuity of the Task
Team, including the task manager and other key sector specialists, from project inception through
completion. This continuity engendered consistency, depth and follow-up of the dialogue with the
government and provided expertise to help the government analyze issues and implement actions as
they emerged during supervision.

Environmental aspects were well supervised and reported on by the task team. Most of the AMs
included a section on environmental safeguards and a detailed action plan with next steps. The
team provided continuous implementation support and monitored closely the implementation of
EMPs, identified performance difficulties and systematically proposed corrective measures. On
the above aspects, the Bank/task team's performance was rated Satisfactory.

On the other hand, there was a major shortcoming on the part of the Bank during implementation.
As mentioned in Section 2.2, at the time of MTR, the Bank had come to the conclusion that a two
to three year extension of the closing date of the project, or some of its components, was needed
to complete the ongoing and planned works, including the implementation of the DBO contracts
for the treatment plants. Although the need for a closing date extension was known well in
advance--at MTR stage, the official request for the same from the GOI came a year later (in
December 2008). The Bank decided (in August 2009) not to grant the extension. The Bank could
have proactively extended the closing date of the project after the MTR--once it was clear that
PDOs could not be fully achieved without such extension (similar to the Tehran Sewerage
Project-Phase I). Similarly, the Bank should have responded to the Borrower's request without
such delay (from December 2008 to August 2009) in order for the Borrower to make necessary
transition arrangements. As a result of this decision and with many critical components of the
project (including treatment plants and pumping stations) still under construction and/or
incomplete, the development objectives anticipated at the design of the project could not be fully
achieved.

Although there were significant performance shortcomings from the Borrower (as discussed
below) in terms of providing timely counterpart funding and appropriately adjusting tariffs in
order to help the WWCs maintain their financial sustainability, and hence fulfilling relevant DOs
as planned at appraisal, the project would have been on track to achieve a greater percentage of
the DOs if the Bank had granted an extension of the project closing date because:

       significant capacity had been acquired by the implementing agencies over the project's
        life time and implementation momentum had peaked in Ahwaz after a slow start at the
        beginning of the project;

                                               23
       after a lengthy bidding process, major DBO contracts were signed during the last few
        months of the project's life and their implementation has started;
       significant components of the project, including water and sewerage networks have been
        put in place and only needed house connections and connections to pumps and treatment
        plants (once implementation of these contracts is completed); and
       the Borrower has recently approved a "targeted subsidies law" which might help alleviate
        the tariff issue and may eventually lead to the achievement by the WWCs of the relevant
        PDO indicator (working ratio).

As such, significant achievements in terms of meeting planned targets at appraisal of PDO
indicators (such as UFW, incidence of water borne disease and quality of receiving water bodies)
and all intermediate outcome indicators would have been made had the project closing date been
extended by three years.

Given the inability of achieving the project's DO in the absence of extending the project closing
date, and also given that the poor are disproportionately affected if the project is left incomplete,
the fact that an extension of closing date was not granted constitutes a major shortcoming. As
such, this aspect of the Bank's performance was rated Unsatisfactory.

Taking into account both aspects explained above, overall Bank performance during
implementation was Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above, and
overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

At the time of project preparation, Borrower commitment and ownership were reflected through:
(i) government giving high priority to the sector, particularly to wastewater in its long-term
planning and its request to the Bank for continued support to the sector; (ii) MOE financing from
its own budget the background studies and its willingness to pay (WTP) for detailed engineering
and preparation of tenders for this project; (iii) WWCs taking initiatives to respond quickly to the
Bank's requirements and formally agreeing on the proposed strategy in the sector and future
collaboration with the Bank; and (iv) willingness of the government to fund urgent operations
(construction of network, wastewater treatment plants, etc.) in many cities prior to the project
implementation.

The government had established a strong NWWEC within the Ministry of Energy, reporting
directly to the Vice Minister for Water Supply and Sanitation. NWWEC (through its own TSU
staffed with competent manager and national consultants) was very committed and supportive of
the project and extended full cooperation to the task team during implementation. It was
instrumental in keeping the project moving forward.




                                                 24
On the other hand, the government commitment fluctuated during implementation. For example,
counterpart funding was not always made available on a timely basis, as a result of which
implementation was adversely affected. Likewise, as agreed, the performance of local water
companies should have been reviewed and their tariffs should have been increased to ensure their
financial sustainability. Instead, for political reasons, the government decided to raise the tariff
despite double digit (over 20%) inflation and high O&M costs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project was implemented by the SWWC, AWWC and NWWEC, and managed by their
TSUs.

Shiraz

Procurement and technical aspects. The procurement management and technical supervision in
Shiraz was satisfactory as the TSU used an experienced procurement officer from the beginning,
along with a very experienced engineer who provided timely oversight with regard to designs and
construction, and a qualified TSU manager who was actively involved in procurement. This team
received the same type of training as did the Ahwaz team (hands-on training provided by the
Bank during supervision missions, along with the in-house training of the international
consultant), but having higher qualifications they could manage to proceed with procurement
activities in a much more professional manner, and faced less delays.

Financial Management. The Financial Management arrangements were based on the use of the
Shiraz WWC systems with an upgrade to facilitate the generation of Financial Monitoring Report
(FMR). The financial management arrangements catered to the project needs and were able to
generate various financial reports on a timely basis. All invoices after being cleared by the TSU
were subject to the applicable controls as defined by the local laws. These laws stipulated that
payments need to be approved and issued by the SWWC Financial controller (FC) and were
subject to post audit by the "Divan Mohassebat" being the country Supreme Audit Institute in
addition to the project external independent auditor.

An accounting system was installed and an external consulting firm was contracted to assist with
the project accounts. The accounting software was customized and configured for the project by
an independent developer. The accounting package comprised one module for recording the
accounting transactions and another as a master file for the contracts. The system functionality
was able to reply fully to the project reporting requirement. The quarterly FMRs were generated
through the system and remitted on timely basis to the Bank. The project SAs were reconciled
periodically with the banks statements and the Bank's client connection and withdrawal
applications (WA) were issued on timely basis with minor deductions being applied to them by
the Bank. All payments were backed by signed contract or purchase orders.

Issues faced during project implementation related to the US financial sanctions on Iran where
funds denominated in US dollars were unable to be transferred to the Special Accounts (SA). The
closure of the US $ SAs and opening of Euro SAs generated currency translation difficulties that
impacted project reporting. With the assistance of the consulting firm the project was able to
introduce a currency translation mechanism (IRR, US$ and Euros) that enabled the reliable
reporting in US $ despite the various currency denominations under the project.



                                                25
Environmental management. The work of the Shiraz environmental unit was satisfactory and
apart from the environmental planning expert, who prepared and managed documents, there was
another specialist working in the unit as supervisor. The Shiraz TSU organized many workshops
on Environmental Safeguard and Safety, during which the issues of contractors, consultants, the
client and safety were discussed.

In light of the above, overall performance of SWWC/TSU was Satisfactory.

Ahwaz

Project management. TSU's Project Manager changed three times during the project period, and
there was also a high rate of staff turnover, which adversely affected the pace of implementation.
In addition, construction design changed two times, and contract management was also overall
considered weak.

Procurement and technical aspects. Originally it was difficult to find and hire qualified staff for
the TSU. As a result, the TSU was staffed by individuals from the AWCC with the assistance of
one individual from an external consulting firm. Even though these individuals were engineers
and a few had experience with local procurement, none of these individuals had the required
knowledge of World Bank procurement. To remedy this shortcoming, in addition to the hands-on
training provided by the Bank during supervision missions, an international consultant was hired
by the Bank to provide the TSU with in-house training, but the TSU had initial difficulties with
properly managing the procurement aspects of the project for the first couple of years. The
procurement activity in Ahwaz only picked up when a new experienced procurement staff was
recruited.

Financial management. Similar to that of Shiraz, the Financial Management arrangements were
based on the use of the Ahwaz WWC systems. Although these systems were able to comply fully
with the project's reporting requirement, an upgrade was needed to facilitate the generation of the
FMRs. An accounting system was installed and an external individual consultant was hired to
assist with the project accounts. The quarterly FMRs were generated through the system and
remitted on a timely basis to the Bank. The project SAs were reconciled periodically with the
banks statements and the Bank's client connection and WA were issued on a timely basis with
minor deductions being applied to them by the Bank. All payments were backed by signed
contract or purchase orders.

The Ahwaz sub-project faced issues similar to those faced under the Shiraz sub-project in terms
of US financial sanctions.

Environmental management. The Ahwaz environmental unit was inadequately equipped for
monitoring the safety and environmental issues of the ongoing projects and carried out its task
with great difficulty. However, despite the initial difficulties faced, the environmental specialist
within the TSU was able to provide the project with baseline data to help monitor progress over
time.

Overall performance of AWWC/TSU was thus Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.


                                                26
As discussed above, project performance was adversely impacted by the lack of timely
counterpart funding which resulted in a protracted delay of contract implementation, and by the
lack of tariff adjustment in line with local inflation and O&M costs needed to avert a financially
unsustainable situation for the WWCs. In addition, delays faced by the Ahwaz sub-project at the
beginning due to poor staff quality and high turnover, especially in the top management of the
TSU including the procurement staff affected the performance of AWWC. Similarly, slow land
acquisition, and municipality and traffic police permit processing added extra delays to project
implementation.

In light of the government and implementing agencies performance as discussed above, the
overall performance of the Borrower was Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Important factors for the success of a project

       It is necessary to understand the political economy of the country vis--vis the feasibility
        of the project and also the achievability of targets. Moreover, due diligence in terms of
        ensuring good quality at entry is very critical for setting realistic targets and devising
        implementation strategies. For example, in the case of Ahwaz and Shiraz project, it
        would be overoptimistic to assume that all the institutional and policy reforms, including
        the financial sustainability of the WWCs, could be achieved in just five years, especially
        given the lack of adequate and recent prior experience by the Bank in the sector in Iran.

Implementation

       The project implementation should start only after all the essential preparatory work has
        been completed, and conversely, doing the preparatory work during implementation
        should be avoided as much as possible. Once the implementation has started, persistence
        and perseverance are important for the success of the project.

       It is good to understand on-the-ground rules and constraints for project implementation in
        order to either make room for such issues in project design and targets or design
        appropriate solutions to mitigate local constraints. For example, in the case of Ahwaz
        and Shiraz project, designing a project expecting a tariff increase of over 20% was
        overoptimistic given the political economy of the country and the two cities involved.

       As Iran had restarted implementing Bank projects after a gap of several years, the
        counterpart officials were not familiar with the Bank's policies and procedures, and as a
        result, a steep learning curve was involved. In addition, for a project of this type, duration
        of more than five years is needed to complete project activities. In light of these factors
        and as recommended by the MTR mission and QAG team, it would have been realistic
        and reasonable to extend the project by another two to three years, so that the project
        objectives could have been fully achieved.

M&E

       A strong M&E framework should be developed at the beginning and due attention should
        be given to training the staff and senior management connected with the project with
        regards to M&E so that they can appreciate its relevance and importance in the

                                                 27
         implementation of the project--and not see resources that go to M&E as resources sub-
         optimally used.
        Appropriate and adequate indicators should be established in order to sufficiently track
         project performance. Performance indicators should be designed taking into account the
         existing institutional capacities. For example, some of the indicators originally identified
         for incidence of water borne diseases and quality of receiving bodies are very difficult to
         measure. The quality of receiving water bodies is an indicator that requires substantial
         sampling capacities and improvements in this indicator is usually a longer-term outcome
         (past the traditional implementation period of these projects). Similarly, adequate targets
         should be established to enable proper tracking of project objectives. In addition, it is
         equally important to have a good baseline data.
        It is important to establish a clear results framework from the outset and only identify
         results that are measureable. Also, it is necessary to evaluate the project's performance
         against these results framework on regular basis, and not against disbursement rate that
         cannot necessarily be a good proxy for project performance.

Safeguards

        It is good to complete land acquisition and other social aspects of the project before the
         commencement of the implementation as these matters normally take a longer time than
         expected.

Procurement

        TSU teams must be appointed and trained before the project commencement (or as a
         condition for commencement), preventing delays as the result of learning curve. Or
         smaller projects could be used for learning process, with larger ones kicking in after
         certain goals have been met.
        Once a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed by the government with
         the Bank, to follow the Bank's procurement guidelines, it is important for the government
         to follow the Bank's procurement procedures so that unnecessary delays can be avoided.
        Using qualified consultants to assist with the original design and cost estimates would
         prevent large changes in the project during the implementation.
Tariff
        Avoid unrealistic expectations in terms of tariff adjustment. Project design should be
         made within the realm of possible assumptions.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The NWWEC, SWWC and AWWC all reviewed the draft ICR and provided their comments,
which were incorporated as much as possible in the revised ICR. In addition, both Ahwaz and
Shiraz WWCs also provided their ICRs, which have been summarized in Annex 7. The full
content of these ICRs are also available in the project's files.

NWWEC is of the opinion that the Borrower's performance should be rated satisfactory.
However, based on the detailed review of Borrower's performance described under section 5.2, it


                                                 28
was decided that the rating of the Borrower's performance should remain moderately
satisfactory.

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

At appraisal, a detailed financial, economic and cost-benefit analysis of the project was
conducted. According to this analysis, the benefits expected under the project from the provision
of modem sewerage systems were better health for the targeted population, protection of the
limited water resources, provision of an alternative source of water for irrigation and reduction in
the cost of environmental degradation. The main health effect would be a significant reduction in
water-borne diseases, mainly in diarrhea and dysentery. As a result, it was estimated that the
project would be beneficial--estimated internal rate of return of over 20%. The financial analysis
showed that the project would generate sound financial benefits (financial rate of return of over
10%) to the Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs from several sources, including increased water sales and
disposal of wastewater, income from connection fees made possible from the new water and
wastewater connections and the increased tariff that will be implemented in order to meet
financial performance targets agreed to between the GOI and the Bank.

As many of the project activities were not completed at the time of project closing date, for the
ICR assessment, it was not feasible to do an economic and financial analysis and compare the
target values with the actual values at the end of the project.

1. Introduction

1.1. Project Description

Shiraz Water and Wastewater Company (SWWC) implemented the Shiraz Water and Wastewater
Sub-project. The sub-project included the rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of water
and wastewater systems and facilities for the city of Shiraz. The development was proposed to
take place in 3 phases to cover the period to about 2027.

For phase 1 covering through 2005 and 2009, and a population of million, water supply and
distribution networks and wastewater collection systems would be implemented and wastewater
treatment works would be constructed in the south east of the city with the use of treated effluents
in the agricultural lands.

The project further included operation and maintenance equipments and technical assistance
training /consultant services for institutional development and project management, engineering
design and construction supervision. The SWWC received a Loan from the World Bank in
amount of USD 127.21 million toward a part of the cost of the project.

1.2. Project Development Objectives

The main objectives were to:

(a) enhance the quality of life in the city of Shiraz, particularly in poor areas by: (i) improving
access to satisfactory water supply and significantly increasing coverage of sanitation services;
and (ii) improving environmental, hygiene and health conditions, as well as promoting reuse of
treated effluents;

(b) Strengthen and develop the capacity of SWWC, and assist the latter in improving their
efficiency, sustainability and financial autonomy; and

(c) Initiate sector reforms, particularly with respect to institutional arrangements, the regulatory
framework, demand management, as well as prepare a sanitation strategy.

The objectives under the first phase of the project would be achieved through:

        Provision of water supply and distribution networks and also provision of sanitary
         wastewater collection and treatment facilities.

        Improvements in public health and reduction of surface and ground water pollution and
         also provision of treated wastewater for irrigation on the Harvestman Plane (Located in
         south east of Shiraz).

1.3 Project Description

The detailed description and components of the project are as follow:
   (i) Rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of water systems and facilities:

           Water resources: drilling and equipping of 17 new wells with total water abstracted
            amounts equaling 82,000 m3/day.

           Water Supply: a) laying of 34 km GRP transmission pipelines with diameters ranging
            between 500 and 1200 mm; b) rehabilitation and extension of the water network
            including installation of pressure reducing valves with diameters ranging between
            200-400 mm and a total length of 235 km of PE pipes; and c) construction of four
            concrete reservoirs 3000m3, 7500m3, 20000m3 and 40000m3 as well as construction
            of two pumping stations.

    (ii) Rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of wastewater systems and facilities:
          Construction of 95 km of GRP trunk mains in the emergency and long- term areas;
            diameter range between 500- 1200 mm.

           Construction of 740 km of PE laterals and interceptors. Works under this
            subcomponent will cover an area of 5496 ha.

           Construction of 50,000 additional house connections.

           Construction of two modules wastewater treatment plant with a total capacity of
            100,000 m3/d to be built under DBO contract.

           Construction of 20 km GRP outfalls to discharge treated effluents as well as sludge
            storage site.

2. Project costs and financing Plan

Total project cost (Phase 1) was estimated at about US$ 214.10 million, with US$ 127.17 million
in foreign exchange. The civil works portion amounted to about 92.71 percent of the cost.

The proposed Bank loan of US$ 127.17 million financed about 59.40 percent of the project cost,
and would meet nearly all the foreign exchange component. The rest of the cost (US$ 86.93
million) was being financed by the borrower.

3. Civil Works

3.1. Water Works:
3.1.1 Drilling and Equipping of 17 New Wells

The work comprised drilling of 20 wells with total depth of 3250 m, provision and installation of
steel pipes of 14 ft and 16 ft diameter, within 3 bids. Drilling of 20 wells has been completed.




                                               39
3.1.2 Transmission Pipelines and Water Distribution Networks

This component comprised of lying 34 km GRP transmission pipelines feeding distribution
network and transmitting water from wells to reservoirs. It also included rehabilitation and
extension of 235 km of water networks.

All 269 km (34 km GRP and 235 km PE pipes) the lines and the networks is constructed (100 %
percent of the target).

3.1.3 Construction of Storage Reservoirs

Bidding of two concrete water storage reservoirs (out of 4) 3000 m3 and 40,000 m3 in volume
was conducted with NCB procedure. The contract was awarded on March 19, 2006 with a
completion period of 24 months, and with a local contractor named "Arsam". The client was not
satisfied with the progress of this project and finally the contract was terminated.

The new contracts of 40000 m3 and 3000 m3 reservoirs were awarded on June 17, 2008 and July
05, 2008 with two local contractors Pars Maroon and Salar Sahab respectively. The previous
Contractor (Arsam) has submitted litigation to the court and the client has confiscated its bid
security.

The contract of the third reservoir 20000 m3 in volume was also conducted with Salar Sahab on
August 14, 2008.

3.2 Wastewater Works:
3.2.1 Trunk Mains, Interceptor & Laterals

About 536.6 km of the mains, interceptor and laterals with diameters ranging from 200mm up to
1800 mm are yet constructed (64.26 percent of the aim). The trunk main which conveys sewage
to the long- term wastewater treatment plant has a length of 8220 meters and is a GRP pipe, 1800
mm in diameter and has been fully constructed.

3.2.2 Wastewater Treatment Works

The prequalification procedure has been carried out and three groups of JV contractors out of ten
have been qualified by the Consultant (Schlegel) and the WB no- objection on the provided Pre-
qualification Report was obtained on August 23, 2007. The final Draft of the Tender Documents
was sent for the WB on October 02, 2007, and the World Bank's approval was obtained on
December 18, 2007.

3.2.4 Outfalls

Construction of two outfalls (20 km in length) to discharge treated effluent for the Emergency
Plant and Long- term Treatment Plant to Lake Maharloo had been planned to be constructed. The
first one was later completely postponed because the effluent is to be discharged into the
Sarvestan irrigation system, and the latter will be constructed in a shorter length as long as to
discharge the effluent into the available constructed drainage system.




                                               40

7. Conclusion
     Project Assessment:
(a) Physical:

   TM 20 new wells have been contracted, all have been drilled. This means 17.65 % beyond the
      plan.

   TM All 269 Km of water supply and distribution pipes have been executed (100%
      completion).

   TM 3 reservoirs 43000 m3 total volume (out of 70500 m3) water storage reservoir has been
      contracted, with average physical progress of 80.29%.

   TM 556 km trunk-mains lateral and interceptor (out of 740 km) of the sewerage system has
      been contracted.

   TM All necessary consulting engineers (Except one), TSU and individual consultants have
      been hired.

(b) Performance Indicators:

SWWC's working ratio has slightly increased to 1.19 (comparing to 0.92 at appraisal), which
means that the company has generated less revenues to pay for its operating expenses. Level of
accounts receivables have also increased to 114 days (compared to 167 at appraisal), and non
revenue water which had been estimated up to about 30 % during the years 2004/ 2005,has been
reduced to 25 %.

Constraints:
(i) Shortage of Government's share in fund allocation till present amounts to 223,523,146,864
Rials (US$ 24,552,191) as fund deficit.

(ii) Increase in the previously forecast budget for the 2 modules of Long Term WWTPs (million
US$ 26.79 changed to million US$ 63.69).




                                             44
(iii). Extra Payments not predicted in the planned values ,which should be made as a result of
price adjustment to contracts subject to adjustment for prices (for water packages about million
US$ 5.79 and for wastewater packages about million US$ 8.09).

(iv). According to the PAD, Bank share and GOI share are 60% and 40% for wastewater and 50%
and 50% for Water works respectively, but based on the Loan Agreement, Bank share and GOI
share are 80% and 20% for Wastewater and Water works respectively, on the other hand since
payments for wastewater house connections is made from SWWC's business income, and
accordingly, the Bank and GOI shares are reduced to 66% and 16.5% respectively.

1   Introduction

Ahwaz, the center of Khozestan province is located at approximately 875 Km. from Tehran. The
present population is about 950,000 and is projected to reach 2.2 million by the year 2027. Ahwaz
is one of the most important economical centers of the Islamic Republic of Iran as it is located in
an oil-rich region and hosts a number of large industries; the Karoon River is the largest river in
Iran, flows along Ahwaz and divides the city into two separate drainage zones.

The project covered the rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply and sanitation system in
Ahwaz city in order to cope with growing demands. The required works for water and wastewater
would be completed over four phases. With phase one from 2003 to 2007, phase two from 2008
to 2012,phase three from 2012 to 2017 and phase four 2018 to 2027 . The Water and Sanitation
Project covered works to be included in the first phase (2003 to 2007).

1.1 Project Description

Water supply: As part of the project, the following water works were included:
 Rehabilitation of the two existing water treatment plants by construction of pre-sedimentation
units and the addition of dual media layers, ozonation and activated carbon in treatment plants
no.1 and 2.
 Pipe laying of 10 km transmission pipelines from the water treatment plants no. 1 and 2 to the
storage reservoirs diameter ranges from 700-2000 mm. Rehabilitation and extension of the water
network with diameters ranging from 200-600 mm. with a total length of 266km.
 Construction of five concrete square reservoirs of 50,000 M capacity in Hasir Abad and water
treatment plant # 2 area as well as construction of required pumping station.

Wastewater: Ahwaz wastewater plan proposed that sewerage generated in the western zone will
be conveyed to the existing Choneibieh wastewater treatment plant, while sewerage generated in
the eastern zone will be conveyed to a new wastewater treatment plant. The Choneibieh
Wastewater treatment plant would be rehabilitated and its capacity would be increased to reach
204,000 M/d by the year 2027 .The proposed new wastewater treatment plant in the eastern zone
was based on activated sludge process plus nitrification, de-nitrification and chlorination .The
plant would be constructed in 3 phases to reach a capacity of 300,500 M/ d by the year 2027. As
part of the project, the following wastewater works were included:

 Construction of 60 Km of concrete trunk main in east and west of Ahwaz , out of which 2.6 Km
of western trunk main with size 1200 mm, and 3.5 Km of the eastern trunk main with size 1600
mm, would be constructed as tunnels. The eastern trunk main would collect wastewater from the
eastern basin and transfer it to the proposed new treatment plant, while the western trunk main
would collect the wastewater from the western basin and transfer it to the existing Choniebieh
treatment plant.

 Construction of 162 Km, of PE laterals and interceptors and 16 lift and pump stations works
under this sub-component would cover an area of 1465 ha .



                                                46
 Rehabilitation and expansion of the existing treatment plant at the west of Ahwaz (Choneibeh),
to meet its design capacity of 200,000 PE, this will be done by replacing various mechanical
parts, repairing of concrete parts, adding a new unit that will enable treating a flow of 54,575m/d
as well as providing sludge lagoons and storage facilities.

 Construction of first two modules of the treatment plant in east of Ahwaz with a capacity of
522,000 PE, treating a flow of 102,000m/d, the proposed treatment process is activated sludge
with nitrification and de-nitrification.

1.2 Benefits of the Project

The project was expected to benefit a population of 1.3 million people, living in Ahwaz city and
representing about 1.8 % of the population of Iran. While the water systems are well developed
and population coverage is almost total in the two cities, sewerage coverage is very low and the
need to develop adequate sewage systems is urgent. Only one wastewater treatment plant
(WWTP), located in Ahwaz, is in operation at the present time and even this plant treats only part
of the generated wastewater and is in need of rehabilitation. Because of the deleterious effects of
the current state of living conditions and the environment, the construction of modern sewage
systems is expected to generate significant health and environmental benefits.

The implementation of the project would address the water and sanitation needs of the population
of Ahwaz city, a large proportion of which is poor. The topographic characters of the city in
question and the downstream effects of water and sewage flow are such that the most polluted
areas are the ones inhabited by the poorest of the population. Traditional water-related diseases
such as helminthes, hepatitis A, conjunctivitis, skin diseases, and to a lesser extent typhoid and
cholera are quite prevalent.

(a) Economic

The benefits expected under the project from the provision of modern sewerage systems were:
better health for the targeted population, protection of the limited water resources, provision of an
alternative source of water for irrigation and reduction in the cost of environmental degradation.
The main health effect would be a significant reduction in water-borne diseases, mainly in
diarrhea and dysentery. These diseases result in various economic costs - workdays missed for
adults and schooldays missed for youngsters during the sickness period, the cost of medication
and eventually of hospitalization. In addition, there will be a significant improvement in the living
conditions of targeted population. The water component will provide safe and affordable
drinkable water to the expanding population in the two cities.

(b) Environmental

Major environmental issues were: (i) risk of poor performance of water treatment facilities that
would lead to insufficient water quantity of inadequate quality if the water supply system is not
properly maintained and monitored; (ii) possible discharge of toxic/harmful industrial substances
into the wastewater collection network because of lack of enforcement on the provision of the
required pre-treatment; and (iii) use of treated effluent for irrigation and of treated sludge for soil
conditioning could, in case of any adverse diversions in treatment quality, cause a health threat to
people.

(c) Public Health


                                                  47
Although water supply coverage is high, sanitation is desperately poor, particularly in unplanned
and informal settlements, which are substantial in city of Ahwaz. Individual infiltration sewerage
systems are common. With a deteriorated potable water infrastructure, drinking water is
contaminated by untreated sewage. During summer or when it rains, these create an unpleasant
and unhealthy environment characterized by odor, flies and polluted stagnant water. Poor children
are particularly exposed, and pedestrian communication is difficult and unpleasant.

2. Project Cost and Financing Plan

Total project cost for planning period (2005-2027) was estimated about IRR 3,960 billion
(US$471.52 million) from which US$87.62 million was the cost of water supply and distribution
system and US$383.90 million was the cost of wastewater collection and treatment plants. For the
first phase (2005-2009) the total estimated cost of the project for water and wastewater was
US$95.54 million and US$157.4 million respectively which was US$252.93 million for both.
The amount of the allocated loan for Ahwaz project was US$149.03 million.

3 Civil Works

(a) Water Works

Two contracts, Rehabilitation of Water Treatment Plant's No. 2 Intake (AW7) and Rehabilitation
of Distribution Network (AW4/4), out of above mentioned stipulated contracts were terminated
due to Contractor's fault and relevant Legal Procedures are going on.

As the results of ILF Feasibility Studies on possibility of Rehabilitation of Ahwaz Water
Treatment Plant No. 2 showed that the rehabilitation of this treatment plant is not technically and
economically feasible and AWWC decision is on reconstructing a new treatment plant instead of
rehabilitation of existing one. This feasibility report has been approved by NWWEC's Technical
Department and considering new scope of work, a new pre-qualification procedure has been
started under package of PQ-AW6R.

(b) Wastewater Sector

13 contracts with a total amount of USD 47.15 million were stipulated and awarded since
effectiveness of World Bank's Loan and their construction is ongoing now. One contract,
Rehabilitation of Ahwaz West Wastewater Treatment Plant (AS6), was terminated due to
Contractor's fault and relevant legal procedures are ongoing now. Also three contracts have been
completed (AS4 & AS4/7 & AS5).

Pre-qualification procedures of four procurement packages worth USD 90 million were started
after getting World Bank's no 춐bjections on relevant pre-qualification documents as follows:

(i)     Ahwaz Eastern Wastewater Treatment Plant (PQ-AS12) with cost estimate of USD 40
        million. Three bids were received and opened publicly on 6th October 2008 for Design,
        Built and operate of Ahwaz Eastern Wastewater Treatment Plant. The evaluation of
        received bids was conducted by P2m Berlin Consulting Engineers.
(ii)    Ahwaz West Main Trunks (PQ-AS9R) with cost estimate of USD 35 million in two lots.
        It is going to be held until finalization of Ahwaz Eastern Wastewater Treatment Plant
        Contract (AS12) and if the World Bank's financial resources are available, it will be
        implemented under the IBRD Loan's resources; otherwise it is going to be executed
        under AWWC's Financial Resources.

                                                48
(iii)   Ahwaz West Three Main Pumping Stations (PQ-AS24R) with cost estimate of USD 15
        million. Due to lack of World Bank's Financial Resources caused by growth of Inflation
        Rate and prioritization of remained packages, it is decided to hold the Implementation of
        this package by World Bank loan and it is going to be tendered through AWWC's
        available other Financial Resources.

Ahwaz Eastern Three Main Pumping Stations (PQ-AS23/2) with cost estimate of USD 10
million. The pre-qualification procedure has been prepared by TSU/AWWC along with the ICB
Bidding Documents and the relevant ICB was supposed to be started by the end of April 2008 but
due to lack of World Bank's Financial Resources caused by growth of Inflation Rate and
prioritization of remained packages, it is decided to hold the Implementation of this package by
World Bank loan and it is going to be tendered through AWWC's available other Financial
Resources by July 2009.
