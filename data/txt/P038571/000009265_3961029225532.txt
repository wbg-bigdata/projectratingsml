RUSSIAN FEDERATION
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:               Russian Federation
Implementing Agency:    Medical Equipment Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU)
Beneficiaries:         Primary and secondary health care facilities in 34 selected oblasts
Poverty Category:      The project is not part of the Program of Targeted Interventions as its
benefits are spread broadly among the population as a whole. However, the
project would contribute to the preservation of universal access to basic
social services which is an essential element in any safety net.
Amount:                 US$270 million
Terms:                 Payable in seventeen years, including five years of grace, at the standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based US Dollar single currency loans
Financial Benefits
and Risks:             The Government selected the single currency loan option in order to improve
its overall liability management and reduce its risks. The US Dollar was
chosen by the Government in order to match expected federal revenues.
Selection of the LIBOR-based interest rate was justified primarily to preserve
the standard country repayment terms of 17 years maturity in comparison to
the shorter final maturity of a fixed rate single currency loan.  The
Government also stated that it did not have a significant amount of debt
subject to fluctuating interest rates and would, therefore, be able to manage
its risk.
Commitment Fee:        0.75 % on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less
any waiver
Onlending Terms:        Not applicable (intergovernmental transfer arrangement; no formal on-lending
agreements)
Financing Plan:         See para. 4.7
Economic Rate of Return:  The ERR for this operation is not quantifiable. See Chapter 6.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1          The Russian Federation is the world's largest country, encompassing 17,075,000 square
kilometers. With a population of 148 million, it is also the sixth most populous. Living circumstances
vary from compact industrial regions with established social infrastructure to production centers set in
vast sparsely populated regions and agricultural areas in rural settings. There is great ethnic and cultural
diversity. Ecological problems, varying only in source and severity, are present throughout the country.
Shortcomings in Russia's health care system, combined with the effects of economic and social stresses,
have caused serious deterioration in health status. This trend became apparent even before the dissolution
of the USSR in 1991.
1.2          The Soviet health system was at one time considered a model for other countries to
emulate. It was, and still is, characterized by universal and relatively equitable access to a comprehensive
system of health care. In principle, the system emphasized primary and preventive care and was built
around a network of primary health care centers comprising feldsher stations, women's consultations,
polyclinics and ambulatories, accessible to the population throughout the vast territory of the Soviet
Union.
1.3          Russia has inherited the Soviet health system, but, with the financial strains of the
economic transition, the disparities between the theoretical design of the system and the way it works in
practice become glaringly apparent. Despite artificially controlled prices of the various inputs, the system
was becoming unaffordable even before the economic transition. Now, as prices of non-salary inputs
have been liberalized and the responsibility for financing has been decentralized, resource constraints have
become an even more important factor. Health care spending has become heavily skewed toward curative
and in-patient care. Although salaries of medical personnel are low in comparison to other professions,
salaries are given the first priority in allocating the limited resources available. It is clear that universal
comprehensive health care cannot be provided by the system in its present configuration at the current
levels of financing. However, even within the envelope of resources currently available, the relevance
and quality of health care provided can be improved.
1.4          In order to strike a balance between the needs of the population for health care and the
resources available, comprehensive reform of the Russian health care system will be required. As in
other countries, the reforms will involve improving financial incentives to providers to raise quality and
cost efficiency, restructuring health care delivery through both physical restructuring of facilities and
implementation of effective clinical protocols, providing more services on an out-patient basis and
reducing reliance on hospitalization. A shift in the balance between public and private sector involvement
of both the financing and provision of health care is needed. This is an extensive agenda which will
require many years to complete. The proposed project represents an initial step towards restructuring
and rationalizing health care facilities in Russia.

A. HEALTH STATUS
Life Expectancy
1.5          In certain respects, the health issues confronting the Russian population are similar to
those found in other industrialized countries. Like other countries which have progressed through the
epidemiological transition, the major health problems are related to chronic, non-infectious diseases.
However, in sharp contrast with patterns in almost all developed and developing countries, the health
status of the Russian population is worsening. This deterioration is perhaps most visibly reflected in the
alarming trend in life expectancy.
1.6           From 1990 to 1993, life expectancy for men declined from 63.8 years to 58.9 years and
for women from 74.3 years to 71.9 years. In 1993 alone, male life expectancy declined by three years
and female life expectancy by two years. Such dramatic declines are unprecedented except in times of
war or natural disaster. The trend continued downward in 1994 to 58.2 years for men and 71.6 for
women. In the early 1950s, health status and life expectancy in Russia were roughly comparable to the
rest of Europe. Until the mid-1960s, health gains equalled or exceeded the rest of Europe. However,
from that point onward, life expectancy stagnated until the 1990s and then actually declined. The 13-year
gap between male and female life expectancy, the largest anywhere in the world, is largely attributable
to certain lifestyle choices, e.g., consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Men are two and a half times as
likely as women to diz at an economically productive age.
Table 1.1: Life Expectancy at Birth (in years)
1965     1980     1990      1991      1992     1993      1994
Men                64.3     61.5      63.9      63.5      62.0     58.9      58.2
Women              73.4    73.1       74.4      74.3      73.8     71.9      71.6
Adult Health
1.7          In 1993, the leading causes of death in Russia were cardiovascular disease (52 percent),
trauma and poisoning (16 percent) and cancer (13 percent). Infectious diseases accounted for only about
1 percent of deaths. Over the past 30 years, mortality from infectious diseases has fallen steadily, while
deaths from cardiovascular disease have nearly doubled. This pattern differs markedly from that in
westem Europe, Japan and North America, where mortality rates from cardiovascular disease declined
by 35 to 50 percent during the same period. More recently, there has also been a dramatic increase in
deaths due to trauma and poisoning. In 1992, the single most significant cause of death in this category,
responsible for 18 percent of such deaths, was suicide. Another 13 percent were murders and a further
10 percent were due to alcohol poisoning. This pattern strongly suggests inadequacies in the provision
of mental health services, despite the fact that nearly 5 percent of the total population received some form
of psychiatric care.
1.8          Both morbidity and mortality reflect distinct gender patterns. In 1992, for example, the
incidence of cancer in men was 1.8 times as high as in women, with lung cancer accounting for 30
percent of all cases. The most common form of cancer in women, accounting for 17 percent of cases,



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                       Page 3
was breast cancer. At comparable ages, men are over twice as likely to die from cancer as women, three
times as likely to die from respiratory diseases, and five times as likely to die from trauma and poisoning.
Maternal and Children's Health
1.9          The declines in life expectancy also reflect a worsening in infant mortality. Infant
mortality, which dropped from 22.0 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 17.4 in 1990, rose to 19.9 in 1993,
before declining to 19.0 in 1994. This rate is two to three times as high as in OECD countries.
Maternal mortality, at 52 per 100,000 live births (1993), is five to ten times as high as in other
industrialized countries. The main causes are complications from abortions, post-partum bleeding and
toxemia. Although abortion is legal and is commonly used to control fertility, the recent imposition of
social and medical criteria to abortions after the first trimester may lead women to seek illegal abortions,
complications of which contribute greatly to the high rate of maternal mortality.  Contraceptive
prevalence is low. The official rate for modem methods was 22.8 percent in 1993. Although rates of
over 40 percent have been reported, these include a high proportion, perhaps as much as half, of non-
modem methods, e.g., rhythm, withdrawal.
1.10         The frequency of abortion also contributes to a high prevalence of anemia among women
of childbearing age which eventually results in high rates of anemia among small children. A recent
survey found the prevalence of anemia for children under age two at between 10 and 15 percent in major
cities and at about 25 percent in the surrounding oblasts. Immunization rates ranging from 60 to 80
percent are fairly comparable to those in other industrialized countries. The availability of vaccines is
not a major problem in Russia, as, in the past, Russia was the main source of vaccines for all of the
USSR. Decreases in vaccine production have, however, adversely affected some of the other FSU
republics, as vaccines are exported only after local demand is met. Children who survive to their first
birthday are likely to reach adulthood, but then have a one in four chance of dying before age 60.
Demographic Crisis
1.11         The convergence of increased mortality and declining birth rates since 1988 has led to
what Russian health officials speak of as the "demographic crisis." In fact, this issue is highlighted as
the most significant concern in the 1992 "State Report on the Status of Health of the Population in the
Russian Federation" (1992 State Report).
Table 1.2: Crude Birth and Death Rates (1987-1994)
(per 1,000 population)
[  1987  1988 11989  1990  1991  1992  1993   1994
Crude Birth Rate             17.2  16.0  14.6  13.4  12.1  10.7   9.4    9.5
Crude Death Rate             10.5  10.7  10.7  11.2  11.4  12.2  14 5   15.5
Since 1992, the birth and death rates have interacted to produce a natural decrease in population. The
effect on the age composition of the population has been a reduction in the population of productive age
accompanied by an increasing proportion of pensioners.

Risk Factors
1.12          The main risk factors in terms of adult health are alcohol, tobacco and diet. Adult
morbidity and mortality are also adversely affected by unhealthful and often dangerous working
conditions. Among the republics of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), Russia is second only to Belarus
in per capita consumption of alcohol. It is estimated that alcohol consumption in Russia rose by 30
percent during the period 1987 to 1992. Recent surveys indicate a dramatic increase (over 100 percent)
in the quantity of alcohol consumed by male drinkers during the period September 1992 to December
1994, while alcohol consumption by female drinkers increased only slightly.
1.13          Smoking is very prevalent in Russia, with approximately 60 percent of adult men and 15
percent of adult women smoking. The difference in smokinig prevalence is also a major factor
contributing to the gender patterns in morbidity and mortality. While male smoking trends have remained
stable at fairly high levels, the prevalence of smoking among women, particularly young women, is
increasing and will undoubtedly be reflected in health status in the future.
1.14          Household surveys reveal a marked change in diet between 1989 and 1992, including
significant decreases in the consumption of fruits and vegetables, fish, meat and milk and dairy products,
and sharp increases in the consumption of bread and potatoes. These changes were, in part, beneficial.
Prior to 1989, fat consumption was 10 to 15 percent higher than the recommended levels, while by 1992
calories from fat represented 31 percent of daily caloric intake, although a high proportion still comes
from animal fats. Undernutrition is not a significant problem; however, the prevalence of obesity is high,
particularly among older women, and contributes to the high incidence of cardiovascular disease.
1.15          Although 77 percent of urban dwellers and 65 percent of rural dwellers are reported to
have access to safe water supply, mechanical failures and intermittent shortages of water treatment
chemicals may reduce the overall level to as low as 50 percent overall on a consistent basis. Industrial
pollution is also a significant problem, leading to regional variations in respiratory diseases and various
forms of cancer, although hard data linking causes and effects are not readily available. Similarly, high
levels of radiation resulting from nuclear accidents require long-term epidemiological monitoring.
B. ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE
1.16          The decentralized Russian health care system as it now exists reflects both the positive
and negative attributes of the highly centralized Soviet health system from which it evolved. On the
positive side, access is universal and fairly equitable; the system is characterized by an extensive network
of over 20,000 polyclinics; and costs have been contained. On the negative side, the system is not
sufficiently funded to support the comprehensive service it attempts to provide'; relies too heavily on
curative and inpatient care; lacks incentives to encourage efficiency; and neglects health promotion and
recognition of the individual responsibility for adopting a healthy lifestyle.
1.17          The public health system in Russia, which provides access to the entire population,
comprises 12,000 hospitals (including 4,700 community or district hospitals) and maternity homes,
aggregating 2.8 million in-patient beds, 15,500 polyclinics and women's consultations, and 3,500
ambulatories. In addition, there are 48 medical academies, 117 research institutes and 34 major
I At 4 percent of GDP, health spending in Russia is at approximately the level that would be expected for a middle-income
country. However, it is substantially lower than in OECD countries, which are more appropriate health comparators for Russia.

diagnostic centers. In parallel, there are some 600 hospitals and 1,700 outpatient clinics operated under
the auspices of the Ministries of Defense, Interior, and Railways and other ministries and agencies. In
addition, large enterprises may also operate their own health care facilities for the benefit of their
employees and (sometimes) families and possibly residents of the inmmediate community. The precise
number of facilities in this latter group is not known. The latter two groups of facilities are sometimes
referred to as the "parallel system." Although these are often superior to public facilities because they
are better financed, in principle, they are redundant as their beneficiaries already have access to sinilar
services through the public system.
1.18          The number and capacity of health care facilities is not only adequate, but probably
excessive. However, quality is an entirely different matter. The 1992 State Report indicates that 23
percent of hospitals have no running water; 33 percent have no sewerage system; 60 percent do not have
hot running water; 23 percent of buildings need major repairs; and 2 percent are considered unsafe. The
state of equipment in health facilities is equally poor. Much of the equipment is run-down, out-of-date,
or unusable for lack of spare parts. Most facilities make heroic efforts to maintain their equipment, often
cannibalizing other pieces for spare parts. However, budget shortages for maintenance or new investment
are chronic and these efforts eventually become futile.
1.19          Since 1992, provision and financing (see next section) of health care have been
decentralized to the oblasts. At the oblast level, a typical health care system would comprise a central
oblast hospital (a tertiary-level general hospital with perhaps 1,000 beds, usually the best equipped,
staffed and financed facility in the oblast), several specialty hospitals, e.g., pediatric, emergency,
psychiatric, tuberculosis, one or two maternity homes, several free-standing polyclinics, one of which
m-night be attached to and serve as the outpatient department for the central oblast hospital. Each raion
typically has a central raion hospital (200 to 300 beds) with attached polyclinic and possibly a maternity
home, one or more district hospitals (25 to 50 beds), one or more ambulatories (small polyclinics) and
numerous feldsher stations (primary health care facilities usually staffed by medical personnel known as
feldshers, whose level of training falls between that of a nurse and a physician).
1.20          Although the vast majority of health services are provided by the public system at the
oblast level and below and the parallel system, there is a thin layer of federally financed health facilities.
Federal institutions are generally highly specialized health facilities, often associated with research
institutes, and account for less than 2 percent of inpatient admissions and 1 percent of outpatients treated.
Health promotion is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry (MOHMI) and the
recently (1991) split off State Comnmittee on Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance (SCSES). The
latter has broad public health responsibilities in sanitatiorn, hygiene, epidemiology and some aspects of
environmental protection.
1.21          The provision of health care in Russia is characterized by excessive reliance on curative
and inpatient care. Although, in principle, the MOHMI is responsible for public health, including health
promotion, the level of funding provided is not commensurate to the task (Table 1.4). Consequently,
intervention occurs after a disease has been contracted and treatment often involves a protracted period
of hospitalization. To some extent, medical practice is supply driven by and refites the availability of
hospital beds and physicians. In recent years, there has been a gradual reduction in the number of
hospital beds, and in 1992 the MOHMI reduced the intake of new students into medical academies by
27 percent. Given the large stock of physicians already in the system, it will take considerable time
before this intervention has a significant impact on the total number of physicians.

C. HEALTH FINANCING
1.22           Two of the most positive features of the Russian health care system-universal coverage
and relatively equitable access-derive from the fact that the system is publicly funded. The major
sources of health finance are oblast and raion budgets, territorial health insurance funds, federal budget,
including federal programs implemented by the oblasts, enterprises, households and the Federal
Mandatory Health Insurance Fund.
1.23           During the recent period of economic transition, the Goverrnent has made considerable
efforts to protect social expenditures. While spending on education has declined slightly over the past
three years, the level of health spending has been better preserved in real terms. Total health
expenditures have risen from 2.2 percent of GDP in 1990 to 4.0 percent in 1994, but over a period when
GDP fell by 50 percent and financing requirements have increased. Introduction of the earmarked payroll
tax for health has been an important factor in maintaining the level of health financing, although the
declining wage fund has made this financing vulnerable.
1.24           Until 1992, the sources of health financing were the federal budget, enterprises and de
minimis household expenditures. Since then, the number and significance of other funding sources has
expanded, making it difficult to assemble a comprehensive picture of health sector resources. In 1992,
responsibility for health financing was decentralized to the oblasts. In 1993, a 3.6 percent payroll tax
for compulsory health insurance was introduced; 1994 was the first full year of implementation. The
earmarked payroll tax is collected by a territorial health insurance fund at the oblast level which retains
3.4 percent, and remits 0.2 percent to the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund which is responsible
for oversight and providing equalization payments to economically disadvantaged oblasts.
1.25           As enterprises are privatized, many of them are choosing to shed the responsibility for
social services they provide. By 1994, enterprise spending on social services was estimated to have
dropped to less than half the 1992 level. However, most of the parallel system of health facilities are



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                       Page 7
related to government agencies or ministries (e.g., Ministry of Railways) and are not affected by
privatization. In any case, many of these facilities duplicate those provided by the public system and
beneficiaries could be served by that system with only a marginal increase in costs.
1.26         The majority of household spending on health is for outpatient pharmaceuticals, which
have always been predominantly a self-pay item. Inpatient pharmaceuticals, to the extent they are
available, are provided to patients free of charge. Outpatient pharmaceuticals purchased under a
prescription from a physician at a polyclinic or other outpatient facility, are at the patient's expense,
except for certain categories of patients who receive free or subsidized pharmaceuticals. These include
diabetics, epileptics, psychotics, veterans, pensioners and very young children. In the past, a high
proportion of pharmaceuticals was manufactured in Russia and prices were subject to stringent controls.
Imports, mainly from COMECON (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) countries, were centrally
purchased and were heavily subsidized by the federal budget.  Hence, the cost of outpatient
pharmaceuticals, even to those not entitled to direct subsidies, was quite low. As from January 1, 1994,
all price controls on phannaceuticals have been removed. Most manufacturers have been privatized and
private distributors and retail outlets have been allowed to enter the market. Because prices at the retail
level now reflect market forces, prices are much higher than in the past, and affordability has become
a significant issue, both for individual consumers and inpatient health care facilities. The 1992 State
Report cites the inadequate supply of pharmaceuticals as a major problem for the health care system.
Although availability has improved somewhat since then, affordability has become an even larger issue
(para. 1.29).
1.27         Although the private practice of medicine is now permitted, relatively little is being spent
on privately provided health care. The Russian Constitution adopted in December 1993 guarantees free
health care to all citizens. Current legislation only imprecisely defines the basic package of care.
However, certain non-essential services, such as cosmetic surgery and, in some places, dental services,
are provided as "paid services." The combination of privately provided and "paid" publicly provided
health services probably account for less an 5 percent of total health spending.
1.28         The allocation of health sector resources is heavily skewed toward hospitals and other
inpatient facilities. The spending pattern reflects the health care system's emphasis on in-patent care as
illustrated by the following breakdown of expenditures in 1991.
Table 1.4: Allocation of Health Sector Resources In 1991 (percent)
Public Health                 3
Hospitals                    69
Ambulatory clinics           10

Other                         4
Total          100
Although current national level information is not available, reports from the oblast level indicate that
the allocation for inpatient care has probably been maintained or even increased.

1.29         Wages, pharmaceuticals, and food for in-patients are considered "protected" categories
and cannot be reallocated for other purposes. Even so, since 1990, there has been a significant shift in
the allocation of health spending by category.
Table 1.5: Allocation of Health Spending by Category in 1990 and 1993 (percent)
1990    1993
Wages                     47      27
Payroll Taxes              3       9
Utilities                 11      13
Pharmaceuticals           10       9
Investments               15      23

Other                      14     19
Total        100    100
From 1960 through 1991, wages and payroll taxes accounted for 50 percent or more of total health
expenditures. As noted above (Table 1.3), Russia has a very high proportion of physicians per capita.
Even though the number of physicians is high, health care administrators are generally unwilling to lay
off personnel. So, although the number of physicians remains essentially unchanged, salaries have
continued to be controlled through a system of federal norms managed by the Ministry of Labor, and
have not risen as rapidly as other costs which have been subject to market forces. In fact, a physician's
salary at present is equivalent to about 70 percent of the wages earned by an industrial worker. Health
care administrators fear, with just cause, that the relatively low remuneration of physicians will ultimately
drive many good doctors out of the profession into other, more lucrative, employment. This is already
happening with nurses. In 1993, only half of the graduates of nursing schools in Moscow actually took
up employment as nurses.
D. REFoRMS
1.30         Russia adopted a health insurance law, creating the framework for both mandatory and
voluntary health insurance, in 1991. The mechanism for funding the mandatory health insurance system
(a 3.6 percent payroll tax paid by employers) was established in December 1992. Actual implementation
of the new funding mechanism did not get underway until late (September/October) 1993.
1.31         A major impetus behind the adoption of health insurance legislation was the recognition
that the hiealth care system was under-funded, and the mandatory health insurance funds were intended
to supplement budgetary allocations for health finance. A second objective was to separate responsibility
for financing from the provision of health care to increase the efficiency of the system. There were great
hopes on the part of its proponents that "insurance medicine," as it was called, would produce major
improvements in Russian health care. Although the term insurance was used and the legislation called
for the participation of private insurance companies, the system envisaged was, in essence, a social



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                     Page 9
insurance fund intended to maintain solidarity. Although private insurance companies were to
intermediate between consumers and health care providers, they were to be not-for-profit firms and could
not deny coverage based on differentiating risks. In actual fact, the results of the present system have
been disappointing and many of the original proponents of mandatory health insurance in Russia are ready
to declare the experiment a failure.
1.32         Such a conclusion is unjustifiably negative for a number of reasons. First, the health
insurance legislation was unclear, and thus, allowed for wide variations in its implementation. It contains
many internal inconsistencies and ambiguities, probably as a result of compromises among the different
proponents who supported the adoption of different systems (German-like social insurance, Canadian-style
consumer choice and Israeli-style managed care). Second, because implementation of the health insurance
system coincided with a major economic decline and decentralization of health financing, instead of
supplementing the level of resources for health, the earmarked payroll tax merely served to maintain the
pre-reform level of health spending. However, in 1994, the mandatory health insurance funds accounted
for 22 percent of health spending. Without them, it is entirely possible that health spending would have
decreased by this amount. (During the transition period, real expenditures for education have declined
by 15 percent.) Helping to maintain the level of health spending during the difficult period of economic
transition has been a significant contribution.
1.33         In part because of the impossibility of literally implementing the health insurance
legislation, mandatory health insurance is being implemented differently in various oblasts. In some
cases, it has served to demonstrate the benefit of separating financing from the provision of health care.
In others, the territorial health insurance funds function as a shadow oblast health department; financing
and service provision are still directed by a single agency, but the authority is now vested in the territorial
health insurance fund. Experiments with provider payment mechanisms have demonstrated that health
care providers do respond rationally to payment incentives. A system of reimbursing in-patient care on
the basis of "clinical statistical groups" (somewhat similar to diagnostically related groups or DRGs in
the U.S.) has been developed and continues to be refined. However, development of appropriate
mechanisms for reimbursing outpatient care lag behind and the new payment mechanisms sometimes leave
the ambulatory facilities relatively more disadvantaged than they had been previously.
1.34         Because the impact of the health insurance system has been disappointing, the Government
continues to seek new approaches to health financing, also aimed, in part, at reducing the reliance on
public finance. In parallel with the health insurance reforms, legislation has been adopted which permits
the private practice of medicine and privatization of distribution and sales of pharmaceuticals. Medical
equipment maintenance has also been privatized. Although these are positive steps, the development of
the market response has been constrained by lack of effective demand due to inadequate funding of the
health system. Nonetheless, a basic framework is in place for gradually increasing the private provision
of health services and greater private involvement in ancillary and support services. Despite limitations
in the current system, comprehensive health care is provided to all citizens at a level of funding which
is both affordable to the economy overall and is relatively efficient in terms of administrative costs.
There are important opportunities for increasing the cost efficiency, quality and effectiveness of health
care in Russia. These opportunities could be realized within the existing framework of a publicly funded
system. It remains for the Government to evaluate the tradeoffs between public and private financing and
to establish the parameters within which health sector reform in Russia can proceed.



Page 10                                                                            Introduction
E. GOVERNmENT'S OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
1.35          Inadequate financing of health care facilities (resulting in severe shortages of supplies and
equipment) and reduction of domestic production capacity for pharmaceuticals and equipment are the
concerns most frequently cited by sector officials. Therefore, it is not surprising that the major focus of
health sector reforms to date has been in the area of finance. Another high priority of MOHMI is the
need to reorient the health care system to one with a stronger emphasis and primary and preventive care.
The objectives of the MOHMI and oblast health departments alike has been to provide an adequate basic
package of health care services to the population within the envelope of resources available.
1.36          The Government is also committed to supporting decentralization of heath care financing
and service delivery. This commitment has been expressed primarily through new health financing
legislation, which attempted to mobilize additional resources for the health sector, decentralize decision
making regarding resource allocation, and separate financing from provision of care. Still, appropriate
incentives must be introduced to improve resource allocation (especially to reflect priority for primary
care) by encouraging efficiency and quality of care.
1.37          While the Government's emphases are well placed and constitute necessary interventions
in support of health reform, they are not sufficiently broad in scope to achieve the comprehensive,
affordable level of care which the system aspires to provide. Health reform in Russia will require efforts
in three major areas: (i) restructuring, modernizing and upgrading the health system so it offers the best
possible service package within the available resource envelope; (ii) identifying a reliable and sustainable
source of financing which will provide adequate resources to finance a basic package of services to the
population; and (iii) inducing individuals to take greater responsibility for their own health.
1.38          Restructuring and modernizing the system will require major structural changes in the
health care delivery system. Among the changes envisaged are: greater emphasis on public health and
health promotion activities; rationalizing health care facilities, including eliminating a significant
proportion of hospital beds and closing facilities which do not provide high quality care; decreasing the
number of physicians, while upgrading medical training and reducing the excessive emphasis on
specialization; increasing the role of nurses and medical technicians; and striving to deliver a much
broader range of services through less costly out-patient facilities. While the introduction of the
earmarked payroll tax provided emergency first aid in the area of health finance, reliance on an ill-defined
system whose capacity to generate revenues is so closely tied to the overall state of the economy may not
be the appropriate means of providing a sustainable source of financing which ensures continuous
provision of essential health services. Finally, increasing individual responsibility for health can only be
achieved through programs to educate the public of the impact of lifestyle choices on their health status.
Although such programs currently exist, they have not been effective in influencing behavior and will
undoubtedly need to undergo major redesign to achieve their objectives.

II. BANK STRATEGY AND LESSONS LEARNED ]FROM PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE
A. COuNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR RuSSIA
2.1          The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board on June 6, 1995; a
CAS Progress Report was discussed with the Board on March 28, 1996. Since the last CAS, the Bank
has continued to operate under an Intermediate Case scenario, which remains broadly appropriate in the
current environment. This scenario assumes that there will be continued progress in macroeconomic
stabilization, as evidenced by the recent agreement with the IMF on the Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
program. In this situation, the Bank would aim to provide around $1.2-1.5 billion annually in investment
lending, including a 'core" program of relatively straightforward projects in infrastructure and the social
sectors. In addition, the Bank would be willing to provide up to $1.5 billion annually in relatively fast-
disbursing assistance if substantial progress was achieved on key structural reforms in specific areas of
the economy, such as agriculture and the social sectors, that are critical to the long-term sustainability
of the stabilization process. Over the past year, the Bank has been working with the Govermnent, both
within the framework of the EFF negotiations and in separate discussions, to develop a consensus on
specific programs of structural reforms that would allow these latter operations to move forward. In the
meantime, the Bank has continued to prepare 6-7 priority investment projects as the basis for a sustained
program of Bank support for the Russian economy over the medium term.
2.2          The proposed operation is fully consistent with the CAS described above. In particular,
it would support two of the CAS's main objectives: (i) to moderate the impact of transition on socially
vulnerable groups by maintaining social services and infrastructure while improving the efficiency of
social expenditures; and (ii) to establish the Bank as a trusted and reliable development partner through
the financing of high priority public sector investments and policy advice on key health sector issues.
In terms of the specific sectoral objectives outlined in the CAS, this operation will help to rationalize
investment in the health sector by giving priority to primary and secondary health care facilities. The
proposed project also supports the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry's strategy of emphasizing
primary and outpatient care.
B. HEEALTH SECTOR STRATEGY
Principles of Intervendion
2.3          Russia's current transition to a market economy may increase social strains even further,
producing greater morbidity and mortality. Thus, the situation requires careful health interventions, not
only to stem potential death and disease, but to reverse the recent adverse trends in health status. There
is no one right formula or sequence for reform; nor is there a quick fix that will dramatically improve
the health status of the population and reduce preventable deaths overnight. In spite of the rather grim
picture of health care in Russia, the country is fortunate to have many strengths on which to
build-notably, the almost universal access to care, a system of community-based polyclinics, and a large
base of human resources. To help Russia to capitalize on these assets while reforming its economy and
health care system, Bank interventions in the sector should be guided by the following three principles:



Page 12                       Bank Strategy and Lessons Learned From Previous Bank Experience
a.     Maintaining equitable access to services including coverage of the poor and
vulnerable groups;
b.     Cost effectiveness and affordability; and
c.    Improving the quality of health care to ensure appropriateness, efficiency and
effectiveness.
Strategic Goals
2.4          It should be noted that, although these principles would appear to be just and rational,
they have sparked debate worldwide, and have been difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, they remain goals
to which many countries aspire. Thus, to help the Government achieve them, the Bank would support
the following:
a.     Feasible reforms in health care financing, management and service delivery that
seek to provide efficient, cost-effective, decentralized care;
b.     Primary care, which can result in fewer referrals to higher levels and better out-
patient treatment for common health problems;
c.     The development of public health institutions and medical education that focus
on health promotion and primary care (that involves expanding the discipline of
family medicine); and
d.    Improved technology and facilities at the hospital level, in conjunction with
downsizing the number of beds and facilities.
2.5           The Bank's work program for the health sector would aim to include rigorous sector
analyses that can support well-focused policy advice along with lending that addresses the Government's
primary concerns. Project design would need to reflect the implementation constraints imposed by
administrative and Government structures and by the latter's lack of familiarity with Bank policies and
guidelines. In addition, it would also need to reflect the fact that health care is provided and financed
by regional governments whose needs must be addressed; and, it would try to support the MOHMI and
other federal entities' attempts to define their roles and perform effectively in a decentralized system (as
these structural changes add new layers of complexity). Further, it would attempt to address the issue of
health care financing (in order to provide appropriate incentives and adequate resources), and the delivery
of services, where outdated protocols and organizational structures impede efficient resource allocation.
C. PROPOSED LENDING PROGRAM
2.6           Modernizing and upgrading the health system will require large amounts of investment
in a system where know-how and technology are out of date and infrastructure is run-down from years
of neglect. The focus of Bank support will be to help the various institutions and individuals involved
in health sector reform (federal and local public authorities, health facilities, health workers and
consumers) define and carry out their roles under the changing system. Bank input will consist of
technical advice and investment financing.



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                      Page 13
2.7          In the context of stagnant and declining real resources for social services, the Bank is
developing three projects that are designed to meet (i) the immediate needs for maintaining core services
operating at adequate levels and (ii) longer term objectives of improving resource utilization (efficiency)
and outcomes (effectiveness). In addition to the proposed Medical Equipment Project, there are two other
projects in the lending program which either deal exclusively with or have a significant health component.
2.8           The proposed Health Reform Pilot Project would serve as a template for more
comprehensive health sector reform in Kaluga and Tver oblasts. It would support improvements in health
financing, including more rational use of available resources through appropriate incentives to providers.
It would also address service delivery issues including clinical protocols and provision of care by
appropriate level facilities (e.g., outpatient whenever possible).  Because it will have a longer
implementation period, it can support the development of new approaches to the organization and delivery
of health services, including fundamental reorganization of the health care delivery system to emphasize
ambulatory care. A particular focus of the project would be improving provider payment mechanisms
to introduce incentives for more efficient provision of health services.
2.9           The Community Social Infrastructure Project supports construction-related investments
in three sectors-health, education and water supply. A pilot project directed at Novosibirsk and Rostov
oblasts, it aims to improve the allocation of public expenditures at the oblast level while supporting
rehabilitation and upgrading of inadequate and deteriorating social infrastructure. The project would
primarily finance deferred maintenance and restoration of service capacity of social sector institutions,
such as schools, hospitals and polyclinics.
2.10         While all of the health-related projects in the Bank's lending pipeline have complementary
objectives which target major issues in the sector, comprehenrive health reform in Russia, as in other
industrialized countries, will undoubtedly be a long-term evolutionary process.
D. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREvIous BANK EXPERIENCE
2.11          The proposed Medical Equipment Project would be the Bank's first lending operation
specifically aimed at the health sector of the Russian Federation.  Many valuable lessons of
experience-drawn from other Bank-assisted projects in Russia and from health projects in other
countries-have been taken into consideration during project preparation and have been incorporated into
its design.
2.12          Project performance in Russia is affected by the same issues as in other countries; in
particular, insufficient Borrower ownership of projects and lack of implementation capacity have already
impacted negatively on project implementation. In addition, as a relatively new Borrower, lack of
familiarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines and loan processing procedures has also contributed
to delays in project implementation. The first and second Country Portfolio Performance Reviews
(CPPRs) for Russia in September 1994 and February 1995, respectively, made the following
recommendations to address the implementation issues which have been specifically identified:
a.    Project design should be simple;
b.    An appropriate balance of local and international expertise should be used during
project preparation;



Page 14                       Bank Strategy and Lessons Learned From Previous Bank Experience
c.    Agreement should be reached early with the Borrower on issues such as cost
recovery and nearly all project conditionality should be satisfied by the time of
negotiations;
d.     An implementation unit should be established early during the project preparation
stage;
e.    The PPIU should be properly trained in Bank procedures and endowed with
sufficient authority, staffing, and other resources to perform its responsibilities;
f.     External technical assistance should be provided in areas where the Borrower's
experience is limited, e.g. procurement; and
g.    Implementation delays should be avoided by advancing--as much of the
procurement process as possible to the project preparation stage.
2.13          The first Rehabilitation Loan (L35130) to Russia which financed US$118 million of
pharmaceuticals, raw materials for pharmaceutical production, and spare parts for medical equipment,
provided many practical lessons of experience relevant to the proposed project:
a.     Availability of counterpart funds and applicable taxes should be adequately
appraised in order to minimize delays at the time of delivery;
b.    Procurement organized on the basis of positive "shopping lists" is both possible
and efficient;
c.     Centrally organized procurement can produce substantial price discounts; and
d.    Records are generally well kept which allows for satisfactory inspection,
forwarding and distribution of goods.
2.14          Experience with health projects in other countries underscore many of the above
mentioned lessons. For example, the inadequate capacity of a Borrower to implement human resource
development projects is often a factor in negative project performance. Additionally, the inability of the
Borrower to provide the necessary counterpart funds is mentioned as a particular area of concem in
human resource oriented projects. Bank experience with health projects has in general provided the
following additional lessons applicable to the proposed project:
a.     Participatory project planning is crucial-equipment delivered to a facility should
be based on the needs of that particular facility;
b.     End-users must be trained in the use and maintenance of equipment with which
they are unfamiliar or the equipment risks being under-utilized; and
c.     Questions of sustainability and project risks should be adequately addressed-the
capacity of the Government to mobilize resources to cover future costs should be
realistically assessed.

2.15          In sum, the proposed project has benefitted from the previous experiences of Bank-
assisted projects in Russia and elsewhere. All of the above lessons were taken into account during project
preparation to facilitate timely and successful project implementation. The following chapters will
illustrate how these lessons have been incorporated into the proposed project's design.

III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.1           The purpose of this project is to initiate structural reform of the health care system in
Russia. Specifically, the proposed Medical Equipment Project is designed to:
a.     Increase the availability, range and quality of services provided by primary health
care facilities and raion hospitals;
b.     Reorient service delivery toward more cost effective health care;
c.     Decentralize decision making for capital investments to the facility level; and
d.     Support policy development through the introduction of national health accounts.
3.2           Because of the large number of facilities which are potentially eligible to participate in
the project (up to 700 hospitals and 10,000 polyclinics), the project proposes to monitor its impact on
development objectives by collecting utilization data, on a sample basis, for equipment delivered to each
of the participating oblasts and by establishing that all equipment has been delivered to and installed at
the designated sites.
B. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
3.3            The proposed project has been developed in response to the Ministry of Finance's request
for a quick-disbursing operation which would provide tied in-kind budgetary support to selected oblasts2
to supplement the usual mechanism of untied block grants. Until now the majority of federal budgetary
support has been through the latter mechanism. Even in the cases of specific federal health programs
(e.g., Children of Chernobyl), very often the use of funds is only loosely related to the program
objectives and there is generally little, if any, monitoring of expenditures and outcomes. Therefore, this
operation represents a significant step in terms of federal oblast fiscal relationships in that it would help
to establish a precedent of tying federal budgetary support to well targeted, high priority programs.
3.4           As a preliminary step preceding comprehensive health reform, the proposed project would
strengthen selected facilities-particularly, polyclinics and raion hospitals-whose role would need to be
enhanced to increase efficiency in the provision of health care. Specifically, the equipment supplied
would enable polyclinics to provide, on a less expensive outpatient basis, services currently offered only
in hospitals. Similarly, equipping raion hospitals to provide a wider range of services will avoid
unnecessary referrals to the central oblast hospitals and facilitate follow-up on patients' post-hospital care.
The project would also strengthen the Federal Government's capacity to monitor health spending which
is an essential step in rationalizing health expenditures. The proposed project can, therefore, be justified
on the basis of its contribution in preparing for more comprehensive reform.
2 The Russian Federation comprises 89 oblasts, republics, krais and okrugs. The terms "oblast" and "region' are used
interchangeably within this report to refer to them.



Page 18                                                        Project Objectives and Description
C. PROJECT DESIGN
3.5            Project beneficiaries would be health care facilities in 34 oblasts selected by the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) (see list in Annex A and IBRD Map No. 27183). In order to avoid the need for a
protracted period of project preparation, targeted facilities would select from a carefully developed
"positive" list of equipment which has been designed to provide basic and essential medical equipment
which would be generally useful, even in the event of a major restructuring of the health care system in
the future.
3.6           The strategy underlying project design is to provide inputs that would help meet
immediate needs to support short-term actions aimed at improving the health status while, at the same
time, positioning the targeted facilities to respond to future policy changes geared toward establishing a
more efficient health care system. The targeted facilities include all outpatient facilities plus raion
hospitals and maternity homes. The emphasis on outpatient facilities is intended to position the health
care system to provide a larger proportion of services through ambulatory, rather than in-patient, facilities
in the future. This is a trend which is already well established in other industrialized countries. The
reason for including only raion hospitals and maternity homes as potential beneficiaries is to strengthen
these secondary level facilities to be able to provide services which are now provided by higher level
facilities. Oblast level hospitals (tertiary level facilities) have been excluded from participation, because,
on the whole, they have, in the past, received a disproportionate share of investment funds. Specialized
and district hospitals have been excluded because, in the event of a comprehensive program of
rationalization of health care facilities, many of these institutions would likely be candidates for closure
or redeployment to non-medical uses, such as elder housing.
3.7           One important feature of project design is the requirement that beneficiary facilities be
required to place their own orders. The allocation of the loan to participating oblasts will be made by
the MOF. Participating oblasts will, in turn, indicate the allocations available to participating facilities.
Each participating facility will be provided with an order form which includes estimated delivered cost
for each item and would have to select the highest priority medical equipment within its allocation.
Although simple in principle, this concept is an important innovation in terms of the Russian health care
system where, even following decentralization, these kinds of decisions are not usually made at the
facility level.
3.8           The 34 participating oblasts were selected by the Ministry of Finance and include oblasts
which would otherwise have been eligible for non-earmarked block grants from the federal government.
The allocation of funds among participating oblasts was also determined by the Ministry of Finance. An
analysis of the oblasts selected for participation indicates that they are fairly average overall in terms of
levels of health spending, availability of health facilities and physicians and health status of the
population. Within the parameters described above (para. 3.6), the oblast health department selected the
facilities to participate in the project. Participating facilities will place their equipment orders within the
allocation indicated by the oblast health department. The fact that resources provided under the project
are finite and are not sufficient to meet all the needs of facilities eligible to participate substantially
mitigates the risk of over-ordering by facilities. Facilities will be compelled to assess the tradeoffs and
determine the most productive use of available resources.

D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.9            The proposed project would have three components: (a) medical equipment; (b) national
health accounts; and (c) project management.
Medical Equipment (US$300. 0 million of total project costs)
3.10           The project would finance medical equipment, related supplies and training, furniture,
spare parts and maintenance equipment to targeted health care facilities in 34 oblasts. The target facilities
comprise primary (polyclinics, women's clinics and feldsher stations) and secondary (raion hospitals and
maternity homes) health care facilities. Providing medical equipment to these facilities would increase
the availability and range of health services they are able to provide and would contribute to providing
more cost effective diagnosis and treatment. In the past, such facilities have been neglected in favor of
more sophisticated facilities such as central oblast and specialized hospitals. This intervention would de
facto redirect a significant part of the health sector investment budget to lower level, more cost effective
providers. Health care facilities in participating oblasts would select equipment from an agreed list
prepared to reflect the responsibilities and functions of the facilities (Annex B). As a condition of
participation, project oblasts are required to ensure that beneficiary facilities participate directly in
ordering equipment (para. 7.2 (a)).
3.11           The equipment list has been developed to allow beneficiary facilities to fill the gaps in
medical equipment available in primary and secondary level health care facilities, including maintenance
equipment and spare parts. The list was designed to enable the targeted facilities to meet the following
clinical objectives:
a.     Primary level facilities should perform activities that represent the first contact
between the population and the health care system. These activities include:
i.     Primary outpatient examination;
ii.    Screening of social pathologies;
iii.    Medical support for healthy children (including vaccination);
iv.    Prenatal medical support and care;
v.     Emergency care;
vi.    Chronic disease care (e.g., tuberculosis);
vii.    Education and community support;
viii.   Referral to higher level facilities;
ix.    Short hospitalization; and
x.     Basic diagnostics (small laboratory and basic radiological systems).
b.     Secondary level facilities' activities are complementary to those delivered by
primary care facilities and include:
i.     Medical-surgical emergencies and acute care;
ii.    Deliveries;
iii.    Hospitalization of cases referred by primary facilities;
iv.    Laboratory;
v.     Radiology;
vi.    Medical support for cases referred by the primary level;
vii.    Surgery; and
viii.   Specialized diagnosis and treatment.
Theoretically, only a relatively small number of cases should need to be referred to the tertiary level.



Page 20                                                        Project Objectives and Description
3.12          However, recognizing that the health care network in Russia suffers from excessive
conipartmentalization, the list has also been designed to encourage a reorientation of the system, including
clarifying the respective roles of primary and secondary level facilities.
3.13          In formulating the list of medical equipment which can be provided under the project,
both the present situation in the Russian Federation in terms of epidemiology (mainly the morbidity and
mortality structure) and the organization of the existing health care system were taken into consideration.
The list of medical equipment to be provided under the project would enable health care facilities to deal
more effectively in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, trauma and cancer. The final list of
medical equipment and related supplies reflects the advice of local practitioners and specialists in medical
equipment, the relevant federal ministries, as well as that of foreign experts who have also had experience
with the Russian health care system.
3.14          As mentioned above, the positive list is intended to address the highest priority health
problems identified by analysis of epidemiological data. The major features of the morbidity and
mortality structure in Russia were discussed in Chapter I. In particular, the following were considered
in formulating the equipment list:
a.     High rates of ischemic heart diseases, cerebro-vascular diseases, cancer, and
respiratory diseases.  Equipment to be provided would support screening
programs and simple treatment procedures to address these diseases.
b.     Trauma and poisoning is the second largest cause of death, and, as if affects
mainly younger and middle aged men, it causes a large loss of potential years of
life. Consequently, the equipment list includes items to strengthen emergency
medical care.
C.     Maternal and child health constitute one of the most serious public health
problems in the Russian Federation. This equipment list includes all the
necessary means to strengthen a prenatal care program, including equipment for
antenatal care, deliveries, postpartum care, neonatal care and vaccination (cold
chain).
3.15          Because of regional differences, even similar facilities may have different needs in various
parts of the Russian Federation. These variations mandate that the equipment list should comprehensively
cover the morbidity/mortality structure, including the specific needs of certain regions or oblasts, within,
of course, the functions defined above.
3.16          To help ensure that the equipment would be fully utilized, the proposed project would also
finance necessary consumable supplies, and technical training in the operation and maintenance of the
equipment. Training would be organized by suppliers for medical personnel at participating facilities. In
addition, participating facilities would provide additional clinical training, if needed, in the use of the more
complex equipment (para.7.2 (b)). The project would finance up to about one year's supply of consumables
with the medical equipment provided. As a condition of participating in the project, however, oblast
administrations were requested to ensure that adequate resources be made available so as to make full use of
the equipment (para. 7.2 (c)).

Nadonal Health Accounts (US$3.0 million of total project costs)
3.17          With decentralization of the responsibility for health sector financing and the introduction of
mandatory health insurance in 1993, tracking of health expenditures has become increasingly complicated.
The lack of reliable data on sources and uses of health finance has been a major- impediment to the
development of health sector policy during the economic transitioni. Accurate and timely information on health
expenditures is important for many reasons. It is an essential element in providing the analytical framework
that is needed to: effectively plan and manage health programs; deternine appropriate resource allocations
both within the health sector and among health and other sectors; evaluate the causes of changes in health
status; and facilitate comparisons with health care systems in other countries. During negotiations, overall
agreement was reached on designing and implementing a system of national health accounts (para 7.3 (a)).
Because of the nature of this task, which would cut across ministries and might eventually create the need for
additional mandatory statistical reporting on the part of both public and private entities, it was required that
a governmental decree endorsing this work be issued as a condition of negotiations.
3.18          The project would provide the necessary support to develop and implement a system of
national health accounts (NHA) for Russia. This component would complement ongoing work financed under
an IDF grant to improve the quality of national income and product accounts for Russia and implementation
of this component will be done in conformity with efforts to improve account standards nationally under the
Ministry of Finance. The approach that would be followed is to: develop a framework for national health
accounts which is comparable to those used in other industrialized countries but which respects the existing
statistical reporting conventions in Russia; inventory the sources of data that are currently available; arrange
for existing data to be compiled into NRA format by a designated agency (most likely MOHM); identify gaps
in available data and propose least cost methods for obtaining the required data (Annex C). The proposed
project would include financing of consultant services for survey design and data collection, computer
hardware and software to support this effort and study tours of NHA systems in OECD countries.
Project Management (US$2.0 milon of total project costs)
3.19          A Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPI  has been established as an agent of
the Ministry of Finance to administer and manage the proposed project. The PPIU would continue in
existence through project implementation to loan closing and would then be disbanded. The proposed project
would finance the operating costs of the PPIU, including salaries of long-term consulting staff, office
accommodation, supplies and equipment, utilities, staff travel and training, and consultant services. Although
the PPIU would not continue as an ongoing institution after project completion, staff trained in procurement
and project management would likely be absorbed into other institutions requiring these skldls and would
continue to contribute to the successful implementation of the Government's investment program.
E. ENVIRONMErAL AsPECS
3.20          This is a category "C" project.  No adverse environmental impacts are anticipated.
Participating facilities would be required to certify that physical plant meets established federal safety standards
before ordering equipment, such as radiology eqipmlent, which is subject to such standards.

IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
A. PROJICr CoSIS
4.1           The cost of the project is estimated at US$305.0 million equivalent including duties and taxes.
The estimated local costs and foreign costs by components are shown in Table 4.1 below. Detailed cost
estimates by type of expenditure are contained in Annex D.

BaiL of Cost Eslimates
4.2           Project costs have been estimated in US dollars because of the difficulty in forecasting
inflation rates for local currency. Cost estimates for the medical and other equipment, spare parts and supplies
have been derived from recent studies by local and foreign medical health specialists when developing the list
of goods to be financed under this project. The goods to be financed are appropriate to the basic needs of
the health care system as needed to accomplish the objectives of the project. The staff-month rates for both
the foreign and local specialists are based on actual cost experience in several on-going Bank assisted projects
in the Russian Federation.
Foreign Costs Component
4.3           The foreign costs of each component was estimated as follows: (a) medical and computer
equipment; spare parts and supplies, 80%; (b) studies and surveys-for studies with foreign participation, 90%
and for those carried out by local consultants, 10%; and (c) PPIU operting expenses, 10%. The foreign costs
component of US$226.8 million represents about 78% of total project costs, net of duties and taxes which
reflects the nature of the project (i.e., a high percentage of goods to be procured utilizing ICB and LIB
procedures).

Condngency AUlowances
4.4           Since project expenditures would be limited by the total allocation for the various components,
no physical contingencies have been included. Price contingencies, representing an average of about two
percent of the base cost of the project, have been included on both local and foreign costs, expressed in US
dollars, since a high percentage of the funds are expected to be committed in the first year of implementation.
Taxes and Duties
4.5           The proposed project would be suibject to taxes and duties at rates in effect at the time of
delivery. Medical equipment is currently exempt from both customs duties and taxes. However, multiple use
items (e.g. furniture and some supplies) would be subject to customs duties and taxes. Therefore, an average
total tax rate of 3% has been used. For computer hardware and software, taxes of 21.5% has been applied
to the total estimated cost and 5% customs duties for that portion expected to be imported. Regulations
regarding taxes on consultants varies depending on, inter alia, the length of contract; therefore, taxes have not
been identified and included in the cost estimate.
4.6           The current estimated tax liability of the project (US$8.0 million) is calculated based on the
above described expectations. However, it is recognized that the current tax legislation may change. The
PPIU would continue to monitor any changes in rates or collection procedures related to customs duties and
VAT. The participating regions were informed that they would be responsible for financing all taxes (up to
20% of project costs or US$54 million). Therefore, the participating oblasts would be expected to finance
any increase in project tax liabilities above the current estimated amount.
B. PROJECT FINANCING
4.7           The proposed project is expected to have a total project cost of US$305.0 million (including
taxes and duties of US$8.0 million), with a foreign cost component of US$226.8 million. The proposed Bank
loan of $270 million would finance 100 percent of the foreign costs and 55 percent of local costs excluding
taxes and duties. Participating regions would provide counterpart funds amounting to 45 percent of local costs
(38 percent net of taxes) and 11 percent of total project costs (9 percent net of taxes). In order to participate
in the project, regions would provide the expected counterpart funds and finance all applicable customs duties
and taxes (para. 7.3 (d)). Loan funds would be made available by the Government to participating regions
on a grant basis. The financing plan is shown in Table 4.2 below:

Counterpart Funds
4.8           Counterpart funds collected from the participating regions would be used to finance local
expenses in the amount of US$27 million equivalent. It is expected that these expenses would be related to
the local storage, transportation and insurance of equipment, the services of the Consolidation and Forwarding
Agent, and locally manufactured equipment, spare parts and supplies.
Recurent Cost Implications and Sustainability
4.9           The provision of replacement or additional medical equipment to health care facilities would
result in an increase in depreciation (a non-cash expense) and, in some cases, would create the need for
additional consumable items, such as X-ray film, reagents, etc. As indicated in the financing plan,
participating oblasts are required to contribute about 10 percent of total project costs (plus applicable customs
duties and taxes). The majority of this contribution would likely fall due in the first year of project
implementation. Within this timeframe, the proposed project would finance about one year's supply of
consumables to support utilization of the medical equipment provided. Following this, the participating oblasts
would commit to providing sufficient resources to supply the required consumables (para 3.16).
C. PROCUREMENT
Summary of Procurement Procedures
4.10          The PPIU would be responsible for managing procurement under the proposed project.
A Procurement Consultant would assist the PPIU in all aspects of the procurement process. Procurement
of goods and services would be in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 (revised January 1996) and "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated August 1981.
Standard Bidding Documents (Goods) and Form of Contracts (Services) issued by the Bank would be used
as appropriate for the goods and services to be procured. Goods would grouped in the most efficient
manner possible and the proposed packaging would be reviewed by the Bank. The estimated procurement
arrangements are presented in Table 4.3 and described below.

Procurement of Goods
4.11         Goods (US$283.9 million) consisting of medical and computer equipment, spare parts and
supplies would be procured utilizing the following methods of procurement:
a.    International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be utilized for medical
equipment, supplies and computer equipment estimated to cost US$247.7 million
(87% of total goods) for contracts above US$300,000 equivalent each. It is
estimated that there would be approximately 110 contracts with an average value
of US$2.2 million awarded using ICB procurement procedures.
b.    Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures would be used for purchases,
estimated to cost an aggregate of US$19.4 million (7% of total goods). LIB
would be used for specialized purchases such as endoscopic and ultrasonic
medical equipment where few qualified suppliers are available. The Procurement
Consultant would ensure that all qualified suppliers are invited to bid. It is
estimated that there would be approximately 5 contracts with an average value
of US$3.9 million awarded using LIEB procurement procedures.
c.    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would be permitted for the procurement of
specialized medical instrument sets and furniture with a contract value below
US$300,000 because the local industry is very competitive in comparison to
foreign suppliers. An aggregate limit of US$3.4 million (1 % of total goods)
would be permitted utilizing NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. It is
estimated that there would be approximately 12 contracts with an average value
of US$283,000 awarded using NCB procurement procedures.
d.    International and National Shopping (IS and NS) procedures would be used for
readily available, off-the-shelf items of small value and standard specifications.
It is expected that consumables, non-proprietary spare parts, minor medical
equipment and the PPIU's computer equipment would be procured using ISINS
procedures (2 % of total goods). IS procedures would be used for goods valued
at less than US$300,000 up to an aggregate US$4.3 million. It is estimated that
there would be approximately 40 contracts with an average value of US$215,000
awarded using IS procurement procedures. NS procedures would be used for
such locally available goods valued at less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate
of US$2.0 million. It is estimated that there would be approximately 45
contracts with an average value of US$45,000 awarded using NS procurement
procedures. Three quotations would be required for each of the contract awards.
Under IS procedures, the quotations would have to be from at least three
suppliers from at least two eligible countries.
e.    Direct Contracting (DC) for procurement of spare parts, inter alia, where the
required goods are proprietary and obtainable from only one source may be
utilized with prior review by the Bank. This method would primarily be used
after the first round of bidding for proprietary spare parts and proprietary
consumable items. An upper limit of about US$7.1 million (3% of total goods)
utilizing this procedure is anticipated. It is estimated that there would be



Page 28                              Project Costs, Financing, Procurement and Disbursements
approximately 75 contracts with an average value of US$95,000 awarded using
DC procurement procedures.
f.    Procurement from UN Agencies. Should it be determined that procurement of
medical equipment and supplies could be carried out in a more efficient and
effective way from UNICEF or other UN Agencies, then such procedure could
be used, subject to prior review by the Bank.
Notification of Business Opportunities
4.12         A General Procurement Notice was published in the January 31, 1996 issue of the UN
publication "Development Business" and, as appropriate, would be updated and published annually
thereafter. For goods to be obtained by ICB, individual bidding opportunities would be advertised prior
to the availability of bidding documents and transmitted to potential bidders who expressed interest in
bidding in response to the published General Procurement Notice. These advertisements would be in
English. The specific notice for the first round ICB procurement was published in the April 26, 1996
issue of Izvestia and in the April 30, 1996 issue of the Financial Times.
4.13         In order to encourage the maximum possible competition in supplying medical equipment
to be provided under the project, a business opportunities seminar was conducted in Moscow on
December 8, 1995. The assistance of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry was utilized during
the preparation of the seminar to identify local manufacturers who might be interested in participating.
In addition, the seminar was announced in the November 27, 1995 issue of the daily Moscow newspaper
"Business World" so that any interested suppliers not directly contacted could also participate.
Preference for Domestically Manufactured Goods
4.14         For contracts for goods to be awarded on the basis of ICB, the Borrower may, as set forth
in the Loan Agreement, grant a margin of preference of 15 % or the amount of applicable customs duties,
whichever is lower, to qualified domestic manufacturers of goods. For many of the items to be procured,
it is envisaged that Russian suppliers will be competitive.
Procurement of Consulting and Technical Services
4.15         Specialists and/or consulting firms (US$4.6 million in addition to US$1.5 financed by the
PPF) would be hired on terms and conditions (including review of their qualifications), in accordance
with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated August
1981. The services of the Procurement Consultant (consisting of a joint venture between a foreign and
national firm) have already been contracted following competitive procedures. The provision of these
services, initially financed by the PPF, would continue during project implementation. Other consulting
contracts valued above US$200,000 would be awarded to firms and/or individuals on the basis of
competitive procedures using short-lists. Contracts below US$200,000 may be awarded to firms and/or
individuals on the basis of competitive or direct contracting procedures in accordance with the Guidelines.
4.16         Technical services to be provided by the Consolidation and Forwarding Agent (US$13.5
million) would be obtained by LIB procedures. Work included, inter alia, would be provision of
warehouse space in Russia, receipt and inspection of goods, insurance, consolidation and transport to end-

users. The Project Implementation Plan (Annex J) for further details on the duties and responsibilities
of the Consolidation Agent.
Trining
4.17         For local and overseas training and study tours financed under the project (US$0.6
million) the qualifications of candidates along with their course of study, proposed training institutions,
and costs would be subject to prior review by the Bank. A training plan would be developed as part of
the National Health Accounts component.
Operatng Costs of the PPIU
4.18         All costs of maintaining the PPITJ (US$1.0 million including US$0.5 million financed by the
PPF) would be eligible for financing under the loan, including salaries of long-term consultancy staff, travel,
office rent and utilities, minor office equipment, etc. Operating costs of the PPIU would be expensed on the
basis of on annual budget approved by the Bank and procured in accordance with Bank guidelines and the
procedures agreed upon for goods and consulting services procured under the project. All expenditures are
expected to cost less than US$50,000 each and would be subject to ex-post review.
Project Preparaton Faciliy (PPF)
4.19         To advance project preparation, a PPF in the amount of US$1.0 million (Letter of Agreement
No. 277-0 RU) approved by the Bank on August 2, 1995 and countersigned by the Government on September
6, 1995 has been used to finance the services of the Procurement Consultant. A supplemental PPF of US$1.0
million (Letter of Agreement No. 277-1 RU) was approved by the Bank on March 4, 1996 and countersigned
by the Government on April 2, 1996 to finance the continued services of the Procurement Consultant, other
consulting services, and operating expenses of the PPIU until Loan effectiveness.
Review By Bank of Procurement Decisions
4.20         Prior review of bidding documents for goods, including review of evaluations and
recommendations for award of contracts, would be carried out for all procurement utilizing ICB and LIB
procedures; all recommendations and documentation for direct contracting woulld also be subject to prior
review. To ensure compliance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, the first two tontracts to be
awarded by National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and International Shopping (IS) procedures would be
subject to prior Bank review. The list of goods to be procured and the standardized bidding documents
for these transactions would also be subject to prior review. Contracts for consultant services would be
subject to prior review for those contracts greater than US$50,000 for individuals and US$100,000 for
firms except that TOR for all consulting services shall be reviewed on a prior review basis by the Bank.
Accordingly, over 90 percent (by volume) of procurement transactions would be subject to prior review
by the Bank. The documentation for all procurement transactions not subject to prior Bank review could
be subject to ex-post review during the Bank's periodic project supervision missions.
4.21         After award, should any material modifications or waiver of the terms and conditions of
a contract result in an increase above 15 % of the original price, the Bank would reserve the right of prior
review of such modifications (included would be modifications in contracts for Consulting Services).

Procurement Monitoring and Reporting
4.22          The Procurement Consultant would be responsible for establishing and maintaining a
computerized monitoring and reporting system acceptable to the PPIU and Bank that would, inter alia,
provide an up-to-date inventory of goods procured, consolidated, and delivered to end-users. Status
reports from this system would accompany the PPIU's regular project progress reports sent to the Bank.
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)
4.23          A CPAR has not been prepared for the Russian Federation. A CPAR is scheduled to be
undertaken and a report issued before the end of the current calendar year. For this proposed project,
the Government would follow agreed procurement procedures (in accordance with Bank guidelines) as
described above and as set forth in the Loan Agreement.
D. DLSBURSEMENTS
Schedule
4.24          The proposed loan would be disbursed over about three years which includes six months
for the finalization of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications and other reports. The
disbursement forecast (Annex E) is based on a detailed work program which is advanced due to the use
of the PPF and which Bank staff consider realistic. The estimated project completion date is December
31, 1998 and the loan dosing date is June 30, 1999.
Disbursement Percentages
4.25          The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed as shown below.

4.26         Disbursements would be fully documented except for (i) goods costing less than
$300,000; (ii) technical and consultant services contracted with firms costing less than $100,000; and (iii)
consulting services contract with individuals costing less than US$50,000; and (iv) PPIU operating
expenses less than $50,000 where certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) would be used.
Disbursement/procurement documents using SOE procedures would be retained by the PPIU and made
available to Bank staff and to auditors.
Special Account
4.27         To facilitate payments of small and medium size amrounts in foreign currency and all
payments in local currency, the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the PPIU would open and maintain a
Special Account in US dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to IBRD. The criteria are described in
Annex F. The maximum authorized allocation of the Special Account would be US$1,500,000. The
initial amount to be deposited at the beginning of disbursements would be US$500,000. This amount
could be increased to the maximum authorized allocation once cumulative disbursements have reached
US$2,500,000. The allocation to the Special Account would be replenished on the basis of satisfactory
documentary evidence, to be provided to IBRD by the PPIU, of payments made from the account for
goods and services required for the project. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account,
which have been reconciled by the PPIU, would accompany all replenishment applications. The
minimum application size for payments made directly from the loan account or for the issuance of Special
Commitment is 20% of the Special Account authorized allocation.
Accounts and Auditing
4.28         In addition to the Special Account, the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the PPIU would
establish and maintain a local currency Project Account. Each of the participating regions would directly
deposit its share of the required counterpart funds (10 percent of the loan amount plus incurred taxes and
duties) into the rouble project account following a timetable prepared to coincide with the equipment
delivery. This schedule would be confirmed at the Project Launch workshop scheduled to occur directly
after the bidding documents for the first round of procurement are issued and about 5 months before the
first delivery of equipment.
4.29         The PPIU in coordination with MOF would be responsible for the appropriate accounting
of funds provided under the loan and by the Borrower, would maintain consolidated accounts for the
project and would prepare monthly financial reports, and would ensure that audits of the financial
statements or reports are timely submitted to Bank. Accounting for all Special Account transactions and
for all other project-related accounts would be maintained in accordance with international accounting
standards.
4.30         Project accounts, including the Special Account, maintained by the PPIU would be audited
annually in accordance with the Bank's 'Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects
Financed by the World Bank", dated March 1982 by auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audits would also
be carried out, at the same time and for corresponding periods in accordance with the Bank's guidelines,
for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made from the loan and SOEs
which would be included in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements. The audited
financial statements for the Special Account, project accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal year and
the resulting audit report in such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a
separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified statements of expenditure, would
be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the Government's fiscal year.

V. PROJECT STATUS, IMPLEMENTATION, EVALUATION AND SUPERVISION
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION
5.1          The project is in an advanced stage of preparation. As an early step, 37 oblasts were
identified as eligible to participate in the project and notified of their tentative shares of the loan amount
by the Ministry of Finance (Annex G). Three of oblasts decided not to participate in the project. As a
consequence, the Loan amount was reduced from $300 to $270 million at negotiations. The Bank,
MOHMI, and MOE have agreed upon the final positive list of equipment and supplies eligible for
financing under the project as well as their detailed specifications. Orders for the first round of
procurement have been submitted by the 34 participating oblasts amounting to more than $220 million
of medical equipment and supplies. These orders have been consolidated and the draft bidding documents
prepared by a Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) which has been operational since early
preparation financed by a Japanese Grant and by a Procurement Consultant appointed in December 1995
and financed by a PPF. The PPIU was formally established by MOF, MOHMI, and MOE prior to Loan
negotiations. The PPIU convened a meeting of the selected oblasts in September 1995 to review in detail
the terms and conditions of their participation in the project (Annex I) and to agree on a mechanism for
the timely payment of counterpart fund contributions. Twenty-nine of the participating oblasts have
provided MOF with letters confirming their intent to follow the conditions of participation; the five
remaining letters are expected shortly. Receipt of the letter of commitment is a condition of procurement
for each oblast. Therefore, the bidding documents-advertised in the April 26, 1996 issue of Izvestia and
the April 30, 1996 issue of Financial Times-will be released following submission of the pending letters.
It is expected that by the time of loan effectiveness, a significant proportion of the bidding packages
would be issued and evaluated and the contracts would be ready for signature.
B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.2          The proposed project, to be implemented over a two and one-half year period, would be
managed by the PPIU. Medical equipment to be provided under the project would be selected by the
beneficiary health care facilities in the participating oblasts from an agreed list. As a condition of
participation in the project, each of the participating regions are required to appoint a project coordinator
to organize the region's medical equipment orders, monitor and report on project implementation and
generally liaise with the PPIU (para. 7.2 (e)). The PPIU would be responsible for coordinating project
activities with the participating oblasts and relevant federal ministries, managing procurement, signing
contracts, authorizing disbursements, maintaining project accounts and complying with the reporting and
auditing requirements detailed in the Loan Agreement. A condition of Board presentation was agreement
of the MOF, MOE, and MOHMI on a Regulation (Annex H) which would establish the PPIU with
acceptable authority and responsibilities (para. 7.4). This condition has been met. The authority of the
PPIU to manage the project would be confirmed by the Government when it issues its internal decree on
the implementation of the project following loan signature.
5.3          A Procurement Consultant (consisting of a joint venture between a foreign and local
consulting firm) is assisting the PPIU to prepare bidding documents and would advertise specific bidding
opportunities, distribute bidding documents, evaluate bids, recommend contract awards and supervise the
work of the Consolidation and Forwarding Agent. A detailed work plan to this effect is included as an
attachment to the Procurement Consultant's Inception Report. The Consolidation and Forwarding Agent



Page 34                              Project Status, Implementation, Evaluation and Supervision
would be responsible for receiving and inspecting medical equipment, providing warehouse space and
insurance and ensuring the delivery of the equipment to the final users. Further details on the roles and
responsibilities of the PPIU, the Procurement Consultant and the Consolidation and Forwarding Agent
are included in the project implementation plan presented in Annex J.
5.4          The Ministries of Economy and of Health and Medical Industry have reviewed and
approved the positive list of medical equipment and supplies eligible for financing under the loan. MOE
and MOHMI would also review and approve the detailed specifications of the equipment to ensure that
the specifications meet applicable Russian standards and certification requirements. At negotiations, it
was agreed that equipment and supplies meeting the agreed specifications and requiring certification
would be reviewed by the authorized institutions on priority basis (para. 7.3 (b)). The certification
process should not take longer than four months to complete.
5.5          The PPIU would also work in conjunction with an inter-agency Working Group-headed
MOHMI and comprising representatives of the State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat), MOF,
Ministry of Economy, the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund and the State Tax Service-
established to coordinate the work on national health accounts.
C. REPORTING AND EVALUATiON
5.6          As a condition of participation, the participating oblasts are required to report periodically
on project implementation and equipment utilization (para. 7.2 (f)). The PPIU would submit monthly
progress reports to the Bank. These reports would be submitted fifteen days after the end of each month
following loan effectiveness. The format would be mutually agreed upon prior to the date of the first
submission and would be modified as necessary during the implementation of the project. In addition
to the monthly progress reports, an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be submitted to the
Bank by the PPIU promptly after the completion of the project but in any event not later than six months
after the loan closing date. Included in the ICR would be an assessment on the execution and initial
operation of the project, its costs and benefits derived or to be derived, the performance of the Borrower
and the Bank and other agencies involved regarding their respective obligations and accomplishments,
and lesson learned.
Project Monitoring
5.7          Because of the large number of facilities which are potentially eligible to participate in
the project (up to 700 hospitals and 10,000 polyclinics), the project proposes to monitor its impact on
development objectives by collecting utilization data, on a sample basis, for equipment delivered to each
of the participating oblasts and by establishing that all equipment has been delivered to and installed at
the designated sites. The sample utilization data would be transmitted from the selected beneficiary
facilities to the designated oblast coordinator who in turn would collect and provide the information to
the PPIU. The standard format for this report would be developed at the time of the project review
shortly after the completion of the first round of procurement and when the delivery of equipment begins.
At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would cause the participating oblasts to
install and utilize the provided medical equipment at the intended facilities (para. 7.2 (g)). The terms of
reference for the auditor engaged by the PPIU would include the responsibility to check, on a sample
basis, that equipment is installed at its intended facility and is in proper working order. Project
implementation would be monitored by tracking the volume of contracts awarded and signed, equipment
delivered and loan disbursements.

D. WORLD BANK SUPERVISION
5.8          Because of the compressed timetable for project implementation, intensive supervision
would be required, especially during the first year of implementation. Between 35 to 45 staff weeks and
three missions would, on average, be required each fiscal year to supervise project implementation.
Supervision missions would be staffed, as needed, by Bank staff and consultants knowledgeable in project
management, contract monitoring, biomedical engineering, procurement, and national health accounts.
Supervision requirements detailed in Annex K are based on the assumption that a strong, well staffed
PPIU would be in place throughout project implementation. At negotiations, the Government confirmed
that the PPIU would be adequately staffed and financed throughout the period of project implementation
(para. 7.3 (c)).
5.9          Following completion of the first round of bidding, a comprehensive review of the project
would be carried out to help the PPIU define the activities and timeframe required to complete project
implementation and create a detailed plan for completing the remaining procurement.
5.10         The Moscow Resident Mission would provide day-to-day support on processing
disbursement requests and other issues throughout the project implementation period.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. PRnoJCr JUSFCATION
Framework
6.1           The proposed project is a component of the Bank's overall strategy for assisting the
Russian Federation as set out in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on June
6, 19953. The project directly supports the priority objective described in the CAS to moderate the
impact of the transition by, among other things, naintaining basic social services while improving the
efficiency of public expenditures. By upgrading the stock of equipment in basic health facilities, it
contributes directly to improving the quality of services in the beneficiary facilities. Purthermore, by
redirecting investments to primary and secondary care facilities-a change unlikely to take place without
the project, given historical patterns favoring highly-specialized inpatient facilities-it represents a first
step in undertaking the broader reforms that would make the health system more sustainable and cost-
effective in the long-run.
6.2          It is recognized that renewing the physical stock of basic facilities is only one measure
of many required to achieve the broader reform objective of improving health carein Russia. In addition
to this selective investment, the Russian health system would require, among other things: (i)
introduction of new payment mechanisms that create incentives for more efficient behavior by providers;
(ii) widespread retraining of providers to enable them to shift to more cost-effective and up-to-date
clinical practices, assume greater responsibility for their professional decisions, and understand the new
financing mechanisms that have been introduced under the ongoing health reform (see Chapter I, Sections
D and E); (iii) strengthening of public health programs to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent the non-
communicable diseases that constitute the largest components of the country's disease burden; and (iv)
gradual elimination of excess capacity in inpatient facilities. Each element of the package could,
individually, contribute to improving resource allocation and sustainability in the sector. However, the
full benefits of reform would be attained only with well-coordinated, fully integrated introduction of all
elements, a significantly more complex and long-term undertaking.
6.3           Although the above complementary measures are not a part of the project, the emerging
health policy environment in Russia would encourage, or at least enable, participating oblasts to undertake
them on their own initiative. Under the new Health Insurance Law, new performance-based provider
payment mechanisms have been legalized countrywide and many oblasts are initiating experimnents with
these payment systems, learning from experiments in the late 1980s in the oblasts of St. Petersburg,
Kemerovo and Samara. The practice of Family Medicine was authorized in 1992, and medical academies
in Moscow and St. Petersburg, among others, have started training Family Physicians, who will form
the core of the new generation of primary care providers able to provide greatly expanded services at this
level. A number of federal level institutes, including the Institute of Prevention and the Cardiology
Institute, are helping oblasts introduce new approaches to preventive care, although these changes have
so far focused more on preventive medicine as performed by caregivers in a health facility and less so
on community-based promotion. These various interventions require substantially less investment
financing than measures to upgrade and update the physical capital, and can generally be undertaken by
oblasts, at least on a limited basis, using their own resources.
3A CAS Progress Report was discussed with the Board on March 28, 1996.



Page 38                               Project Status, Implementation, Evaluation and Supervision
6.4           When the present project was conceived, a strategic choice was made to focus the range
of the interventions to investments in medical equipment, thus simplifying the project considerably. This
would allow broader geographic coverage and generate quick, visible results, an important consideration
for a first operation in a sector where full reform would take years, even decades to complete.
6.5           A second Bank operation for the health sector in Russia, the Health Reform Pilot Project
which was appraised in January 1996, would apply a more integrated approach to health reform at the
oblast level. That project involves a pilot experiment in two oblasts to: (i) test various forms of provider
incentives that encourage cost effective and cost-conscious service delivery; (ii) restructure the delivery
system with a strong emphasis on Family Physicians as primary care providers, and reduction in inpatient
capacity; and (iii) introduce approaches to management of maternal and child health and cardiovascular
disease that stress prevention and promotion. That project would also support national and regional
training programs in Family Medicine through the Moscow Medical Academy and organize activities to
monitor, evaluate and disseminate project results. In contrast with the present project, this more
comprehensive-and complex-approach to health reform has the disadvantage of very limited geographic
coverage and slower implementation. However, dissemination activities of the project are expected to
help transfer the knowledge and experience gained to other oblasts. Future Bank interventions in the
health sector in Russia will likely be a cross between the Health Reform Pilot Project and the present
project, with the broader reform agenda of the former but with wider geographic coverage, using the
methods for more flexible and quicker disbursement developed for the latter.
6.6           Beyond its contribution to health sector objectives, the project contributes to the
macroeconomic objective of improving budget management practices. By introducing a simple
mechanism for realizing federal transfers to oblasts in a manner that ties them to priority objectives in
one sector, this project could pave the way for broader application of tied transfers, with an element of
counterpart financing, that would replace the current practice of untied cash transfers to oblasts. These
cash transfers are widely seen as an inefficient use of federal resources, and a lost opportunity to
encourage oblasts to allocate public resources to national priorities in a wide range of sectors.
Project Design Features
6.7           The project is an exceptionally simple, quick-disbursing investment operation that
nevertheless retains features that ensure that: (i) selection of investments is consistent with priority
sectoral objectives; (ii) oblasts and health facilities are actively involved in project implementation and
finance; (iii) procurement is organized in such a way as to maximize economies of scale.
6.8           Selection of Investments. The project guarantees consistency with sectoral priorities
through the use of a positive list of equipment to be purchased and by limiting access to project resources
to specific types of facilities. In formulating the positive list, both the present situation in the Russian
Federation in terms of epidemiology (mainly the morbidity and mortality structure) and the organization
of the existing health care system were taken into consideration. The selected equipment would enable
health care facilities to deal more effectively in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, trauma
and cancer, the highest priority health problems identified by analysis of epidemiological data. Equipment
to be provided would support screening programs and simple treatment procedures to address these
diseases.
6.9           By targeting the project to primary and selected secondary level facilities, support is being
directed to the most cost effective institutions which have been disadvantaged by less resource allocation



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                              Page 39
in recent years.4 Federal, tertiary and highly specialized institutions have been excluded from the project
because of: (i) the need for strengthening capacity for early health care interventions and out-patient
services provided mainly in primary and secondary regional institutions; (ii) the greater share of capital
expenditures historically provided to federal and tertiary care providers has left them better equipped
relative to other levels; and (iii) they serve a smaller proportion of the population at relatively high costs.
6.10           Directing needed equipment to lower level facilities is expected to have additional benefits
by reducing dependence on tertiary and specialized facilities, thereby allowing selective downsizing of
these more expensive facilities and shifting capacity into services not currently offered or undersupplied.
Indirectly this serves to improve the quality of health care throughout the system.
6.11           Cost effectiveness of the specific investments has been ensured by including on the
equipment list only those items which are both high priority in terms of enabling the target facilities to
meet their mandate for provision of services and the most cost effective in diagnosing and treating patients
given the epidemiological profile in Russia.
6.12           Local Involvement. In keeping with the recent move to decentralized management of
health services, the project introduces opportunities for local authorities to participate in implementation,
while sharing responsibility for project financing. Although oblast-wide allocations out of project funds
are determined at the federal level, the choice of participating facilities and their respective allocations
are determined by oblast authorities, within the predetermined selection guidelines. Managers of selected
facilities then make the choice as to how their respective allocations are used for specific items of
equipment, chosen from the positive list for the entire project. In return, oblasts are expected to
contribute 10 percent of base costs of the project and finance all taxes and duties due on the equipment,
and ensure sufficient budgets for supplies needed to operate the equipment.
6.13           Organization  of Procurement.   Following  decentralization  of health  services
management, responsibility for procurement of medical equipment has been delegated to the individual
facility. Under these arrangements, opportunities for pooling resources to gain price advantages on larger
orders have been lost. The project introduces a mechanism for pooling resources for procurement which
could be continued beyond the life of the project if it proves to generate important cost savings.
6.14           The introduction of standard international competitive bidding procedures is also an
important innovation in Russia. Although the Bank's requirement to apply competitive procurement
procedures met initially with strong resistance, MOHMI and other federal authorities now appear to
recognize that the interests of the health care delivery system needs to be viewed separately from those
of the medical industry. It is hoped that the infusion of considerable resources for the purchase of
equipment as well as the experience of competing with international suppliers will benefit the national
industry in the long run.
Summary of Benefits
6.15           The most immediate impact of the project would be to increase the availability, range and
quality of services provided by the participating primary health care facilities and raion hospitals. Over
1200 facilities in 34 oblasts with a total population of 63.1 million (43 percent of the Russian population)
' Certain secondary level institutions (eg. district hospitals) are also excluded because in some instance they are poorly
staffed, provide low quality care and are not deemed priorities for new equipment. Many of these facilides will likely be closed
or redeployed in the course of subsequent restructuring and rationalization.



Page 40                                Project Status, Implementation, Evaluation and Supervision
would participate in the project. Moreover, the preponderance of primary and secondary facilities under
the project are located in relatively remote areas, serving a population that has in general received less
attention and poorer quality care. Hence, a further consequence of the project would be directing a
greater share of health care resources to less well-serviced districts within oblasts, helping more
vulnerable communities to gain access to quality care. Moving health care services down to primary and
secondary institutions will also facilitate ease of access and reduce associated costs (transport, time, etc.),
particularly for more remote towns and villages.
6.16          One of the project's more important benefits would be in creating the potential for more
significant benefits in the medium and long term as changes introduced by the project are built upon to
implement more comprehensive structural reforms. These longer term benefits of the project arise from
both diversifying sources of diagnostic and treatment services and shifting provision from inpatient
towards outpatient care. Major cost savings can be achieved if complementary steps are taken to reduce
the number of hospital beds and close tertiary care facilities which have been maintained through a system
excessively focussed on tertiary and specialized care.5 This project does not directly provide for such
restructuring, but will serve to shift orientation of health delivery and create an environment more
conducive to more systemic restructuring in five to ten years time.
6.17          As a further benefit the loan would also finance the creation of national health accounts.
A system of national health accounts is considered essential both to administering a national health system
and to effectively monitoring budget execution by national and regional authorities. It allows the
Government to monitor health expenditures in a detailed and timely manner, providing valid data for the
planning and management of health insurance and health care finance.
B. PROJECT RIs
6.18          Because of the project's simple design and structure, the considerable risks often identified
with complex health projects are avoided. The specific project risks relate mainly to the coordination and
implementation activities including including procurement and the logistics of delivering and installing
equipment in more than 1200 facilities-each with its unique selection of equipment-in 34 oblasts located
accross the 11 time zones of the Russian Federation. To avoid delays in implementation, a PPIU was
established and staffed early during preparation, and is being strengthened as the volume of project
activities increases. A procurement consulting firm was also engaged early, initially financed by a Project
Preparation Facility. The use of eight regional warehouses as intermediate delivery points and the
planned engagement of a consolidating and forwarding agent would address the logistical problem.
Agreement was reached with Government during negotiations that equipment meeting the agreed
specifications which require certification should be approved on an accelerated timeframe. This should
also expedite project implementation.
6.19          The achievement of project objectives is also contingent upon the availability of spare
parts, consumable supplies, and personnel trained in the use and maintenance of the equipment provided.
The risk that these requirements might not be met has been mitigated by the following features of the
project design: (a) a one year supply of consumables will be provided with all items of equipment
requiring such supplies; (b) participating oblasts will give an undertaking that the necessary resources will
' Based on the most cost-effective health care delivery experiences in OECD countries, it is estimated that there is scope
in the Russian health care system for reducing the cost of hospital care by up to 50 percent and the number of physicians by
up to 40 percent.



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                         Page 41
be provided to cover the cost of supplies in subsequent years; (c) participating facilities will be monitored
to ensure that equipment is installed in the facility for which it was ordered and that it is being utilized;
(d) in parallel with ordering equipment requiring skilled operators, participating facilities must designate
and certify the appropriate training of the operator; and (e) equipment suppliers would be required to
provide training on operating and maintaining the equipment supplied.
6.20          Finally, review of the project tentatively scheduled for late 1996 following completion
of the first round of procurement, would elaborate the activities and timing required to complete project
implementation in a timely and efficient manner.

Annex C: National Health Accounts
1.    Establishing a system of national health accounts is of critical importance to the development of
health policy in Russia during the current period of economic transition and beyond. Such a system
would provide adequate data to support analyses, not only of the structure and utilization of the resources
of the health care system, but also of the options being considered to reform the system of health care
financing.
2.     The term "national health accounts" refers to an accounting framework for health care spending
which classifies total health spending by source of funding and types of expenditure to which that funding
was applied. Such a framework is required to effectively plan and manage health programs; determine
appropriate resource allocations both within the health sector and among health and other sectors; evaluate
the causes of changes in health status; and facilitate comparisons with health care systems in other
countries. In most industrialized countries, national health accounts are prepared annually and serve as
one of the major tools supporting the development of health policy.
3.     Up to 1991, the vast majority of financial resources for health sector in Russia were provided
either by direct budgetary allocations through the Ministry of Health or indirect allocations through some
21 other agencies/ministries which operated health facilities for their employees and dependents in parallel
to those available to the general public. Accordingly, the normal budgetary reporting mechanisms were
able to capture the bulk of health spending by type of facility. With the subsequent decentralization of
the responsibility for health sector financing to the oblast level and introduction of the system of
compulsory health insurance, tracking of health expenditures has become increasingly complicated. As
the Government considers expanding the range of services for which full or partial payment is required
from patients, the prevalence of private voluntary health insurance increases, and private health care
providers enter the market, an increasing share of health financing is likely to be provided from non-
budgetary sources; the existing system of reporting on health financing will capture a decreasing share
of total expenditures.
4.    As the Government reviews options for restructuring health care in Russia, either by introducing
new structures and organizations for the delivery of health care services or by introducing new health
financing mechanisms, the information on sources and utilization of funds by the health care system will
be an important analytical tool supporting informed decisions. At present, budgetary resources, both
federal and territorial, and funds channeled through the mandatory health insurance system comprise the
two major sources of health financing. Other sources include enterprise spending either on direct
provision or procurement of health services for their employees, extra-budgetary funds and household
expenditures for items such as outpatient pharmaceuticals. It is estimated that budgetary allocations for
health plus the funds provided under the mandatory health insurance system may account for as much as
90 percent of total health spending in Russia. At present, good quality, comprehensive data exist on both
of these sources but the data are not compiled in a framework that facilitates analysis. In addition, less
detailed information on health spending by enterprises and extra-budgetary funds is reported to
Goskomstat, but these data are also not compiled in a way that would facilitate analysis.
5.    Russia has long collected and maintained a very comprehensive data base on health status and
capacity indicators. Annual reports are prepared by the oblast health departments and forwarded to the
Ministry of Health and Medical Industry for consolidation and analysis. The consensus among local
experts is that the existing reporting mechanisms could be modified to support the compilation of national



Page 52                                   Annex C: Development of National Health Accounts
health accounts. As the system of reporting to MOHMI is already well established, it appears to be most
practical to enhance this system. The incremental effort should be minimal. However, consensus among
local experts is that voluntary reporting is unlikely to work in the Russian context, as existing statistical
reporting systems are all based on mandatory reporting. Health financing data would need to be collected
from each facility and aggregated at the usual levels, i.e., by oblast and federation wide.
6.    Because of the nature of the this task, which would cut across ministries and might eventually
create the need for additional mandatory statistical reporting on the part of both public and private
entities, a governmental decree sanctioning this work [would be] required. The decree [is] a condition
of negotiations of the proposed project. Compiling and publishing national health accounts on a regular
basis would involve the participation and collaboration of a number of stakeholders.
Stakeholders
7.    Ministry of Health and Medical Industry (MOHMI). MOHMI has an established reporting
structure with all health care providers. Although at present the data collected relates primarily to health
status and the capacity of facilities, it is anticipated that the most efficient means of obtaining the primary
data for national health accounts would be to mandate that all health care providers also report on their
sources of funding.
8.    State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat). The role of Goskomstat would be primarily be
that of technical advisor. They would play a key role in helping to design the survey instrument
circulated by MOHMI and would develop mechanisms for cross-checking the primary data with data
collected in conjunction with compilation of the national income and product accounts.
9.    Ministry of Finance (MOF). The consolidated budget (federal, territorial and municipal/local)
still provides the bulk of health sector financing in Russia. So long as the health care system in Russia
remains mostly publicly financed, the executed budget reports, which are submitted annually to MOF,
provide another important source of information on health spending. These data would be used as
primary data until a detailed provider reporting mechanism is implemented and, thereafter, to assess the
reliability of data collected by health care providers reporting directly to MOHMI.
10.   Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (FMHIF). The second most important source of
health sector financing comes from the 3.6 percent earmarked payroll tax collected by the Territorial
Health Insurance Funds (THIFs). The THIFs submit quarterly and annual reports to the FMHIF which
will serve as a primary source of data until the detailed provider reporting mechanism can be
implemented.
11.   State Tax Service. Income tax returns of enterprises may serve as a source of data on health
spending by commercial (i.e., non-budgetary) enterprises, again as a primary data source in the near-term
and as a secondary source once a provider reporting system is in effect.
12.   Local Consultants. It has been proposed that the most expedient way to complete the design
work required to create a system of national health accounts would be to establish a task force staffed by
local consultants who are able to devote full time to this task. The task force would be guided by a
Steering Committee comprising representatives of all of the relevant agencies.



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                     Page 53
13.   Foreign Consultants. Foreign consultants would also be employed as needed to provide advice
and guidance on specific technical issues. A partial list of technical issues which must be addressed is
presented below.
National Health Accounts Format
14.   A preliminary format (attached) for national health accounts for Russia has been designed with
the assistance of local and foreign experts. The proposed format suggests an accounting system which
reflects the current configuration of the Russian health care system and the data reporting format which
is familiar to health care institutions.
15.   For types of health care spending, the rows of the table include:
a.    ten types of personal health care spending (1.1 through 1.10) which correspond to the
line items in the executed budget reports submitted by oblasts plus pharmaceuticals
(1.11), which appear to capture most personal consumption of health care goods and
services in the Russian system;
b.    five types of public health service spending (2.1 through 2.5) which also correspond to
line items in the territorial Executed Budget Reports and which capture the variety of
public health activities;
c.    medical research (3.0); and
d.    capital investments related to health care.
16.   This presentation was developed to reflect the existing structure of the health care system in
Russia. In addition, consideration should be given to including additional categories which may be
expected to represent and increasing share of health services provided in the future.
Issues
17.   Sources of Funding: Accrued debt as a source of payment for health care services - Actual
budgeted payments for incurred expenses related to health care services may be supplemented from time
to time by proceeds from short-term loans in order to pay incurred expenses not covered by actual budget
payments. Alternatively, actual budgeted amounts may exceed actual incurred expenses related to health
care services and this surplus budget amount may be used to retire loans previously incurred in periods
of budget shortfalls. Since the health accounts focus on incurred expenses for health services and sources
of funds used to finance those expenses in a particular time period, it would be preferable to include the
actual expenses incurred by type(s) of expenditure, the actual budgeted amount spent for the type(s) of
expenditure as one source of payment and any funding by proceeds from loans as a separate source of
funding (perhaps categorized as "Other") in the accounts. On the principle that the accounts should show
incurred amounts rather than cash flow amounts, any future surplus budget amounts that are not spent
on current expenses for health care but are used to retire loans would not be shown in the accounts.
18.   Types of Expenditures:
a.    Capital expenditures - Purchases of medical equipment (chapter 12 in the Executed
Budget Report) appear under each facilities category as a recurrent expense. Under



Page 54                                   Annex C: Development of National Health Accounts
generally accepted international accounting principles, these expenditures would be
counted as a recurrent expenses if they comprise relatively minor repairs or if they had
an expected life of less than one year, but would be counted as a capital expenditure if
the equipment had an expected life of one year or more. Durable medical equipment
(that is, with an expected life of one year or longer) should be reported under the
investment category in NHA.
b.    Construction of health facilities - Capital investments (paragraphs 140 in the Executed
Budget Report) should comprehensively include both buildings and fixed (that is, attached
to the building) medical equipment.
c.    Pharmaceuticals - Spending on outpatient pharmaceuticals may well be the most
significant item of household spending on health at the present time. Accordingly, it
would appear to warrant reporting as a separate category of expenditure. In order to
fully count total spending on pharmaceuticals, the amounts spent by hospitals and
ambulatory facilities would have to be deducted from these categories and added to the
pharmaceuticals category. Information on total turnover provided to the State Tax
Service might serve as one source of data for this category. However, retail pharmacies
may sell to both individual patients and institutions. Care must be taken to avoid double
counting of the pharmaceutical subsidies paid by polyclinics to retail pharmacies on
behalf of patients who are entitled to discounts (children, veterans, the elderly, diabetics,
etc.). In the OECD, Canadian and U.S. health accounts, the cost of pharmaceuticals
consumed during institutional care (e.g. by hospitals or ambulatory facilities) is included
as institutional care and is not counted separately as a pharmaceutical type of expenditure.
Only prescription drugs or non-prescription drugs (i.e. self-medication drugs) sold by
retail outlets (e.g. a pharmacy) are included as a separate pharmaceutical expense in the
accounts.
d.    Financial reserves of health insurance funds and health insurance companies -
Health accounts in some OECD countries, Canada and the U.S. display the difference
between incurred insurance premiums paid to private insurance companies (that is, non-
governmental insurance funds) and incurred benefits payable. The amount includes costs
for administration of the private health insurance plan and any net additions to (or
subtractions from) to health insurance reserves. In the U.S., regulation of private health
insurance reserves is usually under the jurisdiction of the states rather than the federal
government. The amounts for private health insurance administrative costs and net
additions to (or subtractions from) insurance reserves are added to administrative costs
for government insurance programs and reported in the health accounts as either "health
administration" or "prepayment administration." Territorial Health Insurance Funds and
private (voluntary) health insurance companies in Russia have also been accumulating
reserves and investing in the local securities market.
e.    Medical education is included as a type of health spending in national health accounts
in several of the OECD countries. The United States, however, does not include the
aggregate cost of medical education in its national health accounts. If Russia chooses to
include medical education, a primary data source would need to be identified.
f.    Federal Programs - It has been suggested that federal programs for health (for
example, maternal and child health, emergency medical care, etc.) might be presented



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                   Page 55
as a separate expenditure category. In fact, these programs actually represent one of the
forms of direct federal budgetary support and the related expenditures would be for the
purchase of medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, support to specific hospitals or clinics,
etc. Accordingly, federal programs for health would appear as a source of funding under
the federal budget column of the national health accounts format, and expenditures would
be distributed over the categories for which the funds were actually used.
g.    Orphanages - One principal objective of the health accounts is to focus on spending
that relates primarily to health care. The boundaries between some types of social
welfare spending and health care spending are sometimes not clearly defined. For
example, although minimal health care may be provided in orphanages, the primary type
of care is custodial. Thus, spending for orphanages is excluded in most countries' health
accounts. The appropriateness of including orphanages in Russia's NHA needs to be
evaluated.
h.    Other long-term care - As noted above, custodial care is excluded from health care
spending in most countries' national health accounts. If the funding provided by off-
budget social funds includes such items as homes for the elderly or the poor which do
not include a significant component of nursing or other health care, consideration should
be given to excluding these amounts.
.     Terrltorial health networks -  Although the prevalence of this experiment with
integrated delivery systems is declining, territorial health authorities continue to report
expenditures in this category. In 1991, for example, 12 percent of health spending was
attributable to territorial health nietworks. If the amount continues to be significant, a
mechanism should be developed for estimating the amount of such spending attributable
to hospitals versus the amount spent for ambulatory care.
j.     Central bookkeeping and howebeeplng services are not in and of themselves health
services. Therefore, a methodology should be developed for allocating the costs of
budgetary spending on these categories to specific service groups.
k.    Administrative Expens - The administrative expenses incurred by specific health care
facilities would be included in their financial reports to MOHMI. However, the
administrative expenses of the FMHIF, THIFs and private insurers need to be captured.
19.   Other Isue.:
a.    Anidipated reforms - Any significant reforms expected in the types of health care
services provided (ie. introduction of free-standing family practitioners, private facilities,
etc.) should be considered and accommodated in the health accounts format.
Consideration should also be give to how related expenditures would be measured.
b.    National vs. regional health accounts - Although national health accounts are of
paramount importance, regional health spending estimates may provide important
information to policy makers which is not apparent in the national estimates. Two key
issues that emerge from regional analyses of health spending are:
L.    variations in health spending per capita among regions. Significant
disparities may require further analyses of health budget allocations



Page 56                                   Annex C: Development of National Health Accounts
and/or availability of health care resources, important considerations in
preserving equal access to comparable levels of health care.
ii.    variations in health care practices among regions. Significant disparities
in health spending by type of health provider may point to the need for
further analyses of distributions of the various types of health care
providers and/or variations in practices of health care providers in
different regions. Such variations in health care practices may indicate
more (or less) efficient use of health care resources, thus providing
models of health care that might be adopted (or avoided) elsewhere.
A potential difficulty in preparing regional health spending estimates is that the types of
information available at the federal level may not be available at the regional level.
c.    Adding a third dimension for expenditure data on inputs - The Executed Budget
Reports provide a breakdown of expenditures by input type (e.g., wages, food, etc.) and
type of service (e.g., hospitals, polyclinics). Consideration should be given to whether
collecting these data, when available, would be useful in terms of policy analysis. If so,
the system should be initially designed to include it, even if not available for all types of
service.
d.    Price deflators -  If good quality price deflators are not currently available for
converting nominal health spending into real spending in order to facilitate comparisons
over time, the process of developing national health accounts would provide a good
opportunity to fill this important gap.
e.    Time series - One of the major benefits of developing a comprehensive system of
national health accounts is to facilitate comparisons over time. Even though some prior
year data would not be totally comprehensive, consideration should be given to compiling
whatever data are available in the national health accounts format from 1985 to the
present date.
20.   Based on the advice and conunents of local experts, a two-pronged approach involving
compilation of existing data in parallel with the development of a more comprehensive system of data
collection on health financing, is recommended. The proposed approach is based on the understanding
that at present the Ministry of Finance has access to all budgetary data (both federal and territorial) except
for certain strategic agencies, such as the Ministries of Defense and Interior. Another significant data
base is maintained by the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund. Goskomstat has access to less
detailed data on enterprise spending for health as well as expenditures from certain extra-budgetary funds.
21.   The proposed approach would involve compiling existing data for recent years in national health
accounts format and then improving the comprehensiveness of the data each year from 1996 to 1998 by
including data which are currently not readily available. The proposed scheme would represent an
evolutionary approach as follows:
1995 - compile existing data, beginning with 1994 in national health accounts format, creating
a time series back to 1985
1996 - compile 1995 data, including strategic ministries and agencies



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                   Page 57
1997 - comnpile data for 1996 from all sources included in 1995 reporting, but based on direct
surveys of health facilities
1998 - compile data for 1997 based on new national health accounts methodology
A more detailed action program with a specific timetable would be agreed upon during negotiations.

Annex G: Letter to Participatlng Regions from the Minishtry of Finance
To: (Head of Regional Administration)
Dear Sirs,
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation together with other interested ministries is
preparing a project on delivering medical equipment to particular health facilities in regions selected on
the basis of objective criteria which would be financed from an IBRD loan of US$ 300 million.
The intent is to use the loan funds for budgetary support of the health sector in regions in 1996-
1997.
The main objective of the project is to improve the operation of town and raion polyclinics,
women's consultations, feldsher stations, raion hospitals and maternity homes by providing them with
medical instruments and modem medical equipment to reorient service delivery toward outpatient care.
To coordinate the work of all organizations participating in preparation and implementation of
the project, a Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) has been established. It operates on
the basis of the Regulations on PPIUs.
After assessing the state of medical service delivery system in the Russian Federation a
preliminary list of regions, which are intended to receive loan financing, was defined. Your region is on
this list.
Participating regions would be able to select from proposed lists of equipment for above
mentioned facilities. Necessary consumables are included to complement the equipment to be provided.
Training of medical and technical staff in use of the supplied equipment and instruments would also be
included in the project.
The project could also provide spare parts for existing equipment in any health facilities.
In order to participate in the project you should fulfill the following conditions:
1.    counterpart funding from the region budget up to 30% of the project costs to finance
transportation and storage costs inside the country, and expenditures due to the payment of possible
custom duties and taxes if there are any at the time of deliveries;
2.    the supplied equipment should be utilized strictly in the identified medical facilities which
will be listed by the region in its equipment orders. Regions will be expected to report on utilization of
the equipment for up to two years after delivery and installation;
3.    up to delivery time, premises for installation of equipment should be prepared, medical
and technical personnel should be selected, and conditions for training in use and maintenance of the
supplied equipment should be provided;



Page 66                   Annex G: Letter to Participating Regions from the Ministry of Finance
4.    ensure that during the specified period the region will finance from its budget purchases
of consumables and technical services required for normal operation of the supplied equipment; and
5.    to coordinate project implementation, the regional authorities would appoint a coordinator
who will work in close cooperation with the project preparation and implementation unit. The
coordinator would submit to the PPIU semiannually reports on relevant local staff training, operations
of the equipment and other aspects of the project under PPIU's requirements during two years after
installation.
Attached to this letter are preliminary equipment lists. Later on you will receive detailed
specifications and forms to fill in orders. Because it is important to involve head doctors and leading
specialists of the facilities receiving equipment, a sufficient number of forms will be provided, so that
each facility can place its own order.
You will receive additional information on how the counterpart funding will be organized.
Loan funds in the amount of US$_ million would be allocated to your region as budgetary
support and would not have to be repaid.
To discuss in detail questions connected with the project, the PPIU is going to arrange a
conference with representatives of the regions confirming their participation in the project in Moscow in
August.
Please notify the Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (Victor Pastoukhov, Director, tel.
(095) 246-7970, fax (095) 246-1537, address: Room 301, 3/5 Smolensky Blvd., Moscow) about your

Annex I: Partidpating Oblast Commitments
Letter of      Oblast (Krai, Republic) Commitment
to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation
Referring to the proposed loan agreement, between the Russian Federation and the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the Medical Equipment Project (the "Project"), the
Administration of           (name of the oblast(krai, republic)) (the "Administration")  hereby
confirms its comnmitinent to the objectives of the proposed Project, i.e. to increase the availability and
range of services provided by primary health care facilities, raion hospitals and maternity homes and to

Annex J: Project Implementation Plan
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.            The proposed project is designed to: (a) increase the availability, range and quality of
services provided by primary health care facilities and raion hospitals; (b) reorient service delivery toward
more cost effective health care; (c) decentralize decision making for capital investments to the facility
level; and (d) provide support for policy development in the health sector, by introducing a system of
national health accounts.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTON
2.            The proposed project would have three components: (a) medical equipment; (b) national
health accounts; and (c) project management.
Medical Equipment (US$300.0 million of total project costs)
3.            The project would address the lack of equipment in primary (polyclinics, women's clinics
and feldsher stations) and secondary (raion hospitals and maternity homes) health care facilities in 34
selected oblasts. Providing medical equipment to these facilities would increase the availability and range
of health services they are able to provide and would contribute to providing more cost effective diagnosis
and treatment. In the past, such facilities have been neglected in favor of more sophisticated facilities
such as oblast hospitals. This intervention would de facto redirect a significant part of the health sector
investment budget to lower level, more cost effective providers. Health care facilities in participating
oblasts will select equipment from an agreed list prepared to reflect the responsibilities and functions of
the facilities. To help ensure that the equipment would be fully utilized, the project would also finance
necessary consumnable supplies, technical training in the operation and maintenance of the machines, and
clinical training in the use of the more complex equipment.
Natdonal Health Accounts (US$3.0 milion of total project costs)
4.            With decentralization of the responsibility for health sector financing and the introduction
of mandatory health insurance in 1993, tracking of health expenditures has become increasingly
complicated.  The lack of reliable data on sources and uses of health finance has been a major
inpediment to the development of health sector policy during the economic transition. Accurate and
timely information on health expenditures is imnportant for many'reasons. It is an essential element in
providing the analytical framework that is needed to effectively plan and manage health programs;
determiine appropriate resource allocations both within the health sector and among health and other
sectors; evaluate the causes of changes in health status; and facilitate comparisons with health care
systems in other countries.
5.            The project would provide the necessary support to develop and implement a system of
national health accounts for Russia. This component would complement ongoing work financed under
an IDF grant to improve the quality of national income and product accounts for Russia. The approach
that would be followed is to develop a framework for national health accounts which is comparable to
those used in other industrialized countries but which respects the existing statistical reporting conventions



Page 76                                               Annex J: Project Implementation Plan
in Russia, inventory the sources of data that are currently available, arrange for existing data to be
compiled into NHA format by a designated agency (most likely MOHMI), identify gaps in available data
and propose least cost methods for obtaining the required data. The proposed loan would finance
consultant services for survey design and data collection, computer hardware and software to support this
effort and study tours of NHA systems in OECD countries.
Project Management (US$2.0 million of total project costs)
6.           A Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) has been established as an agent
of the Ministry of Finance to administer and manage the proposed project. The PPIU would continue
in existence through project implementation to loan closing and would then be disbanded. The proposed
loan would finance the operating costs of the PPIU, including salaries of long-term consultancy staff,
office accommodation, supplies and equipment, utilities, staff travel and training, and consultant services.
Although the PPIU would not continue as an ongoing institution after project completion, staff trained
in procurement and project management would likely be absorbed into other institutions requiring these
skills and would continue to contribute to the successful inplementation of the Government's investment
program.
C. IMLEMENTATION RISKS
7.           Risks of delays in project implementation would be mitigated by the fact that a PPIU has
already been established and the staffing of the PPIU would be strengthened as the volume of project
activities increases. A procurement consultant has already been appointed and it is expected that contracts
would be ready to be signed around the time of loan effectiveness. Agreement will be reached with
MOHMI during negotiations that equipment meeting the agreed specifications which require certification
should be approved on an accelerated timeframe. This should expedite project implementation. A review
of the project tentatively scheduled for late 1996 following completion of the first round of procurement,
would elaborate the activities and timing required to complete project implementation in a timely and
efficient manner.
D. IMPLEMENTAToN ARRANGEmENTS
8.           The PPIU would be responsible for ensuring that the Agreement between the Government
and the World Bank would be carried out in a efficient and effective manner. Included would be
coordination among the various participating agencies to ensure a common and consistent approach in the
implementation of the project. Particular attention would be given to the carrying out of the agreed
procurement procedures while maintaining a very stringent schedule. Other responsibilities of the PPIU
would include administration of the Special Account, overall accounting and auditing of project accounts,
preparation of coordinated monthly and mid-term progress reports and a final Implementation Completion
Report.
9.           To assist the PPIU in the timely preparation and implementation of the project: (a) local
experts (consultants) would provide assistance as needed to develop or critique equipment specifications
and to provide other support as required; (b) a procurement consulting firm, financed initially under a
PPF, would assist the PPIU in all aspects of the administration of the procurement goods and related
services; and (c) each participating oblast would designate a liaison officer to specifically represent them
in all matters involving the implementation of their particular sub-component to ensure the timely and



Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                      Page 77
satisfactory completion of the project. These liaison officers, located in each participating oblast, would
be responsible for representing the end-users in their respective oblast and would be responsible for
coordinating with the PPIU in all aspects of project implementation as appropriate to that particular
oblast.
10.           The PPIU would also work in conjunction with an inter-agency Working Group-headed
MOHMI and comprising representatives of the State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat), MOF,
Ministry of Economy, the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund and the State Tax Service-
established to coordinate the work on national health accounts.
Project Preparadon and Implementation Unit (PPIU)
11.           The PPIU has been established as an agent of the Ministry of Finance. Initial funding
from a grant from the Government of Japan and from a Project Preparation Facility will finance the PPIU
through the project preparation phase; the PPIU's costs during the implementation phase of the project
would be financed out of the proposed loan.
12.           The Director of the PPIU would be responsible for the administration of the project and
would act on behalf of the Government in all routine matters including the signing of contracts and
requests for authorized payments/withdrawals from the Loan proceeds and the Project Account.
13.          In addition to the Director, key staff of the PPIU would consist of: (a) a procurement
officer, who would assist the Director in the day to day management of the unit and would serve as the
main liaison officer with the Procurement Consultant and with various participating Agencies; (b) an
administrative assistant; (c) a project assistant skilled also as an interpreter/translator (Russian-English);
(d) a project accountant; (e) a disbursement officer; and (f) a NHA component coordinator. The Director
took up his post on April 1, 1995, the procurement officer on May 15, 1995 and the office manager on
March 15, 1995, all with financing from the Japanese grant. The PPIU is operating in very austere office
accommodations with limited equipment financed under the Japanese grant. Additional office space
would be required and the proposed project includes funds for, inter alia, additional office equipment and
PPIU operating costs.
14.           Duties and responsibilities of the PPIU would include:
a.    Preparation Stage:
i.    Contacting a sample of oblasts to obtain feedback on, inter alia, the
appropriateness and completeness of the equipment lists;
ii.    Employing local experts, as may be required, to advise on the
compatibility of proposed equipment specifications with local
requirements and standards;
iii.    Preparing the notice sent to eligible oblasts to inform them of their level
of entitlement under the project and to obtain their equipment orders;
iv.    Based on information provided by the participating oblasts, assessing the
need for post-delivery installation of equipment and training needs to
ensure appropriate use of the equipment to be provided under the project;



Page 78                                                Annex J: Project Implementation Plan
V.    Employing a procurement consulting firm to assist the PPIU in all phases

vii.   Establishing a management information system covering all appropriate
aspects of the project. The Procurement Consultant would be responsible
for developing a computerized information system and providing the final
version to the Consolidator/Forwarder who would collect information for
the Procurement Consultant and PPIU on all procurement activities.
This information would provide the basis for the PPIU to prepare the
monthly and a mid-term implementation report and a final
Implementation Completion Report; and
viii.  Based on the standardized equipment list, reviewing all requests received
from the participating oblasts to ensure compliance with the established
criteria and objectives of the project including review of the adequacy of
budget allocations, availability of funds in the both the loan and project
accounts and funds required to pay levied duties and taxes.
b.    Implementation Stage:
-.    Reviewing and approving all procedures involving the procuremnent
process to ensure compliance with procurement procedures agreed with
the Bank and including supervision of the Procurement Consultant who
would have the primary responsibility to assist the PPIU in all aspects of
the administration and implementation of the procurement process;
ii.    Administering the evaluation and award of all contracts financed under
the project;
iii.    After verification of satisfactory receipt of goods and services by the

ix.    Providing such other management and administrative services as may be
needed for successful implementation of the project; and
x.    Preparing an Implementation Completion Report.
Procurement Consultant
15.          The Procurement Consultant would report to the Project Preparation and Implementation
Unit (PPIU) to help administer the procurement of about US$290 million equivalent of goods and services
consisting of medical equipment, supplies, training and other related services. Due to the complexity of
the project, various short term assistance may be required during the course of carrying out the assigned
tasks which would be provided by the Procurement Consultant.

Development Impact Indicators
24.           Because of the large number of facilities which are potentially eligible to participate in
the project (up to 700 hospitals and 10,000 polyclinics), the project proposes to monitor its impact on
development objectives by collecting utilization data, on a sample basis, for equipment delivered to each
of the participating oblasts and by establishing that all equipment has been delivered to and installed at
the designated sites. The sample utilization data would be transmitted from the selected beneficiary
facilities to the designated oblast coordinator who in turn would collect and provide the information to
the PPIU. The standard format for this report would be developed at the time of the project launch
workshop shortly after Board approval and the issuance of the tenders for the first round of procurement.
The terms of reference for the auditor engaged by the PPIU would include the responsibility to check,
on a sample basis, that equipment is installed at its intended facility and is in proper working order.
Progress Indicators
25.          Project implementation would be monitored by tracking the volume of contracts awarded
and signed, equipment delivered and loan disbursements.

Annex K: Supervision Plan
1.     Because of the short implementation period, project supervision requirements would exceed the
usual co-efficient. The Project would, on average, require between 35 to 45 staff-weeks of Bank
supervision per fiscal year during implementation, as reflected in the proposed supervision plan below-':
