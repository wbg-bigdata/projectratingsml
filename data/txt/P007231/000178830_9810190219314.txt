REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE GUYANA ELECTRICITY CORPORATION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF GUYANA
FOR A POWER PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC), with the guarantee of Guyana,
for the equivalent of US$6.0 million to help finance a power project. The
loan would have a term of 20 years, including four years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The Government of Guyana would charge GEC a
guarantee fee of one percent per annum on the outstanding amount of the Bank
loan, bringing the cost of the loan to GEC to 8-1/4 percent per annum.
2.       Under parallel financing arrangements, the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) and the U.K. Overseas Development Administration (ODA)
will lend the Government Can$4.0 million (about US$4.0 million equivalent) and
£3.1 million (about US$7.5 million equivalent) respectively for the project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
3.       A review of economic developments in Guyana was contained in an Economic
Memorandum that was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 6, 1972; more
recent developments are covered in the remarks that follow. A country data sheet
is attached as Annex I to this report.
Recent Economic Developments
4.       Although Guyana's economic performance in recent years has been uneven,
it has been, as a whole, satisfactory. The resource base is adequate and the na-
tionalization of the country's largest bauxite mining company in mid-1971 was
handled judiciously. The Government's recent policy measures, taken within the
framework of a concept of "cooperative socialism," have emphasized equity,
local participation in the economy and self-reliance. It is still premature
to forecast the full economic and political impact of these measures; early
signs suggest that the implementation of the Government's policy for an
increased emphasis on social equity is being accompanied by some uncertainty
withifi the private sector and, combined with other adverse factors, by a
diminished growth of the economy over the short term. The longer-term outlook



-2 -
for Guyana's economy; however, promises to bV favorable, given the ong'oing
adtivities and the plans of the Governmeht and the private sector in Guyana's
main connmmoditiess bauxite, sugar and rice.  In addition, the Government has
shown its *illingness to maintain austerity measures, and to 'curb the imlpbrt
of &onimer gooads.
5i.     -Econom:c growth has averaged 4 percent a year over the last few years.
Mining; construction and gvbrziment seivices continue to be the 'most dynamic
sectors; wiith agricuiture increasing at about half the rate of overall output.
This grokth has beeh achieved with the help of heavy investment in miniiig and
a steady growth of public capital formation, of which a third has been finaniced
from public savings.  The growth of the edonomy has, however), beeh subject to
annual fluctuationsj refledting Guyanais heavy dependence oh its three princip&l
commodities.  Sigar and rice pr`oduction in 1972 have been affedted by bad
Weather, and produc4iAon ifn the miiiing sector by a w'eakehihg of the *or±ld &l hinum
ma'rket.
6 .      The most important rec-ent development hai been the nationalization in
July, 1971 of the Demerara Bauxite Cobnpany Ltd. (DEMBA), the largest bauxite
mining company ih Guyana, ana a wioilly owned subsidiary of the Aluminum Company
of Canada Ltd. (AL'CAN). In recent years DEMBA had provided almost one-'fi'fth of
GDPj twd fifths of coiimodity expo±td ahd about 10 percent 'of total governmen't
revenues.  The Guyana Bauxite Comupaify (GUYBAU), Which took over DEMBA, despite
hatiin  ifiherited productioh, financing and marketing problems from its predecessor,
has progressed well. Pioductioh has been tifintaihed at levels clbse to those
achieved by DENBA in the first half of 1971;  Although prices fori bauxite 'ahd
alUmina have weakened in the world markdtj GUYBAU has been able to inaintain its
sales proceeds by raising the price of caldined bauxite, in which Guyana holds
a virtual monopoly; mairkets for cailcined bauxite appear reasonably assured in
the futurej although the recent increase ih price might bring about the develop-
ment of substitutes or of alternative sources of supply.  For tha moment, in
spite of a shutdown bf alumina production due to lack of buyers ith June arnd Ju-ly
6f 1972j GUfYBAU should be able to maintain its compensation payments to ALCAN
without having to rely on government subsidies, and a subAtantiLl investment plan
for expansion and ratibnalizati6h of prodictibn is expected to be shortly initiated
ih time to ensure con tinuing increase in output..
7.       The nationilization of DEMBA is part of a newly emergeht pattein in
Guyana. Since 1970, when the country became a cooperative republic, the Govern-
meht has been reassessing its economic policies; its objective is to evolve a
strategy of development in which the public and the cooperative sedtors would
play a leading role. Within the framewiork of a 15-yIear plan for 1972-86, which
is presently in preparationj a five-year operationlal plan for 1972-76 would aim
to reach seilf-sufficiency in foodstuffs and textiles and to meet the most
pressing housing needs by 1 976. While continuing to develop the traditional
export sectors, the plan would place special emphasis on the development of other
lines of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, and on the penetration of the



- 3 -
country's interior. The industrial strategy of Guyana would be based on the
processing of the country's basic resources for the local market and for export
to other CARIFTA countries, rather than assembly-type production.for the local
market. The plan would also focus on the reduction of unemployment - presently
estimated at 15 percent - and the upgrading of human resources through training
programs.
8.       In line with the broad strategy outlined above, the cooperative movement
continues to grow. A Wholesale Society, which would serve as an outlet for
agricultural and industrial goods produced by cooperatives, and which would link
with a chain of retail cooperatives, has been started in 1972. Labor Contract
Societies would facilitate the participation of the unemployed in labor-intensive
works. An External Trade Bureau, set up in 1971, has been assigned the exclusive
right to import goods valued at about one-fifth of the country's total imports.
The National Cooperative Bank, in which the Government has majority shareholding,
has been established as a commercial bank and provision has been made for financia
and technical assistance for the cooperatives. In regard to direct Government
participation in the economy, other proposed activities include timber and kaolin
exploitation, textile manufacture and shrimping operations, with foreign partici-
pation in at least two of the activities. To ensure the efficiency of public
enterprises, the Guyana State Corporation (GUYSTAC) was created toward the close
of 1971 under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, with broad responsibilities
for wage policies, rate determination and investment planning and financing for
autonomous undertakings.
9.       The new socio-economic thrust has been nevertheless tempered to a
significant degree by pragmatic policies and actions, exhibiting an awareness of
the realities of international economics. The Government has not assumed direct
control of all enterprises involved in the exploitation of natural resources. It
has shown a marked reluctance towards majority participation in the sugar industry,
where a delicate labor union situation, involving the two principal political
parties, has cautioned against direct government involvement in the management
of this industry.
10.      The Government's policy to increase its participation in the economy is
evident in the fiscal accounts. Public expenditures in 1971 amounted to 38
percent of GDP compared with 32 percent five years earlier; the share of the
public sector in overall investment rose from one-third in 1966 to almost two-
thirds in 1971, when private investment, particularly in mining, dropped sharply.
Public investment is now equivalent to almost 12 percent of GDP. Between 1965
and 1970 public sector savings increased from one to six percent of GDP. In
1971, however, fiscal difficulties became evident; whereas current expenditures
kept on rising at the rate of about 8 percent, or slightly below the rate
experienced in recent years, current revenues in 1971 were actually lower than
in 1970. This could be principally attributed to a poor sugar crop in the

PART II - THE BANK GROUP'S ROLE IN GUYANA
Introduction
13.      The Bank made a loan for $0.9 million for agricultural crodit in 1961 when
it was the colony of British Guiana; this loan has been repaid in full. Since
the countryts independence in 1966, the Bank Group has lent US$22.8 million to
Guyana: US$13.3 million from the Bank and US$9.5 million from IDA. Approximately
half of this lending has been for sea defense projects; the remainder being for
an education, a livestock and a highway project. The proposed loan would be the
first Bank loan for power in Guyana. There have been no operations of the Inter-
national Finance Corporation (IFC) in Guyana, and no investments are at present
being considered. A summary statement of Bank loans and mDA credits to Guyana as
of October 31, 1972 is attached as Annex II.
Bank/IDA Lending in the Past
14.      Through the close relationship that has been developed between the Bank
Group and the Government of Guyana we have been able to discuss broad economic
policy issues with the Government, and have helped to shape its investment and
financing program.  Projects financed by the Bank Group in various sectors have
contributed to the strengthening of social and economic infrastracture, and
helped to lay the basis for economic diversification in the future.



-6-
15.      Our sea defense projects have been part of a 12-year program aimed at
protecting coastal areas below sea level against cyclical and local erosion and
tidal inundation. The threatened zone includes Guyana's main institutional and
administrative centers as well as important residential and public utilities
installatibns. The first Bank-financed project ($5.0 million; 1968) is now
progressing satisfactorily. The second sea defense project ($5.4 million; 1971)
has, however, run ihto difficulties; only two bids for civil works contracts
have been received, both at prices much in excess of the original cost estimates.
the Gover'mieht has proposed construction by force account as an alternative, and
the matter is being reviewed by the Bank jointly with the Government and the
consultants.
i6.      Our IDA credit for education ($2.9 million; 1969) was based upon a new
strategy for human resources development that would focus on establishing a
pattern of mdultilateral secondary school education and on teacher training.
It will help finance the construction and equipment of one teacher training college
and several multilateral schools; a technical assistance component inter-alia
financed a study of materials and construction methods for schools.  The construction
of all project schools is expected to be completed by April 1975 about 18 months
behind the original schedule; slippage has resulted principally from delays in
appointing consultant architects and in awarding civil works contracts following
opening of bids. Other elements of the project are progressing satisfactorily.
1i.     iThe IDA credit ($2.2 million; 1970) for livestock development was
conceived as the first step in a continuing, longer term effort. It provides
funds for on-lending to private, cboperative and company ranches in the coastal
and the intermediate Savannah areas. Training and technical services as well as
studies of beef marketing and processing are also included in the project. Al-
though the project has moved slowly, steady progress is being made towards getting
the on-lending program operative. The highway improvement credit ($4.4 million;
1972) is the Bank Group's first operation ih the transport sector. The project
will support agriculture, which ranks high in the Government's order of priorities
for development; improve the organization and operations of the Ministry of Works;
assist in the preparation of a proper highway maintenance program; and contribute
to the formaulation of a national transport strategy.
Future Direction of Bank Lending
18.      In line with our analysis of Guyana's requirements and the Government's
priorities, we are planning to concentrate future lending by the Bank and IDA
mainly on agriculture. As regards lending for other sectors, the project before
you emphasizes institutional improvement and will bring about much-needed integra-
tion of the national power system through frequency standardization and system
ihterconnection (Paragraphs 34-36). We also plan to lend for highways in support



-7-
of agricultural development and for education in order to more closely match
skills and job opportunities and thus contribute towards maximizing output and
employment. We may also propose one more loan for sea defense and we may be
requested to assist in financing investment in calcined bauxite production should
GUYBAU's plans for expansion and kationalization go through (Paragraph 7).  Al-
though the capacity for decision making and administrative sophistication do
exist at senior levels of Government, these are not yet matched by technical
expertise and the ability for project preparation and implementation at middle
levels. However, starting with the budgeting process for 1972, investment projects
for implementation will be given closer attention by the authorities so as to mini-
mize administrative delays, and the establishment of GUYSTAC (Paragraph 8) might
also be expected to facilitate timely project preparation. On our part we consider
the Bank's role in helping to achieve institutional improvements in the country of
crucial importance; in coordination with the UNDP and other lending agencies, there-
fore, we plan to continue providing technical assistance to Guyana as an integral
part of our future lending activities.
19.      As already mentioned, the highest priority is being given to the develop-
ment and diversification of Guyana's primary resources. A land development and
rehabilitation project is being studied for diversifying the country's agricultural
sector outside sugar. A satisfactory credit channel will be needed for the sub-
sequent financing of this project; the Government proposes to set up an Agricultural
Development Bank for this purpose, and we would expect to be called upon to provide
technical and financial assistance. The development of an efficient credit mechanism
would of course also be of considerable importance for Guyana's agricultural develop-
ment in general. A second livestock project is planned to follow up on the earlier
credit operation which broke new ground in instituting a modern livestock industry.
A forestry development project has been identified comprising a 60-mile forestry
access road and a forestry industry coaplex. The Government is carrying out the
surveys needed for the access road, and has planned a market survey which CIDA
will finance. In the fisheries sector, the possibilities for providing port and
onshore facilities, and for augmenting the shrimping fleet will be studied and
Bank financial assistance made available if justified.
20.      In continuation of its present plans for the development of power in the
country, the Government is applying for assistance to the UNDP for a survey of
Guyana's hydropower potential; the Bank is likely to act as executing agency for
the study. At the same time, UNDP is financing a study of the Kabalebo Hydropower
Project (with the Bank as executing agency) in adjacent Surinam which, if found
feasible, could provide an alternative source of power for Guyana's requirements.
21.      A second highway project is being prepared under tha first IDA highway
credit which provides for a national transport plan, feasibility studies of
about 200 miles and detailed engineering of 100 miles of roads. A forthcoming
UNESCO mission report is expected to provide the basis for a second education
project.



22.      Guyafia is in the process of a major reorientation of its social and
economic structures. The Government has fornulated a new socio-economic
thrust aimed at bringing about more meaningful local participation in the
exploitation of the country's natural resources, minimizing unemployment, and
extending the benefits of development to wider sections of the population.
The country's development prospects, however, are still very much dependent
on foreign aid. Further, Guyana's limited export growth potential, extensive
poverty within the country, and the Government's plans for a more active role
in the economy combined with reasonably good policies and performance in the
past, justify the continuance of much of the external assistance on concessionary
t'erms. Of the Bank Group iending to date, over 40 percent has been in IDA
credits.  On the other hand, the present per capita income of Guyana (US$370; 1970)
places it 'on the borderlin'e of IDA eligibility, and the low debt service burden
makes it eligible for considerable borrowing on conventional terms.  Our future
lending to Ghyana is therefore visualized to continue as a hard Bank/IDA blend.
PART III - TKE POWER SECTOR IN GUYANA
23.      All geherating facilities are thermal except for one small government-
owned hydiroelectric plant. Although a UNDP-financed studv in 1967 identified
and reviewed a few specific major hydroelectric sites, the large minimum economic
si'ze 'df the facilities to be constructed at these sitesdprecludes their develop-
ment for the present.  However, the Government still wishes to exploit its hydro-
electric power resources and is consi'deing undertaking a hydroelectric survey
on a c'ountry-wide basis (Paragraph 20).  Guyana has 'no petroleum deposits and
must therefore import fuel oil for its thermal plants.  The only indigenous source
is bagasse, a sugar-cane residue, which is used as fuel at the sugar estate plants.
2'4.      Historically, Guyana's power supply has developed as a number of separate
systems. 'Over the years) in the absence of a national electricity supply, many
private generating plants were established to supply sugar estates, bauxite-mining
operations, rice mills and population centers.  This evolution of the power sector
as a number of separate systems established by industries and municipalities has
resulted in the systems having diffePent operating characteristics. Some of these
systems use 50 Hz and a customer's voltage of 240 volts, soue 50 Hz and 115 volts,
and others 60 Hz and 115 volts.  The use of two frequencies is inefficient in the
utilization of resources anid inhibits integration.
25.       The principal power producers in the country are now: Guyana Electricity
Corporation's Georgetown, Onverwaagt, Anna Regina and Bartica systems (GEC: installed
capacity of 43 MW), Guyana Bauxite Ltd. (GUYBAU: 31 MW), Bookers Sugar Estates Ltd.
(Bookers: 16 MW), Reynolds Guyana Mines Company Ltd. (Reynolds: 7 MW) and the City
of New Amsterdam (New Amsterdam: 5 MW).  All the GEC systems operate at the frequency
of 56 Hz whereas the GU'YBAU, New Amsterdam and Reynolds sytems and almost all other
power producers, except for Bookers, operate at a frequency of 60 Hz.



-9-
26.      In 1971 the Government of Guyana enacted legislation to standardize
the frequency at 60 Hz. Its objective was to facilitate national and inter-
national interconnection (Guyana's neighbors Venezuela, Surinam and Brazil use
a 60 Hz frequency) so as to achieve investment savings in the power sector,
and open the way for development of hydroelectric sites. This legislation
forms the basis for the GEC frequency conversion program which constitutes a
major element in the proposed project.
27.      In the past there has been little central coordination between the
various public and private entities within the power sector. However, the
proposed project will assist GEC to carry out its statutory responsibilities
for the development and supply of electricity and should contribute significantly
to achieving a more rational and efficient power sector.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.      The project was appraised in November/December 1971, and subsequently
reappraised in May/June 1972 due to substantial modifications of load forecasts
and revenue projections. Negotiations for the proposed loan-were held in
Washington in October 1972. The Government was represented by Messrs. Wim ton
King, Secretary to the Treasury, D. yankana, Permanent Secretary, Department
of Public Corporations and Secretary to Guyana State Corporation (GUYSTAC),
B. Pollard, Chief Parliamentary Counsel, and P. Mittelholzer, First Secretary,
Embassy of Guyana. The Borrower was represented by Messrs. D.I.G. Thompson,
General Manager, Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC) and W. Haynes, Chief
Accountant (GEC).
29.      A report entitled "Appraisal of a Generation, Transmission and Fre-
quency Conversion Project - Guyana Electricity Corporation - Guyana" (No. PU-103a dat
December 18, 1972) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
The main features of the loan and the project are summarized in Annex III.
The Borrower
30.      The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Guyana Electricity Cor-
poration (GEC) with a government guarantee.   GEC is a fully government-owned
corporation established by legislation in 1957, with responsibility for public
electricity supply within the designated areas, and for advising the Government
on generation, transmission and distribution matters. The Government exercises
its control over GEC through the Guyana State Corporation (GUYSTAC), a public
corporation which the Government established in 1971 to supervise, control,
coordinate and hold the State interest in a number of public corporations.
During the negotiations, GUYSTAC agreed to use its powers to enable GEC to
fulfill its obligations to the Bank under the proposed loan agreement.

31.      In addition to the proposed Bank loan to GEC, the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) and the U.K. Overseas Development Adminis ration (ODA)
have agreed to make loans to the Government under parallel financinlj arrangements
for the purposes of the project (Paragraph 40).
GEC Organization and Management
32.      GEC has already established a planning and construction dirision within
its structural organization and will maintain this division with arrangements satis-
factory to the Bank. GEC is reasonably well managed at present, though there
is still a shortage of experienced management and technical personnuil. A manage-
ment training program for GEC's senior personnel has been included :.n the proposed
project to improve the calibre of management within GEC; and during negotiations
GEC agreed to engage consultants satisfactory to the Bank for this purpose. In-
dependently of the present project, CIDA will provide training on a grant basis
for GEC's technical personnel.
33.      GEC has engaged the Shawinigan Engineering Company Ltd. as consultants
for the design, construction, supervision, procurement and managementt of the project
(including the ODA and CIDA-financed portions) and to advise on the remainder of
the power development program. This consulting firm will also trai)t GEC's engineer-
ing personnel and utilize them in the project work. During negotia.ions, GEC agreed
to retain engineering consultants satisfactory to the Bank throughoutt the design
and construction of the project.
Project Description
34.      The proposed project provides for the interconnection and !oordination
of the principal systems in Guyana, that is, GEC, GUYBAU and New Am;nterdam, includ-
ing additional generating capacity to meet estimated demand increaso for the inter-
connected systems, extending electricity supply to the east coast a.ea and standardiz-
ing the interconnected system at 60 Hz. GEC has signed power suppl,,!/interchange
agreements with GWYBAU and New Amsterdam.
35.      To interconnect GEC's Georgetown and Onverwaagt systems wiqh GUYBAU and
NetiAmsterdam, about 185 miles of 69 kV, 60 Hz transmission system irould be
constructed to start operation in 1973-74. Approximately 20 MW of f:requency
converter capacity would be installed in 1974 in order to connect thte 50 Hz
steam generation at Georgetown, for which conversion is not economioal, to the
60 Hz system. Another 10 MW of frequency converters would be added in 1976.
The frequency converters would also provide for progressive frequen,y conversion
of GEC's Georgetown and Onverwaagt systems, and permit their interconnection to
the GUYBAU and New Amsterdam systems at 60 Hz. The project include, the con-
version of customer's equipment in the Georgetown, Anna Regina and (nverwaagt
areas. Since the frequency conversion will require particular atte3ition from
the standpoint of coordination and logistics, it was agreed during ~iegotiations
that GEC would prepare a master plan for frequency conversion withi.i nine months
of the loan signing.



36.      To meet the anticipated demand increase of the interconnected systems,
additional generating capacity will be needed. The project provides for the
installation of about 36 MW of diesel generation to supply this increased load.
The diesels will be installed in two plants located on the Demerara and Berbice
rivers, which will facilitate fuel delivery and provide a source of cooling
water. The project will include the provision of distribution facilities in
the new service areas, in addition to those being self-financed by GEC. The
project has no adverse environmental effects.
37.      The project would constitute the major part of GEC's 1972-76 power
development program. The latter includes, in addition to the project, the
installation of 19 MW of small diesel units and the extension of GEC's distri-
bution system. During negotiations GEC agreed to the construction of the
distribution facilities planned for the 1972-76 program in time to have them
in operation when the new generating facilities under the project are completed.
Project Justification
38.      Due to uncertainties about frequency standardization, and to the fact
that a hydroelectric survey has still to be made, until recently no long-term
power development program had been prepared in Guyana. The proposed project
represents the first Bank involvement in power in the country, and will provide
a basis for the formulation of a long-term program after the hydroelectric
potential is known. The interconnection of the principal power systems in
Guyana would result in substantial economies by reducing required reserve
capacity, as compared to the continued development of isolated systems, and
by the introduction of larger units with lower per unit costs. The use of
residual oil-fuel diesels, as proposed in the project, will lead to substantial
savings in fuel costs, and continuity of service will be improved by coordinating
outages for the maintenance of plants. The interconnection of the systems,
with frequency standardization and the installation of residual oil-burning
diesel generating plant, is the least cost solution at any rate of interest
less than 20 percent.
39.      A conservative estimate of the rate of return on the project, con-
sisting of generation, transmission and distribution expansion and the
frequency conversion of the GEC system, is 16.5 percent. In this calculation,
the stream of costs includes capital and operating costs (taking into account
fuel cost savings at existing plant but excluding taxes and depreciation).
Shadow pricing was not considered necessary for foreign exchange or local
labor costs. The stream of benefits consists of the increase in GEC revenues
from sales attributable to the project. Raising or lowering attributable
revenues by 15 percent would provide rate of return estimates of 20.5 percent
and 12.5 percent respectively.



- 12-
Project Cost and Financing Plan
h0.       External Financin4 - The total cost of the project is estimated to be
$23.1 million of which $16.4 million will comprise foreign exchange costs. The
Canadian International Development Agency (CInA) and the U.K. Overseas Develop-
ment Administration (ODAE have agreed to participate with the Bank in parallel
financing of the project. The Bank loan of $6.0 million represents 26 percent
of the total project cost and would finance the direct foreign exchange costs
of about 30 KW of frequency converters, a 13.8 kV distribution program, material
for the conversion of customers' equipment to 60 Hz, project engineering and
a management training program. It would also include $1.1 million of interest
and other charges during construction on the Bank loan.  ODA wil make available
LStg.3.1 million (about US$7.5 million equivalent of which about $6.4 million would
be for equipment imported from the U.K. and $1.1 million for associated local
currency expenditures). The ODA loan would finance the 36 MW of diesel generators
and the conversion of small diesels. The CIDA loan of Can$4.0 million (about
US$4.0 million equivalent) would finance the procurement of equipment from Canada
for the 60 kV transmission lines, substations, a river crossing and the conversion
of utility equipment. In addition, CIDA is prepared to make available a $200,000
grant for the training of GE:C's technical personel in Canada. The CIDA and ODA
loans would be made to the Government. The ODA loan would be for 25 years, in-
cluding a 4-year grace period, with interest at 3 percet; the CIDA loan would be
I'-or 50 years, including a 10-year grace period at no interest.  The Government of
Guyana would on-lend these amounts to GEC at 6.2 percent initerest,fcr 25 years,
including a h-year grace period.  The on-lending rate has been set by the Govern-
ment below its usual lending rate of 8 percent to public entities having regard
to the non-revenue earning nature of certain project items (for example, customers'
equipment. eonversion).  The Government will charge GEC a guarantee fee of one percent
on the outstanding balance of the Bank loan.
Domestic Financing
41.       GEC's financial situation, which was weak for many years, has been
satisfactory since 1969 when, duiing the caarsae oa the Comone*alth Develojt2int
Corporation's (CDC) association with GEC, rates were raised and the tariff
structure iTrproved.
42.   --eEo's financing requirements for its 1972-76 investment program, which
are not covered by the Bank/CIDA/ODA loans, will be provided by internal cash
generation, domestic bank loans and a government loan.  The Government has additionally
agreed to make arrangements to meet any shortfall in (lC's finances so that the pro-
ject will be conmpleted as planned. The internal cash generation assumed in the
financing plan will probably require increases in tariffs of some 10 percent in
1974 and 6 percent in 1976. After taking into account domestic bank loans already
negotiated, the remaining amount of the financial gap to be bridged by the government
loan is expected to build up to a peak of $2.9 million by the end of 1975. The
government loan would be for 20 years, including a grace period of 8 years, at
8 percent interest.



- 13 -
43.      During negotiations GEC agreed that, having regard to operating and
other expenses it would take such action in respect of tariffs so as to earn
not less than a 10 percent return on investment throughout thie life of the
proposed loan.
4L.      The Government will continue to exempt GEC fran a 10 percent import
duty, which would otherwise be levied on imported material and equipmentw for
the 1972-76 development program. The Government has agreed that in the event
of a change in GEC's import duty status it will make good any resulting
financial shortfalls by an equity contribution to COC.
45.      Annual debt service coverage by internal sources is expected to be
around 2.3 during the pe4od 1972-76, but coverage is expected to be reduced
substantially shortly thereafter due to the start of the bulk of the amortiza-
tion repayments. GEC has agreed that during the life of the loan it will not
incur debt other than for carrying out the program, unless net revenues of the
previous consecutive 12-month period cover the mnaxium debt service of any
subsequent year 1.5 times.
Procurement 
46.      Procurement of equipment and material to be financed under the Bank
loan would be on the basis of internazional competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for procurement, with the exception of the material
required for the conversion of customers' equipment. The latter is not suited
to competitive bidding due to the variety of items involved and the need to
match existing equipment; the equipment in this category would therefcre be
procured on a negotiated basis satisfactory to the Bank; the value of the
equipment in question is not expected to exceed $400,000 equivalent in the
aggregate. Guyana would be unable to supply domestically the goods to be
financed from the Bank loan; therefore, the question of preference for domestic
supplies does not arise.   Since GEC is exempt from import duty on equipment and
material imported for its 1972-76 cnnstracticn program, preferences under the
Caribbean Free Trade Association will also not be applicable. Engineering of
the project has been started by consultants in order to meet the installation
schedules; it is proposed that the foreign exchange costs of these services
incurred between December 1971 and mid-January 1973, and estimated at $750,000,
should be financed retroactively from the loan proceeds. Estimated annual
disbursements of the loan are given in Annex III to this report. Any funds
remaining aidisbursed on conpletion of the projecL woald be cancelled unless
needed for concurrent work related to the project and/or feasibility studLes
for further power investment approved by the Bank.



PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.      As explained in paragraph 30, Guyana has established a corporatian
(Guyana State Corporation) to hold on its behalf the interest of Guyana in some
corporate bodies wholly owned by Guyana. Guyana State Corporation has been
given certain powers of supervision and control over such other corporate bodies,
including the power to give to them general or special directions in respect of
matters relating to their personnel, finance, management and organization. In
view of this it is proposed that an agreement be entered into with Guyana State
Corporation providing, inter alia, that the said powers of supervision and control
will be exercised in such a manner as to ensure that GEC performs all its obliga-
tions under the Loan Agreement.
48.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Guyana Electricity
Corporation, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Guyana and the Bank, the
draft GUYSTAC Agreement between the Bank and Guyana State Corporation, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.      In 1968, GEC received a loan for bStg.400,000 from the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) which was secured by a floating charge on all of
GEC's assets.  In order for the proposed loan to rank pari passu with CDC's, pro-
vision has been made in the draft Loan Agreement (Sectiocn 5.01iJfor the creation of
a similar charge in favor of the Bank.
50.      The execution of the GUYSTAC Agreement, the agreements providing for
the loans to Guyana from the U.K. and Canada, and for the relending of the
proceeds of such loans by Guyana to GEC, and the creation of the above-mentioned
charge, are additional conditions of effectiveness.
51.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B. Projects in Execution
$5.0 million Loan of September 27, 1968, for Sea Defence (Ln. 559)
All project items (except for part of the survey equipment costing less
than $100,000) are under contract, and disbursements should be completed before
the end of 1973. Construction is proceeding satisfactorily on the East Coast
Demerara sea wall. Total project costs are estimated at $8.5 million, of which
the foreign exchange component will be about $5.7 million, resulting in a cost
overrun totaling $1.0 million. The Government intends meeting the cost overruns.
Since benefit increases have been approximately parallel to cost increases, the
economic rate of return of the project has not been seriously affected.

$5.4 million Loan of June 24, 1971,for Sea Defence (Ln. 765)
The Georgetown Sea Defence Project is at a critical stage. When the
tenders for civil works were opened on July 6, 1972, only two bids were received,
of which the lower was more than twice the amount estimated by the appraisal
mission. After consultation among the Government,the Bank, and the consultants,
it was decided to reject both bids, and the consultants were asked to discuss
with both bidders a more acceptable price.   Discussions are still going on.
The res'it could be a revised version of the project which would eliminate
all items that dculd be postponed for later construction by force account.
F'rthermore, the Government is studying the possibility of constructing the entire
works through force account. A decision on the project will be taken after the
consultants' findings and Government's report have been received.
$2.9 mi8llion Loan and $2.9 million Credit of January 31, 1969, for Education
(Ln. 503 and Cr.. 139)'
Con§truction of the teacherst training college has been started, and
is expected to be completed by July 31, 1973, some 15 months behind the appraisal
schedule, the major causes of delay have been in the selection of consultants,
award of construction contract, and adverse weather conditions during construction
start-up. A contract for the construction of the multilateral schools has recently
been awarded, construction has not yet started, but is expected to be completed by
April 1975, about 18 months behind the appraisal schedule, and four months beyond
the present closing date of December 31, 1974. Signature of the construction
contract was delayed due largely to prolonged discussions between the lowest bidder,
Guyana Bu-ilders Consortium Cooperative Society Limited and Taylor Woodrow (Int.) Ltd.
for the provision of expert management and procarement consulting services. The
anticipated d6lay in completion of all project construction is expected to result
in cost increases of about eight percent. The Government intends meeting the cost
overruns. In spite of these cost increases, the project is still considered
worthwhile.
$2.2 million.Credit of November 27, 1970,. for Livestock Development (Cr. 221)
The Credit became effective on September 15, 1971, but disbursements
have been minimal. However, steady progress has been made towards getting the
on-lending program operative.  The first on-ranch loan has been made, and two
cooperative groups have their programs at an advanced stage of planning.
$4.4 million Credit of, April 26, 1972, for a Highway Project (Cr. 301)
The Credit, after its date of effectiveness had been postponed twice,
wa's declared effective on November 15, 1972, after UNDP assurances had been
obtained on the financing of -$'1.2 million for technical assistance for transport
planning, a management 'study of the Ministry of Works and Communications, and
road feasibility studies. The transport planning technical assistance and the
management study are 'expected to start shortly.
