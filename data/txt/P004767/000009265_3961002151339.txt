EMEOWDNDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
0 A PROPOSED LOAN TO TIE PETROLEUK AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
FOR A BONGIOT GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.        I  submit  foi  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Petroleum Authority of Thailand
(PTT) with the guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of
US$105 million to help finance a project for the transmission of natural
gas. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 17 years, including 4 years of grace.
2.        J.;kground. Thailand's dramatic economic growth in recent years,
averaging 11.5% since 1987, has led to a sharp increase in the consumption
of commercial energy, particularly oil and gas.   Demand for commercial
energy continues to far exceed domestic supplies.
3.        Until about 1980, Thailand depended on imported energy for almost
94X of its commercial energy needs. The prospects of higher oil prices and
the economy's critical dependence on an uninterrupted supply of oil to
sustain its rapid growth prompted the Government to re-examine its energy
policy. The key elements of the revised strategy have been: reducing the
cnuntry's reliance on imported energy by increasing exploration for and
development of domestic resources, particularly natural gas; promoting
efficient utilization and conservation of energy; reducing the negative
environmental impacts of energy production and use; and, to the extent that
import of energy is unavoidable, formulating a coherent policy for energy
Import.
4.        The Government's implementation of the new strategy resulted in
the country's dependence on imported energy being reduced from 941 in 1980
to 631 in 1990, prinarily through increased production of gas.   Gas
production, which began in 1981, reached about 730 million cubic feet per
day (mmcfd) by 1991. The upstream operations of the gas sector are carried
out by private international oil companies, while transmission and
wholesale distribution of gas are undertaken by PTT.
5.        The total consumption of dry natural gas in Thailand in 1991 was
627 mmcfd, 931 of which was used for power generation.  There is ample
demand for natural gas in the foreseeable future.  Projections indicate
that the country's demand for natural gas will reach 1,975 mmcfd by the
year 2000, with about 1,400 mmcfd going to the power sector including 610
mcfd for combined-cycle power plants.
6.        PTT has developed a master plan for gas utilization, defining the
issues and options in the gas sector, and highlighting the priority
projects.   The proposed project was identified to have  the highest
priority.
7.        Progect Objectives.  The objective of the project is to increase
the gas supply capabilities of Thailand by:   (a) expanding the gas
transmission system;  (b) strengthening the institutional functioning of
PTT; and (c) making more efficient use of capital resources in the gas



- 2 -
sector through annual review c_ PTT's investment program. These objectives
are consistent with the Government's strategy for gas sector development.
8.        Project DescriDtion.    The proposed project consists  of the
following components: (a) a 32-inch, 175-km long submarine pipeline from
the Bongkot gas field to the existing Erawan production complex; (b) a 24-
inch, 160-km long submarine pipeline from Erawan to a terminal at Khanom;
(c) a new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and telecom
system and renovation of the existing system; (d) a riser platform; (e)
equipment  including  additional  compression  capacity;   (f)  project
engineering and management consultancy; (g) upgrading of PTT's Management
Information System (MIS) and training of staff; and (h) a study for
preparation of safety and environmental standards, and a study for a second
pipeline.  The total cost of the project is estimated at US$348.0 million
(excluding interest during construction estimated at US$22 million). The
proposed Bank loan of US$105 million would finance 28X of the total project
financing required, and 331 of its foreign expenditures. A breakdown of
wosts and the financing plan are given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are given in
Schedule B.    A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Maps showing the project location are also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10465-TH dated June 11, 1992, is being
circulated separately.
9.        Project Imlementatin.  PTT will be responsible for implementing
the project.   PTT has in the past implemented several similar projects,
including the construction of the existing 34-inch offshore pipeline
financed by the Bank. PTT has entered into a contract with a consulting
company for engineering consultancy and project management. The Bank loan
proceeds would be disbursed against the cost of:  (a) pipeline materials
procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures; (b) the
consultancy and project management contract; and (c) technical assistance
components.
10.       The gas field will be developed and operated by a joint-venture
consisting of PTT Exploration and Production Co. Ltd. (401), French TOTAL
(301), British Gas (201), and Norwegian Statoil (101). TOTAL will be the
operator. A Gas Sales Agreement has been signed between the gas producers
and PTT. It provides, inter alia, for the delivery of 250 mmcfd of gas
during the life of the reserve, availability of at least 1.5 trillion cubic
feet (tcf) of reserves, and a pricing formula which includes an appropriate
mechanism for indexation, floor, and ceiling. PTT has also signed a gas
sales/purchase agreement with the Electricity Generating Authority in
Thailand (EGAT), which uses over 80% of the gas transported by PTT.
11.       Project Sustainability. The necessary conditions exist to ensure
the financial and institutional sustainability of the project; the
framework including the project design is in place.  The provisions for
cost recovery including requirements for spare parts and other recurrent
expenditures   are   adequate   to  ensure   the   project's   operational
sustainability.   PTT is a well-run state enterprise which has managed
similar operations for the past 15 years.



12.       L6ssons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement.    The  three
projects previously financed by the Bank in Thailand's oil and gas sector
were completed on schedule and within the budget, and they realized their
main objectives. The Bank provided substantial institutional and technical
support to PTT, especially during the early stages of PTTs operations.
Two important lessons from the Bank's previous involvement are:  (a) the
gas sale/purchase agreements need to include a carefully designed pricing
formula to protect the gas transmission company from fluctuation of
international oil prices; and (b) the uniq7ve geology of the areas for oil
and gas divelopment can lead to   substantial cost overruns.   In the
proposed project, PTT will recover its full cost of gas purchasing and gas
transmission, and the project design has taken into account risks related
to the area's complex geology.
13.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been involved in
Thailand's oil and gas industry since its inception. During that ten-year
period, Bank involvement has focused heavily on institutional development
in general and capacity building within PTT in particular.   Some of the
more important programs in this regard are currently in mid-stream, and
continued support from the Bank is critical in ensuring that they will be
concluded successfully:  (a) the Bank has worked extensively with PTT to
develop a more rational investment program, and continued Bank involvemert
will encourage further refinement and correct implementation; (b) PTT has
grown very rapidly over recent years and as of January 1992 was reorganized
on a profit-center basis.   Continued Bank involvement will help PTT to
develop internal systems and procedures and managerial approaches that are
appropriate to PTT's stage of corporate development; and (c) Bank support
to date in the proposed project has resulted in PTT's adopting a common-
carrier approach to pipeline development, which will encourage small
independent producers to exploit marginal fields close to the pipelite.
The approach would also promote regional trade in gas since the
construction of the pipeline facilitates the future importation of gas into
Thailand from the neighboring countries of Vietnam and Malaysia.
Furthermore, the Bank's involvement in the project has helped to resolve
the gas pricing issue between PTT and EGAT which has been in dispute for
ten years.
14.       Agreed Actions.  The main areas in which agreement was reached
are:   (a) preparation of an inspection test report c- the operating
condition of the existing 34-inch pipeline; (b) implementation of the
environmental action plan and associated monitoring activities outlined in
the Environmental Assessment (EA) report; (c) preparation of a safety audit
report on PTT's entire operation; (d) changes in the Office of the Internal
Auditor with respect to its staff strength and reporting arrangements; (e)
use of an independent extenial private auditor; (f) financial covenants,
including the requirements that PTT achieve a 25X self financing ratio,
maintain a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60/40, and have a debt service
coverage ratio of at least 1.3 times, except that the self financing ratio
may drop to 15X in 1993; and (g) annual Bank review of PTT's investment
program. Retroactive financing equivalent to US$22 million is recommended
for expenses incurred after September 1, 1991, for partial payment for line
pipe materials and consultancy contracts, for amounts which have already
been paid by PTT through advanced contracting approved by the Bank.
Although this amount exceeds the Bank guideline for retroactive financing,



- 4 -
it is needed to finance pipe material critical to adhering to the tight
implementation schedule.
15.        nvi&ronmental Aspects.  The project is not expected to have any
substantial adverse impact on the environment. Indeed, the impact will be
relatively positive, because the use of natural gas is significantly less
harmful to the environment than the alternative fuels which are either fuel
oil or coal. There are, however, several potentially adverse environmental
impacts such as disruption of marine life, the discharge of liquids from
the production platform, the disposal of mercury, and noise and vibration
from equipment.   These are addressed tbrough the mitigation plan agreed
with PTT.
16.       Project Benefits.  The project would have significant economic
and  environmental  benefits.    Its  implementation  would  help  ensure
Thailand's continued economic growth.   The gas transported under the
proposed project will be used for power generation in combined-cycle plants
which form part of EGAT's least cost power development plan. The economic
benefits of the project are derived from the opportunity value of gas -- as
compared to the use of alternative fuels -- which is higher than the
incremental costs of gas supply.
17.       Risks.  Risks for the project revolve around two areas:  (a) the
availability of sufficient gas reserves; and (b) the costs of producing
such reservas.   The gas reserves have been assessed and certified by a
qualified consulting firm which is pre-eminent in the field of reserves
estimation, to be at least 1.5 tcf, the volume on which the proposed
project is based. The risk of lnsufficient gas reserves is consequently
low. The risks associated with a potential increase in production costs
stem from the complex nature of the reservoirs, in that the volume of gas
is distributed in numerous small reservoirs, requirlng a larger number of
platforms and wells than otherwise would be ezpected. This risk has been
mitigated by taking into account appropriate contingencies in setting cost
parameters, and by having benefitted from the experience of another gas
producer which has operated nearby since 1981.
18.       Reco_mendatio.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
