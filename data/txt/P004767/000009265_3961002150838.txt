BONGKOT GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECI
Loan and Prolect Summary
Borrower:            Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
Guarantor:           Kingdom of Thailand
Amount:              US$105 mil:ion equivalent
Terms:               17 years, including a grace period of 4 years, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Project Objectives:  The objective of the project is to increase the gas
supply capabilities of Tha4.land by: a) expanding the
gas  transmission  system;    b)  strengthening  the
institutional functioning of PTT; and c) making more
efficient use of capital resources in the gas sector
through annual review of PTT's investment program.
Proiect Description: The project consists of the following components: (a)
a 32-inch, 175 km long submarine pipeline from the
Bongkot gas field to the existing Erawan production
complex; (b) a 24-inch, 160 km long submarine pipeline
from Erawan to a terminal at Khanom; (c) a new
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and
telecom system and renovation of the existing system;
(d) a riser platform; (e) equipment including
additional compression capacity; (f) upgrading of
PTT's Management Information System (MIS) and training
of staff; and (g) a study for preparation of safety
and environmental standards, and a study for a second
pipeline.
Benefits:            The proposed project would have significant economic
and environmental benefits. The gas will be used for
power generation, in a combined-cycle plant, which has
been shown to be part of Thailand's least-cost
solution to power generation. The economic benefits
of the project are derived from the value of fuel
(mainly fuel oil) displaced by gas, corrected for the
differential in thermal efficiency. In addition, the
project produces a significant volume of condensate
saleable in international markets.  Environmentally,
natural gas is a clean and low-polluting fuel compared
to alternative sources of energy.
Risks:               Risks for the project revolve around two areas:  (a)
the availability cf sufficient gas reserves; and (b)
the cost of producing such reserves. The gas reserves
have been assessed and certified to be about 1.5 tef,
the volume on which the proposed project is based.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



The risk of insufficient gas reserves is consequently
low. The risks associated with potential increase in
production costs stem from the complex nature of the
reservoirs.   This risk has been mitigated by taking
into account appropriate contingencies in setting cost
parameters, and benefitting from the experience of
another gas producer, which has operated nearby since
1981.

I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A.  The Role of Energy in the Thai cqonmy
1.1       Sinca '.987, GDP growth in Thailand has averaged 11.5X, making
Thailard the fastest growing economy in the world.   Commercial energy,
particularly oil and gas, plays a critical role in Thailand's economy
because (a) Thailand '..  a relatively modest endowment of commercial energy
resources and (b) the country's dramatic industrialization in ree~ent years
has led to a sharp increase in the consumption of commercial energy.
Demand for commercial energy continues to far exceed domestic supplies.
This gap is lik6ly to intensify in the future, in view of the continued and
rapid economic growth expecteu in Thailand and the uncertair. prospects of
discovering further major oil and gas reserves.
'.2       Like other middle-income,  oil-importing countries,  Thailand's
nomy is greatly affected by the price of oil. In the earlv 1980s, when
country faced sharp increases in oil import prices and then the oil
I    absorbed over one third of the country's export earnings, Thailand was
ab_ ro maintain growth, but only at the expense of high inflation, large
fiscal md ex-rnal deficits, and heavy international borrowings.  While
the Government implemented fiscal policy measures to revive the economy,
the dec'.ne in the price of oil in 1986 was the single most important
factor i., brii-irg about a surplus in the country's current account.
Furthermore, ti i Government's decision to retain most of the oil windfall,
rather than n  sing it on to consumers, helped to increase national
savings, resulting in increased investments.
1.3       Despite the country's  impressive economic growth, per capita
energy consumption in Thailand and the type of energy consumed is that of a
middle-income developing country: a modest 320 kilogram oil equivalent
(koe) consumption of energy per capita (compared with the average 420 koe
for all Asia) and a relatively high share (35X) of traditional fuels in the
final energy consumption.   This is explained by the size of the rural
population and the relatively high price of commercial energy compared with
rural income levels, which places commercial energy beyond the reach of
the lower-income group.
B. Energy Resources and Production
1.4         As of end-1990, the remaining recoverable reserves of oil in
Thailand totalled about 260 million barrels, including about 195 million
barrels of condensate, which would have to be produced in association with
offshore  gas,  and about 65 million barrels of crude  oil.   Possible
additional oil reserves are estimated at about 125 million barrels,
consisting of about 65 million barrels of condensate in off-shore gas
fields and 60 million barrels of oil (see para. 2.2).   Oil production in
Thailand is currently limited to Phet crude from the Sirikit oil field in



-2-
Kamphaeng Phet Province, which amounted to 22,000 barrel per day (bpd) in
1990.   In addition,  about 19,000 bpd of condensate were produced in
association with gas from offshore fields in the Gulf of Thailand. To meet
the country's oil demand, Thailand imported 145,000 bpd of finished
petroleum products, and 208,000 bpd of crude for processing in its local
refineries.
Natural Gas
1.5       Natural gas has been discovered mostly by companies exploring for
oil. As of end-1990, the remaining proved and probable reserves of natural
gas in inailand totalled about 7 tcf.  Possible additional gas reserves are
estimated at about 3.7 tcf. Gas production in 1991 was about 770 mmcfd, of
whnich 670 mmcfd were produced from the offshore fields.
Hydro Power
1.6       Thailand's hydropower potential, excluding that of its two main
international rivers--the Mekong and the Salween--is estimated at 9,300 MW,
of which about 2,250 MW (with an annual generation capability of 5,400 6Wh)
has already been harnessed.  Thailand is also importing 750 GWh from Lao
PDR and Malaysia. Higher iulvestment costs and environmental concerns are
the major constraints for further development of hydro power in Thailand.
1.7        Thailand is endowed with relatively low grade coal resources,
generally categorized as lignite.   Thailand's geological coal resources
amount to 2.2 billion tons (about 450 million toe), of which an estimated
800 million tons are economically exploitable reserves.   Almost 70X of
these resources are located in the Mae Moh Basin in northern Thailand which
is exploited solely by EGAT, the largest user of coal. The production of
local coal in 1990 was about 9.8 million tons.   In addition. Thailand
imported 0.3 million tons of coal in 1990, for use in the industrial
sector.
C. Energy Consumption and Demand
1.8       In 1990, total supply of commercial energy in Thailand was about
28 million tons of oil equivalent (toe). This was a two and a half fold
increase over 1980. Petroleum represented 701 of the total supply; natural
gas 16X, lignite 91, hydro power 4Z, and coal 1Z. Since Thailand exports
very little commercial energy, the entire supply was consumed in the
country. Table 1.1 summarizes the past consumption and the prospects for
commercial energy demand in Thailand. A detailed energy balance is given
in Annex 1.

1.9       Final commercial energy consumption in the economy continues to
be dominated by the transport sector, which in 1990 accounted for 40X,
followed by the industrial and commercial sectors, accounting for 30% and
24X respectively. Traditional fuel (fuelwoods, charcoal, and agricultural
residues) continues to represent a significant albeit rapidly declining
share of energy consumption in the rural residential sector.
Petroleum
1.10      Demand for petroleum products ir 1990 was about 201 higher than
in 1989.   Since 1985, LPG consumption has grown at an annual average rate
of 111. largely because of its increasing use in the residential sector,
but also in petrochemical industries. Gasoline consumption has grown at an
average 12X p.a. since 1985, reflecting increased consumption in the
transport sector.1'  Demand for jet and aviation fuel grew at 11  p.a.
becausr  of increased air travel.  Fuel owl demand grev at about 13X a year,
due to increased demand from industries and sea vessels as well as its
continum.ng use in electricity generation. Diesel oil consumption grew at
121 p-a. and had the highest Powth between 1987 and 1990, averaging about
14.61 p.a.   These rates of 6?owth were realized despite an increase of
about 1.9 Baht per lite'  ..L the retail prices of petroleum products.

1.11      In 1990, Thailand imported its crude oil from the Middle East
(641), and .-rom Malaysia and Brunei (36%). The imported crude is processed
in the country's three refineries: the Bangchak Petroleum Co., Ltd. (BPC)
refinery --in which PTT has a 30% interest-- with a current capacity of
65,000 bpd; the Thai Oil Co., Ltd. (TOC) refinery -- in which PTT owns a
49% interest -- with a current capacity of 107,000 bpd; and the Esso
Standard Thailand Ltd. refinery --wholly owned by Esso Eastern Inc.-- with
a capacity of 65,000 bpd.
1.12      The marketing of petroleum products in Thailand is shared by PTT
(about 30X), Esso (24%), Shell (23%), Caltex (14%), and others (9%). As of
April 1990, there were about 3,250 retail stations in Thailand.
Power
1.13        Thailand's total installed generating capacity as of September
1990 was 7,970 MW, and ano.her 4,193 MW will be added by December 1994.
The additional capacity includes the new 600 MW combined-cycle plant at
Khanom, which will use natural gas from the proposed Bongkct project.
Existing generating facilities consist of: conventional thermal plants
(54%);  hydropower   i3%); combine'-cycle  plants  (15%);  and combustion
turbines (3%).
1.14      Per capita electricity consumption in Thailand has grown from 19
KWh in 1961 to 606 KWh in 1989. Demand for electricity, particularly in
the past two to three years, has surged, with about a 15% average increase
a year, fueled mainly by rapid GDP growth in the industrial rector, but
also by the recent substantial expansion in the residential sector, both in
urban and rural areas.  The industrial sector consumed about 48% of the



-5-
electricity, the residential and commercial sector each about 22X, and the
government and other public facilities about 81.
1.15      De-and for coal in Thailand surged during the period of high oil
prices.  The total share of coal consumption in commercial energy, which
was less than 41 in 1980, is now about 91, or 2.2 million toe per year.
This corresponds to a 17X increase per year, thre. times average GDP
growth.   Domestic coal supplies about 901 of demand.   The power sector
accounts for 801 of total coal consumption. Based on current consumption,
and co;.sidering proeluction constraints due to environmental reasons, EGAT
needs to start importing coal in 1996, to supplement the local supply in
order to meet its power generation requirements.
D. Future ProsRects for Energv
1.16      While the energy elasticity of GDP growth in Thailand between
1985 and l993 was 1.2, reflecting the continuous expansion of energy
consumption in the industrial sector, the past trend is not expected to
continue because of increased efficiency in energy use and, to a lesser
degree, the structural shift away from heavy industry to light
manufacturing and services. The Government accordingly projects that total
energy consumption wi?l grow at an average rate of 8.71 a year between 1990
and the year 2000, hence an implied energy/GDP elasticity of 1. This is a
realistic forecast considering projected growth of the various sectors.
Oil consumption is expected to increase at the rate of 81 a year between
1990 and 2000, and natural gas consumption at 71 a year, primarily because
of a supply constraint. In the power sector, the latest forecast by EGAT
envisages a 14.51 base-case growth for 1992, followed by an 3.41 growth for
1993-97 and 6.9Z for 1998-2000.  Demand for domestic coal is expected to
increase at about 141 a year throughout this decade.   Annex 2 provides
PTT's detailed forecast of commercial energy demand in nailand.
E. The Institutional Framework
1.17      Institutional  arrangements  for  the  regulation  of Thailand's
energy sector are rather complex, cutting across several ministries and
agencies. The principle actors are: (a) the National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB),  the   government agency responsible for the
formulation of overall economic and social policy, reporting to the Office
of the Prime Minister;   (b) the National Energy Policy Committee (NEPC),
which acts on behalf of the Cabinet on all matters related to energy policy
and planning;   (c) the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO), a senioi
policy formulation, coordination and advisory body focused on energy
matters, which serves as a secretariat to NEPC;   (d) the Department of
Mineral Resources (DMR), which is responsible for resource assessment,
granting of licenses for exploration and production, setting and enforcing



- 6 -
of environmental and safety standards governing production activities, and
royalty collection;   (e) the National Energy Administration (NEA), under
the Ministry of Science, Technology and Energy, which is responsible for
development of non-conventional energy sources, energy conservation, and
identification and promotion of new uses for domestic energy sources; and
(f) the National Environment Board (NEB), chaired by a Deputy Prime
Minister and responsible for advising the Cabinet on all aspects of
environmental protection in Thailand.
1.18      While the public enterprises in the energy sector enjoy a large
degree of autonomy in the conduct of day-to-day operation, the Government
continues to control matters related to investment planning and financing.
Recently, however, the Government is increasingly introducing measures to
pave  the  way  for  commercialization  of  revenue-generating  public
enterprises. PTT is among the first state enterprise to be selected by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) for de-regulation so long as it meets a set of
profitability and pruductivity performance criteria.
F. Sectoral Issues and Strategy
1.19      During  the  past  decade,  the  Government  and  the  Bank  have
coopezated to identify and address the following issues in the energy
sector:
(a) Insufficiency of domestic energy resources to meet the growing
demand is the most critical issue in the sector. Since the late
1970's, the Government has made serious efforts to reduce the
country's dependence on imported energy. As a result, the share
of imports in commercial energy declined from 94X in 1980 to 63X
in 1990, primarily through increased production of domestic coal
and natural gas.   However, it is now recognized that further
expansion of domestic energy supply is limited and the country is
likely to rely more neavily on energy imports in the future. The
Government is therefore attempting to devise an energy import
policy which would minimize both the risk and the expected
economic cost of energy imports to the country.  The Government
and the Bank are cooperating in exploring possibilities of
importing gas and liquified natural gas (LNG) from the countries
in the region (para. 2.13).
(b)  Heavy burden of energy investments on public resources has been
recognized as an impediment to economic growth. As a result, the
Government and the Bank have cooperated in investigating various
avenues to promote private sector participation in the energy
sector.   In the power sub-sector, which is the country's most
capital-intensive industry, the Government has adopted a policy
towards potential commercialization of EGAT, encouragement of
private independent power generation and private cogeneration.
In the petroleum sector, private oil companies have taken the
major share in refining and distributing petroleum products. In



- 7 -
the  gas  sub-sector,   private  companies  dominate  upstream
activities. In addition, the recent reorganization of PTT into
profit centered business units is an initial step towards
commercialization of PTT and eventual privatization of its
individual business units.
(c) Subsidies and cross-subsidies in energy prices have been
recognized as an important contributor to inefficient use of
energy. During the 1980's, the Government introduced successive
increases in power tariffs to align the rates with the cost of
supply.   In 1987,  the Government took a major step towards.
floating retail oil prices by tying local ex-refinery prices to
the world market through weekly price adjustments based on
Singapore-posted prices. There are some remaining distortions in
the  relative  price  structure  of  petroleum  products.    The
Government is taking steps to align the relative price structure
of petroleum products with the structure of international prices
and domestic refining costs.   The prices of selected energy
products are given in Annex 3.
(d) Judicious use of energy has been recognized as a necessity for
coping with the economic, financial and environmental costs of
energy  supply.    Energy  conservation has  become,  since  the
introduction of the Sixth Development Plan (1988-92), a formal
objective of the energy sector policy.   Accordingly, the Plan
provides for:  (i) the establishment of the Energy Conservation
Center of Thailand (ECCT) charged with promoting energy
conservation through public awareness, consulting assistance,
training, inspection, research and development; (ii) the
establishment of the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand
and other financing agencies to provide low-interest loans to
industrial factories which adopt energy saving processes and
systems;   (iii) the reduction of taxes and duties on energy-
efficient equipment and appliances; (iv) the establishment of
educational institutes to promulgate energy knowledge to students
and the public; (v) consideration for enacting an Energy
Conservation Promotion Law mandating energy efficient designs for
new industrial and commercial buildings and systems, and
improving features of existing ones; and (vi) promoting transfer
of technology including between the Government agencies and the
privat_ sector.  These directives are currently being put into
practice by the NEA and its implementing arm, the ECCT.
(e) Environmental impacts of energy nroduction and consunmtion have
become a topic of public debate. The Government has recognized
the significance of the issue and is fully committed to the
development of the energy sector in an environmentally sound
manner.   Environmental concerns in the next few years will be
focused on:   (i) the impacts of rapid expansion of power and
mining  facilities;   (ii)  the  ecological  acceptability  of
hydropower projects involving dams; and (iii) the adequacy of the
existing environmental regulatory framework for formulating



policy and standards, enforcing compliance and monitoring the
quality  of  the  environment.    Measures  to  strengthen  the
environmental  safety  of  gas  production,  transmission  and
distribution are incor?orated in the proposed project (paras 3.16
- 3.22).

II. THE GAS SECTOR
A. Background
2.1       The natural gas indutstry in Thailand started in August 1981, with
transmission of offshore gas from Erawan field to Rayong through a 34-inch,
425- km long submarine pipeline financed by the Bank under Loan 1773-TH.
The Erawan gas field is operated by Unocal, the operator of the offshore
fields, under a production-sharing agreement.   After extraction of gas
liquids in a gas separation plant at Rayong (finarnsd by the Bank under
Loan 2184-TH), the dry gas is transported to the Bangkok area through a
160-km onshore pipeline, primarily for use in EGAT's power planta but also
for use in the industrial sector.   The gas liquids are used to produce
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) for domestic consumption and to provide
feedstock for Thailand's petrochemical plants.
B. Gas Reserves
2.2       Due to the complex geology of the basins in the Gulf of Thailand,
the reserves are distributed in many small reservoirs without easily
definable limits.   Hence, the reserve calculations --at least prior to
significant production history-- are based on statistical occurrence rather
than measured quantities.    The relatively high cost associated with
production of Thailand's offshore gas makes reserve estimates highly price
sensitive and rather subjective. A more detailed discussion of the general
geology of Thailand's sedimentary basins and its hydrocarbon reserves is
given in Annex 4. A summary of the reserves is given in Table 2.1.

2.3       Based  on  the  above,  the  gas  reserve  life  at  the  current
production rate is about 28 years, and at the production rate forecasted
for the year 2000 is about 23 years.   This is an adequate reserve-to-
production ratio (R/P).
C. Production of Gas
2.4       Thailand's  initial offshore gas production in 1981 from the
Erawan field averaged about 200 mmcfd. Subsequent drilling by Unocal in
the vicinity of the Erawan field resulted in discovery of several fields,
together currently producing about 670 mmcfd.  The production facilities
include 34 platforms and 422 development wells, 309 of which are now
producing.    The current production comes  from  fields under Unocal's
Contract I and II. The fields developed under Unocal Contract III will be
brought on stream in early 1992. On February 6, 1990, a total of 1 tcf gas
had been purchased by PTT from Unocal, less than nine years after the start
of the operation, rather than 20 years, as indicated in the original
contract.
2.5       In addition to offshore gas production, which represents about
90X of the country's total gas production, Thailand is also producing --
from the Sirikit and Namphong fields-- about 100 mmcfd of onshore gas,
which is used in the nearby power plants. In accordance with the gas sales
agreement signed between PTT and Esso for the Namphong gas, a reserve of
not less than 1 tcf must be confirmed before a gas utilization project can
be implemented.   In the interim, however, natural gas at the rate of 66
mmcfd was delivered until the end of 1991, and is projected to gradually
increase to 250 mmcfd by 1993. Annex 5 provides present gas consumption in
Thailand.
2.6       Gas production in the Gulf of Thailand is determined by two
striking features of the gas reserves: the gas fields contain many
individual reservoirs of varying size and shape; and most individual
reservoirs are small. Because each small reservoir depletes fairly quickly
when placed in production, a large number of platforms and wells are
required to recover the gas. In addition, since each production well may
penetrate from 2 to 20 or more individual reservoirs, workovers and re-
completions are rather frequent.   These factors make both the cost of
development and production relatively hig&.
D. Gas Availability
2.7       The forecast of gas availability from offshore fields in the Gulf
of Thailand is given in Table 2.2.

a See pars. 3.11 for discussion of ehisting pipeline.
* Point at which additional transport capacity is desirable.
2.8      COther potential gas supplies --besides those from the Gulf of
Thailand- - which may impact the Thai gas market include both onshore Thai
gas and imports. At present, onshore gas production is limited to the non-
associated gas from the Namphong field and associated gas from the Sirikit
field (para. 2.5). Namphong was originally estimated to contain 1,500 bec
of producible reserves and therefore a nipeline from the Namphong field to
the Bangkok area was contemplated.   However,  the additional drilling
resulted in reducing the estimated level of original reserve. Therefore,
no major additional onshore gas supplies are predicted prior to the year
2000.
2.9       Faced with a limited supply of domestic gas and its rapid
economic expansion, Thailand is looking to its neighboring countries for
gas.  This includes Martaban offshore gas in Myanmar, offshore Malaysia
gas, and any new gas discoveries in the Cambodian and Vietnamese portions
of the Gulf of Thailand. The offshore Martaban field with 2,500-4,000 bef
of producible reserve is a suitable candidate because of its low
development and operating costs and high-caliber reservoir.  Discussions
between Thailand and Hyanmar have been ongoing for several years without
producing any discernible result due to economic and political difficulties
in Myanmar.   Gas  imports  from Myanmar are therefore not  likely to
materialize before the year 2000.
2.10      Due to the limited market in southern Thailand and the distances
involved from the Malaysian gas fields to major Thai markets, it is not
expected that significant gas imports from Malaysia will materialize in the
foreseeable future.   A more likely scenario for imports from Malaysia
involves the extension of a Gulf of Thailand trunkline, to join the Joint
Development Area (JDA), a gas field shared between Thailand and Malaysia.
The development of JDA, however, requires additional exploratory work
before an appraisal program can be contemplated.



-12 
2.11      The eastern portions of the gas-rich Pattani Trough and Malay
Basin extend into Cambodia and Vietnam territory, making Thai imports
potentially viable.   However, exploration is only in the initial stages.
Furthermore, any pipeline would need to traverse the disputed areas for
Thailand to utilize existing infrastructure to import gas from Cambodia or
Viet Nam. At present, import potential seems remote, making the import of
gas from Vietnam and Cambodia unlikely before the year 2000.
2.12      Therefore, no additional gas supplies of consequence, either from
onshore domestic sources or imports, are likely to impact the Thai gas
market before the year 2000.  Domestic offshore gas supplies will be the
most likely source to provide increased gas production.   Unless new
discoveries are made in the Gulf of Thailand, the 1,400 - 1,500 mmcfd
plateau production expected in the late 1990s should become the target
level. Identified reserves should be sufficient to maintain production at
this level for eight to ten years, with expected new discoveries produced
to prolong this plateau further.
2.13      Thailand  has  recently  been  considering  importing  LNG  from
Indonesia or Malaysia. Given the high net-back value of gas in Thailand's
economy (particularly in the power sector) and its environmental
advantages, the option of importing LNG deserves further assessment. One
key consideration in importing LNG is that unlike other imported fuels
(e.g., oil and coal), LNG requires commitments to be made well ahead of
time because of the magnitude and long lead time of the investment
required. Another consideration is that imports have to be of a sufficient
scale to justify the necessary infrastructure. This requires a concerted
effort on the part of the Government, in part motivated by environmental
considerations, to promote the use of LNG as a major fuel source and adopt
appropriate pricing policy and other policies to bring about an adequate
level of usage. The Government is initiating a "fuel option" study, which
includes assessing the issue and options in importing LNG to Thailand.
E. Gas Demand
2.14      There is ample demand for natural gas in Thailand for the
foreseeable future.      Table 2.3 gives the supply/demand forecast for
natural gas in Thailand and Annex 6 provides a detailed breakdown.  The
supply/demand forecast indicates that Thailand will face a deficit in gas
supply for the foreseeable future. The Government's projection indicates
that the country's demand for natural gas will reach 1,975 mmcfd by the
year 2000, with about 1,400 mmcfd going to the power sector (including 610
umcfd for combined-cycle power plants).   These relatively conservative
estimates are based on the needs of currently identified end-users, without
taking into account rapid GDP growth in the future and the environmental
benefits associated with the utilization of natural gas. It is estimated
that if the gas supply is not constrained, the country's gas consumption
could reach 2,500 mmcfd by the year 2000.

Gas-Use Policy
2.15      While the Government has not formally adopted a gas-use policy,
it has examined the gas use options in various sectors.   The present
allocation of gas is based on the ranking of the economic value of gas in
different applications. The present policy is to extract the propane and
butane (C3/C4) fractions for LPG use, and the ethane and propane (C2/C3)
fractions for petrochemical feedstock.  The methane (Cl) fraction, which
represents about 80X of the total, is used in the industrial and power
sectors.  The gas in Thailand presently yields its highest economic value
when used in a combined-cycle power plant. However, since the total gas
demand in the industrial sector represents less than 5X of the country's
potential gas demand, the Government has made a decision to meet the full
demand of gas in the industrial sector, while adjusting the supply to the
power sector according to gas availability.
Gas Utilization for Power Generation
2.16      Due to rapid growth in electricity demand in Thailand, EGAT needs
to increase its generation capacity from 7,970 MW in 1990 to 24,794 MW in
the year 2000. EGAT has established that, subject to gas availability, gas
offers the least-cost scheme for the country's power generation



- 14 -
requirementsV. The economic benefits of gas use in combined-cycle power
plants and its value-added environmental benefits resulted in the share of
combined-cycle power plants to increase from zero in 1980 to 16X in 1990,
while the share of oil-fueled power plants declined from 48X to 221. The
share of coal-fired (lignite) power plants increased from 61 to 221.  In
addition to economic benefits, the underlying policy for this structural
shift stemmed from two objectives:   reducing Thailand's dependence on
imported nil and improving environmental conditions in the country.
2.17      Choices of fuel for EGAT however,  are becoming increasingly
limited. The remaining hydro potential is not easy to develop, because of
high costs ard environmental and forestry problems.  The reserves of the
country's li[aite are not sufficient to meet the increased power generating
requirements, and, in addition, the use of lignite creates environmental
problems.  Although the gas is the least-cost solution for EGAT's power
generation, because of constraints in gas supply, EGAT cannot develop a
reliable, long-term gas-based plan for its power generation needs.
Therefore, EGAT is forced to continue to include locally produced lignite
(or imported-coal-based) plants and dual-firing capability to supplement
gas with fuel oil in its master plan in case of gas inavailability. EGAT's
present planning calls for the share of combined-cycle plants to stay in
the present range of 15-16% between now and 2006, assuming that no further
gas would be available in addition to the existing reserves. The plan also
calls for the share of oil-powered plants to decline from 221 to 41 by
2006, the share of local-coal-powered plants to increase marginally, from
181 to 221, but the share of imported-coal-based power plants to increase
from zero in 1996 to 35% by 2006. EGAT's plan calls for switching to gas,
whenever gas is available. Annex 7 gives the projected demand of gas by
EGAT until 2001, for both thermal power plants and combined-cycle power
plants. The projected demand represents EGAT's minimum gas requirements.
If sufficient gas were available, EGAT's potential demand would be 1,420
mmcfd in the year 2000 (Table 2.3).
2.18      The size of EGAT's investment for natural-gas-based combined-
cycle power plants in its Seven-Year Development Plan (1992-96) is US$1.2
billion. Furthermore, the Seven-Year Plan envisages additional investment
in rehabilitation and new construction of oil-fueled power plants.   For
both oil and gas, EGAT needs to deal with PTT.   Given this size of
investment, EGAT and PTT need to coordinate more closely regarding the
proper programming of investments. While such coordination at the policy
level is currently through NEPO and at the corporate level between EGAT and
PTT, it is believed that a more formal exchange of information between PTT
and EGAT through regular, working-level meetings would produce substantial
benefits. During negotiations, assurances were given by PTT that it would
take the necessary measures to hold such a meeting at least every six
months (para. 7.2).

oxpansion sequences are analyzed using computer model WGOPLAN). The timing of the plant Is dotermined by analysis
of monthly load demand and avallable generating capacity.

F. Gas Pricing
2.19      Although Thailand has not yet established a comprehensive gas
pricing system for produicers and consumers, the Government's underlying
policy for gas pricing in sound, in that it is guided by the principle of
full cost-recovery.
Producer Prices
2.20       The cost of producing natural gas in Thailand is relatively
expensive compared with that in Indonesia or Malaysia. This is due to the
complex geological structure of the fields (para.2.6), which results in the
well-head transfer price bearing the high cost of field development and
production.   The average well-head price for Unocal's gas ranges from
US$1.77 to US$2.08 per mmbtu, while gas frov he Namphong field is about
US$1.00 per mmbtu. Except for Namphong gas, : r which the price is 100l
linked to the price of fuel oil, Unocal's priceb are partly indexed to fuel
oil (15X - 202), and partly to Thailand's wholesale prices (25X - 30X) and
to U.S. oil field machinery prices (40X - 60X),
Consumer Prices
2.21       The principle applied by the Government in setting consumer
prices is to link gas prices to alternative fuel prices in each activity.
Currently, PTT charges two prices: one for industry and one for the power
sector.  The present prices of gas to industry are intended to encour-.,e
LPG consumers to shift to gas, but no such incentive is provided to fuel
oil users.   This is because the gas has a lower net-back value when
substituting for fuel oil. In 1990, the average price of gas to industry
was Baht 100-120 per mmbtu. In the power sector, which uses over 902 of
gas in the country, the gas yields its highest economic value. The price
of gas for the power sector, i.e., EGAT, is about Baht 70 per mmbtu. The
price of gas to EGAT is low because of the size of EGAT's consumption and
because EGAT, as a swing customer, bears the weight of uncertainties of gas
supply and has to maintain dual-fired stations.
G. Experience with Previous Bank Loans
2.22      So far, the Bank has made three loans to Thailand in the oil and
gas sector over the past ten years.   The first loan (1773-TH) was for
construction of Thailand's first gas transmission pipeline.   The second
loan (2184-TH) was for the construction of a gas separation plant.  The
third loan (2184-TH) supported oil field developmer.t. These projects were
completed on schedule and within the budget, and they realized their main
objectives.   The Bank provided substantial institutional and technical
support to PTT, especially during its early stages when PTT had very little
operational experience. While several important lessons were learned from



- 16 -
the Bank's previous involvement, two in particular are relevant in
designing the proposed project:
(a)  During the first year of operation of the gas separation plant
(Loan 2184-TH), EGAT, PTT's major client, purchased less gas from
PTT than it had originally estimated, because EGAT saw no
financial incentives in using gas while the price of fuel oil was
declining. Since there was no formal agreement between PTT and
EGAT, EGAT simply switched its dual-fuel installations to fuel
oil. PTT was not in a position to pass on to its major client
the benefits of declining oil prices, because in its agreement
with the gas producers, the gas price was insensitiv& to
international oil prices. In the proposed project, a long term
agreement has been signed between PTT and EGAT, under which PTT
passes the full cost of its gas purchases from the producers to
EGAT, and recovers its transmission costs (para. 3.10).
(b)  Although  the  first  gas  transmission  project  (Loan  1773-TH)
remains economically sound, during its implementation the Bank
learned that the hydrocarbon basins in the Gulf of Thailand are
characterized by a complex geology, therefore requiring a
comprehensive appraisal of the discovered gas fields before
proceeding to the full development and production phase.   An
inadequate appraisal program could lead to substantial cost
overruns. In the proposed project, the designs have taken into
account risks related to the area's complex geology (para. 6.9).
H. Rationale for the Bank's Involvement in the Progosed Project
2.23      The Bank has been involved in Thailand's oil and gas industry
since  its  inception.    In the course of the dialogue  that has been
stimulated by this involvement, the Government and the energy-affiliated
agencies have continuously sought the Bank's advice in the areas of
institution building, pricing, investment programming, and least-cost
scheme development for meeting the country's rapidly growing energy demand.
In most cases, the Government has implemented the Bank's recommendations.
Some of the more important programs in this regard are currently in mid-
stream, and continued support from the Bank is critical to ensuring that
they will be concluded succe- fully: (a) the Bank has worked extensively
with PTT to develop techniques and processes for a more rational investment
programming and analysis.    Continued Bank  involvement will encourage
further refinement and correct implementation of the investment program;
(b) PTT has grown very rapidly over recent years, and as of January 1,
1992, PTT was reorganized into five business units operating on a profit-
loss basis.   Continued Bank involvement will help PTT in developing
internal systems and procedures and managerial approaches that are
appropriate to PTT's eventual privatization in which t*e individual
business units might be sold separately to the public;   and (c) in the
proposed project, Bank support to date has enabled PTT to take a broad view
at its objectives, including adopting a common-carrier approach to pipeline



- 17 -
development.   The proposed common-carrier pipeline will encourage small
independent producers to exploit marginal fields close to the pipeline, and
would also promote the regional trade in gas slnce the construction of the
pipeline facilitates the future importation of gas into Thailand from the
neighboring countries of Vietnam and Malaysia.   Furthermore,  the Bark's
involvement in the project has helped to resolve the gas pricing issue
between PTT and EGAT which has been in dispute for ten years, and has
helped attract co-financing for the project.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.1       Since the commercial discovery of gas in the Bongkot field in
1976 (para. 3.5), the Government has sought ways to implement a project for
economic utilization of this gas.   Immediately following the award of the
Production License by DMR, PTT commissioned Fluor Daniel to carry out a gas
ma-ter plan study, taking into account the potential gas availability,
forecasted demand, and the existing infrastructure.  A conclusion of the
study was that the implementation of the proposed project should be given
high priority. In February 1990, PTT requested Bank financing the project.
The Bank has reviewed the consultant's report and agrees that the Bongkot
Gas Transmission Project constitutes a high priority investment in the
master plan proposed for the country's gas transmission network.
B.  Project ObjectivUes
3.2       The objective of the project is to increase the gas supply
capabilities of Thailand by: a) expanding the gas transmission system; b)
strengthening the institutional functioning of PTT; and c) making more
efficient use of capital resources in the gas sector, through annual review
of PTT's investment program (para. 5.11).
C   rr_!lect Description
3.3       The  project  consists  of  two  submarine  pipelines  and  the
associated facilities to transport the natural gas production of the
Bongkot field to onshore locations in the southern and central parts of the
country. Map IBRD 23485 shows the location of the offshore facilities and
the routing of the pipeline. Annex 8 gives a diagrammatic description of
the project's content.
3.4       The major project components are:
(a)  A 32-inch diameter natural gas pipeline installed in water depths
ranging from  270  ft  to  200  ft.    The  pipeline would  run
approximately 175 km from the production platform being installed
in the Bongkot gas field to a new riser platform to be installed
approximately one km from the existing Erawan production complex.
The pipeline is designed to transport up to 700 mmcfd of natural
gas; V'
/   PTT antlcpates a plateau production of 350 mmcfd from the 8ongkot field, and expects an additonal 350 mmcld
In future from the JDA flold.



- 19 -
(b) A 24-inch diameter natural gas pipeline installed in water depths
of 200 ft to landfall. The pipeline would run approximately 160
km from the new riser platform at Erawan to the terminal at
Khanom. The pipeline is designed to transport up to 350 mmcfd of
natural gas;
(c) A new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and
pipeline telecommuw cations system, including renovation of the
existing SCADA system, and construction of new control buildings
at Khanom and at Chonburi;
(d) A riser platform to support a piping mainfold to connect the
incoming gas flow from the Bongkot field to the existing 34-inch
pipeline to Rayong, as well as the pipeline to Khanom;
(e) Equipment including additional compression capacity for PTT's
off-shore operation at Bongkot and Erawan;
(f) Consultancy and management services for engineering, procurement
and construction of the project facilities;
(g) Upgrading of PTT's Management Information System (MIS) and the
training of PTT's staff;
(h) A study for preparing engineering safety and environmental
standards for PTT's operations; and
(i) An engineering study for a new project to transport additional
gas from the Erawan platforms.
The Bongkot Gas Field
3.5       The Bongkot gas field (formerly called "B" structure) will be the
primary source of gas for the proposed project (IBRD Map No. 23519). The
field will be developed, produced and operated by a joint-venture of three
private producers and PTT Exploration and Production Co., Ltd. (PTTEP).
The produced gas will be sold by the joint-venture producers to PTT, in
accordance with a gas sales agreement signed in March 1990 (para. 3.9).
PTT will transport the gas and sell it to EGAT, under a gas sales agreement
signed in December 1991 (para. 3.10).
3.6       The Bongkot field is located about 180 km southeast of the Erawan
gas field.   Annex 9 provides more detailed information on the Bongkot
field.  On March 15, 1990, DMR transferred the concession rights in the
Bongkot field to a joint-venture group. The Joint Venture (JV) assembled
to develop and produce the Bongkot gas field comprises PTTEP (40X) which is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTT, Total Exploration and Production Thailand
(TOTAL) (30X), British Gas Thailand (BG) (20X) and Statoil Thailand
(Statoil)  (101).   A Development Plan for the Production Areas  (areas
surrounding the previously drilled gas production wells) was submitted to
DMR, and a seismic program cont.act has been signed for the Reserved
Exploration Areas (the remainder of the concession area). To proceed with



- 20 -
development, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), an industry leader in reserve
determination and experienced in working in the Gulf of Thailand, were
commissioned to provide a reserve determination for the Bongkot field.
After compreher.sive analysis, D&M certified 2,168.6 bcf of recoverable gas
(1,494.2 bcf proved and 674.4 bcf probable additional) in the Bongkot
Production Area. D&M estimates that up to 18 platforms and 160 wells will
be required to achieve producing the certified reserves.   They are also
estimating 55X recovery from the 3,973 bef proved and probable reserves in-
place.   This relatively low recovery estimate  (601 to 701 is normal)
reflects D&M's conservative approach.
3.7       The JV partners have entered into a participation and operating
agreement among themselves.    TOTAL was elected Operator.   The Operator
will handle all normal operations, i.e., preparation of budgets.
procurement and expenditures, and management of day-to-day operations,
including supervision of employees seconded by other parties. The Operator
will also prepare the Initial Program (the first phase of the Development
Plan and Definitive Cost Estimate) which must be adopted unanimously. A
more detailed description of the Operator's role is given in Annex 9.
3.8       The Development Plan for the Bongkot field is designed to produce
a minimum of 1,500 bcf of gas and 24 million barrels of condensate over the
life of the Gas Sales Agreement signed by JV and PTT. The cost for the
first phase of the Development Plan (Definitive Cost Estimate) is estimated
at US$383 million. Procurement is essentially completed and construction
is under way, with production start-up planned in October 1993. The first
phase (Initial Program), however, will not be sufficient to develop the
1,500 bcf of recoverable gas reserves and the associated cordensate called
for in the Gas Sales Agreement. The Operator is already planning a second
phase of development, but no Definitive Cost Estimate has been prepared
because implementation will depend on first phase results. PTTEP (with the
assistance of Statoil) has prepared a complete development plan to
determine the economics of the proposed pipeline project.   PTTEP's total
development plan requires central production and process facilities, 13
well-platforms and 123 development wells. The total Development Plan is
estimated to cost US$897 million. Considering related exploration costs of
US$55 million, the total investment for producing at least 1,500 bef of gas
and 24 million barrels of condensate is US$952 million.   The Bank has
reviewed the cost estimate and has verified the size of the investment,
which is also consistent with the cost estimate prepared by D&M.
Gas Sales Agreement Between PTT and Bongkot Field Producers
3.9       The Gas Sales Agreement signed between the Bongkot gas producers
and PTT for the proposed project follows the same principle outlined above
for the producer price (para. 2.20). Specifically, the transfer price is
based on the economic cost of supply: it is linked to the price of fuel
oil, and the price adjustment is based on a set of indices reflecting
domestic and international inflation.   The formula also includes stable
floor and ceiling prices to avoid the impact of short-term fluctuations in
international markets.   The initial base price is set at Baht 56.14 per
mmbtu, and the Agreement includes a take-or-pay covenant.   The formula



- 21 -
appropriately ensures economic efficiency by charging the full economic
costs (including a depletion premium) of gas supply, while allowing
producers to cover the cost of exploration, development and production, and
the Government to absorb the economic rent in the form of royalties and
taxes. The discounted (at 12%) transfer price of the gas over the life of
the field contractual reserve (1.5 tef) is calculated to range from US$1.98
to US$2.25 per mcf depending on the range assumed for the future prices of
fuel oil (i.e., fuel oil price varying from 73% to 85X of the price of
crude). While the price is relatively high, reflecting high development
and production costs, the economic value of this gas for power generation
is significantly higher than its cost.
Gas Sales Agreement Between PTT and EGAT
3.10        Consistent with its role of purchasing and transmitting the gas
to consumers, PTT seeks agreement with the major users for a price which
would cover PTT's cost of purchasing gas from upstream producers, as well
as its cost of gas transmission. Although PTT has supplied natural gas to
its major customer, EGAT, for about a decade, no formal gas sales/purchase
agreement was signed between the two entities until December 1991. During
pre-app.-aisal of the proposed project, the Bank raised with PTT, EGAT and
the Government the lack of a gas sales agreement as an outstanding issue
which needed resolution prior to project appraisal. Subsequently, PTT and
EGAT undertook extensive negotiations which resulted in the signing in
December 1991 of a ten-year sales agreement between the two entities. The
pricing structure stipulated under this contract -- as the price of gas to
be paid by EGAT to PTT -- is composed of three components: (a) the price
paid by PTT to the upstream producers (well-head price); (b) the average
cost of gas transmission by PTT (throughput fee); and (c) the value-added
tax (VAT), if any. A throughput fee will be assessed annuall) to ensure
that it reflects PTT's transmission costs and gives it a reasonable return
on its investment. The agreement provides that if PTT must invest in new
transmission facilities, the throughput fee will be readjusted to take into
account the new investment and will be in effect retroactively on the date
when the new investment was used. The current average price of gas s'old by
PTT to EGAT is Baht per 70 per mmbtu. During negotiations, agreement was
reached that prior to entering into any material amendment to the existing
gas sale/purchase agreements (between PTT and EGAT, and between PTT and the
joint-venture gas producers), PTT shall exchange views with the Bank and
shall take the Bank's views and recommendations into consideration. It was
further agreed th&t amendments that would be considered as affecting the
ability of PTT to perform are those dealing with the: (i) quantity of gas
to be purchased by or sold to PTT; (ii) price of gas sold to or purchased
by PT,; and (iii) duration of the agreements (para. 7.1a).
ProRosed Second Pipeline
3.11      Over 90% of Thailand's entire supply of natural gas comes fr,l
t.e Gulf of Thailand; all of that gas is currently being transported
through a single 34-inch submarine pipeline from Erawan to Rayong.   The
pipeline has been in operation for almost nine years, and its present flow
rate is about 670 mmcfd.   Its maximum design capacity is 850 mmcfd.



- 22 -
However, the pipeline has never operated at its design capacity due to
inavailability of gas supply. Periodic pipeline inspection -- the latest
In 1990  -- has  indicated some corrosion.   PTT plans  to run a more
sophisticated inspection test in early 1992, which should provide more
accurate information on the condition of the pipeline including its maximum
allowable capacity.
3.12      The need  for and the viability  of  the  second pipeline  to
transport additional gas from Erawan to Rayong is a function of: (a) the
present and projected production of gas from the Unocal and, to a lesser
degree, from the Bongkot fields; (b) maximum allowable capacity of the
existing 34-inch pipeline, depending on the result of the inspection test;
and (c) concern over the security of supply, since the existing 34-inch
pipeline is the only means of transporting gas to the critical consuming
centers  of  Rayong  and  Bongkot  for  power,  petrochemical,  and  other
industrial users.
3.13      If the inspection test determines that the pipeline can be safely
operated at its design capacity of 850 mmcfd, then no major dislocation of
gas supply would occur until about 1998, because the existing pipeline
would have sufficient capacity to transport the additional volume of gas
(Table 2.2). Under this scenario, the second pipeline, which is scheduled
for completion in PTT1s Master Plan in late 1995 or early 1996 -- primarily
for transporting gas from Unocal's future production under Contract III --
could be delayed by two years, depending on the pace of Unocal's field
development  activities  and  subsequent  production  rate.    Furthermore,
depending on the quantity of the additional gas supply from UJnocal fields,
the required increase in pipeline capacity could be achieved through
installation of a booster compressor on the existing pipeline rather than
constructing a new one.  However, if the inspection test indicates that
limitation should be imposed on the capacity of the existing pipeline, then
the need for additional capacity, in the form of a second trunkline,
becomes more immediate, possibly in 1995, as scheduled in the PTT Master
Plan. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the results of this
Inspection test would be furnished to the Bank not later than December 31,
1992, and that the Bank's comments on the results of the inspection test
and the pertinent recommer.dations of the inspection report would be taken
into account (para. 7.lb).
3.14      To determine the urgency of the second pipeline and the project's
viability, the Bank is providing US$2 million for the required consultant's
study as part of the proposed loan. The study, which will be carried out
not later than October 31, 1992 (para. 7.1j), will confirm the availability
and timing of the gas supply, and the optimal means of evacuating the
additional gas from Erawan to the onshore consuming centers.   It would
establish whether the additional gas in the region justifies the
construction of a second pipeline, and whether the proposed second pipeline
should be constructed offshore, closer to the shore or onshore.



- 23 -
D. Status of Proiect Pregaration
3.15      The project is at an advanced stage of preparation.  A contract
for the pipeline materials (to be financed by the proposed Bank loan) has
been awarded to a Japanese Consortium in accordance with the Bank
procurement guidelines. A letter of intent has been issued to a firm for
coating and jacketing the pipe in Malaysia.   Bids for the pipelaying
contract have been evaluated by PTT and its consultants, and the award is
expected to be announced in April 1992. Other engineering, procurement,
and related project activities are progressing at a corresponding pace. No
land acquisition problem is anticipated for pipeline landfall and onshore
receiving facilities since the land is owned by EGAT. The overall status
of project implementation suggests no impediment to the current rate of
progress, other than the possible lack of timely project financing
arrangements.
E. Environmental and Safety Aspects
3.16      Terms of reference for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
of the project were prepared jointly by the Bank and PTT's environmental
consultants, the Team Co., which was responsible for carrying out the EIA
and for preparing the Environmental Assessment (EA) report. The final EA
report has fully taken into account the Bank's comments, including the
measures to be taken to ensure that the project complies with the Bank's
environmental guidelines. Annex 10 provides the summary of the EA.
3.17      The project's negative impact on the environment is minimal
because use of natural gas would be significantly less harmful to the
environment than either fuel oil or coal. While natural gas consumption is
not pollution free, .it is inherently cleaner than other fuels. Natural gas
is free of most pollutants present in liquid and solid fuels and generates
less carbon dioxide (CO2). The reduction in CO2 emission offers a highly
cost-effective response  to the greenhouse  effect.    The gas used  in
combined-cycle power plants emits only 40X as much CO2 as a coal-fired power
plant. Treated natural gas has no sulfur content. Furthermore, the gas to
be transported by the project pipeline is non-associated gas, which has
much less environmental risk than the transport of oil or associated gas.
Nonetheless, a few potential but more manageable environmental issues
exist, including the disruption of marine life which may be caused by
changes in seabed conditions in the vicinity of the pipeline during
construction; the discharge of liquids such as process water, deck drainage
and sewage from production and living quarters platforms; the disposal of
mercury present in the gas; and the noise and vibration caused by equipment
on the production platforms. The EA report fully addresses these potential
issues and provides for appropriate mitigation actions such as pre-
treatment of liquid effluents before discharge to the sea, safe disposal of
solid wastes to approved sites on land and safe disposal of elemental
mercury. The disruption of marine life is not severe because only about
0.37 square kilometer of seabed would be subject to short-term habitat
destruction.   Indeed, during the operation phase of the pipeline lt is



- 24 -
expected that the pipeline surface would provide attachment points for
plant species and will provide cover for fish.  The design of equipment
will be in accordance with international standards for maximum safety and
allowable levels of noise and vibration.   Furthermore,  the EA report
provides analysis of alternatives, including the effect of various pipeline
routings on natural biological resources such as coral reefs.   Proposed
measures will ensure that the environment impact, if any, will be kept
within  limits  prescribed  by  Bank  guidelines.    During  negotiations,
agreement was reached that PTT will take all measures required on its part
to ensure full implementation of the action plan contained in the
Envizonmental Assessment Report (para. 7.1c).
3.18      The entire project design will be in accordance with applicable
international safety codes and standards.   Natural gas condensates are
separated from the gas on the production platforms before the gas is
introduced into the pipeline. However, small quantities of liquids will be
present in the gas as the result of condensation of hydrocarbon gases. The
condensed gases will be periodically removed from the pipeline by a "pig."
The pipeline route will be adequately demarcated, especially in shipping
lanes and fishing areas, to avoid potential damage to the pipeline (e.g.,
by a ship's anchor). The construction of the offshore facilities is being
carried out by the Operator of the Bongkot gas field (for upstream
facilities), and by PTT's construction contractor (for downstream
facilities).   The Operator, TOTAL, has extensive experience in similar
operations elsewhere in the world.   The construction of the downstream
facilities will be carried out under the supervision of Bechtel
International, which  also has vast experience  in this  area.    These
companies use high standards of safety and environmental protection, and
they would require the same from their sub-contractors.   Furthermore, a
study for developing environmental regulations for all offshore operations
in the Gulf of Thailand was proposed by the Bank as part of this project.
This study is part of the project but will be financed by ADB using Bank-
prepared TOR. The study results should be ready long before the completion
of project construction.
3.19      PTT's operational safety record has been excellent, and it is
expected that operation of the new facilities will meet this high standard.
The gas plant group experienced only one lost-time (14 days) accident
during 1989-90; this was due to a highway collision. Over the same period,
the pipeline group had no lost-time accidents, but there were two highway
fatalities, one in 1988 and the other in 1990.
3.20      Notwithstanding PTT's excellent operational safety records and
PTT's commitment to the environmental aspects of its operation, the
relatively young age of the oil and gas industry in Thailand has not yet
produced the necessary standards and regulations for safety engineering and
environmental  protection.    PTT  currently  has  no  well-defined  safety
engineering standards and environmental regulation, nor does it have an
adequate institutional framework to properly administer this aspect of its
operation.



- 25 -
3.21      PTT has commissioned the DKV Company of Sweden to carry out a
one-time comprehensive safety audit of PTT's entire operation.   During
negotiations, agreement was reached that the results of this safety audit
would be made available to the Bank not later than December 31, 1992, and
the Bank's comments on the audit would be taken into account (para. 7.1d).
3.22      In addition,  the proposed loan would include US$200,000 for
consultancy services to help PTT prepare adequate safety engineering and
environmental standards for its entire operation. It was agreed with PTT
that the study for preparation of safety engineering and environmental
standards would be carried out not later than March 31, 1993 (para. 7.1j).
Regarding the institutional framework, PTTIS new organization, effective
January 1, 1992, includes a safety and environmental committee chaired by
PTT's Governor as well as safety and environmental standards divisions in
each business unit.  The heads of the environmental standards divisions
report directly to the presidents of the respective business units.
Furthermore, each division has one or more sub-divisions (e.g., for
pipeline and gas plants within the natural gas business unit) to enforce
the standards and regulations at the operational level.
F. Prolect ImRlementation and Schedule
3.23      Overall responsibility and control over project implementation
will rest with PTT.   PTT has in the past implemented several similar
projects including the construction of the existing 34-inch offshore
pipeline financed by the Bank.   PTT has appointed Lavalin/Bechtel,  a
consortium comprising Lavalin and Bechtel International, both of Canada, to
assist in carrying out all stages of the project implementation cycle. The
consortium members are reputable international engineering firms which have
the experience and expertise for successful execution of the project.
Annex  11  shows  PTT's  organization  for project  implementation.    PTT
personnel will also be assigned to the project for on-the-job training and
other selected tasks.
3.24      PTT's internal schedule cal.ls for completion of the project's
physical works by December 31, 1993 (Annex 12).   This is a challenging
target which can be achieved with the cooperation and best effort of all
concerned.   PTT with assistance from its consultants has instituted a
critical path master plan to monitor implementation progress and to react
quickly  to actual and potential delays.   However,  to allow  for the
possibility of delays during testing and commissioning, the project
completion date is assumed to be June 30, 1994.
3.25      EGAT has already issued the invitation to bid for procurement and
installation of a 600 MW combined-cycle power plant at Khanom. The 200 MW
gas turbine for the first unit will be completed in December 1993, followed
with completion of the second 200 MW unit in April 1994. The 100 MW steam
turbine units will be completed one year after the respective gas turbine
units,  i.e.,  December  1994 and April  1995.    Annex  12 provides  the
completion schedule for the Khanom combined-cycle power plant.

G. Project Costs
3.26      The project  is estimated to cost  tha equivalent  of US$348
million, including taxes and duties which amount to US$13 million. Foreign
exchange costs total US$305.6 million or 88Z of total costs.   Table 3.1
gives a breakdown of the project cost by major components. Annex 13 gives
the breakdown of annual expenditures.  The estimate is expressed in end-
1991 prices and is based on actual prices of approximately 68Z of the total
project cost and on informal but firm quotation for the balance.  An 8X
physical contingency and a 2X price contingency have been added to the base
cost estimate.   The physical contingency  is adequate considering the
advanced stage of project design and the fact that pipeline engineering and
construction involve few uncertainties. The low price contingency reflects
the fact that all major procurement is on a fixed price basis, that two
major contracts have already been awarded, and that most procurement will
be completed by late 1992.  Taxes and duties were estimated based on an
average rate of 40X on all goods subject to such charges. The Government
requires PTT to pay taxes and duties only for those project goods which
enter Thailand's 12 mile territorial water zone.

- 28 -
3.28      Total financing required, including interest during construction
(estimated at US$22 million based on 8X interest), would amount to US$370
million. The proposed Bank loan of US$105 million would be made directly
to PTT at the Bank's standard terms for Thailand.   PTT would bear the
foreign exchange and variable interest rate risks of its loan, which would
be guaranteed by the Government.   The Bank loan would be for 17 years,
including 4 years of grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate. The loan
would finance 28Z of the total project financing required and 33% of its
foreign expenditures.
3.29      The financing plan has been developed on the basis of extensive
discussions with PTT, Japan Exim Bank (JEXIM) and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB); the JEXIM and ADB representatives participated in both project
pre-appraisal and appraisal.   The procurement packages were designed to
take into account the various co-lenders' internal requirements, the
project implementation schedule, and PTT's concern regarding its large
exposure to non-dollar hard currency, particularly Japanese yen. The Bank
would finance the engineering consultancy and the line pipe contracts and
several studies  (US$105 million),   while ADB and JEXIM would jointly
finance the pipeline construction contract, and the U.S. Exim Bank would
finance part of the the SCADA system. ADB and JEXIM jointly appraised the
project in February 1992.
3.30      The Bank loan may become effective before ADB/JEXIM's loan.
Since indications suggest fairly clearly that the proposed co-financing by
ADB/JEXIM will materialize (both institutions have shown strong interest in
lending for the proposed project and both have actively participated in the
project preparation), it was determined at negotiations that cross-default
and cross-effectiveness of the various loans were unnecessary.   In the
unlikely event that co-financing will be delayed, PTT is in a healthy
financial position to fund the project financing gap from its own
resources.
I. Procurement and Disbursement

3.32      The following five single responsibility contracts comprise the
bulk of the procurement required for the project:
(a)  Supply and delivery of pipeline material (US$85 million), a Bank-
financed component, the contract for which has been awarded under
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's procurement guidellnes. Owing to its critical nature, the
Bank had agreed to advance procurement for this contract;
(b)  Engineering consultgncy and project management contract (US$16.5
million), a Bank-financed component, the contract for which has
already been awarded by PTT in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines for use of consultants by the World Bank
Borrower;
(c)  Coating and jacketing  the line pipe  (US$28.9 million),  the
contract for which is to be awarded to a .1alaysian firm and to be
financed by PTTVs own resources;
(d)  Construction of the pipeline (US$121.2 million), the contract for
which will be awarded in accordance with ADB and JEXIM
procurement procedures; and



- 30 -
(e) Supply and installation of SCADA and telecommunication facilities
(US$11.4 million), the contract for which will be awarded in
accordance with U.S. Exim Bank procurement procedures.
3.33      Equipment,  including additional compression capacity  (US$22.0
million), is needed for PTT's offshore gas pipeline operation. These items
would be supplied and installed on the Bongkot production platform by
TOTAL, the operator of the Bongkot gas field, in accordance with an
agreement between PTT and TOTAL. Due to a lack of space on Unocal's Erawan
production platform, PTT requires a riser platform to support a piping
manifold to connect the incoming gas flow from the Bongkot field to the
existing 34-inch pipeline to Rayong, as well as the pipeline to Khanom and
the future second pipeline. The riser platform (US$41.9 million) would be
designed, supplied and installed by Unocal in accordance with arrangements
agreed with PTT.  PTT would procure civil works and buildings (US$3.3
million) in accordance with its own procurement procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank.   The remaining consultancies included in the
project would be selected and appointed in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines for use of consultants by the World Bank Borrowers.
Disbursement
3.34      The estimated disbursement of the Bank loan is shown in detail in
Annex 14 and summarized in Table 3.4 below:
Table 3.4: Estimated Loan Disbursement
(US$ Million)
Bank FY            1993        1994      1995
Annual                 75         21         9
Cumulative             75         96       105
3.35      Disbursement of the loan is based on the assumption that it will
become effective in the first quarter of the Bank's fiscal year 1993. It
is expected that the loan will be fully disbursed by June 30, 1994 (para.
3.24), the scheduled completion date of the project. On this basis, the
closing date for the loan is set for December 31, 1994.   The scheduled
disbursements are faster than the standard profiles for the region and the
subsector, reflecting the advanced stage of project preparation. Phasing
of the estimated disbursements of the proposed Bank loan and the Bank's
standard disbursement profile for the subsector are shown in Annex 14.
3.36      Due to a tight project implementation schedule and the critical
nature of the pipe material in the completion schedule, PTT had to advance
its  contract  for  pipe  material.    Therefore,  retroactive  financing
equivalent to US$22 million is recommended for expenses incurred after
September 1, 1991, for partial payments for line pipe materials and



- 31 -
consultancy contracts, for amounts which already have been paid by PTT
through advanced contracting approved by the Bank. Increasing the level of
retroactive financing from the Bank's normal limit of 10 to about 21X of
the loan amount is considered acceptable because:   (a) the increased
retroactive financing is required for progress payments on the pipeline
oontract which has been approved in advance by the Bank; and (b) the
retroactive financing will be for expenditures incurred within the
allowable period (12 months before the expected date of the loan signing,
and after the pre-appraisal).
3.37      The Bank loan would be disbursed against the categories outlined
in Table 3.5 below:
Table 3.5: Allocation of the Proposed Bank Loan
(US$ million)
Percentage of
US$ Million expenditures financed
Pipeline Materials      85.0        100l of foreign expenditures
Consultancy services    16.5        1002 of expenditures
Training, studies,       3.5        10OZ of expenditures
MIS
Total             105.0
3.38      Reimbursement for goods, services and training valued at less
than US$1.0 million would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure
(SOEs). Documentation of SOEs would be retained by PTT and made available
for review by Bank supervision missions. All other disbursements would be
made against full documentation.   To the extent possible, withradawal
applications should be consolidated into amount of US$1.0 million
equivalent or more, prior to submission to the Bank.
J. Monitoring. Reporting and Supervision
3.39      The Bank will monitor the progress of the proposed project in
terms of physical execution and financial reporting to ensure that all
conditions of the proposed loan are satisfied. For this purpose the Bank
would, on average, field two supervision missions per year, during the
active project phase to review project implementation, inspect job-site
activities and discuss, as required, any related matters with Government
and PTT officials. In addition, PTT would be required to forward periodic
progress reports.   During negotiations, agreement was reached with PTT
regarding the format, content and frequency of these reports (para. 7.1e).
The basic requirement would be quarterly progress reports for each



- 32 -
applicable project component and PTTVs semi-annual and annual financial and
auditors reports as defined in para. 4.14.
3.40      Project supervision by the Bank would be coordinated through a
supervision plan to be confirmed during loan negotiations.   Bank field
supervision would require a total of about 24 staff-weeks during the life
of the project, of which about 14 staff-weeks would be required during the
first two years of project implementation.  Supervision would be carried
out mainly by Bank technical and financial staff, including an
environmental specialist.

IV.  THE BRROWE
A. hackground
4.1       The  Borrower of  the proposed  loan would be  the  Petroleum
Authority of Thailand (PTT), which was established in December 1978 by the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand Act and became operational in July 1979.
mT's objective is to engage in and promote petroleum and petrochemical
activities.    It was  formed by the  transfer of operations  from  two
previously existing state ent6prprises: the Natural Gas Organization of
Thailand and the Oil Fuel Organization. It is wholly owned by the Kingdom
of Thailand and comes under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Industry.
4.2       While PTT focuses primarily on gas transmission and petroleum
products refining and marketing, it also is involved in upstream operations
through PTT Exploration and Production Co., Ltd. (PTTEP), a wholly-owned
subsidiary company which was established to handle petroleum exploration
and production activities.  PTT is a statutory body which, because of a
technicality in the Thai petroleum law, cannot co-venture with private
production companies.   It does, however, participate in joint ventures
through PTTEP which, as a limited company, can legally be the co-venturer.
PrTEP's accounts are kept separate from those of PTT to ensure proper
identification of exploration and production expenditures.
4.3       PTT has entered into joint venture agreements for downstream
operations and holds shares in two refineries --the Thai Oil Company
Refinery (491) and t'ne Bangchak Petroleum Co. Ltd. (301)-- and in the
National  Petrochemical  Corporation  (49X),  the  National  Fertilizer
Corporation (21X), Thai LNG Co. (101), Bangkok Aviation Fuel Services
(101), Intoplane Services Compnny (171), Thai Olefins Company (401) and the
Aromatics (Thailand) Company (251). In 1991, PTT invested in two new joint
ventures, buying a 25.5Z share in the Thai Petroleum Pipeline Co. Ltd. and
a 10 share in the Fuel Pipeline Transportation Co., Ltd.
B. Organization
4.4       PTT is a well-run state enterprise,  capable of managing the
substantial growth in investment, exploration and production, and sales
expected over the project period.  It functions as a modern organization
and enjoys a considerable degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations.
Although decisions concerning the investment plan and financing remain
subject to government approval, PTT has essentially been deregulated and
management  makes  the  key  operating  decisions  (para.  4.5).    PTT's
operational and policy decisions are made by a Board of Directors, which
consists of a Chairman and 11 other members, including the Governor. With
the exception of the Governor, the Board members, who are appointed by the
Council of Ministers, act in a part-time capacity. The Directors include



- 34 -
representatives from the Ministries of Defense, Finance, Commerce,
Industry, Transport and Communications and the Juridical Council. PTT also
has an executive committee, comprising the Chairman of the Board and five
Directors.  The executive committee meets frequently and is empowered to
make decisions on certain investments, contracts, staffing and other
operational matters.
4.5       While PTT has in the past operated under the constraints typical
of government enterprises in Thailand, it has recently been designated for
deregulation under a Ministry of Finance directive which allows greater
autonomy for those government-owned enterprises which meet certain
efficiency  criteria.    As  of  fiscal  year  1992,  PTT's  procurement,
organizational structure, and administrative controls are no longer
regulated, and salaries and benefits are no longer limited by schedules
applicable to state enterprise. The major areas remaining under government
supervision are the capital investment plan, which is subject to NESDB
approval, and the financing of investments, which is reviewed by the
Ministry of Finance.
4.6       As of January 1, 1992, PTT  was reorganized on a profit center
basis, with four separate buliness units reporting to the PTT Governor (the
attached chart shows the company's organizational structure). The business
units  are as  follows:    (a)  the downstream  oil companies  (including
logistics and transportation, refining and marketing); (b) the natural gas
activities; (c) the petrochemical facilities, and (d) central services.
While the administrative departments --including human resources, finance,
accounting and budget, policy and planning, public relations, and MIS--
remain in the head office, reporting to the Governor, the portions of these
functions relevant to individual operating units are decentralized into
each of the five business units.   It is intended that the individual
business units will function autonomously, and that the reorganization will
prepare PTT for an eventual privatization in which the individual business
units might be sold separately to the public.
C. Stafflng and Training
4.7       PTT's staff level, which totaled 3,720 employees as of year-end
1991, has remained relatively constant over the past five years, with very
little growth ln that period. The management and staff are competent and
well qualifict. About 62Z of the staff have received some form of higher
oducation. About 371 are temporary staff, largely in unskilled positions.
Since most construction ls contracted out on a turnkey basis, the PTT staff
does not include construction workers.

4.8       For the past several years, with Thailand's economic boom, PTT
has suffered a "brain drain" of experienced technical personnel leaving the
company to take mora lucrative private sector jobs. Under the system in
place through FY91, PTT had been obliged to use the government salary scale
published by the Ministry of Finance for all public enterprises.   For
technLcal employees, that scale was considerably lower than the private
sector compensation levels for comparatle jobs.   PTT s pay scale was
therefore not sufficient to retain trained engineers, computer specialists,
accountants and financial experts, chemists, geophysicists, and other
scientists.   With the recent deregulation, PTT has been freed from the
constraints of that salary structure, and it anticipates that, with its new
autonomy on salary and other personnel matters, it will be able to compete
more effectively with private sector companies. As of October 1, 1991, PTT
increased its salaries by an average 25X, with the increases allocated
largely to technical and financial personnel.   PTT plans to adjust the
compensation of these employees so that after a three year period, most
salaries would be within 801 of commercial levels.
4.9       Training falls under the overall responsibility of the Personnel
Administration Department, and focuses on both the management and technical
activities of PTT. In addition to significant in-house training programs,
PTT sends employees to outside training courses, both in Thailand and
abroad.   In 1991, nearly 200 PTT employees attended training programs
overseas.
4.10      PTT has a good record in project cost control, implementation and
management. It has been borrowing from the Bank since its inception and is
very familiar with the Bank's procurement guidelines.   Processing of
tenders and award of contracts are undertaken equitably and expeditiously.

D. Operation and Management
Accounting
4.11        PTT's accounting system conforms to modern oil anu gas industry
practices.    PTT maintains  separate  accounts  for  each  of  its  major
activities. The natural gas financial accounts are modelled on U.S. gas
industry principles, and accounts have been satisfactorily prepared for all
aspects of PTT's operations.   Accounting applications such as general
ledgers, payroll, inventory transactions, accounts payable, and accounts
receivable have been fully computerized. PTT prepares annual budgets for
its capital and operating expenditures; it also prepares five-year
forecasts for financial planning purposes.   Periodically,  reports are
prepared enabling management to compare actual results against budgeted
amounts. The budget process has been operating satisfactorily.
4.12      PTT's billing and collection system  is adequate.   Accounts
receivable are an average of 45 days of sales, which is consistent with a
government regulation requiring all state enterprises to collect
receivables within 60 days.
Audit
4.13      PTT has an Office of Internal Audit with a staff of approximately
40 auditors. The Office of Internal Audit is an effective management tool
for PTT.   Its responsibilities  cover audits of PTT's accounting and
financial functions, computer systems and programs, and operation systems.
The tasks outlined to be performed by the Internal Audit Office seem
appropriate. However, the Office could be strengthened by an increase in
staff.   Although  the scope of work  for audit of PTT operations  is
appropriate, because of the shortage of engineers on the staff of the Audit
Office, it has not been possible for all of the operations to be audited
each year. Rather, some sites have been audited only every few years. In
addition, it is important Xhat, as shown in the new PTT organization+,
structure effective January 1, 1992, the Office report directly to tf.,U
Governor (it previously reported to the Deputy Governor for Special
Affairs).   This will empower the Internal Audit Office and help its
recommendations to be taken more seriously. Accordingly, assurances were
given at negotiations that not later than September 30, 1992, the Internal
Audit Office will report directly to the Governor, and that the budget and
staff allocation of the Office will be changed to provide for three more
engineers, to be in-place not later than March 31, 1993, bringing the total
number of engineers on the Office's staff to six (para. 7.2). This will
enable the work to be completed as recommended.
4.14      PTT's external audit has in the past been performed solely by the
Office of the Auditor General, the government organization responsible for
auditing all state enterprises. While the performance of the Office of the
Auditor General has been satisfactory, it is desirable that as PTT takes
steps towards corporatization and potential privatization, it should also
be audited by a private sector auditing firm. Accordingly, agreement was
reached during negotiations that PTT in the future will be audited in
accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles by a private



- 37 -
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and PTT, and that PTT will
submit to the Bank its audited annual financial statements within six
months of the close of each fiscal year (para. 7.lf).
Insurance
4.15        PTT carries insurance against loss or damage which could cause
serious financial harm, and otherwise tries to limit its risks through an
internal risk management system.   It protects itself through all risk
insurance, which provides coverage against property damage on major
properties and any subsequent business interruption, protection against
third party legal liabilities, protection of cargoes and against delays or
damage in transportation, and protection against any catastrophic loss.
The insurance is provided through the Dhipaya Insurance Co. Ltd., a state
enterprise which reports to the Ministry of Finance.  Most of the risks
against which PTT is insured are in turn transferred to the reinsurance
market through the Sedgwick Energy Group, London.  PTT would continue to
make these provisions, which are satisfactory to the Bank, to provide
insurance against risks and in amounts consistent with appropriate
practice.
Taxes
4.16      PTT is required to remit a portion of its net income to the
Government as determined by the Ministry of Finance on a periodic basis.
Remittance to tho Government is now set at 35% of net income and it is
expected to continue at that level. This is consistent with the corporatt.
tax rate in Thailand as well as to most other state enterprises.
4.17      Customs duties and business taxes on imported equipment and
materials for PTT projects have in the past been covered by the Government
in the form of equity contributions.   Ho-7ever, the Government has not
agreed to PTT's requests for assuring similar concessions for projects in
the future. Duties and taxes are therefore expected to be met from PTT's
own resources.
Management Information System
4.18       The Management Information System (MIS) of PTT consists of six
separate systems, some of which were inherited from PTT's parent
organizations. These systems include the SCADA system which monitors the
operation of the gas separation plant and pipeline systems, a finance and
accounting system, a management information system, a marketing system, and
two data systems -- one for oil and one for gas. These systems will need
to be adapted to PTT's new organization and they also should be integrated.
Integration of the systems would facilitate the transfer of information
from one function to another, both making access to information more
immediate and establishing the communication links which would encourage
closer integration of PTT's various departments.
4.19      Integration of the systems and adaptation of the MIS for the
proposed organizational structure would most appropriately be done by



- 38 -
outside consultants since the MIS Department of PTT has neither sufficient
staff nor the specific expertise to accomplish the scope of work required.
A consultancy contract, the first phase of which would cost approximately
US$1 million, would te required to complete the assignment, and has been
included in the proposed project. The study will be carried out not later
than December 31, 1992 (para. 7.1j). EssenLially, the first phase of the
consultancy service would involve identifying how PTT's existing computer
systems and those currently under development should operate under the new
organizational structure implemented January 1, 1992.   It would include
updating the MIS master plan, which would be implemented over the next five
years. This would involve developing a high level data model as a basis
for identifying the total integration needs relating to PTT's data and
systems; it would also involve an assessment of PTT's hardware needs. In
addition, the consultant would propose the optimal structure and staffing
plan for PTT's MIS department.
Research and Development
4.20       PTT's Research and Development Unit is a part of the General
Service Unit under the Vice-President for Technical Services. Although to
date PTT's research and development efforts have centered on the marketing
of petroleum products and on pollution reduction, an important future goal
is to develop new applications and uses for natural gas.   This would
include developing residential/commercial uses for natural gas, natural gas
use in the transport sector, and the cogeneration of electric power.
4.21      In the residential/commercial sector, PTT plans to investigate
the use of natural gas for such purposes as air conditioning, and it hopes
to improve the efficiency of gas appliances. Technological assistance will
be sought from major gas utilities such as British Gas, Osaka Gas and Tokyo
Gas. With regard to the transport sector, an active program is in place
for developing compressed natural gas (CNG) as a motor fuel, especially as
a substitute for diesel oil. The government has approved the purchase, by
the Bangkok Mass Transportation Authority (BMTA), of 200 buses especially
designed to operate on CNG. The buses are expected to be operational in
1993.   If results are encouraging, the BMTA may eventually replace its
entire  2,000  bus  fleet  by  CNG-powered  units.        PTT  is  currently
experimenting with two diesel engine buses running on CNG, and it is
developing CNG fueling stations. Research and development activities with
regard to co-generation will initially focus on evaluating the technical,
financial and economic feasibility of using cogeneration to produce
electricity for use in the gas separation plants.

5.2            During the period FY86-90, PTT's revenue increased from B 38,578
million to B 58,047 million--at an average annual growth rate of nearly
11.   The revenue growth was particularly dramatic in FY90, when sales
increased by 26X over the FY89 level. This was the result of a substantial
increase in PTT's revenues from oil operations. Sales volume of petroleum
products increased from 4,770 million liters in 1989 to 6,827 million
liters in 1990, for a gain of 43Z. This resulted in PTT's increasing its
share of the total market from 261 in 1989 to 301 in 1990.  To a large
extent, PTT's operating income and net income rose with sales through the
FY86-90 period.   The one exception to this trend was FY89, when both
operating income and net income declined. This reduction in income in 1989



- 40 -
occurred primarily because PTTs gas separation plant was forced to shut
down for 124 days (as opposed to 33 days in 1988) when mercury was found in
the cold box. The plant outage resulted in a 44X increase in PTT's refined
product imports.
5.3       During the past five years, PTT has been a strong financial
performer. This is primarily indicated in its rate of return (ROR) on net
revalued assets in operation, which has remained at or above 11 during the
period. <(Assets were revalued using government-published inflation indices
for fixed assets.)   Due largely to the unevenness of debt repayment
obligations, PTT's self-financing ratio (SFR) has been volatile. Indeed,
in FY88 and FY89 PTT's total debt service was larger than its internal cash
generation reduced by the increase in non-cash working capital.   After
being negative for two years, PTT's self-financing ratio (which was 731 in
FY88 and 35X in FY89) then jumped to 1281 in FY90. This dramatic swing in
the SFR was primarily caused by a 971 drop in PTT's long-term loan
repayment obligation, from B 4,081 million in FY89 to B 126 million in
FY90.   PTT financed its debt service obligations primarily through a
reduction in cash. While it will be important for PTT to smooth out its
future long-term loan repayment schedule (para. 5.4), it is notable that
during the FY86-90 period, PTT financed 421 of its total capital investment
program with  internally-generated  funds  (Table 5.2).   Also,  it will
continue to be advisable for PTT to re-finance some of its debt to lengthen
maturities and to reduce the percentage of debt financed in yen.
Accordingly, for future calculations of debt service coverage and self-
financing ratios, refinancing will be excluded from debt service figures so
long as the term of the debt, including the refinanced portion, does not
exceed 801 of the useful life of the assets financed by the debt (para.
5.9).

5.4     PTT's borrowings have been heavy, and the amount of its .debt has
been expanded substantially by the appreciation of the Japanese yen, the
currency in which about 30X of PTT's debt is denominated (para. 5.6). An
uneven debt repayment schedule (para. 5.3), exacerbated by mushrooming
foreign exchange losses (at year end FY90, the total unrealized exchange
loss on the revaluation of loans for completed projects was B 2,888
million), caused PTT's debt service coverage ratio to drop to 0.9 times in
FY89. However, PTT is a financially sound organization. Its debt service
coverage ratio averaged 2.3 times during the FY86-90 period and was 4.1
times in FY90.   PTT's capital structure remains satisfactory (long-term
debt was less than 601 of total capital throughout the five years, falling
from 591 in FY86 to 431 in FY90). To avoid erratic financial performance,
PTT should in the future consider arranging a more level debt repayment
schedule or plan debt refinancing to lengthen loan terms so that they
correspond more closely to the useful lives of the assets financed.
B. Present Financial Position
5.5     PTT's financial position as of fiscal year end 1991 is healthy, with
a self-financing ratio of 1211, an ROR of 131, and a debt service coverage
of 4.1 times.  These robust ratios were caused in part by a substantial
sales increase of 341 in FY91 (this on top of the ample 261 increase of
FY90): operating income increased by 571 over FY90's level; net income went
up by 1311.  They are also reflections of the uneven capital investment
program and debt service obligations of PTT.  Capital investment in FY91
amounted to only B 3,113 million, which was a decline of 461 from the FY90
level, and the debt service requirement, at B 2,028 million, was 341 lower
than the average of the previous five years.   The ratios have, however,
given PTT a strong balance sheet which positions it well for its future
operations. As of September 30, 1991, PTT's debt to total capitalization
ratio was 341 and its current ratio was 1.8 times; accordingly, PTT is in a
strong position to take on the expanded capital investment program which is
anticipated for the next few years.
5.6     Although PTT's FY91 debt to total capitalization ratio is low enough
to give PTT ample flexibility (para. 5.5), PTT nevertheless has significant
foreign exchange losses: its debt has been expanded by about 201 due to
currency fluctuations. As of September 30, 1991, PTT had long-term debt
(net of current maturities) of B 15,480 million, of which about 301 was
denominated in Japanese yen.   Since the Baht has weakened substantially
against the yen, PTT had incurred foreign exchange losses of B 2,606
million.    A  1986  Ministry  of  Finance  directive  required  all. state
enterprises to revalue foreign currency loans as of September 30 of each
year, and spread the loss over the remaining term of the loans. PTT treats
its foreign exchange loss in accordance with this policy. The policy is
not in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which
provide that except in the case of devaluation, the foreign exchange loss
should be written off each vear as it occurs. However, because the yen
tends to both appreciate and depreciate against the dollar (the currency to
which the Baht is essentially tied), the Thai Government policy provides a



- 42 -
smoothing effect which the Bank mission determined to be acceptable. While
the Thai foreign exchange accounting policy would not be appropriate in an
environment in which the local currency always depreciated against the
foreign currencies, it is acceptable in the Thai context and in fact
precludes the wide swings in earnings which would result if foreign
exchange losses were written off year by year as they occurred.
C. Financial Outlook
5.7         PTT's  healthy  financial  performance  is  projected  to  continue
throughout the next five years.   The challenge for PTT in the near-term
will be to assimilate and finance the expected sizeable expansions in its
capital investment. Its current financial strength should allow it to do
this without excessive difficulty.   Key indicators of PTT's financial
performance for the period FY91-96 are presented in Table 5.3, and detailed
projections are shown in Annex 16.

5.8       Although PTT's sales revenues are expected to increase only 3.41
in FY92, sales growth for the FY92-96 period is projected to be 151 per
year. Most of this increase is in the sales volume of petroleum products,
which are expected to grow on average 14X per annum.  Petroleum prices are
forecast to remain fairly steady through the five-year period.  Total gas
flow is expected to increase at a slower rate, averaging 4X per year: the
increase would come from gas flowing through the proposed pipeline.  Gas
prices for existing gas are forecast to remain fairly constant; prices for
gas flowing through the proposed Bongkot Pipeline, beginning in 1994, are
projected to be about 161 higher than for the for existing flows. (Further
information regarding these assumptions is included in Annex 16 and is
provided in greater detall in the project file).   PTT's net income is
projected to decrease through FY94.  This is due largely to increases in
interest expense in FY93 and FY94 (resulting from the incremental debt
required to finance PTT's expanding capital investment plan: PTT's total
debt service obligation will jump 771 in FY93, and another 391 in FY94).
PTT's operating ratio, which was 941 in FY91, will rise to 961 in FY92 and
remain at that level throughout the projected period. The ROR is projected
to remain at or above 131 between FY92 and FY96.   PTT's net property,
plant, and equipment which will be revalued each year according to an index
published by the Ministry of Finance, will increase at about 171 p.a. from
B 27,201 million in FY91 to B 60,020 million in FY96.
5.9       Due to PTT's expected continued high level of profitability, its
self-financing ratio over the medium term is forecast to remain at healthy
A'S is.   Except  in FY93  (when internal cash generation will not be
sufficient to cover the projected higher interest expenses and still
contribute 251 toward the substantial capital investment program), the
ratio will range between 251 and 381. The SFR is projected to be about 161
in FY93. Agreement was reached at negotiations that, except in 1993, PTT
would generate funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 251
of the annual average of its capital expenditures incurred, or expected to
be incurred, for that fiscal year, the previous fiscal year, and the next
following fiscal year. For its fiscal year ending in September 30, 1993,
PTT would generate funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than
151 of the annual average of its capital expenditures (para. 7.lg).
5.10      PTT's capital  structure  is projected to remain satisfactory
throughout the FY92-96 period. The debt to total capital ratio is expected
to average 501 and remain at or below 551 on a revalued asset basis.   The
debt service coverage ratio is estimated to range between 1.7 and 3.1 times
throughout the projected period.   Agreement was reached at negotiations
that PTT's debt-equity ratio (calculated after the revaluation of PTT's
assets) will not exceed 60/40 and that its debt service coverage ratio will
be at least 1.3 times. Debt refinancing would not be included as repayment
of debt for debt service ratio calculation purposes so long as the term of
the debt, including the refinanced portion, does not exceed 801 of the
useful life of the assets financed by that debt. Indeed, such refinancings
are encouraged as a way for PTT to smooth its schedule of debt service
obligations (para. 7.lh).

D.  Investment Prok * and Financing Plan
5.11      Annex 17 provides PTT's FY92-FY96 Investment program,  which
amounts to about US$2.3 billion. The investment program was reviewed by
the Bank mission and the necessary adjustments were made to provlde for a
more realistic implementation schedule. It was agreed that the Bank would
work closely with PTT in developing future investment programs and coherent
poli^ies for PTT's joint-venture participation.   The Bank and PTT have
agreed that the Bank should be consulted about the revisions and
preparation of PTT's long-term investment plan in order to make more
efficient use of capital resources in the gas sector (para. 3.2). During
negotiations, agreement was reached on annual review of PTT's investment
program by the Bank, with PTT required to take into account the Bank's
comments (para 7.1i).
5.12      A financing plan for PTT over the project period (FY92-96) is
presented in Table 5.4.

5.13       The proposed project, including interest during construction,
represents about 19X of the overall investment program during the
FY92-96 period. The proposed Bank loan of US$105 million is expected to
meet about 41 of mT's total financing requirements for the perlod. During
the FY92-96 period, PTT expects to meet 251 of its total capital
requirements from internally generated funds.
5.14       Borrowings  from external  sources  amount  to  751  of  PTT's
financing requirements for FY92-96.  ITT's sources of foreign borrowings
are expected to be the Bank (with its 17 year term, 4 year grace period,



- 45 -
and interest rate of approximately 7X), the Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund of Japan (with a 30 year term, 10 years of grace, and 2.5X interest
rate), the Japan Export-Import Bank (with a 15. year term, 5 years of grace
and  approxiartely  71  interest  rate),  and  foreign  commercial  banks
(typically with 10 year terms, 2 years of grace, and pricing at
approximately London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). PTT expects to raise
funds locally by issuing bonds and by borrowing from local commercial
banks.

VI. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Economic Benefits
6.1         Projected supply  and demand of natural  gas  indicate  that
beginning in 1993-94 and continuing through the life of the proposed
project, Thailand will be facing a deficit in gas supply (para. 2.14). The
Government policy to cope with the deficit would be to adjust the supply to
EGAT, by far the largest consumer of gas, while providing other existing
consumers with their full gas requirements. The economic viability of the
proposed gas project should be assessed based on the economic position of
natural gas in EGAT's least-cost expansion of power generating capacity.
BGAT's fuel choices in the absence of major hydro candidates are:   (a)
domestic coal (lignite) which, even if developed to its full potential and
ignoring its environmental externalities, would not be sufficient to supply
the fuel needed for the incremental power demand during the 1990s; (b)
natural gas; (c) imported coal; and (d) imported fuel oil. EGAT's analysis
indicates that natural gas utilized in the combined-cycle power plant
represents the least-cost fuel for power generation (para. 2.16).
6.2        Although the economic viability of gas supply is demonstrated by
the priority ranking of the gas option in EGAT's least-cost development
plan, the internal economic rate of return (IERR) of the proposed project
should be calculated based on its incremental costs and benefits.   The
incremental costs include: (a) capital and operation and maintenance (O&)
costs of gas development and production; and (b) capital and O&M costs of
gas transmission. The gas development and production costs are estimated
based on the planned schedule of drilling and installation of the required
facilities by the gas producers to produce 1.5 tcf of gas. These estimated
costs, both capital and O&M, are investment-grade estimates and highly
reliable because they have been submitted as part of the Gas Sales
Agreement for the "Definitive Cost" of the field development and production
plan (para. 3.8). The estimates have also been verified by DeGoyler and
MacNaughton. The capital cost of the proposed project is based on PTT
consultant's estimate, representing the construction cost of pipeline
systems connecting the Bongkot field to Erawan platform, and the Erawan
platform to Khanom. The project cost estimate is now confirmed by actual
bids and quotations received from the suppliers for various project
components. The O& cost for the project is assumed at 3X of the capital
cost.
6.3         The incremental benefit of the proposed project is estimated
based on the economic value of marginal gas supply. The marginal economic
value consists of: (a) the netback value of gas used in EGAT's combined-
cycle power plants; namely, the value of fuels (mainly fuel oil) displaced
by gas, corrected for the differential in thermal efficiency; and (b) the
net value of liquids extracted from the raw gas prior co its being used for
power generation.



- 47 -
6.4         For the base case,  the IERR calculated is 26Z.   Details,
including the assumptions tused, are given in Annex 18. This hlgh rate of
return Is largely due to: (a) the value of condensate (gas liquids) which
is produced in association with the gas and sold in international markets
for almost the same price as crude oil; and (b) the high efficiency of
natural gas in combined-cycle power plants.
6.5         The analysis of the sensitivity of the IERR to the underlylng
assumptions indicate that if the capital and O&M co. ;s increase by 10, the
IERR decreases only by 31.   Hence,  the project would have to incur
exceptionally high development and production costs (the main project risk
due to complex reservoir geology), in order to render the project
uneconomic. The sensitivity of IERR to other assumptions are:
IERR (X)
(a)    Price of fuel oil decreases by 10;               24
(b)    Capital and O&  cost, up 10;                    23
(c)    Gas supply, down 10;                             23
(d)    Capital and O&M cost up 101, and
gas supply down 10,                             20
6.6        Assumptions used for the base case IERR are rather conservative
in that the price of fuel oil is assumed to be 801 of the crude oil price
projected by the Bank. Historically, the fuel oil price in the Singapore
market has hovered around 85-95X of the crude oil prices. Furthermore, it
is assumed that the total volume of gas which will be produced from the
Bongkot field would be limited to 1,500 bcf, namely the contractual
reserve.   The more likely scenario is that at least 1,750 bcf of gas will
be produced from the Bongkot field. The IERR was also tested assuming that
the gas would displace the fuel oil on a Btu-Btu basis, hence discarding
the thermal-efficiency value of the gas in power generation.   The IERR
calculated on this basis is 141.
6.7         The financial rate of return calculated is 161.  Annex 18 also
shows the detailed calculation of the project's financial rate of return.
This calculation is based on the capital and operating cost estimates
contained in the project cost table, including taxes and duties. Although
the Gas Sales Agreement between PTT and EGAT does not provide for a firm
price for the Bongkot gas, which comes on stream in 1994, PTT intends to
seek a price for this gas from EGAT which would cover its costs and which
would yield a reasonable (121) return on its investment. PTT is currently
contemplating a price of Baht 80-82 per mmbtu, based on the present cost
estimate of the project. The final price of the Bongkot gas to EGAT will
be decided in 1993, when the project costs are more accurately established.
B. Environmental Benefits
6.8         An added benefit of the proposed gas infrastructure investments
is the major contribution natural gas will make toward mitigating the
impact of energy use on the quality of the environment.   Without the
proposed project, the fuel used by EGAT for power generation would be



- 48 -
either coal or fuel oil. Compared to coal and fuel oil, natural gas is a
clean and low-polluting fuel; its expanded availability particularly in the
Bangkok area (and progressively in other parts of the country) will lead to
a significant improvement in air quality in these areas by reducing
emissions of, inter alia, S02 and particulates (para. 3.17). The new gas-
fired power plants will in effect substitute for fuel oil or coal-fired
stations.   Based on the fuel substitution,  the project is expected to
reduce emissions of S02 by about 45,000 tons each year. The project would
also result in a net reduction in CO2 production by 2-3 million tons
annually.
C. Risks
6.9         Risks for the project revolve around two areas:   (a) the
availability of sufficient gas reserves; and (b) the costs of producing
such reserve.   The gas reserves have been assessed and certified by
DeGolyer and MacNaughton, which is pre-eminent in the field of reserves
estimation, to exceed 1.5 tcf, the volume on which the proposed project is
based. The risk of insufficient gas reserves is therefore low. The risks
associated with a potential increase in production costs stem from the
complex nature of the reservoirs, in that the volume of gas is distributed
in numerous small reservoirs, requiring a larger number of platforms and
wells than would otherwise be expected. This risk has been mitigated by
taking into account appropriate contingencies in setting cost parameters,
and benefitting from the experience of Unocal producing nearby since 1981.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
A. Agreements
7.1         The following agreements were reached between the Bank and PTT
during the negotiations:
(a)    That PTT shall, prior to entering into any amendment to the
Gas Sale Agreement (between PTT and EGAT) or the Gas
Purchase Agreement (between PTT and Gas Producers) --
amendments which shall be considered by the Bank and PTT as
affecting  PT-'s  ability  to  perform  under  the  Loan
Agreement-- exchange views with the Bank, and shall take
the Bank's views and recommendations into consideration in
deciding whether or not to enter into such amendment.  It
was further agreed that amendments that would be considered
as affecting the ability of PTT to perform under the Loan
Agreement are those dealing with the: (i) quantity of gas
to be purchased by or sold to PTT; (ii) price of gas sold
to or purchased by PTT; and (iii) duration of the
agreements (para. 3.10);
(b)    That PTT shall furnish to the Bank not later than December
31, 1992, for its review and comments, a report containing
the results of the inspection test, evaluating the
operating condition of the existing 34-inch pipeline; and
that PTT take into account the Bank's comments and the
pertinent   recommendations   of  the   inspection  report
regarding the operation of the pipeline (para. 3.13);
(c)    That PTT shall take all measures required on its part to
ensure full implementation of the action plan and the
associated  monitoring   activities   contained   in   the
Environmental Assessment Report (para. 3.17);
(d)    That PTT shall, not later than December 31, 1992, furnish
to the Bank for its review and comments, an audit report of
the  safety  of PTT's  operations  and  take all measures
required on its part to ensure implementation of the
report's  recommendations  taking  into  consideration  the
Bank's comments (para. 3.21);
(e)    That PTT shall furnish to the Bank during each fiscal year
until completion of the project,  commencing November 1,
1992, a quarterly progress reports on the physical progress
of the project (para. 3.39);
(f)    That PTT would be audited, in addition to the Office of the
Auditor General, by a private independent external auditor
acceptable to the Bank and PTT, and that it would submit



- 50 -
to the Bank, audited annual financial statements within six
months of the close of each fiscal year (para. 4.14);
(g)     That except in 1993, PTT would generate funds from internal
sources equivalent to not less than 25Z of the annual
average of its capital expenditures incurred, or expected
to be incurred, for that fiscal year, the previous fiscal
year, and the next following fiscal year.   For 1993, the
internal cash generation would be 15X (para. 5.9);
(h)     That  PTTIs  debt-equity  ratio  (calculated  after  the
revaluation of PTT's assets) would not exceed 60/40, and
that it would have a debt service coverage ratio of at
least 1.3 times. Debt refinancing would not be included as
repayment of debt for debt service ratio calculation
purposes so long as the term of the debt, including the
refinanced portion, does not exceed 80X of the useful life
of the assets financed by that debt (para. 5.10);
(i)     That PTT and the Bank, not later than December 31 of each
fiscal year until the completion of the project, commencing
in 1992, shall carry out a joint review of PTT's investment
program for the period FY92 to FY96, PTT paying due regard
in each instance to the Bank's comments and recommendations
(para. 5.11); and
(j)     That  PTT engage  qualified  consultants,  under  terms  of
reference, conditions and timing satisfactory to the Bank,
to: (1) not later than October 31, 1992, commence carrying
out an engineering study for a new project to transport
additional gas from the Erawan platforms, including the
feasibility of constructing a second pipeline from Erawan
to an onshore location in the Central Region (para 3.14);
(2) not later than March 31, 1993, commence preparing
safety engineering and environmental standards for its
entire operations (para. 3.22); and (3) not later than
December 31, 1992, commence carrying out a study for
improving PTT's Management Information System (para. 4.19).
7.2         During negotiations,  .mderstandings were reached that: (a) PTT
would take the necessary measures to hold regular meetings with EGAT at
least every six months in order to coordinate more closely regarding the
proper programming of their investment (para. 2.18); and (b) the Internal
Audit Office would: (i) not later than September 30, 1992, report directly
to the Governor of PTT, as proposed in the revised organizational
structure; and (ii) be provided with a budget and staff allocation for
recruiting three additional engineers who would be in place not later than
March 31, 1993 (para. 4.13).

B. Recommendation
7.3    With the above agreements and assurance,  the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$105 million equivalent
to PTT, with the guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate for a 17-year term including a 4 year grace
period.

Geology and Petroleum Reserves
General Geology
1.        The Gulf of Thailand contains several present day sedimentary basins.
Theme are: Chumpon (West Kra) Basin; Songkhla (East Kra) Basin; Pattanl Trough;
and the northern end of the Malay Basin. These basins are similar in most
respects.  They were formed as extensional rift basins along highly active
lateral fault systems.  They are filled with Cenozoic Age clastic sediments
(sands, silts, and shales) extending from the Paleocene to Pleistocene. The
environment of sedimentation ranges from non-marine lacustrine and fluvial
deltaic to near shore lagoonal and shallow marine with deltaic association. The
basins are separated by intervening highs where thin Cenozoic sediments
unconfornably overlie older sediments (Mesozoic and/or Paleozoic Age) and in some
areas volcanic terrain or crystalline basement.
2.        The fault movements which formed the basins in the Gulf of Thailand
persisted throughout the Cenozoic and affected the concurrent deposition of
sediment. As movement continued on the lateral faults, structural forces Aithln
each basin alternated between compression (uplift and folding) and extension
(subsidence and sag). As each of the forces occurred in turn the preceding
structure was overprinted with the latest movements. At present each basin is
paradoxically characterized by low relief features (both highs and lows) vhich
are highly fulted. An echelon rifts are predominant suggesting that the latest
activity is primarily exte_sional.
3.        With respect to hydrocarbons found, the basrins are all gas prone. The
only significant oll discovered thus far is in the southeastern part of the Malay
BMain (offshore peninsular Malaysia) and even in this area gas remains a major
component. Isolated oil discoveries have been made in the Chumpon and Songkhla
basins which are as yet unevaluated. This oil was found in the underlying pro-
Cenozoic sediments. Relatively minor oil reservoirs have been encountered in the
Pattani Trough, notably in the shallower part of the Cenozoic section. High
crustal heat flow, associated with the lateral faulting appears to have placed
the bulk at the most prospective sedimenta7y interval in the over mature gas/
condensate realm. The high heat flow regise interacting with the pro-Cenozoic
limestones (CaCO3) also appears to have produced significant quantities of
carbon-dioxide gas (CO2) which is associated with the hydrocarbon gs.
4.        The ten gas fiolds and six as yet unevaluated gas d$scoveries in the
Thai portion of the Pattani and Malay Basins as well as the approximately ton gas
fields and unappraised discoveries in the northwestern part of offshore
peninsular Malaysia (Malay Basin) have strikingly similar characteristics. The
gas is reservoired in sandstones of several types associated with river and river
mouth and shallow marine systems, i e , fluvial-deltaic.  In any given area
scores to hundreds of reservoirs are productive. Productive reservoirs vary from
just a few acres to 2,000 acres or more in areal extent but most are rslatively

mall. Most of the Se  is structurally trapped with the bulk of the reserves
associated with high side fault closures and much of the remainder is associated
with romnant folds within the low (graben) fault blocks. Gas is also trapped
stratigraphically in lenticular sand bodies not associated with faulting or
crestal portions of folds but those reserves are somewhat randomly distributed
and of lesser significance. The close association between the concentration of
productive reservoirs and fault closures suggest that: (L) fault planes served
as paths for gas migration during at loast part of their existence; and (ii) that
the gas source rocks my be pro-Conozoic (this is almost surely the case for the
carbon dioxide gs).
5.        The salient points are that the gas fields contain many individual
reservoirs of varying size and shape and most individual reservoirs are small.
When placed on production each reservoir depletes fairly quickly. Thus in order
to recover most of the gas a large number of platforms and wells are required.
In addition since each production well may penetrate from 2-3 up to 20 or more
individual reservoirs, workovers and recompletions are rather frequent. These
factors make both the cost of development and the cost of production relatively
high.
Reserves
6.        When considering estimates of gas and liquid reserves discovered to
date in the Gulf of Thailand several factors must be kept in mind. The more or
less official reserves published by the Department of Mineral Resources (DMM) are
primarily a compilation of the latest reserve data provided by each company
operating in Thailand who have made discoveries. As such the reserves are not
totally consistent or standardized in the usual manner , .e., API (American
Petroleum Institute). However it should be noted that due to the distribution
of the reserves In a multitude of small reservoirs without readily definable
lisits, roserve calculations are based on statistical occurrence rather than
measured quantities, at least prior to significant production history. This
necessary approach to reserve estimation is itself at variance with API criteria
which assumes a degree of measurability. In essence when statistical methods of
estimation are used the distinction between proved and probable reserves is
blurred, with proved reserves somewhat loss proved and probable reserves somewhat
more probable than indicated by API standards.  The relatively high cost
associated with this gas makes reosrve estimates highly price sensitive and
hence, somehat subjective. Thus the lack of standarllzed reserves in the DMR
annual reports is not as serious as It may seem.
7.        Using DH. data, the latest submission by Unocal, and the most recent
Bongkot field reserve estimate made by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (DM), the
estimated reserves of ga and condensate in Thailand are:

9.        Based on the above:
A.  reserve life at current producing rate (675 mefd) - 28 years
b.  reserve life at forecast producing rate ln year 2000 (1450 .efd) -
23 years
co  Liquid ratio to date - 36.5 bbl/wacf
d.  UquLd ratio ultumate (proved and probable) - 28.8 bbl/umcf
*.  Lquid ratio ultimate (Total indlcated) - 25.2 bbl/nmcf
These indicate that:  (i) production of gas from the Gulf of Thailand can
comfortably be increased to about 950 - cfd based on established remaining
reserves (20 year reserve life); (ii) that forecasts of production increraing to
1,450 m cfd by the end of the century are reasonable if current discoveries neet
spoctations (not dependent on nev discoveries); (iLL) the proportion of liquids
(condensate) declines as fields are depleted; and (iv) the possible or indicated
Liquid reserves are underestimated (more likely) or these reserves contain drier
gas (less liLkely).

BONGQOT GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT
BONGKOT FIELD
1.        The Bongkot gas field (formerly called 'B3  structure) will be the
prinmry source of gas for the proposed Thailand Gas Transmission System ExpazLsion
Project. This field is located ln the northwest extremity of the Malay Basin
(all offshore) about 180 km southeast of the Erawan gas field (terminal of
present gas pipeline).  The 13 Unocal discoveries are located in the south
central portion of the Pattani Trough. The Pattani Trough and the Malay Basin
are simalar in most respects but are physically separated by an intervening high
(horst block). About 6 Tcf has been found to date in the Pattani Trough.
2.        The first exploration licenses in the Bongkot field area were granted
in 1972 to Tenneco and British Petroleum. During the next several years Tenneco
drilled three exploratory wells and BP drilled one. All four encountered gas and
three of these in quantities indicating potential com _rciality. However, in May
1976 the remaining rights and obligations were transferred to Texas Pacific
Thailand, at. al. (TP) by means of farm-in from Tenneco and BP. The first TP
exploratory well was completed in November 1976 and was considered a commercial
discovery (officially the discovery well). TP conducted an appraisal program
over the next *ix years (1977-82) in which 18 additional exploratory wells were
drilled and 3-D seismic survey covering 110 kIm was made over what was considered
the heart of the field. Based on the results of the 23 wells, TP appliod for and
received a Production Liconse (up to 30 years) from the DMM TP's development
plan was never accepted by the DK& due to inability to reach agreemnt on a sales
price formula with Texas Pacific. After protracted negotiations an agreement to
buy-back the TIP Production License was reached and consumated in July 1988. The
repurchase price was $100 mm.
3.        The Bongkot fiold, as currently defined, is comprlsed of some 20
structured highs (14 high saLs fault closures and six renmant fold closures) and
intervening saddles over an area of approximately 225 kmI (60 km along NW/SE axis
and up to 10 km wide, averaging nearly 4 km).  While gas reservoirs are
concentrated on the hLghs, which cover about 40 percent of the total area, they
are not limited to them.  This is due to the stratigraphy of the sandstone
reservoirs.   These are large in number and consist of relatively small
disconnected bodies deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine, or perhaps
1acustrine, environment, l.e. irregularly shaped channel, bar, lagoonal, or
coastal deposits. The 23 wells drilled to date encountered from as little as
one to as many as 26 reservoirs with as little as 6 feet to as much as 300 feet
of net gas pay. A purely arithmetic average for all 23 wells results in 143 net
fact of gas pay in 8.5 reservoirs per well. A total of 22 production tests were
conducted (the remaining reservoirs confirmed by wire line sample tests) and
nearly half of these indicated a reservoir boundary withln 500 feet of the well
bore. ThLs data when coupled with the lack of electric log correlation of
reservoir between wells makes it difficult to determine whether any of the 196
gas reservolrs penetrated occurred in more than one well. Therefore it can be
concluded that the reservoirs are numerous, each contalns a relatively small
reserve, and are lrregularly distributed and uimappable at present.

4.        In order to proceed with development, DeGolyer and MacNaughton were
cousissioned to provide a reserve determination for the Bongkot field. D&M has
a long established reputation as an industry leader in the area of reserve
determination. They also know the rather unique situation in Gulf of Thailand
fiolds as well, having made four prior reserve estimates for Bongkot and several
for Unocal. Early difficulties with the original Unocal reserve estimates have
honed D&W's sensitivity to the critical factors in estimating Bongkot reserves.
These are: (a) in the absence of any mappable reservoir limits and the irregular
distribution of a large number of reservoirs any calculation of in-place reserves
must be based on statistical occurrence; (b) it was deemed that the number and
placement of available well data when combined with seismic derived structure
maps provided a usable and generally reliable statisti ~al sample; and (c) that
the recoverable fraction of in-place reserves is cost and price sensitive, since
reservoir distribution limits the reserve quantity per well, requiring a large
number of platforms and wells in a diminishing returns regime for maximum
recovery. After comprehonsive analysis DWH certifies 2,168.6 Bcf of recoverable
gas (1,494.2 Bcf proved and 674.4 Bcf probable additional) in the Bongkot
development area. DUM has excluded those reservoirs where CO2 is excessive.
They anticipate that up to 18 platforms and 160 woRlls may be required to achiove
the certified reserves and are estimating 55 percent recovery from 3,973 Bcf
proved and probable reserves in-place. This relatively low recovery estimate (60
percent to 70 percent is normal) reflects the intensive development -equired and
the economic sensitivity of reserve estimates to both cost and price. D6I has
attempted to be prudently cautious in this respect.
5.         The DMR awarded a Production License to the Joint Venture Group
assabled to develop and produce Bongkot gas on the March 15, 1990. The Joint
Venture (JV) consLsts of Petroleum Authority of Thailand Exploration and
Production (PTTEP) 40 percent, Total Exploration and Production Thailand (total)
30 percent, BritLsh Gas Thailand (BG) 20 percent and Statoil Thailand (Statoil)
10 percent. The Bongkot liconse is divided into Production Areas (those areas
surrounding the previously drilled gas productive wells; consistlng of 720 km1,
and Reserved Exploration Areas (covering the reminder of the TP License)
consisting of 2,523 kmc. Each of these areas carries its own obligations for
activity and expenditure.   A Development Plan must be submitted for the
Production Areas within eight months (November 1990), which has been met, and a
seismic program must be commenced on Reserved Exploration Areas within 24 months
(March 1992), contract already signed.  It is further required that three
exploratory wells will be drilled prior to the end of the third year of gas
production (mid-1996).
6.        Immedietely following the award of the License, the JV partners entered
into a participation and operating agreement. In this agreement PTT EP accepts
each of the other parties as co-concessionaire in return for a proportional
payment of the acquisition cost borne by the DHR in the rep%rchase of Texas
Pacific rights.  Total was elected Operator.  The Operator undertakes the
responsibility of preparing the Initial Program (Development Plan and Definitive
Cost Estimate) which must be adopted unanimously after which they will be
financially bound and liable. The Operator will handle all normal operations,
i.e. preparation of budgets, procurement and eapenditures, and management of day-
to-day operations including supervision of employees a..Gonded b other parties.
The Operators activities will be authorized and monitored by a Management
Committee representing all parties with a proportional vote. The development and



- 70 -                   ANhE    9
Page 3 of 4
operating costs will be met by monthly cash calls initiated by the Operator and
approved by the Kan-gement Cou.ittee. Any party(ies) may conduct sole risk
operations. Sole risk operations permltted are restricted to: (a) the drilling,
deepening, side-tracking or testing of an exploration or developmental well,
(b) the appraisal and developmont of a previously drilled dLicovery area and the
production therefrom; and (c) the installation of additional production
facilities including platforms, well, etc. Parties may withdraw from the venture
agrooemnt only after completion of the Initial Program. The withdrawal may be
accomplished by party deeding its share proportionally to remaining parties, by
placing interest in trust with the Government of Thailand as trustees, or by
selling or otherwise assigning its shares to a new party providing this party is
acceptable to the Government of Thailand and is willing to abide by the terms of
Participation and the Operating Agreement.  Except for gross negligence tho
Oporator is not solely liable for any damages awarded as a consequence of the
Joint venture. The Operator is obliged to carry adequate insurance and any award
amounts above insurance limts will be shared by all parties proportionally. The
Operator may be changed any time 95 percent of non-operating parties deem
Operator to be negligent. The Operator may resign after giving six months notice
providing the Initial Program has been completed. Another party to the JV may
bo elected Operator should PTTEP decline to act as Operator. Ax.ter the third
anniversary of gas delivery PTTEP shall have the option to become Operator after
giving 24 months notice to the other parties (earliest five years after start of
gas sales). It is contemplated the 24 month period would be used to provide a
smooth transition from the current Operator (Total) to the new Operator (PTTEP).
7.        The Develcpment Program for the Bongkot fiold is designed to produce
a minimum 1500 Bcf over the life of the Gas Sales contract between the JV and
PTT. Further the sales contract provides that a minimum production level of
150 -  cfd shall be maintained for the first five years of production wlth
subsequent minimum levels to be determined on the basis of reserves to be re-
evaluated after three years of gas production. It is also stipulated that the
CO2 fraction will not exceed 23 percent of pipeline gas. The actual production
targets of the JV are significantly higher than the minimum required.
8.        The Initial Program, as unanimously agreed, includes the following
(') New 3-D seismic survey covering 573 km2 (3-D area) at a cost of
$20 -;
(b) Central Production and Process Platform (includes living quarters,
compressors, condw'sate separation, etc.) at a cost of $219 am;
(c)  Three 12-slot well platforms plus plpelines to CP&P platform at  a
cost of $85 m; and
(d)  Drilling and compleing 20 producing wells (out of 36 slots available)
deviated to selected target reservoirs at a cost of $59 m.
The total cost estimate for the first phase of developmert is $383 -.
Procurement is essentially complete and construction is underway with production
start-up planned in October 1993.

Page 4 of 4
9.        The Initial Program will not be sufficient to develop the 1, 500 Bef of
recoverable gas reserve called for in the Gas Sales Agreement. The Operator, is
already planning a second phase of development but implementation will be
somewhat dependent on first phase results. The most recent plans include three
additionAl well platforms and 27 additional platform wells completed by year ond
1996.  Some six appraisal wells (non-platform) will abe required -for proper
platform locations. The 47 producing wells are expected to raise productive
capaclty to more than 250 - cfd, the current target for 1995-96, 100 m cfd
above the contract minimum. The Operator (Total) has not made any plans beyond
the second phase on the assumption that PTTEP will be the Operator for any
additional phases at development.
10.       PTTEP with the assistance of Statoil has prepared a total development
scenario for the purpose of determining economLes of the Pipeline Project.
PTTEP's scenario envisions a total of 109 wells to be drilled following the
Initial Program, 103 development wells and 6 appraisal wells (most likely
expendable wells) on 10 adLitional platforms. This additional drilllng program
is expected to cost $514 on ln 1991 constant dollars. Thus the total development
is expected to require; (a) Central Productlon and Process facilities; (b) 13
well platforms; and (c) 123 development wells, at an estimated investment cost
of $897 -. Related exploration activities are $55 - bringing the total JV
investment to $952 -. This investment is expected to recover 1,700 Bcf as and
24 - bbl of condensate. Gas delivery at plateau production will fall between
250 - cfd (min. DCQ) and 350 - cfd (max DCQ, i.e. Daily Contract Quantity).
Gas quality is expected to average 912 btu/cf.
11.       The cost and volume assumptions used by PTTEP are comparable with past
experLence in similar fiolds in the Gulf of Thailand (Unocal average experience
in 6 fields). These include average reserve/well at 13.8 Bcf (Unocal 8 - 15
Bcf); initial producing rate of 12.5 mm cfd (Unocal 10 - 12 mmefd); rate of
production decline average/well predicted is 20 percent (Unocal 20 percent), etc.
Expected costs of platforms and wells are also comparable to current Unocal
experience. The initial results of the new 3-D seismic survey give promise that
better than expected development efficiencies can be achieved. The clarity of
structure and faulting is much improved over the initial 3-D survey. Many of the
gas reservoirs, both proved and prognosticated, can be identified and delineated
by means of seismic amplitude anomalies. While substantiation of the seisaic
data will require drilling, the seismic results support JV enthusiasm that a
production plateau of 350 -m cfd can be achieved by 1999 for a duration of seven
or more years. The seismic data also indicates that the earlier wells at Bongkot
were located on the basis of the deeper structure (where CO2 concentrations are
higher) consequently missing the better part of the shallower structure (where
C0 concentrations are lower) since the structures are offset with depth,
particularly the fault closures. Thus, the statistical methods used to determine
reserves serves to overestimate the quantities of gas (including C02) in the
deeper reservoirs and underestimate the quantities of gas (including COZ) in the
shallower reservoirs. Thus the CO2 fraction way be overstated and the estimate
of condensate (shallow reservoirs also richer in liquids) reserves may also be
low. In view of this PTTEP has used an estimate of 912 btu/cu ft for their
development scenario rather than 875-900 btu/cu t: as determined from produced
samples.

Bangkok-Erawan-Khanom Gas Transmission
Pipeline-Environment Assessment Summary
L _Backgroun
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) completed the construction
of a natural gas pipeline and associate onshore dew point control unit from
the Erawan field of UNOCAL Thailand Ltd. in the Gulf of Thailand to
consumption centers on shore in 1981.   In 1985, PTT completed another
pipeline connection PTT's Platong platform to PTT's main system and also
installed an onshore compression stati.'n near the existing gas separation
plant at Rayong. Recently, PTT concluded a natural gas supply agreement
with PTT Exploration and Production Co. for the supply of gas from the "B
(Bongkot) structure gas field 160 kilometers south of the Erawan platform
in the Gulf of Thailand. A study was conducted by Fluor Daniel in order to
determine the best way in which the "Bo structure field gas can be
transported to various consumption centers via existing facilities or by
the addition of new facilities. The study concluded that the best way to
perform this task would be the construction of a new 170 kilometer pipeline
form the "Bw structure field to the Erawan platform, joining the existing
system, and in addition the const.uction of a new 160 kilometer pipeline
from the Erawan platform to Khanom onshore.
II. The Prglect
The proposed project consists a 32" diameter pipeline form the "B"
field to the UNOCAL Erawan field and a second 24" pipeline from the Erawan
platform to Khanom onshore.  There are no structures at present in the  B
field, with construction of initial platforms and intra field platforms set
to commence in March 1992. The "Bo field structures will be sufficiently
complete to allow construction of the pipeline from the field to the Erawan
platform after May 1992. The major system components of the project are
summarized below:
A 175 kilometer long 32" diameter submarine gas pipeline in
depths varying from 270 to 210 feet connecting the Bongkot
production platform with the existing Erawan compression platform
(ECP). This pipeline will be able to transport up to 750 NMSCFD
of gas from the *Bo field and a potential future gas field to be
developed jointly by Thailand and Malaysia.



- 73 -                         ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 10
A 165 kilometer long 24" diameter submarine gas pipeline in
depths varying from 210 to 100 feet to sea level connecting the
ECP with Khanom onshore. This pipeline will be able to transport
up to 330 MSCFD of gas without recompression and ultimately 500
MMSCFD of gas with recompression at Erawan.
A new gas/liquids handling and tie in facility at the Erawan
complex, located on the existing UNOCAL platform.
A  new  gas/liquids  handling  facility  at  Khanom  near  the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand's existing Khanom
powerplant.
A new SCADA information system, including renovation of PTTIs
existing gas pipeline control system.
A new control building at the Khanom pipeline terminal for both
the Bongkot to Erawan and Erawan to Khanom pipeliaes.
The target date for the completion of the pipeline and associated
facilities from the "B" field to the Erawan platform is June 1993, while
that of the Erawan platform to Khanom and associated facilities is December
1993.
III. Base line conditions
The study area is focused on the offshore environmental areas where
the pipelines will be laid, and the onshore area where the EGAT thermal
power plant is located.
A.   Meteorology
The project area lies between latitudes 8 and 10 N, 1,100 km
north of the equator.   Its climate is characterized by high
temperature and humidity, with rainfall varying according to the
monsoon season. Meteorological parameters summarized below were
measured in stations located close to the project area:
(1) Temperature: The mean maximum and minimum temperature range
from 29.0 to 32.5 C and 23.5 to 26.2 C respectively.
(2) Rainfall: Annual rainfall in the Khanom area is in the range
of 1,600-2,000 mm. Precipitation peaks to 428 m per month
in November and declines to 38 mm in February.



- 74                           ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 10
(3) Winds: Easterly winds are normal from May to October, with
mean speeds ranging from 4.0 to 7.1 knots, and extreme gusts
of 40 to 50 knots.
(4) Fog: This is seldom recorded in the area but may
occasionally occur in March.
(5) Thunder storms: Activity peaks in May with an average of 18
days.
(6) Storms: Intensity and occurrence of storm in the Gulf of
Thailand range from 10 m/sec during 3 hours once a year to
instantaneous gusts of 58 m/sec once in 100 years.
B.  OceanorraPhy
(1) Waves: Height and occurrence of waves range from maximum 4 m
high once a year and 11.6 m once in 100 years.   Wave
direction ranges from 220-270 degrees.
(2) Currents: Maximum currents of both flood and ebb tides is
0.3 m/sec with flood tide setting north, and ebb tide south.
C.   SeismoloFg
Thailand lies on a southern extension of the Eurasian seismic
activity zone.   The closest boundary is just offshore of the
islands of Sumatra and Java, some 1,000 im from the Gulf of
Thailand. The main belt of shocks is seen to run offshore from
the coast of Myanmar, then approximately along the Thai border.
No earthquakes of magnitude greater than 2.0 were observe in the
Gulf during 1984-1987 period. It can therefore be concluded that
the seismic risk along the pipeline is negligible.
D.   Marise water quality
The distribution of water temperature and salinity in the lower
western part of the Gulf of Thailand are quite similar throughout
the water depth resulting from the vertical mixing of the water
mass. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration at the surface
water is greater than the bottom except for some deep areas.
Observed  DO  concentrations  were  greater  than  4.0  ug/l.
Transparency at nearshore area are usually lower than 10 meter

but reach 30 meter at far offshore areas.  PH values are lower
than 8.
E.   Aquatic Biology
(1) Plankton: Low relative abundance of plankton was measured
along the proposed pipeline route and vicinity area. About
6 species of plankton were observed.
(2) Benthos: Benthos occupy the mud and muddy sand habitats.
Low abundance of up to 28 species were observed.
(3) Sea grass: 9 species of sea grass were found in the Gulf of
Thailand. The sensitive productive area is 25 km north of
the coastal pipeline route to Khanom.
F.   FishvXX
The western coast of the Gulf from Surat Thani province to
Nakhom Si Thamarat province is an important fishery resource.
The distribution of juveniles have mostly densed along the
nearshore coast more than for the offshore areas, due to the high
fertility along the shallow coast.   The planktons which some
species use as food have mostly been found in the shallow area.
Thai fisheries developed very rapidly after 1960, with total
production increasing slx-fold between 1960 and 1970 and by a
further 501 in the period 1970-77.   Recently, production has
fluctuated - the catch from otter trawling (of particular
relevance to the pipeline) jumped about 25X from 1985 to 1986
then remained fairly static at about 1 million tons through 1988.
Fishing  resources  are  now  over-exploited  and  associated
industries such as cold storage, canning and fishmeal production
are under utilized.
86X of the marine catch is from the Gulf of Thailand.
Trawling accounted for 5i4 of the catch. The percentage of otter
board trawling to other trawling was 821.  Hence, 44X of the
total catch was derived from otter board trawling.
Hundreds of trawlers will operate in the vicinity sf the
pipeline route at all times of the year, with only the immediate
areas of the oil platforms providing some deterrent. A typical



- 76 -                        ANNEX 10
Page 5 of 10
trawler will be 16 m long, with a 90 HP engine and operate with
otter boards weighing less than 100 kg.   These will therefore
pose little direct risk to a surface-laid pipeline. Fish traps,
comprising floating bamboo rafts moored by wire to concrete
mocrings, presently extend to offshore areas as far as the "B3
field (220 km).
Bottom trawling for demersal fish is illegal within 3 km of
the coastline but is doubtless carried out by rogue vessels lured
by the rich fishing grounds off Khanom. Smaller local vessels,
including long-tailed motor boats also carry out line and rod
fishing off Khanom, catching fish, shrimps and crabs. Some 200-
300 of trawler vessels may be present along the cable route,
normally running at least 8-10 km from the coast.
G.   The mangrove forests
The mangrove forests in the vicinity area of the coastal
pipeline route cover 12,400 rai.  The common tree species are
Kong-Kang-bi-led   (RhizoRhara   agiculate),   Kong-Kang-bi-yai
(RhizoRhora mucronata), Prasak (Brumuiera gvmnorrhiza), Tualkhas
(Bruguiera cylindrica), and Prong (CerioRs tagal).
H.   Navigation
International shipping to &nd from the north part of the
gulf to Singapore, Nalaysia, Australia, Persian Gulf and
westwords, will cross the pipeline route at about 100 km from the
shore.
Domestic coastal traffic, consisting of cargo vessels,
tankers, LPG carriers, passenger vessels and tugs. The average
cargo vessel size is 750 DWT and the mean tanker size 1,500 DWT.
Traffic in and out of the coastal ports, down the southern
coast of the Gulf of Thailand, involves crossing of the pipeline
route.   Typical commodities traded are rubber, copra, general
goods, minerals, rics and fish.
I.   Socio Economic Data
Amphoe Khanom is located at the north of Nakhon Si Thanmarat
and covers an area of 434 km2.   The population counts about



- 77 -
Page 6 of 10
25,000 people.   Most of the income in the region comes from
fisheries and agriculture.
J.   Archaeologv
The region is regarded as one of the centers of ancient art
and culture in the southern regions.
An archaeological site is located about 8 km from Khanom and
2 km south of the onshore pipe crossing.
IV. Potential Significant Environmental Impacts
and Mitigation Measures
Potential significant environmental impacts of the Bongkot-Erawan-
Khanom pipeline would be caused by the following:
=    Sea bottom disturbance
-    Solid and liquid wastes
-   Obstruction of navigation during construction
-   Gas composition and pollution due to potential leakage during
operation
-    Changes  in  the  existing  socio-economic  situation  during
construction and operation
-    Safety issues
A.   Sea Bottom Disturbance
Construction of the offshore pipeline will have short term effects on
marine water quality.   Disturbance of the sea bottom will result in
increased turbidity and suspended solids contents. This will result in a
decrease in water transparency, affecting the growth of phytoplankton by
reducing the light available at the seabed.   Further,  direct habitat
destruction over the area disturbed would affect benthic organism.
Indirect destruction of habitat by the increase in concentration of
chemicals such as sulphides, greases and oils and phenolic compounds in the
sea water in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline due to the dissolving
of chemicals naturally present in the disturbed seabed sediment could also
occur. However, in the former case, since phytoplankton are dominant only
in the first ten meters from the surface it is expected that no significant
effects will be observed in the long term.   In the case of direct and
indirect habitat destruction, only about 0 37 square kilometers of seabed
would be subject to short term habitat destruction. Little impact on the
long term quantity and characteristics of benthic life is anticipated.



- 78 -                       ANNEX 10
Page 7 of 10
Indeed during the operation phase of the pipeline, it is expected that the
pipeline surface will provide attachment points for plant species and
benthic life and will provide cover for fish.
B.   Solid and Liguid Wastes
No process related solid wastes will be generated during the operation
of the pipeline.  Spoil generated during the construction of the onshore
facilities associated with the pipeline will be initially deposited in
suitable areas at the construction sites and then eventually used foi
landscaping around the construction site. Onshore spoil will be disposed
of in suitable areas so as to minimize siltation effects. The spoil from
the onshore pipeline excavation will be stored along the sides of the ditch
and used for backfilling upon completion of pipelaying. Solid refuse from
both the onshore construction sites as well as from the pipeline lay barge
and the platform will be collected and disposed of onshore.
Process waste water will be generated during the operation of the
facilities. The primary pollutant in this water will be waste oil. The
waste oils generated during platform and pipeline operations will be
separated and the water treated to prevailing Thai standards (15 ppm of
oil).  Domestic waste water and sanitary wastes will be pretreated and
discharged to the sea at B.O.D. load conforming to Thai standards. Solid
wastes will be transferred to approved disposal sites onshore.
C.  Obstruction of Navigatio
During construction, the use of a pipelaying barge which will have the
pipeline suspended behind the barge, touching down on the seabed at a
distance of 200 to 400 meters behind the barge will pose a iazard to
navigation.   Further,  during construction,  the suspended pipeline can
potentially interfere with trawl fishing since fishing nets could get
fouled on the pipeline. Both of these hazards will be mitigated by the use
of appropriate warning devices and the prohibition of trawling in the area
around the pipelaying barge. PTT and the government of Thailand agencies
will develop a plan to implement the prohibition of trawling. Since the
nearshore pipeline will be buried in a four meter deep trench, no
obstruction of navigation will be caused by the pipeline.  Furtler, the
platforms will be equipped with appropriate navigational aids and warnings
to prevent their being a hazard to navigation during pipeline operation.

Page 8 of 10
D.   Gas Characteristics and Potential Leakage
Mercury in gas can pose an environmental hazard. The reported content
of mercury from the Erawan structure is 10 ppb.   The gas from the "B"
structure field is expected to contain similar amounts of mercury.   A
mercury removal unit will be installed in the future to remove mercury from
the gas if it reaches unacceptable levels.  The removal unit will be an
absorber which can reduce mercury levels to 0.1 microgram/m3.   The used
absorber will be sent back to the manufacturer for mercury reclamation.
Mercury is also condensed on the production platform and accumulated until
a proper way of disposal will be agreed with DMR. The mercury content and
accumu_ated amounts on the platform do not coincide and shcAld be resolved
by the EA consultant.
Non catastrophic, short term, gas leakage will have no significant
effect on marine water quality, since the gas will bubble to the surface
and disperse. Catastrophic gas leakage is addressed under safety issues.
E.   Socio-Economic Effects
The temporary increase in the population around Khanom by about 800
workers, of which 80 will be local residents, will have an impact on the
quality of life in the Khanom area.   Problems such as overcrowding of
construction camps, life and property security problems, gambling, etcetera
could result.   In addition, the workers will stress the water supply,
health   services,   and   other   community   facilities   capabilities.
Transportation and navigation activities during thb construction period
will probably result in an increase of transport related accidents.  The
impact of the additional workers will be mitigated by requiring the
contractors to provide and maintain good living conditions in the
construction camps as well as requiring them to seek the assistance of
local authorities and police forces as necessary. The economic condition
of the Khanom area will be improved by the influx of workers as well as by
the employment of local labor. The influx of the workforce will lead to
increased development of the commercial and service sectors such as food
services and general stores for the supply of the workers needs.  During
operation, only a small number of PTT employees will be working at the
Khanom terminal and thus are expected to have a negligible socio-economic
impact. Indeed local people have been surveyed as to their attitude toward
the project and in general had positive opinions about the impact of the
pipeline.
The effect of the pipeline on fishing productivity and livelihood of
the fishermen, has still to be checked by the EA consultant.

Page 9 of 10
F.   Safety Issues
During construction, the occurrence of storms will have a significant
impact on pipelaying activities. Tropical cyclones and typhoons normally
occur in the period from September to December. Pipeline construction wil'
have to be suspended during these storms. During operation, the effect of
the storms on the pipeline will be comparatively minor, but production
activities at related production platforms may have to be suspended.
In order to minimize occupational hazards and enhance worker safety
during the construetion phase, construction equipment will be kept in good
repair and good working conditions will be established at the sites.
Adequate safety measures will be taken and safety related equipment as well
as fire fighting equipment provided in order to reduce the potential for
accidents.  Further, stringent safety regulations will be set and safety
awareness increased by training and education of construction workers. A
record will also be kept of accidents and their causes and the damage that
results in order to ensure learning from past experience.
Although the pipeline and associated facilities are properly designed,
there is a small potential for hazardous conditions during operation such
as overpressure. leaks and fire that can result in catastrophic rupture of
the pipeline of damage to the platforms or onshore facilities.   The
potential for these events will be minimized by the adoption and
implementation of proper operating and maintenance procedures as well as
personnel training.   Overpressure protection of the pipeline  is also
provided by the use of design principles for the pipeline and associated
facilities that requires a design allowable operating pressure that is
significantly higher than the normal operating pressure. In addition, over
pressuring of the platform facilities at Bongkot and ECP as well as the
onshore facility at Khanom is prevented by a design code requiring features
such as active monitor/pressure regulators, high pressure alarms and shut
down valves, emergency shutdown valvcs, blowdown connections and pressure
safety valves. Leak detection devices will be provided and the pipelines
continuously monitored in order to ensure prompt detection of unsafe
conditions.
Risk assessment and evaluation of the hazards associated with a
catastrophic gas and condensate leakage, are still pending and should be
shortly completed by the EA consultant.

Page 10 of 10
C.   Other Issau
No significant environmental impact is expected due to the sGismology
of the site or due to the ocean currents and tides at the offshore sites.
Noise pollution will occur during pipeline construction resulting from the
operation of heavy equipment. Since the noise level is not anticipated to
be excessive and since only the construction workforce will be exposed,
noise pollution during construction is not expected to have a significant
impact.
V. Environmental Management and Training
PTT proposes an environmental monitoring plan that will sample water
quality and aquatic biology during both construction and operation.  The
plan will also monitor fish landing at Khanom, solid waste generation,
water supply requirements and socio economic impacts. The results will be
used to adjust the environmental management plan to reflect experience.
The ITT Safety and Environment Subdivision of the Gas Pipeline Operation
Department is directly responsible for the implementation of the pipeline
environmental management plan which has been drafted by the PTT Safety and
Environment Standard Division.   Pipeline system personnel are trained in
loss control, safety, fire control and hazardous chemical management on a
regular basis. PTT realizes its responsibility for the improvement and
maintenance of good working conditions, working environments and working
approaches with respect to internal and international standards. Safety is
paramount at PTT and will be monitored as part of the environmental
management plan.

7.          Remittance to the Government is expected to remain at 35s  of
net income throughout th  proj-ction period (calculated on net income based
on book value -- not revalued asset -- depreciation).
8.          Foreign Exchange Losses are an amortization of the balance of
tbh deferred losses from devaluation of the Baht against foreign
currencies. The balance of deferred losses on exchange from conversion of
outatanding foreign loans as of September 30, 1991 mounted to Baht 2,605.9
million.  The projections assume that the current exchange rates of the
baht into all currencies (including both the dollar and the yen) will
remain constant. Accordingly, if the baht in fact weakens against the yen
(it is less likely to move dramatically agalnst the dollar since it is tied
to the dollar), then the foreign exchange loss could be understated (ard
net income correspondingly overstated). Conversely, a strengthening of the
baht against the yen would provide an increase to PTT's net income.

BONGKOT GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Economic and Financial Analysis- Assumotions
Economic Analvsis
1.        The capital cost for development and production of the Bongkot
field is based on the estimated costc for drilling 123 wells, installing 13
well-platforms and a central production and process.ing platform, and the
cost for related exploration activities.   The total capital cost is the
estimated investment needed to produce 1,500 bcf of gas and 24 million
barrel of condensate. The operating costs associated with the estimated
investment cost is based on the required fixed and variable costs,
including the work-over and re-completion of the wells.
2.        The pipeline capital cost includes the Project base cost (except
taxes and duties) and the physical contingency.   The pipeline operating
cost is assumed to be 3 percent of the capital cos:.
3.        The annual quantity of gas supply is basid on minimum daily
contractual quantity delivered by the joint-venture ga- producers to PTT.
The average calorific value of the gas is assumed to I-- 000 btu per cubic
feet. The annual prodtction of condensate is proportio.. _o minimum daily
contractual quantity of gas supply.
4.        The price of crude oil is based on Bank projection. The price of
condensate is assumed to be US$1.00 less than the price of Bank-projected
crude, due to possible penalty imposed by some refiners on the condensate.
The FOB price of fuel oil is assumed to be 80 percent of the price of B&nk-
projected crude oil. The CIF price of the fuel oil is assumed to be US$2
more than the FOB price of the fuel oil, to cover the cost of ocean
freight, insurance and losses.
5.        The gas net-back value is based on the economic value of gas used
in a combined-cycle power plant. This takes into account not only the
energy cost of the alternative fuel (i.e., the fuel oil used in a thermal
power plant), but also differential in equipment efficiency (i.e.,
differential in efficiency of a gas-based combined-cycle and fuel-oil-based
power plant).
6.        The combined-cycle power plant considered for. the purpose of
these analyses is the proposed plant at Khanom, 600 MW capacity, estimated
to cost US$815 per Kwh ( based on actual bids received by EGAT).   It is
assumed to have operating costs of US cents 0.6 per kwh, a plant factor of
751, efficiency of 46X, a construction time of 3 years, and a life of 20
years.
7.        The fuel oil-based power plant is assumed to have a plant factor
of 65X, efficiency of 39Z, capital cost of US$1,100 per Kwh, operating cost



- 98 -
Page 2 of 4
of US ceonts 0.5 per Kwh, a construction tin, of 4 years, and a life of 25
years.
Financial AnalAsIXS
8.        The capital cost of the plpcllne for the purpose of finLneial
analysLs L. ssumed to be the Projoct base cost ineludlng taxes and duties
and the physieal contingency. The operating cost is assumed to be 3X of
the capital cost.
9.        The purchase price of gas is calculated using the gas price
formula provided in the Gas Sale Agreement singed between PTT and the
joLnt-venture gas producers. The gS solling price is calculated using the
price formula provided ln the Gas Sale Agreement singed betweon PTT and the
EGAT.
