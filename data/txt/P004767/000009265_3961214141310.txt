IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF THAILAND
BONGKOT GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 3508-TH)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Bongkot Gas Transmission
Project in the Kingdom of Thailand for which Loan 3508-TH in the amount of US$ 105.00 million
equivalent was approved on July 7, 1992 and made effective on December 8, 1992.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1995, one year later than the original closing date
of December 31, 1994. Final disbursement took place on October 26, 1994, and the undisbursed
balance of US$ 13.29 million was canceled in two installments on December 13, 1994 and on
December 31, 1995. Co-financing was provided by Asian Development Bank (ADB), Exim Bank of
Japan (JEXIM) and Exim Bank of the United States (USEXIM). PTT did not provide the Bank with
any comments from the co-financiers.
The ICR was prepared by V. Krishnaswamy (Consultant) of the Infrastructure Operations
Division of the East Asia and Pacific Region, Country Department I, and reviewed by M. Farhandi,
Principal Energy Specialist, J. Shivakumar, Infrastructure Division Chief and W. Schwermer, Project
Adviser, EAL.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission
in March 1996. It is based on material in the project files and information gathered during the ICR
mission from the Borrower and other sources. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR
by: (i) providing information to the ICR mission; (ii) contributing views reflected in the mission's Aide
Memoire; (iii) preparing its own evaluation of the project implementation; and (iv) commenting on the
draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF THAILAND
BONGKOT GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 3508-TH)
Evaluation Summarv
Introduction
i.            The Bongkot Gas Transmission Project was the fourth in the series of Bank loans to the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) to augment the supply of indigenously available and
environmentally friendly natural gas in Thailand. It was also designed to encourage commercialization
of the transactions between two parastatals-- PTT and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
(EGAT). PTT had completed all three earlier projects on schedule and within the budget and the projects
realized their main objectives. The Bank had provided significant technical assistance for the institutional
strengthening of PTT, which has emerged as one of the successful and well run energy entities in the
region.
Project Objectives
ii.           The main objective of the project was to increase the gas supply capability of Thailand
by: (a) expanding the gas transmission system; (b) strengthening the institutional effectiveness of PTT;
and (c) enabling Thailand to make a more efficient use of its capital resources in the gas sector through
annual reviews of PTT's investment programs.
iii.          In pursuit of the physical objective, the Loan Agreement (LA) required the Borrower not
only to execute the project with due diligence, and also carry out: (a) a thorough inspection and testing
of the older pipeline between Erawan and Rayong to determine the limit of its capacity to transmit gas
safely; and (b) an engineering study for a new gas transmission project to augment the transmission
capacity from Erawan to Rayong.
iv.           To strengthen the institutional capacity of PTT, covenants under the loan required PTT
to: (a) conduct and implement a study to upgrade PTT's Management Information System (MIS); (b)
conduct and implement a study on establishing the safety engineering and environmental standards for
PTT operations; and (c) conduct a safety audit of PTT's operations by external experts to be hired for
this purpose!'. During loan negotiations it was agreed: (a) that in addition to an audit by the Auditor
General, PTT's accounts would be audited by an independent private audit firm acceptable to the Bank;
and (b) that PTT would strengthen its internal audit office and allow it to report directly to the Governor
of PTT. As part of project preparation, PTT was persuaded to enter into a formal commercial gas supply
contract with EGAT, and a loan covenant required PTT to consult the Bank before making any major
amendments to its gas purchase contract with the gas field operator and its gas sales contract with EGAT.
1/    In addition, a study on establishing Environmental Standards and Regulations for on-shore and off-shore exploration,
development and production of Oil and Gas in Thailand, and another study on the Business Strategies and Privatization of PTT were
parts of the Project allocated for grant financing by ADB technical assistance.



-iii-
v.            With regard to the third objective, it was agreed during negotiations that PTT would
provide towards the end of each year its investment plan for the next few years and that the Bank and
PTT would jointly review it to identify possible improvements to make a more efficient use of PTT's
capital resources.
vi.           The project's objectives were considered timely, practical, realistic and consistent with
the country's priority (of rapidly increasing commercial energy supplies to sustain the momentum of
economic growth), the Bank's country assistance strategy (which stressed support for removing
infrastructural bottlenecks to growth) and the sector strategy (which focused on environmentally friendly
energy options and on public sector management reforms that would promote competitive private
investments in the energy sector).
Implementation Experience and Results
vii.          The project's objectives have been substantially achieved. The physical facilities were
constructed and commissioned substantially on schedule, optimum transmission capacity of the first
pipeline between Erawan and Rayong was determined, and the engineering study led to the construction
of the second pipeline between Erawan and Rayong under a follow-up Bank loan (Loan 3799-TH). The
institutional and investment review objectives were also realized, especially with the completion of the
Fuel Options Study (December 1993), which provided an analytical framework for investment choice and
timing of investments. PTT's operations have become more commercialized and it is moving gradually
to corporatize and eventually privatize some of its business units.
viii.         The project's sustainability seems to be assured in the context of more than the forecast
level of availability of gas (350 mmcfd compared to the estimate of 250 mmcfd) and condensate from the
Bongkot gas field, continued high demand for gas in Thai economy, and the adoption by PTT of a sales
contract to EGAT ensuring continuity of sales and an adequate return on investment. Construction of
the project pipelines and the second pipeline from Erawan to Rayong encouraged the timely investment
in gas development and production by private sector operators like Unocal and Total.
ix.          The project was completed at a cost of US$ 333.94 million, which was about ten percent
lower than the appraisal estimate. The saving was essentially due to the contingency amount provided
in the cost estimate not being required, as a result of prudent project management. Despite some
unfavorable weather conditions, the project was completed basically on schedule and was in full
commercial operation by March 1994, four to five months ahead of the date envisaged during appraisal.
The revised economic internal rate of return (ERR) for the project is 34 percent compared to 26 percent
estimated at appraisal. The pricing formula for the sale of gas to EGAT enables PTT to achieve financial
internal rates of return (FRR) of 16 percent as estimated during appraisal.
x.            PTT hedged against external factors such as oil price changes, by partially indexing its
gas purchase and sale prices to oil prices. Natural disturbances such as cyclones did affect the laying of
off-shore pipe, but astute construction scheduling allowed the experienced contractors to make up the lost
time in later stages. The performance of consultants and contractors was excellent and the financiers
including the Bank helped maintain the project schedule. There was a high level of ownership of the
project on the part of PTT, which was determined to complete it on schedule to meet its take-or-pay
obligations under the gas purchase contract. The Government gave PTT a large measure of autonomy and
was supportive of its initiatives.



-iv-
xi.           The Bank's performance on the whole was highly satisfactory. Its quick response to the
loan request and willingness to spend nearly a year in project preparatory assistance was commendable.
Also noteworthy were its attention to the exhaustive review of the gas reserves, and its initiatives to
have the reserve levels certified by the experts, its contributions to make the environment impact
assessment comprehensive, and its focus on stakeholder incentives to sustain the arrangement. Its
decision to provide more than the usual percentage of retroactive financing, helped in the timely
implementation of the project. PTT found the assistance provided by the supervision and other missions
useful and constructive. The Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory in all areas except for a
delay in carrying out one of the studies and having its accounts audited by a private firm.  Its
performance was characterized by a high degree of ownership of the project and reflected the
organization's maturity.
xii.          In the light of the achievement of its objectives, the sustainability of its operations, and
the institutional changes that have taken place, the project outcome was judged highly satisfactory.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
xiii.         This is the fourth Bank-financed project, which PTT has implemented successfully,
thereby proving that it is a mature organization capable of implementing successfully complex projects
in the oil and gas sector. All the conditions for the continued success of the project operation are
favorable. The Bank's following up with another gas transmission project to augment supplies to the
Bangkok area was timely and appropriate. Given the urgent need to increase commercial energy supplies
and the need to ensure that the incremental supplies come from environmentally friendly sources, the
Bank's continued support for gas transmission and gas import projects is appropriate. Conditions in the
oil and gas sector in Thailand are favorable for a gradual restructuring of the sector with increasing
private sector involvement in a competitive milieu. PTT is poised for a major, gradual transformation
and the Bank will need to be involved in the sector to support and orient the change appropriately. The
focus of the future operations could be to support regional co-operation initiatives, help Thailand to adopt
appropriate regulatory mechanisms to enable greater private investment in a competitive environment,
and to help PTT to gain access to international capital and commercial debt markets on the basis of
conforming to the disclosure requirements such access demands.
xiv.          The key lessons learned from the project include: (a) in the Asian context support to
national oil and gas companies, to construct gas transmission systems helps unbundle the sector, reduces
the marketing risk for those engaged in exploration, development and production of oil and gas and
thereby promotes private investment in such upstream activities; (b) projects with a high degree of
ownership by the borrower succeed, especially when the Bank focuses on identifying and managing
possible risks to ensure sustainability; (c) gas reserve and recovery level estimates need to be reviewed
and certified by external experts; (d) Bank missions need to cover areas far beyond the traditional project
boundaries and work with a wide range of agencies which translates into extra resources and time to
address adequately the Bank's environmental concerns; (e) the use of the same Task Manager for
appraisal and supervision leads to greater efficiencies in Bank performance; (f) Bank divisions dealing
with public utilities need to have adequate in-house financial expertise.






PART I: IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.         The Bank has had a long and successful record of assisting Thailand over two decades in
its efforts to increase commercial energy supplies, develop indigenous resources (such as hydro power,
lignite, oil and natural gas), make the supply process environmentally acceptable, and improve the
operational efficiency and financial performance of the energy supply entities. The Bongkot Gas
Transmission Project (the Project) was the fourth in the series of Bank loans to the Petroleum Authority
of Thailand (PTT) in the oil and gas sector. Its main objective was to increase the natural gas supply
capability of Thailand by: (a) expanding the gas transmission system; (b) strengthening the institutional
functioning of PTT; and (c) enabling Thailand to make a more efficient use of its capital resources in
the gas sector through annual reviews of PTT's investment program. In the past, the Bank had
provided significant technical assistance to PTT to improve its efficiency and performance and the
Project was designed to further commercialize the transactions of parastatals among themselves (e.g.,
PTT and EGAT) and with others to enable the country to attract and sustain private investment in the
upstream and down stream activities of the oil and gas sector.
2.         Given Thailand's rapid economic growth and the sharp rise in the demand for commercial
energy, the project objectives were considered timely, relevant to the urgent needs of the country,
practical and realistic. They were also consistent with the country's priority (augmenting commercial
energy supplies to sustain growth momentum), the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (which stresses
support for removing infrastructural bottlenecks to growth, especially in the energy and transport
sectors), and the energy sector strategy (which focuses on environmentally sound energy options to
minimize green house gas emissions, and public sector management conducive to attract and sustain
private investment in the energy related areas). The objectives were clear and sharply focussed, and
were achievable. The level of complexity of the project and the demands it made on PTT were within
the capability of PTT with selective external support. The risks (uncertain gas reserves and possible
cost escalations in offshore production and transport of gas) were normal for all offshore gas supply
projects, and PTT had adequate technical support during the preparation and implementation phases to
manage them reasonably.
3.         To expand the country's gas transmission capacity, construction of offshore pipelines
between Bongkot and Erawan and between Erawan and Khanom along with the associated on-shore and
offshore facilities was included as a component under the loan. Also, PTT was required to inspect and
test, with the help of external experts, the extent to which gas could be transmitted safely through the
older pipeline between Erawan and Rayong (Loan Agreement (LA), Sch. 5 para. Al). In addition PTT
was required to carry out an engineering study for a second pipeline between Erawan and Rayong (LA,
Sch 5, para. DI).
4.         To strengthen PTT's institutional capacity the project involved: (a) conducting a study to
upgrade the Management Information System (MIS) of PTT and training the PTT staff (LA. Sch. 5,
para. Bl); (b) conducting a safety audit of PTT's operations by external experts hired for this purpose
(LA Sch. 5, para. CI); (c) carrying out a study to establish safety engineering and environmental
standards for PTT's oil and gas operations (LA Sch. 5, para. C2); and (d) carrying out an audit of
PTT's financial statements, not only by the Auditor General but also by a firm of independent private
auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 7 of the Minutes of Loan Negotiations). Further, while preparing
the loan, PTT was persuaded to enter into a formal commercial gas supply contract with EGAT and a



-2-
loan covenant required PTT to consult the Bank before amending any major provision of the gas
purchase contact with the field operator and the gas sales contract with EGAT (LA, Sec. 5.02). Two
additional technical assistance studies, one on environmental standards and regulations for the onshore
and offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production and the other on PTT's business
strategy and privatization options were designed to meet the project's institutional objectives. They were
funded by an ADB technical assistance grant.
5.          To use capital resources in the oil and gas sector more efficiently, it was agreed during
loan negotiations that the Bank and PTT will jointly review PTT's investment plans each year (Minutes
of Loan negotiations, para. 19).
6.          The physical, institutional and allocative efficiency objectives were also further followed
up under the subsequent loan (Loan 3799-TH) for the Second Gas Transmission Project.
B. Achievement of Objectives
7.          The project's objectives were substantially achieved. With regard to physical objectives,
expansion of the capacity of the gas transmission system was achieved as planned when the project
facilities were in full commercial operation in early 1994. The project had been completed at a total
cost of US$ 333.94 million, or about ten percent lower than the cost of $370 million estimated at
appraisal. The saving was realized as the funds provided for contingencies were not required, due to
extensive advance procurement and high quality project management. Despite unfavorable weather that
affected the off-shore pipe laying work, the Project was essentially completed on schedule and was in
commercial operation from March 6, 1994, compared to the date of June 30, 1994 estimated at
appraisal. Gas deliveries actually commenced at Erawan in July 1993k' and at Khanom in Feb 1994.
The outlook for gas and condensate availability from the Bongkot field has become much more
optimistic than before and the field operator will be able to increase the daily contract deliveries from
250 mmcfd to 350 mmcfd after June 1, 1996. Condensate recoveries are also correspondingly higher.
Thus, it is not surprising that the economic internal rate of return (ERR) calculated in the ICR
following the methodology adopted during appraisal, was 34 percent compared to the 26 percent
estimated at appraisal.
8.          The financial internal rate of return (FRR) calculated at appraisal was 16 percent. The
ICR mission did not consider it necessary to reassess it, since the selling price to EGAT (which
accounts for over 85 percent of PTT's gas sales) is governed by the formula that allows PTT to fully
recover: (a) the cost of gas purchased from the field operator; (b) the cost of transmission including a
reasonable internal rate of return (not less than 12 percent) to PTT on its investment in the transmission
facilities; and (c) applicable value added tax. In practice an internal rate return of 15 percent is used to
determine the sale price to EGAT. On its gas sales to industry, PTT is able to secure prices several
times higher than that for EGAT. Thus PTT is virtually assured of securing FRRs in excess of 16
percent by this pricing mechanism.
1/    A total of 11.08 bcf of gas was delivered from Bongot gas field in July-December 1993 to Erawan and then on to
Rayong.



-3-
9.         The physical objectives achieved also included the determination of the safe gas
transmission capacity of the older Erawan-Rayong pipeline, the completion of the engineering study for
the second Erawan-Rayong pipeline and the commencement of the construction of that pipeline under
the follow-up Bank loan (Loan 3799-TH). Construction of the pipelines under the two Bank loans
encouraged the private sector field operators such as Unocal and Total to invest further in the gas
development and production activities in the Gulf of Thailand. By achieving the physical objectives, the
project also served the environmental goal of minimizing greenhouse gases. Action plans and
monitoring arrangements set up as a result of the environment impact assessment review at the
beginning of the project minimized adverse impacts during construction and monitoring reports
confirmed that the adverse impacts were insignificant.
10.       In relation to the institutional objectives, PTT carried out the MIS study with a Canadian
grant (rather than with the funds allocated under the Bank loan for this purpose).  The terms of
reference were agreed upon with the Bank and PTT implemented the recommendations of the study in
consultation with the Bank. The associated training of the PTT staff was also completed. The safety
audit of PTT's operations was carried out by external experts, as envisaged. The study on Safety
Engineering and Environmental Standards, however, was delayed. The loan closing date was extended
from December 31, 1994 to December 31, 1995 on account of this. However, the study could not be
completed before the extended closing date. In the event, PTT used its own funds (instead of the
US$200,000 allocated for it) to complete the study. The Bank received the final report in April 1996.
Its scope has also been somewhat abbreviated to cover only the natural gas related operations of PTT,
using Bongkot Gas Transmission Project as a model or pilot program. Staff manuals are expected to be
prepared and issued based on this study sometime in 1996. As a result of the agreements reached
during loan negotiations, the internal audit office of PTT was strengthened with additional staff, and
allowed to report directly to the Governor of PTT. The same principle was also been adopted in the
organizations of PTT's subsidiary business units. The study on environmental standards and regulations
for exploration and development of oil and gas in Thailand under ADB financing was also successfully
completed and increased the institutional capacity of several agencies in Thailand.
11.        The objective of improving the allocative efficiency of PTT's investment plans was
achieved through reviews of the investment plans by the Bank missions which made suggestions for
improvement. Though formal reporting of such activity appears to have made by only one of the
supervision missions, PTT regarded the discussions with the Bank missions as providing useful inputs
to the process of its investment planning. Further the comprehensive sector and economic work done
for the highly acclaimed Fuel Options Study (December 1993) provided a useful analytical framework
in which PTT could determine its investment priorities and decide on the ranking and scheduling of its
options. The Government and PTT were greatly appreciative of this major contribution by the Bank.
12.        The financial objectives have also been substantially achieved.  PTT's financial
performance during FY1992-FY1996 was even better than what was forecast at appraisal (see Table
15). Current projections by PTT indicate that it will have no problem maintaining current levels of
performance. However, the objective of having the accounts of PTT audited by independent private
auditors has not yet been realized. This issue was brought up during the negotiations for Loan 3799-
TH, when it was agreed that the purpose of the private audit would be to restate the financial statements
of PTT in accordance with the International Accounting Standards (IAS) and to certify PTT's
compliance with financial ratios covenanted with the Bank. A long form audit report of the private
auditor was to be submitted to the Bank every year (commencing from FY1993) within three months of
the date of submission of the Auditor General's report. PTT has concluded a contract with a private



-4-
audit firm acceptable to the Bank to review its accounts for FY 1994 and advise on changes to its
system to conform to IAS. The review is still underway and PTT expects to provide the long form
report sometime between October and December 1996.
13.         PTT's financial statements, audited by the Auditor General do not disclose all details
necessary to calculate the covenanted self financing ratio and debt service ratio. Full information was
not disclosed on items such as non-cash charges included in expenses (e.g., provident fund
contributions, depreciation charged as part of cost of sales, etc), debt repayments relating to
refinancing, their effect on the current portion of the long term loans due, and on the changes of the
non-cash working capital. PTT's financial situation is essentially sound, but in the absence of adequate
disclosure in the audited financial statements, it is made to look like an entity performing at a much
lower level. Thus, it is necessary that the full details required to calculate these ratios and the actual
calculations themselves should be part of the audit report by the Auditor General and the private
auditor. If PTT is to raise resources from the international capital markets, such complete disclosures
would be a minimum requirement. Securing compliance in this regard may not be difficult, since
another leading energy entity (EGAT) had been complying with somewhat similar provisions for a long
time. This will be followed up as a part of the supervision of Loan 3799-TH.
14.         Over the years PTT has become a well managed public sector energy entity in the region
and has benefitted from a range of technical assistance provided by the Bank. In January 1992,
following the concept of profit centers, PTT was reorganized into separate business units for oil,
gas,petrochemicals, central services and head office.  Based on further studiesi', it was further
reorganized again in February 1996, following the concept of arms-length subsidiaries, into business
units for oil, gas, international trading operations, and a head office in the form of a holding company.
All these units will be completely self contained and produce their own balance sheets, so that they
could be corporatized and listed in the local stock exchange in the near future. PTT's approach to
business has become increasingly commercial and it is poised for corporatization, and for partial or full
privatization of its business units eventually.  Public sector management objectives may thus be
regarded as having met a large measure of success.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
15.         Natural disturbances such as unseasonable and severe cyclones affected the laying of off-
shore pipe, but the experienced contractors were able to make up the lost time in the later stages.The
performance of the contractors and consultants on the whole was excellent. The financiers including the
Bank were understanding and co-operative. There was a high level of ownership of the project on the
part of the Government and PTT. With some advice from the Bank, PTT's approach to managing
external risks and factors affecting the project was successful. It sought to protect itself by partially
indexing the purchase price of gas to oil prices changes along with prescribed floor and ceiling prices.
Its sale price of gas to EGAT recovers the purchase price of gas and provides a reasonable return on its
investment in transmission facilities. Uncertainties relating to gas reserves were resolved through
detailed investigations, certification of the reserves by the best available experts and appropriate
2/    Study on the Business Strategy and Privatization of PTT carried out as a part of the Project under ADB technical
assistance funding,



-5-
contracting arrangements with the field operator. Delays in carrying out one of the studies and in
having its accounts audited by private auditors were mainly due to different interpretations about the
frequency of the private audit and the cost of the study, as well as to staff changes caused by the two
reorganizations of PTT. There was some delay in the loan becoming effective, caused by the process
of the legal opinion being reviewed by the Juridical Council of Thailand, but it did not affect project's
progress.
D. Project Sustainability
16.        Project sustainability over the medium-to-long term seems to be assured. The project was
completed as scheduled and at a cost lower than estimated. PTT's business unit for natural gas is a
well run and is able to operate the facilities properly. The outlook for gas and condensate availability
in the Bongkot field is much brighter than at appraisal (see para. 8). Further, there seems to be no
slackening of demand for natural gas in Thailand in the foreseeable future. More importantly, the
commercial arrangements among the key participants are likely to sustain the Project operations as
planned. The gas sales contracts between the field operator and PTT and between PTT and EGAT
minimize the risk for all and spread the risks and rewards in an equitable manner, ensuring
stakeholders' interest in the continued survival of the arrangements. The follow-up project under Loan
3799-TH further reinforces these trends and will make the project even more sustainable, as will future
plans to link Bongkot pipeline to the JDA area.
E. Bank Performance
17.        Bank performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the Project was considered
highly satisfactory. The project as formulated was consistent with the country's priorities, the Bank's
country strategy and sector policy. The Bank responded to the loan application from the country in a
timely fashion, eliminated the component relating to the onshore pipe line to Namphong power plant,
the viability of which was not entirely satisfactory, and spent nearly a year in helping PTT prepare the
project and mobilizing co-finance from the Asian Development Bank and the Exim Banks of Japan and
USA. The considerable time taken by the Bank to have the gas reserve estimate reviewed, and gas
reserve levels certified by the best available experts in this activity and to ensure that the contracting
arrangements for the purchase and sale of gas by PTT were based on commercial considerations and on
an acceptable gas pricing formula indicate the Bank's concern for identifying project risks and devising
methods to manage them to ensure project sustainability. In this effort, the appraisal team was guided
by lessons from earlier PTT projects.
18.        Bank's performance in relation to the environmental concerns during the preparatory phase
is noteworthy. To deal effectively with environmental concerns, the Bank had to cover areas far
beyond the conceptual project limits and work with several agencies besides PTT. Thus it interacted
with the Department of Mineral Resources, National Energy Policy Office, Office of Environmental
Policy and Planning, National Environment Board, and the Ministry of Science, Technology and
Environment as well as private gas field operators like Unocal and Total in order to formulate the
technical assistance proposals and terms of reference for the Study on Environmental Standards and



-6-
Regulation for the on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration and development-'. Repeated and
comprehensive reviews by Bank staff of the several versions of the Environment Assessment Review
Report produced by PTT with consultant assistance, resulted in the production of a final report that laid
the foundation for the environmentally sound construction and operation of the Project. The Bank's
decision to provide more than the usual share of retroactive financing, at the request of the Borrower,
helped move implementation in a timely fashion.
19.        Based on the experience under past operations with PTT, procurement arrangements were
designed to be simple and conducive to speedy implementation. The number of the contracts was kept
to the minimum and most of them were made single responsibility contracts. Bidding and bid
evaluation was carried out in the preparation phase and the Bank staff spent considerable time in
reviewing and discussing the evaluation reports and proposals for contract awards.  Complex
procurement issues such as the correctness of separating the coating and jacketing of line pipes from the
main contract for the supply of line pipes arose and were deliberated upon at length, and the issues
were resolved in the larger interests of the economy and efficiency, generally upholding the proposals
of the Borrower. The Bank's attention to strengthening the capacity of PTT with comprehensive
consultant support for project management, and to ensure continuous and meaningful co-ordination with
all co-financiers throughout the project cycle was also noteworthy.
20.        Bank supervision was satisfactory-- indeed, more than was evident in the institution's
records. Apart from the regular supervision missions, missions involved with identifying and preparing
of the follow-up loan (3799-Th) and Fuel Options Study also provided useful inputs for resolving
problems. PTT thought highly of such contributions. Sectoral loan covenants were followed up and
compliance secured. The inability to follow up on the audit related agreements (see paragraphs 12 and
13) was caused by a shortage of financial analysts in the division.
21.        In retrospect, it would also appear that for a project with such complete commercial
orientation, it would have been more appropriate to arrange for some commercial co-financing rather
than relying exclusively on export credits and official co-financing. PTT could also have been
encouraged to consider international bond issues and to adopt discipline in accounting, audit, and
disclosures required for such bond issues. But the tirne frame in which the Project had to be completed
to meet the take-or-pay obligations under PTT's contract for gas purchase from the field operator
perhaps did not allow adequate time to prepare PTT for such exercises.
F. Borrower Performance
22.        The Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory in all aspects, except with respect to
the audit covenant (see para. 12) and one of the studies (see para. 10). It was characterized by a high
degree of ownership of, and commitment to, the project. PTT was determined to design, fund,
implement and operate the project in time to meet the take-or-pay obligations under its gas purchase
agreement with the Bongkot field operator. It engaged competent consultants to carry out all pre-
investment investigations and responded well to the Bank's suggestions to have the gas reserve levels
certified appropriately and have the project prepared in a manner acceptable to the Bank and the co-

-7-
financiers. It provided out of its own internally generated cash about 28 percent of the project cost and
raised through domestic bond issues another 16 percent. It allowed the consultants and contractors to
operate with adequate freedom and non-interference, but kept a meaningful and rigorous control over
cost and time schedules. It is remarkable that in a major complex off-shore pipeline project, all
contract claims were settled and completion certificates issued to all contractors within 6 months of the
date of the initial operation.
23.        PTT was fully responsive to the Bank's suggestions to improve the Environmental Impact
Assessment Review report, which included an action plan and a monitoring plan. It carried out those
plans engaging competent staff and consultants.
24.        PTT, through its good financial and corporate performance, has earned the status of
"Good State Enterprise" from the Government, which gives such enterprises a high degree of autonomy
in running their business. The Government was also fully supportive of PTT's efforts to raise external
loans and to issue domestic bonds to finance the project.
25.        PTT's record of compliance with the covenants under the loan was considered satisfactory.
Most of the sectoral, financial and audit covenants have been complied with in a timely and meaningful
manner (see Table 10). The only deviations relate to the delay in carrying out one of the studies and in
having its accounts audited by external auditors (see paragraphs 10 and 12). In both cases remedial
action is underway and progress can be monitored by the Bank as a part of the supervision of Loan
3799-TH.
G. Assessment of Outcome
26.        All the Project objectives covering the physical, institutional and allocative efficiency
aspects were substantially achieved. The project has met and exceeded the levels of gas and condensate
deliveries planned at the time of appraisal and produced a higher ERR. It is also clearly sustainable.
Thus, the outcome was judged highly satisfactory.
H. Future Operations
27.        PTT's natural gas business unit is well run and capable of operating the project facilities
properly. Its commercial and financial policies and procedures as well as its personnel are adequate to
ensure that the operation remains financially sound. Increasing availability of gas and condensate from
the Bongkot field and the continued high demand have made the outlook for the project brighter than
before. Nonetheless, PTT will need to closely watch the gas reserves situation and also revise the gas
sale prices to EGAT from time to time based on the agreed formula. Overall monitoring and evaluation
of the project performance in the future will be made through the records of PTT relating to the
operation of the facilities, as well as through the internal and external audit systems in place. The Bank
has already given a follow-up loan (3799-TH), through which the sectoral and institutional objectives
will be pursued further. The two items to be followed up by the Bank staff as a part of the supervision
under that loan would be the matters relating to external audit of PTT's accounts by independent private
auditors and the implementation of the study on Safety Engineering and Environmental Standards of



-8-
PTT's natural gas operations. As a part of some future operation, PTT could be helped to carry out a
similar study for its oil related operations. The optimal timing for a future evaluation of the project
would be after five years of operation (sometime in 1999).
28.         A number of major developments are taking place in Thailand's oil and gas sector. PTT,
after its reorganization, is poised for the corporatization of its subsidiary business units and for listing
them on the local stock exchange in the near future. Also, projects involving co-operation among the
developing countries of the region are taking shape. Such projects included in PTT's investment plans
are for: (a) LNG import facilities; (b) the import of gas from Myanmar and the JDA area through
offshore pipelines. In this context, the Bank will need to continue its involvement in Thailand's oil and
gas sector focussing on the objectives of promoting regional co-operation, encouraging PTT in the
direction of corporatization and eventual privatization, and creating appropriate regulatory mechanisms
in the oil and gas industry to foster increased private investment and competition.
I. Key Lessons Learned
29.         Many lessons can be learned from the successful implementation of the project. They
include the following:
(a)   By supporting gas transmission projects by national entities like PTT, the Bank indirectly
helps in unbundling the sector, reduces the business risk for the private investment in
exploration, development and production of oil and gas, and promotes private investment
in the upstream and down stream activities.
(b)   With respect to natural gas projects the risk relating the reserve level estimates could be
made manageable not only by careful reviews of reserve estimates by bank staff and
project consultants but also by having the safe reserve and recovery levels certified by the
best experts in the profession.
(c)   Projects with a high degree of ownership by the Borrower succeed, especially when the
Bank's preparatory assistance focuses on risks, risk management and sustainability.
(d)   With respect to projects in Thailand, adopting the use of single responsibility contracts and
keeping the total number of contracts to the minimum leads to fewer problems and rapid
implementation.
(e)   The use of the task manager who prepared and appraised the project, also for its
supervision leads to continuity of relations with the executing agency and to more effective
supervision.
(f)   Adequate attention paid at the stage of reviewing the Environment Impact Assessment
Report to set up appropriate action plans and monitoring mechanisms leads to an
environmentally sound implementation and operation of the project, and helps to avoid
public resistance which is a common feature in many infrastructure projects.



-9-
(g)   To address adequately environmental concerns, the Bank has to cover areas far beyond the
traditional project boundaries and deal with a wide range of agencies, besides the project
executing agency. Adequate resources need to be provided for this.
30.        On the downside, project experience showed that it was necessary to improve
communication among the different agencies in Thailand such as PTT and EGAT, to ensure that their
development and business plans become congruent in substance, details and timing. It was also found
necessary to improve communication within PTT among its technical, financial and commercial groups.
The next Bank operation focused on this aspect.
31.        The project experience also showed that Bank divisions dealing with public utilities and
infrastructure must have an adequate number of financial analysts on their staff to follow up on the
audit and financial covenants meaningfully. Given the budget constraints, it may not always be possible
to remedy this problem.

THAILAND: BONGKOT GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(Loan No. 3058-Th)
AIDE IMEMOHE
LMPLEtYENTATION COMPLETION REPORT MISSION
1.    A World Bank Implementation Completion Report Mission (ICR Mission)
visited Thailand during 11-15 March 1996 to collect materials for the preparartion
of the ICR for the above mentioned Project and to hold discussions with the officials
of the Borrower, Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT).
2.    A World Bank loan of $ 105 million was approved for the above Project on
7 July 1992 and became effective on 8 December 1992. The construction of the
Project facilities was completed by end 1993 as originally scheduled and
commercial operations commenced in January 1994. The pipelines are operating
normally since then and planned gas deliveries from the Bongkot gas fields are
being made. The gas availability in the Bongkot field has turned out to be more than
anticipated and the field operator is ready to increase the contracted deliveries from
the level of 250 mmcfd to 350 mmcfd; In the context of demand for natural gas in
Thailand increasing at higher than forecast rates, the sustainability of the Project
seems to be fully assured. The Project has been imnplemented at a cost of about
S 334 million or about 10 percent lower than the cost estirnated at the time of
appraisal. The economic and financial rates of return, based on actuals upon
completion of the project are expected to be even higher than those calculated at the
time of Project appraisal. The World Bank loan account was closed on 31 December
1995, after canceling a surplus amount of about S 13 million. The Project, thus, has
been successfully completed and PTT believes that there are no special issues to be
raised for discussion.
3.    PTT has carried out most of the studies, it agreed to undertake, and has
complied with most of the covenants under the loan. It would appear that there are
only a few items to be highlighted for follow up.
4.    The Study on Safety Engineering and Environmental Standards for the PTT
Operations had been delayed and a draft report had been sent to the Bank recently:
The draft covers only the operations of PTT relating to natural gas, using the
Bongkot Gas Transmission Project facilities as an example/pilot for the study. The
draft is being revised taking into account the comrnments of the various sections of
PTT, and the revised version will be forwarded to the Bank not later than 15 April
1996. PTT plans to use this study to prepare and issue the relevant Manuals for staff
use on this subject. PTT also plans to carry out a similar study for its oil related
operations at an appropriate time.
5.    PTT had agreed earlier to engage an independent private auditor experienced
in the oil and gas industry to review its financial statements and prepare a long form
report to restate them in accordance with International Accounting Standards. Such
long form reports are to be sent to the Bank every year commnencing from FY 1993,



-21-                          AppEendix A
Page 2 of 2
within three months from the date of submission of the Audit Report of the Auditor
General. However, PTT had been able to conclude a contract with a suitable
intemational accounting firm for this purpose only in September 1994. The work in
relation to the accounts of 1994 are ongoing, and the long form report for FY 1994
could be made available to the Bank in the fourth quarter of 1996. This needs to be
followed up by PTT.
6.    Under the current procedures of the Bank, the ICR should include an
appendix giving the Borrower's part of the ICR. The format and possible items to be
included in this had already been communicated to PTT and further explained to its
staff during this mission. PTT has agreed to send its part of the ICR to the Bank not
later than 25 March 1996, so that the Bank's draft ICR including the Borrower's ICR
as an appendix could be finalized and sent to PTT by mid April for review and
comments. PTT's comments on this draft of the Bank needs to be communicated
within a week or ten days to enable the Bank to finalize the ICR and circulate it to
its Board of Directors on the scheduled date. Under the Bank's current policy on
disclosures, ICR is a document accessible to the public.
7.   The comprehensive Environment Impact Assessment Statement Report
prepared at the time of appraisal includes an action plan to be pursued by PTT both
during the construction phase and'the operational phase of the Project. PTT
confirms that it will maintain the appropriate monitoring arrangements and pursue
the action plan throughout the operational phase of the Project facilities.
8.   The Mission wishes to place on record its appreciation of the co-operation
and assistance provided by the PTT staff and thanks PTT for all the courtesies and
hospitality extended during its stay at Bangkok.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BONGKOT-ERAWAN-KHANOM PIPELINE PROJECT
1. Project Description
The main objective of the Bongkot-Erawan-Khanom Pipeline Project was to provide the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) with gas transmission capability from the Bongkot
and Erawan offshore gas fields to customers on Thailand's southern and eastern seaboards.
This additional supply capability was required to meet the increasing energy demands of
Thailand's growing economy.
The project consisted of the following major parts:
1. A 32-inch diameter submarine pipeline approximately 170km in length from the newly
developed Bongkot gas field to an existing platform in the Erawan gas field.
2. A 24-inch diameter submarine pipeline approximately 160 km in length from the
Erawan platform to shore at Khanom in southern Thailand.
3. An onshore gas receiving terminal at Khanom including a liquid slug catcher and a
short gas delivery pipeline to an EGAT power plant.
4. SCADA and Communications additions and upgrades to PTT's existing system,
including construction of a new control building in Chonburi, a Product Management
Information System, and a Pipeline Simulation Model.
The project began in April 1991 and was completed in December 1994.
2. Project Implementation.
The project was split into two phases, with Phase I including detailed engineering, site

supply of linepipe, pipe coating, construction, and SCADA and Communications
installation. Overall project coordination and project management services were provided
by a Consultant to PTT.
The project was executed well, with the only major difficulty being weather delays due to
unusual occurrence of two typhoons affecting the Gulf of Thailand during marine
construction. Since these delays occurred early in the project, Contractors were able to
compensate in later activities.
3. Project Costs
Final actual costs for each portion of the project were as follows (all figures in millions):
Consulting                            US$   14.56
Supply of linepipe                           77.22
Linepipe coating and jacketing               26.01
Pipeline and facilities                     115.75
SCADA and Communications                     10.75
Civil Works                                   1.58
TOTAL                                        18.04
RISER PLATFORM                               43.80
MIS and Training                              0.41
Environmental Study                           0.17
2nd Pipeline Study                            0.99
Taxes and Duties                              3.26
IDC                                          21.40
Total   US$  333.94

4. Economic Re-evaluation
The economic evaluation of the project takes into consideration both the capital costs and
the operating costs for the pipeline against the benefit derived from sales of gas and
condensate. Detailed figures have been provided by PTT Planning Department showing
the costs and benefits on a year-by-year basis. Of greatest note is an improvement in the
benefit received from the gas streams over the original economic evaluation. This higher
gas stream benefit has contributed to the increased project EIRR of 29.73% over the
original estimated EIRR of 26.33%.
5. Performance of the Bank
The project was closely monitored by the Bank. During implementation, the Bank actively
played a constructive role in many parts of the Loan Projects. Close monitoring by the
Bank was of value in expediting implementation.
