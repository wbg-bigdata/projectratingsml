A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

Country Economic Overview
   .   The Turkish economy has rebounded from the 2001 crisis which had serious
       economic and social impacts. By the end of 2001, the currency had devalued by 50
       percent, nominal interest rates were about 100 percent, and the banking system had
       virtually collapsed.
       GNP growth has been strong since 2001 - 8 percent in 2002, 6 percent in 2003, 10
   .   percent in2004 and about 7.6 percent last year. Inflation i s under control reaching single
       digits(7.7 percent) in2005, the lowest inTurkey for 35 years.
       Several factors contributed to the improved macroeconomic performance - key
       amongst them are: strong fiscal discipline which has allowed the maintenance o f a large
   .   primary surplus on the order o f 6.5 percent o f GNP; on-going structural reform; and
       political stability since 2002.
       The EU's decision to open accessionnegotiations with Turkey in October 2005 -has
       been an important signal to financial markets and has created a firm anchor for the
       country's development and structural reforms inthe years ahead.

Impetus for Electricity Sector Reforms
The economic crisis o f 2001 led to the crystallization and recognition o f several structural and
planning deficiencies inthe electricity sector, the most important o f which were:

       A build-up o f public contingent liabilities as a result of the Government guaranteeing
       debt for a substantial amount o f privately financed generation capacity. These generation
       projects have imposed a heavy take-or-pay burden on the electricity system and have
   .   complicated the transition to a structure where the commercial risk can be shifted to
       private investors.
       A rising quasi-fiscal burden on the budget stemming from growing consumer non-
       payment and electricity theft problems at the distribution level.        The non-payments
       worsened as a consequence o f the economic crises. Although an attempt was made at
       offering private sector concessions for the distribution sector in the period 1999-2001,
       most o f these concessions involved guaranteed distribution margins with the supply risk
   .   borne by the Government. This approach was abandoned due to legal challenges to the
       approach and the nature o frisk sharing.
       Political influence on operating, planning and pricing decisions that made operational
       decision making more difficult.

Reform Direction-Electricity Market Law and the EUMarket Integration Process
   .   The Government has embarked upon a comprehensive reform and restructuring program
       o f the electricity sector to create a liberalized, efficient and economic sector. This was
       initiated by the Electricity Market Law (Law No. 4628) promulgated in February 2001.
       The principles and goals o f the reform program defined by this Law are substantially in
    .  line with EC Directives (1996/92/EC and 2003/54/EC) concerning rules for the internal
       market for electricity.
       Turkey i s a signatory o f the Athens Memorandao f 2002 and 2003 that the EC initiated to
       develop the regional electricity market in South East Europe and eventually integrate it
       with the internal electricity market o f the European Union.             The 2002 Athens
       Memoranduminitiated the regional market development process commonly referred to as
       the "Athens process". A more detailed version o f the memorandum was signed in 2003,
                                                   1

     which i s referred to as the Athens Memorandum 2003, and supersedes the 2002
     document. While other regional members signed the Treaty on October 25,2005, Turkey
     did not, owing to reservations on some o f the Treaty provisions (Annex 1). With the EU
     decision o f October 3, 2005 to begin negotiations for full accession, some reservations on
     the Treaty now become intertwined with the negotiations on the Energy Chapter o f the
     Acguis Communautaive.       Turkey however remains committed to, and continues to
     implement the provisions o f the 2003 Athens Memorandum.

Reform Implementation
     Functional and corporate restructuring of the sector - The electricity sector has been
     restructured into a generating corporation EUAS, a trading corporation TETAS, a
     transmission corporation TEIAS, a distribution corporation TEDAS and regional
     distribution companies (DISCOS).       The regional distribution companies are being
     prepared for privatization. See Figure A.1 below on the currently planned transitional
     sector structure.
     Regulatory Authority - Turkey has set up an independent regulatory authority, the
     Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) withjurisdiction over electricity, gas and
     petroleum. EMRAhas powers over licensing, tariff setting and customer service issues.
     Retail Competition in Electricity - Consumers whose annual consumption exceeds 6.0
     GWh can choose their own supplier-this represents more than 30% of the total Turkish
     electricity market.
     Competitive Market Structure - Market simulations are in progress to introduce a
     competitive bilateral contract market with a balancing and settlement system. TEIAS, the
     transmission company i s the independent system operator, and will also be the market
     operator. The market i s expected to provide the necessary price signals for potential new
     generation.

K e y Medium-Term Sector Issues

The key medium term sector issues include:

(a)    Ensuring supply security - Electricity demand has been growing at about 6 percent per
       annum between 2002 and 2005 and the Government anticipates that it will accelerate
       over the next decade closer to the long term average o f about 8%. (The Government i s
       also considering a low growth case where demand growth remains about 6%) In any
       case, capacity increases on the order of 1,500-2,000 MW per annum are required from
       around 2009-2010 onwards.         The issue o f concern i s that although licenses have been
       issued for about 6,000 MW o f new capacity (of which 4,000 MW i s for small hydro and
       wind), presently very little new construction has been started. These problems are largely
       linked to the on-going market implementation which has not yet led to the formation of
       creditworthy private distributors who can contract for new capacity andor electricity
       offtake. In order to strengthen supply security, the implementation o f the market and
       privatization o f distribution are vital. The Bank team i s working with the Government on
       a policy note on addressing supply security in parallel - this study focuses on the near
       term solutions as well as more systemic solutions for the medium term.

(b)    Accumulated arrears in the electricity utilities -Operating revenues at all the publicly-
       owned electricity and gas sector companies inTurkey are inadequate to meet their longer
       term level o f operating costs and expenditures. The problem i s mainly inthe distribution
       business managed by TEDAS. As o f 2004, the theft and loss percentage i s 18.5% o f
       purchases by TEDAS. Due to these problems there i s a 25-27% shortfall inpayments for
       purchased electricity by TEDAS which in turn cascades as revenue shortfalls to all the
       upstreamelectricity and gas businesses. The Government i s studying various alternatives
       to deal with the problem o f accumulated arrears (See Annex 9).

(c)    Reconciling independent economic sector regulation with the Government's
       economic stabilization controls -Presently, the Government exercises certain economic
       controls and constraints on pricing o f energy services/outputs and investment decisions,
       in order to maintain fiscal prudence, achieve a healthy primary surplus, and restrain
       inflationary pressures. There remains a fine line between economic stabilization controls
       and other forms o f economic controls that prevent the development o f institutions
       essential to a functioning market economy.         To mitigate regulatory risk for private
       investment it will be important that the economic stabilization restraints are relaxed to
       allow timely pass-through o f costs to consumers - specifically: (i)    wholesale gas prices
       should be adjusted to reflect the market terms in the underlying contracts; (ii)   electricity
       prices are adjusted to reflect operating cost changes at the distribution level; (iii)
       electricity produced by state-owned hydro power plants which i s sold into the market,is
       priced at levels that send appropriate signals o f scarcity and water value so as not to
       distort wholesale market price signals.        In addition, the regulator should approve
       investment programs consistent with establishedperformance targets.

(d)    Transition to compliance with European internal market and environmental
       standards - Turkey is committed to the principles o f the Athens memorandum, even
       though it did not sign the Treaty in October 2005.             Although Turkey has begun
       implementing fundamental structural reforms in its power sector, some o f which are far
       more advanced than required from the EU's perspective, there are several areas, such as
       the timeframe for complete retail market opening that Turkey has reservations on, for
       good reasons.      Turkey has already allowed significant retail market opening with
       eligibility for consumers whose annual consumption exceeds 6.0 GWh (this i s more than

                                                  3

        30% o f the total Turkish market). Turkey i s perhaps second only to Romania in the
        degree o f market opening amongst all SEE countries.         The results have been positive
        from the point o f view o f attracting new capacity and ensuring better supply quality for
        these consumers.      However, in order to free up all the existing consumers, several
        fundamental changes are required in the sector, most critical among these being the
        improvement in distribution system losses and payment discipline. The Government i s
        currently preparing for the privatization o f distribution, which i s seen as an important
        solution for these improvements. Privatization, however, has been delayed for several
        reasons, chief among them being the delays increation o f the electricity market, and the
        finalization o f a privatization mechanism that i s consistent with the market structure and
        operation, as well as legally permissible.

        A key area where Turkey has reservationsis with regard to compliance with the timetable
        in the Treaty to meet EU environmental standards.             In July 2005 EU consultants
        produced a report on Turkey's investment needs in order for it to be in compliance with
        the EU Large Combustion Plant Directive which limits emissions by these plants
        (Directive 2001/80/EC). Almost all o f the plants covered by the Directive are thermal
        power plants and the estimated cost o f bringing them into compliance with the EU
        Directive i s 1.5- 1.9 Billion Euro (US$ 1.8-2.3 Billion).       This is a large investment
        requirement for Turkey, and, in the absence of concessional financing, will require a
        number of years to implement, given the lack o f adequate fiscal space for incremental
        investment.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

Th World Bank's support under the proposed Electricity Generation Rehabilitation and
Restructuring Project i s predicated on four elements o f critical importance to the economy and the
         .
sector. These are to:

         ...Achieve security o f supply over the medium-term (specifically energy shortages in
            the 2009-20 10period).
            Prevent further deterioration and enhance value of an important state asset.
            Improve environmental quality and environmental compliance.
            Advance the implementation o f reforms in the electricity generation sector in a
            manner consistent with the overall reform program.

Achievingsecurityof supplyover the mediumterm
As noted above and discussed indetail in the economic analysis inAnnex 9, Turkey is likely to
face growing shortages of energy in the 2009-2010 period depending on the pace of growth in
demand. Large scale private sector investments innew generation capacity are not occurring at
the required pace largely because the competitive market system i s still in trial stage and the
distribution sector i s still in the process o f being restructured for subsequent privatization.
Furthermore, the Government has constraints on the provision o f guaranteed long-term off-take
agreements. The rehabilitation o f existing generation capacity by EUAS i s therefore, considered
the fastest alternative for increasing necessary energy supplies.       The economic and financial
analyses demonstrate that the rehabilitation o f Af9in-Elbistan A power plant i s the least cost
alternative for incremental generation and can be completed in about 2.5-3 years.           Through
engaging inthis rehabilitationproject therefore, the Bank would support one o f the most critical
investments in the sector at this stage. Inparallel the World Bank i s supporting the Government
indevisingprivate-public options to bringinginnew capacity over the medium term ina manner
consistent with the market structure.


                                                 4

Prevent further deterioration and enhance value of an important state asset
Af$in-Elbistan A power plant requires urgent rehabilitation. It has deteriorated significantly and
pre-maturely owing to a lack o f maintenance management and investment which was exacerbated
due to operational responsibility uncertainties from 1998-2001             '.  The rehabilitation project will
stem further deterioration by putting in improved operating and maintenance practices, and will
extend the life o f the plant significantly.

Improve environmentalquality and compliance
The project will include investments which will substantially reduce dust and particulate
emissions, a significant problem in the area.              These investments will bring the plant into
compliance with Turkish and most international standards. In addition, through its dialog with
the Government, the Bank has helped accelerate a review o f SO2pollution controls on existing
thermal plants, which has led to the Government to provide a reasonable transition period to
implement flue gas desulphurization units (FGDs), provided that such plants continue to meet air
quality standards.

Advance the implementationof reforms inthe generation sector
The reform components o f the project will support the Government in restructuring the
generation sector in a manner consistent with the overall reformprogram. The project can focus
on several aspects o f financial, accounting, operational and organizational restructuring which
will have to be completed to establish the generation companies (Gencos) and prepare them for
privatization. Based on the conclusions of the supply security work being carried out inparallel,
the Bank will also provide assistance to explore options for bringing in additional generation
consistent with the evolving competitive market over the medium term.

Synergies with the World Bank Energy Programin Turkey
From the perspective o f the World Bank's energy program in Turkey, the proposed Electricity
Generation Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project i s an important part o f the Bank's ongoing
lending and advisory support to the Turhsh energy sector (See Annex 2). The overall assistance
o f the Bank supports the implementationo f structural reforms, bridges gaps in electricity and gas
service delivery needs during the transition, and assists in meeting EU integration challenges.
This loan inparticular will support reforms inthe generation sector.


3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

The electricity reform strategy o f the TurkishGovernment, which is formalized inthe Electricity
Market Law o f February 2001 and the Strategy Paper o f March 2004, envisages the restructuring
of the electricity sector and the eventual privatization o f the distribution and generation
businesses over the medium term. The privatization o f distribution, and the restructuring o f the
generation business into separate companies, has been delayed. This in turn i s affecting the
implementation o f the competitive market. Through the project, the Bank will assist in the
restructuring o f the generation sector, thus supporting ultimately the successful transition to a
competitive market.

The Project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Turkey, and i s listed in
the Progress Report for the CAS for Turkey for the period FY 2004-07 (Report No. 33995-TU,
dated November 8,2005).


'This was the period when a Concession contract for the plant was signed with a private operator but not implemented
owing to inability to reach agreement on commercial and operational parameters.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lending instrument

This project will use a Specific Investment Loan (SIL). The loan will be borrowed directly by
EUAS, under a sovereign guarantee fiom       the Republic o f Turkey. The loan will be a variable
spread loan (VSL) with level repayments o f principal, and a 15-year maturity including a grace
                     -
period o f 5-years.

2. Project development objective and key indicators

Project development objective:
     To improve supply security during the reform transition and restructure the state-
     owned generationbusinessinto corporatizedentities.

Achievement of these objectives will be monitored through the following indicators:
    (a) Progress inrehabilitationo f Afyin-Elbistan A Power Plant;
    (b) Progress in creation of generation companies (Gencos) from EUAS and finalization o f
        transitional contracts with distributioncompanies; and
    (c) Improvement indust emission levels by the Afyin Elbistan A Plant.

3. Project components

The Project has two components (Table B.1below shows summarized cost estimates):

Component 1-Afyin-Elbistan-A Rehabilitation
The main component o f this project i s the rehabilitation o f Afyin-Elbistan A Power Plant. The
Afyin Elbistan generation complex which includes Afyin ElbistanA and the newly commissioned
Afyin Elbistan B, is the largest thermal generation complex in Turkey. Afyin Elbistan A has a
capacity o f 1,355 MW (3x340 MW + 1x335 MW) and its four unitswere commissioned between
1984 and 1987. Performance o f the Afyin Elbistan A unitsinterms o f efficiency and availability
has deteriorated sharply because o f inadequate maintenance. Current available capacity i s about
85% o f its original installed name-plate capacity.

This component will include:

(a) Repair, replacement and upgrade of the power plant systems to restore reliability,
    availability, power output and improve plant efficiency.
(b) Implementationof environmentalprotectionsystems and monitoring-new electrostatic
    precipitators (ESPs) will be installed to reduce and bring dust and particulate emissions
    within the Turkish Emission limits. Power plant dust emission from Afyin Elbistan A is the
    most significant environmental problem from the complex.              In addition, continuous
    environmental monitoring and data logging equipment will be provided and implemented.
    Environmental monitoringpractices will be revised and training will be provided.
(c) Improvementsin plant operation and maintenance practicesthat are critical to keep the
    plant in good operating condition with high availability after rehabilitation.    These will
    include procedures and systems for: equipment monitoring; historical data analysis for
    predictive maintenance; and maintenance scheduling. In addition, staff training programs to
    enhance operational and maintenance practices will be implemented.


                                                 6

(d) Implementationof control systems to meet UCTE standardsfor primaryand secondary
     frequency control - these systems would allow the power plant to meet the standards
     established by the Union for the Coordination o f Transmission o f Electricity in Europe
     (UCTE).     Meeting these standards would help Turkey in being certified to operate
     synchronously with the South East European Electricitynetwork.
This component will also include support services for project implementation. This will be in
additionto the project management services that will be provided by RWEInternational.

Component 2 - Support for Financial and Operational Restructuring of the Generation
Business
This component will focus on supporting EUAS in restructuring its generation business into
financially and operationally viable portfolio generation companies and a hydro corporation.
This work will create the basis for undertaking the future privatization o f these generation
entities. The PHRD grant for the preparation o f this Project has been utilized to begin this work.
Consultants have analyzed different portfolio configurations based on criteria such as fuel mix,
load following capabilities and financial viability, and have also prepared draft transition
contracts between GENCOs and TETAS/ distribution companies.                Based on this work, the
Government has decided on 6 portfolio companies, and these have been earmarked as separate
units within EUAS, in addition to the residual EUAS Hydro. The Project proposes to assist in
completing this work, focusing on aspects o f financial and operational restructuring o f the
companies to create them as viable business units.

The Project will also provide support, if necessary, to EUAS and the Government to implement
mechanisms to address generation supply security needs in the period beyond 2008. The initial
work on assessing options and strategies i s being funded through separate grant funds.

FinancingPlan
The proposedBank loan will finance the main rehabilitation contract. This contract will cover all
the major critical aspects o f the rehabilitation included in Component 1 such as the rehabilitation
o f the boiler and firing system, the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), the main cooling water and
condensate water system (covered under the Balance o f Plant Mechanical), control and
instrumentation, and ash and coal handling.

The remaining portions o f Component 1will be financed from EUAS' operating and maintenance
budget since these elements are either currently ongoing or are logically covered by the annual
maintenance budget. The most important sub-component covered by EUAS is the ongoing
rehabilitation o f the steam turbines and generators. EUAS' maintenance budget will also cover
elements such as the switchgear, transformers and other general instrument supplies (Balance o f
Plant Electrical), cooling tower coating and reinforcement, and environment monitoring. The
bidding documents for the main contract will contain suitable provisions to reflect the fact that
some works are ongoing, and that EUAS will provide some components from its own resources.

The operational and maintenance practice improvement services, and specialized project
management services will be funded through the Bank loan.

Under component 2 the Bank loan will be used for services to facilitate the financial and
operational restructuring o f EUAS in to multiple generation companies. In addition, provision
will be made under component 2 to utilize the earmarked resources to implement mechanisms to
address generation supply security needs inthe medium-term.

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

Project design and preparation have benefited from the extensive experience that the Bank has in
developing large infrastructure investment operations, and specifically in rehabilitation o f
generating plants. These include:

(a) Comprehensive feasibility and technical review                    The scope o f the rehabilitation
    component has been developed based on a comprehensive feasibility study and technical
   review. The initial pre-feasibility study was done by Chubu Electric from Japan in 2004.
    This study established the broad scope o f the rehabilitation needed based on a technical and
    economic assessment.            This work clearly established the economic benefits o f the
   rehabilitation. The Bank's power engineers reviewed the pre-feasibility report and assisted
    EUAS in defining the terms of reference for the detailed engineering study. The detailed
    engineering study was undertaken by RWE Consulting Engineers, Germany. This consulting
    engineering firm i s an affiliate o f one o f the largest electric utilities inEurope, which operates
    a number o f lignite fired power plants and mines, and also has significant experience in
    lignite plant rehabilitation. The detailed engineering study provided a full assessment o f the
    power plant systems which require rehabilitation. The detailed feasibility study was reviewed
    by the Bank's power engineering team.              This review provided important inputs to the
    decisions on what i s required and what i s optional, and enabled EUAS to finalize the scope
    and cost estimates for rehabilitation.

(b) Focus on addressing environmentalissues systemically The EIA for this project analyzed
    the current and forecast (modeled) performance o f the plant withregardto sulfur dioxide and
    dust emissions, and their impact on ambient air quality, and the requirement for an FGD.
    Largely as a result o f this analysis, the Government has carried out a review o f existing
    thermal power plants and evaluated the alternative o f installing FGDs on them. The
                                                     8

   Government has processed a regulation which will provide each thermal plant with a
   transition period for implementingthe FGD. As a result, Afvin A will have a transition o f 5
   years for installing the FGD (This i s considered as the next phase o f the project).         The
   rehabilitation o f the plant will improve the plant's environmental compliance especially inthe
   area o f dust emission, which has been identified, during public consultations, as the most
    significant environmental problemfrom the power station inthe vicinity.

(c) Flexibility in policy dialogue and recognition of macroeconomic priorities               The
   project has chosen flexibility in carrying out the policy dialogue on reforms in the Turkish
    electricity sector, as opposed to the use o f hard policy conditionality within the loan.
    Ongoing loans carry conditionality, and in recognition o f the fact that Turkey, as an EU
    candidate country, i s in the midst o f adopting the EU Acquis on Energy, separate Bank
    conditionality in this loan was not considered critical. The project is therefore designed to
    support the Bank's overall dialogue on the reform program which i s consistent with the EU
   Acquis and being carried out inparallel (supported by ongoing loans and grants).

(d) Adaptation of procurement arrangements to suit specific circumstances EUAS and the
    Bank team evaluated the option of carrying out the rehabilitation using a number o f
    procurement packages, covering respectively, the firing system, piping, balance o f plant
    mechanical, balance o f plant electrical, electrostatic precipitator, control and instrumentation,
    ash and coal handling, civil works, and plant chemistry. This option was deemed unsuitable
    and EUAS and the Bank team chose to adopt a single supply and installation contract for the
    entire rehabilitation (except the turbines which are being rehabilitated separately by the
    original manufacturer of the turbines under a continuing service agreement), because this
    gives better control over implementation progress, and it reduces problems due to
    weaknesses, or delays, inintegration across different packages.

5. Alternatives ConsideredandReasonsfor Rejection

The following alternatives to the rehabilitationo f Afvin-Elbistan A were considered:

(a) The construction o f a new gas fired combined cycle power plant. Such a plant could be built
    rapidly but still not as rapidly as the rehabilitation o f Afgin Elbistan A, and hence again
    would not respond to the immediate supply security situation. Generation from this plant was
    also expected to be more expensive than from a rehabilitated Afvin-Elbistan A (see Annex 9).

(b) Another alternative that was consideredinvolved the construction o fa new lignite-fired plant
    at Af9in-Elbistan. The economic analysis for the project (Annex 9) however, showed that
    such a plant would be more expensive than the rehabilitation project, and would take a much
    longer time for commissioning. The Government therefore gave priority to the rehabilitation
    of Afgin ElbistanA, and accordingly requestedthe Bank for support.



C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements(ifapplicable)

Duringproject preparation the Japanese Government provided a PHRD grant for US$ 600,000
which was used for the initial feasibility study and for preparation o f the EIA for the project. The
Government o f Japan has also provided funds for the construction o f Afvin-Elbistan B power
plant, adjacent to Afvin-Elbistan A. This former plant shares some o f the same infrastructure as
Afvin Elbistan A. In addition, PPIAF grants and the Spanish Trust Fund are being used for
                                                  9

supporting the overall reform program, which also includes support for the initial work on
restructuring of generation, and preparation o f transition contracts between the generation and
trading businesses.

2. Institutional and implementation arrangements

The project will be implemented by EUAS and a special Project Management Team (PMT) has
been established to oversee the implementation. Further, for Component 2, there i s likely to be
significant oversight from the Ministry o f Energy and Natural Resources. The rehabilitationwill
be carried out by one contractor who will be overseen by the PMT aided by EUAS' consultants,
RWE, who will report to the PMT and EUAS top management.                  In addition, there will be
considerable focus given to the monitoring o f the environmental impacts o f the project and the
plant in general, either as part o f the implementation consultant contract, or as a separate contract.
Because o f the importance o f this project to EUAS and to Turkey, EUAS management will
follow its progress closely.

It is likely that duringproject implementation, EUASwill be restructured into separate portfolio
GENCOs. Inthis case, AfSin-Elbistan A will be transferred to the portfolio company which will
contain the Afgin-Elbistan generation complex, hereinafter referred to as Afgin GENCO. The
responsibility for rehabilitation and supervision will be transferred to this GENCO. The PMT,
with adequate staff in Afgin GENCO, will be suitably enhanced to ensure that implementation
does not suffer. The Bank loan will remain with the successor company o f EUAS, EUAS Hydro,
with aback-to-back loan fromEUASHydroto Afgin GENCO.

There i s also a possibility that while the rehabilitation i s ongoing, the operations o f the Afgin-
Elbistan A power plant may be transferred to a private company, under an existing concession
contract that i s however disputed at this time (See Section C.5 on Critical risks later for more
details on this issue). In this eventuality, the Government will ensure that the rehabilitation i s
completed as planned, and that the new operator will ensure the continued operation and
maintenance o f the plant.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomesh-esults

The PMT, with the assistance o f the implementation consultant, will monitor progress against the
agreed performance indicators specified in Annex 3.           The PMT will provide, on a quarterly
basis, 45 days after the end o f each quarter, consolidated reports on project implementation
progress in the Bank's FMR format. The Bank will conduct regular supervision missions about
once a quarter for the first several years while the project is under implementation. The PMT will
prepare a detailed mid-term report to serve as the basis for a project mid-term review. The PMT
will also help prepare the Borrower's contribution to an Implementation Completion Report
(ICR), so that the Bank could complete the ICR within six months o fthe closing date o fthe Loan.
The ICR would involve a complete assessment o f project costs and benefits, project execution
and performanceso f the parties involved.

4. Sustainability

The project i s considered sustainable for the following reasons:

(a)      Long-TermCompetitiveness- the rehabilitation extend the plant's economic life by at
         least 20 years and result in AfSin-Elbistan A being one o f the least cost sources o f base
         load power in Turkey. Apart from being an important facility to provide incremental
         capacity and energy to mitigate anticipated supply shortfalls in the next few years, this
                                                  10

          plant will be preferentially dispatched over the long-term, since it will have low
          incremental costs and therefore will rank very highinthe merit order.
(b)       Experienced Project Manager to Supervise Implementation -During implementation,
          EUAS will be assisted by RWE in supervision o f the works. RWEis amongst the most
          experienced consulting engineers on lignite plant maintenance and rehabilitation and this
          i s expected to speed decision making on technical issues and choices that arise duringthe
          rehabilitationprocess, thereby reducing delays and maintainthe project on schedule.
(c)       Focus on O&M Practice Improvement - The project also includes in its scope,
           improvement in O&M practices in the plant, which will ensure that the plant i s well-
          maintained after rehabilitation.
(d)       Adequacy of Fuel Reserves - The lignite reserves at AfSin-Elbistan are approximately
           2.6 billion tons and both the AfSin-Elbistan A and B power plants together, operating at
           full capacity, are projected to use around 37 million tons per year. Thus, the reserves at
          AfSin-Elbistan will be more than adequate for the two existing plants and also
           accommodate further capacity expansion.
(e)        Completion of Rehabilitation by EUAq - the Government and EUAS will ensure that
          the rehabilitationi s completed by EUAS by 2009 to ensure that the needed incremental
           energy i s available to meet potential supply shortfalls.

 5. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

        Risk            Risk rating                               Mitigation Measure


 A.l Disruption/             N        The restructuring of EUAS into portfolio generation companies (Gencos)
 Delay in                             may carry the risk of causing delays in the implementationof the project.
 implementation                       The scope of the portfolio gencos has already been defined and they are
 owingto on-going                     gradually expected to become operationally more independent from the
 restructuringof                      EUAg holding company. The Project ManagementTeam, with adequate
 EUASinto                             staff in Afsin GENCO, will be suitably enhanced to ensure that
 portfolio Gencos.                    implementationdoes not suffer. Further, since the timely completion of
                                      rehabilitationis very critical due to security of supply considerations, the
                                      Governmentwill monitorimplementationclosely.


 A.2 Delay due to            N        As the timely rehabilitationof Afsin ElbistanA is a strategic priority of the
 ongoing litigation.                  Government to address medium-term supply security concerns, the
                                      Government has been actively discussing the resolution of the on-going
                                      dispute with the private concessionaire. The efforts by both parties to
                                      achieve successful resolution without impacting the rehabilitation,
                                      indicates that the risk of the on-going dispute impacting project
                                      implementationis moderate.
~
 A.3 Delayowing              N        The scope of rehabilitation may increase owing to the condition of the
 to increased                         boiler, in particular, being worse than currently assessed. This is not a
 scopeof                              major risk. While some scope change is likely the risk of delay is not
 rehabilitation                       deemed very large.        The contract will have adequate flexibility to
                                      accommodate scope change and the conservative cost estimates will
                                      cover such increases. Most importantly,these changes will be identified
                                      early in the process, allowing additional equipment to be ordered,
                                      delivered and installed to meet the rehabilitation schedule.             The
                                      procurement process will result in a highly-qualified contractor being
                                      selected, and EUAS will use RWE to ensure that contract progress is
                                      routinely monitored.
 A.4 Financingof             M        The FGD is an expensive investment,estimated at US$ 250 million, and
 the FGD                              may not be justified on economic parameters alone, given the remaining
                                      plant life even after rehabilitation. MoEF has prepared a regulation
                                      providing derogation from implementing an FGD to the Afqin-Elbistan A
                                      plant for 5 years, among all other thermal plants. The FGD will thus be
                                      installed at the end of the derogation period, in the absence of a further
                                                      11

                                         extension of time, and financing will have to be arranged for this
                                         investment. The team will assist the Government in finding grants or
                                         subsidized financina for this eauipment. in order to help reduce the costs.
~~~~~~
4.5 Inadequate                M          The project includes a significant level of support for improving operations
maintenance                              and maintenance of the plant after rehabilitation. It is expected that this
                                         will assist in ensuring that the plant continues to operate efficiently. This
                                         risk therefore, is moderate.
A.6 Constraint on             N          Based on a study by RWE on mine extension for Afgin-Elbistan B which
mine capacity                            currently uses the mine for the A plant, EUAS has decided to extend the
                                         existing mine over the next 2-3 years. Potential constraints on mine
                                         capacity are possible, but this is not a big risk, since significant
                                         investments in developing and extending the mine are already underway,
                                         and the lignite seam has significant reserves.
4.7 Procurement               H          EUAS does not have experience of using the Bank's procurement
                                         guidelines and procedures. The main contract under the project is also
                                         expected to be a very large and complex contract. EUAS therefore, will
                                         use the two-stage bidding process, and the Bank's procurement staff
                                         have been providing training and significant guidance on the bid
                                         documentation. EUAS is also being assisted by RWE in the preparation
                                         of the specifications and the bid document.
B. Financial and market-related issues
B.l Impact of                 N          Given the high debt burden carried by the Afgin GENCO (due largely to
competition                              the debt acquired in the construction of Afgin-Elbistan B), it is possible
                                         that prior to rehabilitation, the costs of Afgin GENCO will be
                                         uncompetitive. This may in turn imply that Afgin GENCO will be at risk in
                                         the market. This risk is being mitigated by ensuring reasonable transition
                                         contracts. Further, once the rehabilitation is complete, Afgin GENCO is
                                         likely to be at an advantage vis-a-vis the competition, because its costs,
                                         and hence, the required tariff, will reduce significantly (See Annex 9 for
                                         the financial forecasts for the company).
B.2 Impact of                 M          As mentioned above, Afgin GENCO carries about US$ 1.4 billion of debt
significant                              associated with the Afgin B plant. The rehabilitation will require additional
outstanding debt                         debt. Afgin GENCO is thus likely to require a higher initial tariff than other
                                         GENCOs. However, as discussed above, after rehabilitation, the tariff
                                         reauired will be reduced, and this risk is therefore likelv to be low.
 ~~
B.3 Financial                 H          EUAS had about US$ 2 billion of outstanding receivables in 2004. WhG
constraints on                           these have not hampered its ability to invest largely because the
account of                               investment program has been severely curtailed, this is still a serious
continued non-                           problem afflicting the entire sector. While it is difficult for this project to
payment of EUAS                          mitigate this risk entirely, the Government is working towards improving
bills, inadequate                        payments by Government departments, which are the main defaulters,
tariffs. etc.                            through various measures including legislative means. Treasury is also
                                         working with MENR and the utilities to resolve the issue going forward.
                                         The present regulatory regime is considered robust and ELSA$' tariffs
                                         cover operating and debt servicing costs.        Upon the restructuring of
                                         EUAS, the existing market arrangements will be replaced by transition
                                         contracts with the distribution companies and TETAS, with tariffs set so
                                         as to allow continued recovery of costs. Upon the establishment of the
                                         balancing market, EUAS companies are expected to be competitive,
                                         given their cost profiles and given that demand is expected to continue
                                         growing at a fast pace (See Annex 9).
Overall Project               S          Based on risks discussed above, the overall project risk is assessed to be
 Risk                                    "Substantial".

World Bank Financingof the AfSin-ElbistanA Power Plant-The Government entered into a
concession contract with a private company in December 1999 for the Afvin-Elbistan A Thermal
Power Plant, pursuant to a 1994 Council o f Ministers Decree. The scope o f the concession
includedrehabilitationo f the existing four units, construction o f two new units at the site, and the
operation o f the plant for 20 years.       However, the concession contract could not be made
operational as the principal implementation agreements (i.e. the energy sales agreement and the
transfer contract) could not be finalized.

Owing to the inability o f the two parties to finalize the agreements, the private company filed a
lawsuit with the Council o f State against the successors o f TEAS (ie. EUAS and TETAS
respectively responsible for the transfer contract and energy sales agreement), stating an implicit
denial from EUASand TETAS to sign the contracts. The Council o f State upheldthe statement o f
the private company in February 2004. Both TETAS and EUAS (as successors o f TEAS) have
appealed this judgment and the judicial process i s still inprogress.

The Government considers the rehabilitation to be o f paramount importance given the supply
security issues and given the requirement to improve the plant's environmental compliance. It i s
therefore a priority investment included in the Government's investment plan for 2006, and the
Government aims to ensure that EUAS completes the planned rehabilitation to mitigate supply
problems that are forecast in2009/10.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

(a) Economic Analysis
Supply and Demand Projections Electricity consumption inTurkey grew over 8% per year in
each o f the decades from 1970-2000. However, it has slowed during the past five years in spite o f
continuing rapid growth in GDP. Since the deep recession o f 2001 electricity consumption has
grown 5.9 % per year (still a fairly highrate by international standards) while GDP has increased
7.2% per year. Two demand forecasts have been prepared by the Government. The official
forecast, which i s based on a 5.5% GDP growth, projects an 8.3% per year average growth in
electricity consumption.     This forecast is based on a standard electricity forecasting model
(MAED) which uses GDP growth to estimate electricity consumption growth and is consistent
with the past three decades. An alternative but unofficial government forecast calls for about
6.3% per year average growth in electricity consumption using the same GDP growth rates but
altering the MAED model to better reflect a shift o f Turkish manufacturing towards less energy
intensive industries. Table D.1below shows these demand forecasts.

While Turkey currently has adequate generating capacity, very little new capacity is due on line
after the end o f this year. Capacity i s currently expected to rise less than 1%per year from 2005
to 2010. Moreover, while additional major new plants could be announced in the future, no such
plants are anticipated and given the long lead times for large coal, lignite or hydro plants,
construction needs to start immediately for completion in 2010. In addition, given the large role
o f hydro plants (35% o f total capacity) the Turhsh electricity supply situation depends very
heavily on whether it i s a dry or wet year. In dry years, hydro power generation can be 40%
below normal hydropoweryears due to the lack o frainfall.

As a result o f the continuing growth in electricity demand and the slow growth in generating
capacity, Turkey i s expected to face supply shortages between 2008 and 2011 depending on the
assumptions made. Under the official Government forecast and assuming a dry year, Turkey
would have an electricity shortage in2008. Under the low demand case and dry conditions or the
official case and normal hydro conditions, the shortage would occur in2009 while under the low
demand case and normal hydro conditions the shortage occurs in 2011. The rehabilitation o f
AfSin Elbistandelays these shortages by around a year.

Least-cost generationoption The economic analysis shows that the least-cost and fastest
ways to provide additional electricity in time to avert shortages i s for EUAS to rehabilitate the
Af9in ElbistanA power plant. Giventhe poor condition o fthe plant, rehabilitation would initially
provide about 5.1 TWh o f incremental generation rising to around 8 TWh. This i s based on the
assumption that the plant would not be able to continue operating for very long without
rehabilitation.

The cost o f electricity from the rehabilitatedAf9in- Elbistan A Plant is estimated at about 3.8 U S
centskWh on a levelized basis including the FGD. These costs are in economic terms, and the
levelized tariff i s discounted at a conservative 10%. Electricity from a new gas fired combined
cycle power plant i s estimated at about 4.4 U S cents/ kwhon a levelized basis and importswould
currently cost around 4.6 US cents/ kwhalthoughthey may not be available inadequate amounts
inthe longer term.

The rehabilitation i s expected to be completed in a little over 2-3 years after contract award,
implying that the rehabilitated plant can be back online by 2009 - it is unlikely that any other
option can result inthis quick a turnaround.

Inaddition to these significantbenefits, the rehabilitationof the plant will also have significant
environmental and social benefits. Once the rehabilitation is complete, it i s expected that the
extremely high level of dust produced by the plant when it is operating at capacity would be
reducedto well below the current emission limits. The smaller particles wouldbe reducedwhich
would mitigate any adverse health impacts on the local population. Also the rehabilitation will
reduce the emission o f large dust particles which, while they are less o f a health hazard, the local
population says are damaging their crops. These benefits however, have not been quantified in
determining the ERR o f the project.


                                                    15

The ERR for the project depends on the value assigned to the additional electricity produced as a
result o f the rehabilitation o f AfSin-Elbistan A. Ifthe electricity generation from the rehabilitated
Afgin A is valued at the cost of unserved energy (electricity), usually taken to be between 40 U S
cents per kWh and US$ 1.00 per kWh in Europe, then the ERR i s very high and the payback
period i s about 4 months, which is however, a notional calculation. More realistically, if the
value o f the electricity i s taken to be the estimated level o f wholesale prices in Turkey after a
functioning market i s established, which i s about 5.O U S centskWh, the ERR from rehabilitating
the plant is 25%. The ERRwill be evenhigher ifthe value o fthe electricity is taken to be the cost
o f electricity generation from single cycle gas turbines (around 5.9 U S centskwh) which would
be the alternative for many industries, or diesel generators (around 8-8.5 U S centskwh). (Refer
to Annex 9 for more details)

(b) FinancialAnalysis

The Government has decided to create 7 companies from EUAS (including the successor
company o f EUAS, EUAS Hydro, which will operate the large hydros). One o f these companies
- Afgin GENCO will contain the Afgin-Elbistan A and B plants. AfSin GENCO also includes
                   -
the Hopa (Fuel Oil) and Altinkaya, Derbent, and Karkamis (Hydro) plants, with the total installed
capacity o f 3,548 MW before rehabilitation, and 3,788 MW after rehabilitation.              Annex 9
contains a detailed discussion o f the historical and forecast financial condition o f EUAS, as well
as the estimated future financial condition o f AfSin GENCO. The timeline for the creation o f
Afgin GENCO has not been finalized, but the accounts o f the company have been separated and
these are usedto forecast the financial condition.

Historical financial performance of EUAS EUAS'Sprofitability has been reasonable through
the period since its creation in 2001. The large increase inrevenue (and average sales per unit)
from year to year i s primarily because o f the impact o f favorable changes in the generation mix,
and not because o f an increase in tariffs. EUAS' cash flow, due to its receivables being at a
significant level and increasing somewhat, i s a concern for the future (see discussion on arrears in
Annex 9). Inthe past, EUAS has managed primarily due to its non-payment to suppliers and due
to the low level o f investments that have been permitted by the Government.

Receivables and Payables Outstanding trade receivables have accumulated to about 9 months'
o f sales by endo f 2004 (although EUASbooks also show an amount o f about US$900 million as
Other Receivables, which are dues from TEAS carried over from the time o f its restructuring and
includes dues for electricity sales). EUAS has financed these large receivables with payables,
which have accumulated to over a year o f fuel purchases. Again, the payables are with public
economic enterprises that supply fuel, such as TKI, TTK and BOTAS. Currently the longer
payable period allows EUAS to generate sufficient cash flow, but also is a risk factor inthe future
cash flow and financial projections as these entities work to collect their receivables.

The single-largest financial concern for EUAS i s its poor collection efficiency, almost entirely
due to the collection problems at TEDAS. For TEDAS the main defaulters are government
agencies such as municipalities, although there are cases o f private consumers who have large
accounts outstanding as well. The Government i s evaluating several options for addressing the
problem o f arrears including: legislative measures to enable utilities to enforce collections against
municipalities and government agencies, and settlement o f cross-dues among government
agencies. The outcome of these attempts however, i s difficult to quantify at this stage, but the
Bank will remain indialog with the Government on this issue.

Forecast financial performance of EUAS The impacts from the rehabilitation project are
factored in (these impacts are discussed separately, while discussing the finances o f Afgin

                                                   16

GENCO). The forecasts are based on conservative assumptions regardingcommercial efficiency
improvements such as collections. N o significant gains from privatization o f distribution or
generation are factored in. The forecasts also assume that EUAS will no longer be able to defer
its fuel and other purchases, and that payables will reduce significantly over time. Due to the
forecast electricity shortage in 2009, EUAS will have to ramp up generation from its high-cost
plants which will raise variable costs.

EUASwill as a result need to manage its cash flow due to the conservative assumptions, as well
as its debt service requirements. The forecasts show that EUAS i s able to maintain reasonable
financial health, and i s able to service its workmg capital and debt servicing requirements.

Investments The investment requirement for EUAS is large in the medium term, with most o f
the investments in rehabilitation and maintenance. The investment needs in the next five years
amount to more than US$2 billion, adding further to the existing debt service burden.

Forecast FinancialPerformance of Afyin GENCO Afqin GENCO includes Af$n ElbistanA
and B, Hopa (Fuel Oil), AltinkayalDerbentiKarkamis (Hydro) plants, with a total effective
capacity o f about 3,400 MW. After rehabilitation, the effective installedcapacity will increase to
3,788 MW, as the effective installed capacity o f Afvin Elbistan A will increase from 1,000 MW
to 1,360 MW. The forecasts for Af$n GENCO are prepared on the basis o f the same
assumptions as inthe case o f EUAS forecasts.

The main risk that Af9in GENCO faces i s its large debt service liability and required investment
amount inthe near future. The large liability i s due to the construction o f Af$n ElbistanB lignite
plant (commissioned in 2005), which was financed through a JBIC syndicated loan o f JPY 5.85
billion (approximately US$494 million), and other funds. Additionally, it i s expected that a large
amount o f other investments will be required by Afvin GENCO in the near future.                 Major
investments are the lignite mine expansion (EUR 424 million) and FGD installation in Af$in
Elbistan A (EUR 181 million). As a result, the debt servicing obligation (interest and principal
repayment) i s expected to increase fromUS$ 121million in2005 to US$293 million in2015.

Debt service requirements and assumptions on trade receivable and payable (average annual cash
outflow o f US$33 million) poses a significant burden for AfSin GENCO. However, its cash flow
is expected to remain reasonably comfortable due to the high depreciation and increase in
generation output as result o f the rehabilitation. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio i s expected to
be at 2.6 in 2008, but will settle down at 1.3 from 2013 onwards, owing to the increased debt
repayments. The leveraging i s also at a conservative 0.6 in 2006 but increases to 0.7 in 2009, as
result o fthe investments above and their financing.

The rehabilitationi s expectedto increase the effective installedcapacity of Af$n Elbistan A plant
from 1,000 MW to 1,360 MW. It is also expected to not only improve the efficiency o f the plant,
but also to improve the consistency o f the lignite fuel through improvements inthe lignite feeder
system.


2. Technical

EUAS has carried out a pre-feasibility study which done by Chubu Electric, and this was
followed up by a detailed engineering study which was undertaken by RWE International,
Germany. This consulting engineering firm i s an affiliate o f one o f the largest electric utilities in
Europe, which operates a number o f lignite fired power plants and mines, and also has significant
experience in lignite plant rehabilitation.       The project i s therefore, based on very sound

                                                   17

engineering work, and has been reviewed and supported by Bank power engineers. The project i s
considered satisfactorily prepared from a technical standpoint.

Each rehabilitation sub-component was selected based on an economic and technical assessment
o f options ranging from doing no rehabilitation, to repairinghenewing the system or replacingthe
system entirely. The finally selected scope was defined based on an overall least-cost solution
that would achieve a guaranteed power plant performance that the engineering contractors could
be held accountable to. The scopes o f the environmental pollution control systems were defined
based on regulatoryrequirements.

The rehabilitationwork i s expected to improve the plant performance as follows:
rn       Plant output o f each unit will be increased from about 260 MW net to 300 MW net;
rn       Capacity factor will be increased from 40% or below to 75%; and
rn       Net plant efficiency will be increased from 27% to 31% (30.6% with the FGD).

Performance parameters such as availability, steam output, boiler efficiency and auxiliary power
consumption will be guaranteed by the rehabilitationcontractor.

EUAS has considerable experience in thermal, and specifically lignite plants, and their
rehabilitation. EUAS has continuously carried out and supervised rehabilitations in their plants
over the past few years. The rehabilitation in this case will be carried out by an experienced
contractor selected under Bank procedures. The work will be overseen by the EUAS Project
Management Team aided by RWE. In addition, there will be considerable focus given to the
monitoring o f the environmental impacts o f the project and the plant in general, either as part o f
the implementation consultant contract, or as a separate contract.

Project costs are summarized in Annex 5. Cost estimates have been derived from the feasibility
study. The cost estimates are considered conservative, which is appropriate for a facility o f this
magnitude, and accordingly, include reasonable price as well as physical contingencies.


3. Fiduciary

The Bank's standard fiduciary requirements apply to this project. Procurement for the proposed
project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004; and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions
stipulated inthe Legal Agreement.

An assessment o f the financial management arrangements for the project was undertaken in
October 2005. The assessment determined that EUAS has financial management arrangements
acceptable to the Bank and these systems will be relied upon for project financial management
purposes. However the main system will be supplemented by excel sheets for project reporting
and monitoring on a foreign currency basis. There will be a designated account for the project to
assist disbursements from the World Bank loan. This account will be in Euro and will be located
in a government-owned commercial bank. The commercial bank will be selected by EUAS.
Payments to the contractors, suppliers and consultants for the project will be made from this
account (except direct payments).       See Annex 7 for further details on financial management
aspects.

EUAS will finance part o f the equipment for Component 1, taxes (except the withholding tax on
consulting services), interest during construction, land and contingencies. The Bank loan will

                                                   18

finance about 73% o f the total project cost since EUA$ will finance the taxes, VAT, interest
during construction, and other local expenses such as land (See Annex 4 and 5 for detailed
Project Costs).

4. Social

There are no major adverse social issues involved with the project. The project entails the
rehabilitation o f an existing plant, and no land acquisition i s required. The rehabilitation will
have a positive social impact since it will lower dust emissions by the plant very substantially
compared to what they would be if it were to operate at capacity without rehabilitating the ESPs.
This will help the localpopulation. Firstitwill reduce any potentialhealth impact. Second, it will
remove the problem o f large dust particles settling on crops which the local population has been
complaining about. Further, in the absence o f rehabilitation, the plant would gradually cease
operating, which would have an adverse impact in terms o f loss o f jobs and requirements for
ancillary services inthe area.

5. Environment

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):                  EUA$ used a PHRD grant for the
environmental impact assessment (EM), which was carriedout by a consortium comprising Cinar
and KEMA. Though TurkishEL4 regulations did not require an EIA for this project, the EIA
was carried out per Turkish and World Bank guidelines. The Ministry of Environment and
Forestry (MOEF)reviewed and approved the EIA on September 9,2005 (EMPositive Certificate
Issued). The EIA concluded that:
             The rehabilitation o f the ESPs on the main stack gas and the Bruden stacks i s
             essential to address the dust and particulate emission problems.
             The Af9in-Elbistan A Power Plant operating at full load after rehabilitatiodupgrade
             will meetboththe long-term and short-term Turkishair quality standards for SO2.

The Af8in-Elbistan A Power Plant operating at full load will however, not meet Turkish SO2
emission standards.     In the evaluation of the EIA by MoEF, it was recognized that plant
performance does not affect compliance with Turhsh air quality standards for SO2in the plant
vicinity. Since the plant exceeds emission standards for SOz,the Government has evaluated the
option o f installing an FGD on AfSin ElbistanA, along with all the other existing thermal plants.
MoEF has decided to provide each thermal plant with a transition period (derogation) for
complying with air pollution limits, and has prepared an amendment to the Regulation for the
Control o f Air Pollution Caused by Industrial Facilities. This amendment provides an extension
o f time by 5 years for installing the FGD in order to comply with SO2emission requirements.
Providing transition periods for FGD installations i s not unusual because o f the substantial
investment costs. The EU has granted such transition periods to candidate members such as
Romania(for 8 to 10years) as well as newlyjoined members, such as Poland (for 5-12 years).

Duringpublic consultations as part o f the EIA process, dust emissions were cited by the local
populace as the most significant environmental impact inthe vicinity o f the plant. The project
therefore, includes rehabilitation o f the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) which will reduce dust
emissions from current levels o f 400-6000 mg/Nm3to 100 mg/Nm3in accordance with Turhsh
regulations. The Turkish standard i s the same as the relevant EU standard as well as the World
Bank guidelines for dust emission for a plant with the size and fuel type such as that o f Af$n
Elbistan A - the ESPs are therefore designed to meet EU and World Bank standards on dust
emission.



                                                  19

The Af5in-Elbistan A plant uses local lignite, which has very high sulfur content. Currently, the
plant operations meet Turlush ambient air quality standards for SO2 in the area. Air quality
modeling results carried out as part o f the environmental assessment (EA) show that after
rehabilitation, AfSin Elbistan area airshed will continue to comply with Turlush short term and
long term limits. The Af$n Elbistan area airshed will also comply with EU standards and will
also be consistent with the World Bank indicators for good air quality (annual average
concentration above 80 pg/Nm3 i s considered as moderately degraded air quality; average
concentration above 100 pg/Nm3is considered as poor air quality)' in the impact area o f the
project. While over the project impact area, air quality i s within international standards and
guidelines, modeling indicates that at two locations out o f 12 villages inthe project impact area,
air quality falls outside the levels provided in the Bank guidelines, and that at an additional three
villages the air quality may not comply with the stricter WHO guidelines ( 5 0 ~ g / N m ~ )When the
                                                                                                 ~ .
FGD unit is installed at the end o f the transition period all international standards for ambient
levels o f sulfur dioxide will be in compliance. The current power station emissions of sulfw
dioxide (SO,) however, exceed Turkish regulations which specify an emission limit o f 1000
pgmm3.

Lignite mine extension The Af$n Elbistan A plant i s supplied by an existing mine at Kislakoy
near the plant. This mine currently has a capacity o f 18 Million tons per year           - it is currently
primarily supplyingthe B Power Plant because the A Plant i s operating at a very low level. The
mine i s an open pit mine which was built using World Bank funds in the 1970s. It has an
operational license from MENRand i s inspected periodically by various government agencies.
     (a) MENR inspects the mine to see whether it i s conforming with the Mining Law (which
         prescribes overburden and waste disposal guidelines);
     (b) The MinistryofLabor (MOL)carries out inspections for worker safety issues; and
     (c) MoEF inspections focus on adherence with environmental safeguards.
Overburden from the mine and the ash from the power plant are used as backfill inthe mine and
covered over with soil. Over 400,000 trees have been planted on the backfill area which i s now
wooded as a result.

After rehabilitation o f AfSin A, the existing mine will revert to supplyingthe A plant and EUAS
will expand the mine inorder to continue supplyinglignite to Af5inB.

Project construction activities will present minor potential environmental issues associated with
the movement o f men, equipment and materials. Typical issues are dust, exhaust gases from
combustion engines, noise, disposal o f materials (hazardous and non-hazardous), etc. All o f these
issues are of limited duration, confined to the plant boundaries, andor are readily managed with
standard good engineering and construction practices. During operation, environmental issues
are largely beneficial, particularly the benefits accrued with more efficient particulate removal.
When the FGD system i s installed, disposal o f gypsum may be an issue if markets in the
construction materials sector do not develop to the extent o f utilizing all the generated waste.
Depending on the FGD technology selected, water consumption and wastewater discharge are
potential environmental issues requiring effective mitigation. However, the gypsum is non-
hazardous and in fact, its alkaline matrix will effectively inhibitmobilization o f most trace metals
preventing their migration into the environment.

Country Economic Overview
       The Turkish economy has rebounded from the 2001 crisis which had serious
       economic and social impacts. By the end o f 2001, the currency had devalued by 50
       percent, nominal interest rates were about 100 percent, and the banking system had
       virtually collapsed.
       GNP growth has been strong since 2001 - 8 percent in 2002, 6 percent in 2003, 10
       percent in2004 and about 7.6 percent in2005. Inflation i s under control reaching single
       digits (7.7 percent) in2005, the lowest inTurkey for 35 years.
       Net public debt has decreased significantly - at the end o f 2004 it reached 64 percent
       o f GNP compared to 79% percent in2001.
       Several factors contributed to the improved macroeconomic performance - key
       amongst them are: strong fiscal discipline which has allowed the maintenance o f a large
       primary surplus on the order o f 6.5 percent o f GNP; on-going structural reform; and
       political stability since 2002.
       The EU's decision to open accession negotiations with Turkey in October 2005 -has
       been an important signal to financial markets and has created a firm anchor for the
       country's development and structural reforms inthe years ahead.

Impetus for Electricity Sector Reforms
   .
The economic crisis o f 2001 led to the crystallization and recognition o f several structural and
planning deficiencies inthe electricity sector, the most important o f which were:
       A build-up of public contingent liabilities as a result o f the Government guaranteeing
       debt for a substantial amount of privately financed generation capacity. These generation
       projects have imposed a heavy take-or-pay burden on the electricity system and have
   .   complicated the transition to a structure where the commercial risk can be shifted to
       private investors.
       A rising quasi-fiscal burden on the budget stemming from growing consumer non-
       payment and electricity theft problems at the distribution level.        The non-payments
       worsened as a consequence o f the economic crises. Although an attempt was made at
       offering private sector concessions for the distribution sector in the period 1999-2001,
       most o f these concessions involved guaranteed distribution margins with the supply risk
       borne by the Government. This approach was abandoned due to legal challenges to the
       approach and the nature o frisk sharing.
       Political influence on operating, planning and pricing decisions that made operational
       decision making more difficult.

ReformDirection-Electricity Market Law and the EUMarket Integration Process
   .   The Government has embarked upon a comprehensive reform and restructuring program
       o f the electricity sector to create a liberalized, efficient and economic sector.This was
       initiated by the Electricity Market Law (Law No. 4628) promulgated in February 2001
       and this path reflected in the Strategy Paper accepted by the High Planning Council in
       March 2004, accelerated the reform process. The principles and goals of the reform
       program defined by this Law are substantially in line with EC Directives (1996/92/EC
       and 2003/54/EC) concerningrules for the internal market for electricity.
   m   Turkey is a signatory o fthe Athens Memoranda o f2002 and 2003 that the EC initiatedto
       develop the regional electricity market in South East Europe and eventually integrate it
                                                  22

          with the internal electricity market o f the European Union.                  The 2002 Athens
         Memorandum initiated the regional market development process commonly referredto as
          the "Athens process". With the inclusion o f natural gas, a more detailed version o f the
          memorandum was signed, which i s referred to as the Athens Memorandum 2003, and
          supersedes the 2002 document. While other regional members signed the Treaty on
          October 25, 2005, Turkey did not, owing to reservations on some o f the Treaty
          provisions. With the EU decision o f October 3, 2005 to begin negotiations for full
          accession, some reservations on the Treaty now become intertwinedwith the negotiations
          on the Energy Chapter of the Acquis Communautaire. Turkey however remains
          committed to, and continues to implement the provisions o f the 2003 Athens
          Memorandum.

Reform Implementation
    .     Functional and corporate restructuring of the sector - Pursuant to the law TEAS, the
          former integrated generation and transmission corporation, was restructured into a
          generating corporation EUAS, a trading corporation TETAS and a transmission
          corporation TEIAS. TEDAS, the Government-owned distribution corporation had been
          earlier separated from TEAS' predecessor, TEK. In 2004, TEDAS was restructured into
          separate companies (DISCOS) in preparation for their privatization. The generation
          sector i s also in the process of being restructured into six separate portfolios o f
          generation assets that will be later formed into companies (portfolio companies) that
          would be privatized once distribution i s substantially privatized. EUAS however, will
          continue to own the large multipurpose hydroelectric projects amounting to about 7,000
          MW. See Figure 1.1below on the currently plannedtransitional sector structure.
          Independent Regulatory Framework - Turkey has set up an independent regulatory
          authority, the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) with jurisdiction over
          electricity, gas and petroleum. EMRA has powers over licensing, tariff setting and
          customer service issues.         EMRA is currently involved in setting multi-year tariff
          principles for the distribution business, and a tariff equalization mechanism across
          regions in order to enable national uniform retail tariffs. The Law will be amended to
          allow uniform national tariffs and to enable an equalization mechanism. EMRA has also
     .    conducted the privatization o f gas distribution reasonably successfully over the last few
          years.
          Privatization of Distribution and Generation - Turkey's plan i s to privatize its
          distribution companies inphases over the next two years. The regional companies have
          been created in preparation for privatization, which is expected to commence in mid-
          2006. This process i s delayed from the original timeline since Turkey i s keen to avoid a
          repeat o f earlier difficulties inprivatization4. At present, the privatization o f distribution
          i s delayed as key preparatory tasks such as medium-term (i.e. 5-year) regulated tariff
          profiles and performance benchmarks, and the tariff equalization mechanism have not
          been completed. In addition, there are delays in market implementation.                 Turkey i s
          preparing the implementation o f the balancing and settlement system prior to
          privatization, in order to enable private investors to understand the market in its entirety
          before they bid. Turkey also plans to privatize its existing generating assets, once a
          substantial part o f the distribution business i s privatized. The configuration of the
          generation portfolio companies has been decided, and EUAS will be restructured into 7
          companies, one o f which will retainthe large hydroelectricprojects and is not expected to
          be privatizedinthe medium term.




  Turkey attempted to privatize distribution in the 1998-2000, but the process was challenged in Court and the
transactions resulted in beingcancelled.
                                                      23

  .  Retail Competition in Electricity- Consumers whose annual consumption exceeds 6.0
     GWh can choose their own supplier -this represents more than 30% of the total Turkish
     electricity market.
     Competitive Market Structure - Market simulations are in progress to introduce a
     competitive bilateral contract market with a balancing and settlement system. TEIAS, the
     transmission corporation i s the independent system operator, and will also be the market
  .  operator. The market i s expected to provide the necessary price signals for potential new
     generation.
     Turkey's Regional Interconnection Efforts - Turkey first applied for UCTE(Union for
     the Coordination o f Transmission o f Electricity in Europe) membership in March 21,
     2001.     Since then several studies financed by the European Commission within the
      framework o f the TEN (Trans-European Networks) Program, have assessed different
      scenarios for connecting the Turkish power system to the UCTE power system through
     Bulgaria and Greece. On September 28, 2005, a technical study was initiated by UCTE
     to complete transmission assessments including static and stability analyses to determine
     the technical conditions under which the Turhshpower systemwill be synchronized with
     the power system o f the UCTE. Turkey already has two lines to Bulgaria, and will
      complete its section o f the linkage to Greece [The Greek section has been delayed but i s
      expectedto be completed in20071.

Key Medium-TermSector Issues

  (a) Delays in implementation of the competitive market in electricity -Turkey has begun
      implementation, on a trial basis, o f a competitive bilateral contract market with a
     balancing system for energy, as laid out inthe Government strategy paper o fMarch 2004.
      This process however, is delayed significantly largely for the following reasons:
         -   Unwillingness o f existing market participants, the distribution companies
             primarily, to participate inthe market on a cash basis.
         -   Delay in finalization o f transitional contracts for existing generation between

         -   EUAS, TETAS and distribution companies.
             Delay in finalization o f the equalization mechanism for retail tariffs to enable
         -   uniform tariffs inthe country.
             Delay inapproval o f market regulations and related amendment o f legislation.

                                              24

     The challenge facing Turkey i s to achieve coordinated and timely implementation o f the
     multiple activities integral to the creation o f the market, and generally, to the overall
     reform process. Most implementation activities are very closely linked - for example,
     the output by one implementing agency (e.g. tariff profiles prepared by TEDAS) needs
     approvals (from EMU) and also serves as inputsto the preparation o f vesting contracts
     (by TETAS and MENR). Effective coordination is therefore critical.         The risk to the
     Government with implementation delays resulting from inadequate coordination i s the
     increasing levels o f direct and contingent liabilities owing to:    (i)anon-functioning
     market mechanism with impacts on supply security (see point (b) below); (ii)     continued
     cash-flow shortfalls at the distribution level (see point (c) below); and (iii)   negative
     signals and perceptions created in the private investor community o f the Government's
     commitment and ability to implement the reform agenda. The Bank has been providing
     support to the Government in the design, preparation and implementation of electricity
     reforms, through ongoing lending operations, as well as through grant-funded panels o f
     international advisors.

(b)  Ensuring supply security - Electricity demand has been growing at about 6 percent per
     annum between 2002 and 2005 and the Government anticipates it will accelerate over the
     next decade closer to the long term average of about 8%.        The Government has also
     prepared a low growth case where demand growth remains about 6%. In any case,
     capacity increases on the order o f 1,500-2,000 MW per annum are required from around
     2009-2010 onwards.       The issue o f concern i s that there although licenses have been
     issued for about 6,000 MW o f new capacity (of which 4,000 MW i s for small hydro and
     wind), presently very little new construction has been started.

     The problems are largely linked to the on-going market implementationwhich has not yet
     led to the formation o f credit-worthy private distributors who can contract for new
     capacity and/or electricity offtake.

     The Bank i s collaboratingwith the Government on a policy note addressing the problem
     o f supply security. This study aims to evaluate bothnear term as well as mediumto long
     term solutions for supply security. Upon its finalization, the Government may seek
     further support from the project to assist in implementing the recommendations o f the
     study.

(c)  Accumulated arrears in the electricity utilities -Operating revenues at all the publicly-
     owned electricity and gas sector companies inTurkey are inadequate to meet their longer
     term level o f operating costs and expenditures. The problem is mainly inthe distribution
     business managed by TEDAS. As o f 2004, the theft and loss percentage i s 18.5% o f
     purchases by TEDAS. Bill collection i s about 90%. Due to these problems there is a 25-
     27% shortfall in payments for purchased electricity by TEDAS which in turn cascades
     into revenue shortfalls to all the upstream electricity and gas businesses (Refer to Annex
     9 for a detailed discussion on the current situation o f bill collection and accumulated
     arrears).

(d)  Reconciling independent economic sector regulation with the Government's
     economic stabilization controls -Presently, the Government exercises certain economic
     controls and constraints on pricing o f energy services/outputs and investment decisions,
     in order to maintain fiscal prudence, achieve a healthy primary surplus, and restrain
     inflationary pressures. There remains a fine line between economic stabilizationcontrols
     and other forms o f economic controls that prevent the development o f institutions

                                              25

     essential to a functioning market economy.          To mitigate regulatory risk for private
     investment it will be important that the economic stabilization restraints are relaxed to
     allow timely pass-through o f costs to consumers - specifically:
         -    wholesale gas prices should be adjusted to reflect the market terms in the
         -    underlying contracts;
              retail electricity prices should be adjusted to reflect operating cost changes at the
              distribution level as well as changes inwholesale prices; and
         -    electricity produced by state-owned hydro power plants which i s sold into the
              market i s priced at levels that send appropriate signals o f scarcity and water value
              so as not to distort wholesale market price signals.
     Inaddition, the regulator shouldapprove investmentprograms consistent with established
     performance targets.

(e)  Transition to compliance with European internal market and environmental
     standards - Turkey is committed to the principles of the Athens memorandum, even
     though it did not sign the Treaty in October 2005.              Although Turkey has begun
     implementing fundamental structural reforms in its power sector, some o f which are far
     more advanced than required fkom the EU's perspective, there are several areas, such as
     the timeframe for complete retail market opening that Turkey has reservations on, for
     good reasons. Turkey has already allowed significant retail market opening, and the
     results have been positive from the point o f view o f attracting new capacity and ensuring
     better supply quality for these consumers.         However, in order to provide choice o f
     supplier to all the existing consumers, several fundamental changes are required in the
     sector, most critical among these being the improvement in distribution system losses and
     payment discipline.      The Government i s currently preparing for the privatization o f
     distribution, which i s seen as an important solution for these.improvements. Privatization
     however, has been delayed for several reasons, chief among them being the delays in
     creation o f the electricity market, and the finalization o f the strategy for privatization.

     A key areawhere Turkey has reservations iswith regardto compliancewith the timetable
     in the Treaty to meet EU environmental standards.               In July 2005 EU consultants
     produced a report on Turkey's investment needs inorder for it to be in compliance with
     the EU Large Combustion Plant Directive which limits emissions by these plants
     (Directive 2001/80/EC). Almost all o f the plants covered by the Directive are thermal
     power plants and the estimated cost o f bringing them into compliance with the EU
     Directive i s 1.5- 1.9 Billion Euro (US$ 1.8-2.3 Billion).          This is a large investment
     requirement for Turkey, and, in the absence of concessional financing, will require a
     number o f years to implement, given the lack o f adequate fiscal space for incremental
     investment.

            An Overview of the WorldBankPrograminthe EnergySector


Advisory Support
The Bank has a strong advisory support program to help the Government and the utilities in the
gas and electricitv sector.
    The Bank supported the government in structuring and establishing the Energy Market
    Regulatory Authority in 2001 and indefining the detailed electricity market design. A Bank
    technical assistance loan supports specific implementation tasks, such as distribution sector
    unbundling, definition o f tariff review rules, and preparation o f initial vesting contracts to
    prepare for privatization.
    An independent expert panel o f leading international specialists in market implementation,
    regulation and privatization provides           the  government     guidance   on   challenging
    implementation trade-offs and choices.
    Inthe gas sector a comprehensive gas development strategy was completed in2004 to set a
    framework and process for introducingcompetition inwholesale supply.
    The Bank i s also beginning its support to key energy utilities inachieving a credit quality and
    rating that will enable them to access capital markets without sovereign guarantees.
    Presently, financial advisors financed by PPIAF (Public Private Infrastructure Advisory
    Facility) are working with BOTAS inpreparing for a credit review by a rating agency.
Inadditiontothe continuingwork onreformimplementation, theBankwill continueitsadvisory
work focusing on issues o f energy supply security, EU market integration and helping the
institutionaldevelopment o fvarious utilities inthe energy sector.

ProjectLending
The current program o f lending inthe energy sector aims to: (a) bridge gaps in gas and electricity
service delivery needs during the reform transition; (b) meet EU integration challenges; and (c)
ensure that essential infrastructure that can affect energy supply reliability is implemented. The
projects include:
(a) NationalTransmission Grid Project (NTGP): This project loan o f US$270 million was
    approved in 1998 to the then integrated transmission and generation corporation, TEAS.
    Project objectives are to: (i)   develop adequate transmission grid capacity in a timely and
    environmentally sustainable manner; (ii)continue the reform o f the power sector by
    establishing the independent operation o f the transmission gnd system; and (iii)  maintain the
    financial viability of the state institution responsible for the grid development and operation.
    The project was restructured in 2002, after TEAS was restructured into three corporations -
    TEIAS (transmission), EUAS (generation) and TETAS (trading and contracting). TEIAS is
    the successor and has taken on the obligations under NTGP, but US$ 20 Million o f the loan
    was assigned to the Government for helping fund the implementation o f the reform process.
    The project i s rated satisfactory both on a Development Objectives (DO) and Implementation
    Progress (IP) basis.      While construction o f transmission lines has been slower than
    anticipated, capacity shortages have. been avoided, TEIAS has been designated the
    independent operator o f the transmission grid and TEIAS itself remains financially viable. In
    addition, the loan supports the creation o f an electricity market and ongoing efforts to


                                                   27

    privatize distribution and generation, and capacity development within the independent
    regulatory agency.

(b) Renewable Energy Project: The project loan o f US$ 202.3 million was approved inMay
    2004.    The objective o f the project i s to increase privately owned and operated power
    generation from renewable sources without the need for government guarantees, and within
    the market-based framework o f the Electricity Market Law. The Treasury has on-lent the
    funds to the TurkishDevelopment Bank (TKB)andthe TurkishIndustrialDevelopment Bank
    (TSKB). The two development banks in turn are on-lending the funds to private developers
    o f renewable electricity generation projects. The PHRD grant was used to support the
    government inthe preparation o f the renewable energy law approved inJune 2005.

(c) ECSEE APLZ: As Turkey gets closer to its negotiations with the EU for accession, it i s in
    the process o fintegrating its energy markets with those o fEurope. Under the Athens Process,
    Turkey i s liberalizing its electricity market and linkingits market to the electricity markets of
    other countries in South East Europe. The World Bank established a regional adaptable
    program loan in FY05 to support the eight non-EU members in meeting their technical and
    institutional obligations. This regional program provides Bank investment support by using
    the adaptable program lending (APL) instrument. This loan o f EUR 50.6 million i s the first
    loan to Turkey under this program. The specific objectives o f APL2 are to: (i) with the
                                                                                       assist
    creation o f a market management system for the electricity market; (ii)strengthen the
    SCADA system to enable TEIAS to operate more efficiently; and (iii)strengthen the
    transmission grid. This loan became effective inSeptember 2005.

(d) The Gas Sector Development Project: This project loan o fUS$325 million to TurkishGas
    Pipeline Corporation (BOTAS) finances a gas storage facility for Turkey as well as part o f its
    transmission system expansion.        Inaddition, the project will support the restructuring of
    BOTAS and help it achieve access to capital market financing in the future. This project
    results from the Gas Distribution Strategy and the Gas Sector Strategy Note completed by the
    Bank for the TurkishGovernment in July and September 2004. These studies indicated inter
    alia that peak demand for gas would increase rapidly with the expansion o f gas distribution
    and therefore storage i s increasingly needed. This storage would make gas supplies more
    reliable, thereby improving the investment climate for gas using companies.           The system
    expansion and the storage would also assist with Turkey's increasing role as a gas transit
    country. The loan agreement was signed on February 2,2006.

(e) ECSEE-APL3:        This loan i s the second regional adaptable program loan to Turkey. Its
    objectives are to increase the safety, reliability, efficiency and capacity o f the bulk power
    transmission system in Turkey and to improve market access for consumers and suppliers o f
    electricity. The project will support the strengthening and expansion o f the transmission
    network to reliably meet the growing electricity demand.         It will also help upgrade the
    transmission network in dense urban areas to minimize the risk to public safety posed by
    urbanencroachment on existingoverhead lines.

Proposed Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation Project: In addition to the above projects,
the Bank i s also currently preparing a distribution rehabilitation project with TEDAS. The
distribution sector in Turkey has not completed essential investments in system upgrades and
rehabilitation for several years, for two reasons. First, from 1997-2002 the sector went through
an unsuccessful attempt at privatization. Second, the Government faced budget pressures during
repeated fiscal crises and curtailed investments in the distribution sector. The proposed project
will finance system rehabilitationand upgrading investments to improve reliability. The project
is expected to be presented for Board consideration incalendar 2006.

                                              RESTRUCTURING



Component 1: AfSin-Elbistan A Rehabilitation (Estimated Cost EUR328.2. million)
The main component o f this project is the rehabilitation of AfSin-Elbistan A Power Plant. This component will
focus on: (a) the repair, replacement and upgrade o f power plant systems to restore reliability, availability and power
output, and improve plant efficiency; (b) upgrade o f environmental protection systems and environmental
monitoring; (c) improvement o f operational and maintenance practices - particularly maintenance monitoring
systems, predictive maintenance based on historical data analysis, and maintenance planningkcheduling; and (c)
environmental regulations; and (d) meeting UCTE standards for primary and secondary frequency control required
to integrate with the South East European market.

Component 2: Support for Financial and Operational Restructuring of the Generation Business (Estimated
                        cost EUR3.0 million)
This component will focus on supporting EUA$ in restructuring its generation business into financially and
operationally viable portfolio companies and a hydro corporation. This work will create the basis for undertaking
the future privatization o f these generation entities. The PHRD grant for the preparation o f this Project has been
utilized to begin this work. Consultants have analyzed different portfolio configurations based on criteria such as
fuel mix, load following capabilities and financial viability, and have also prepared draft transition contracts
between GENCOs and TETA$/ distribution companies. Based on this work, the Government has decided on 6
portfolio companies, and these have been earmarked as separate units within EUAS, in addition to the residual
EUA$ Hydropower company. The Project proposes to assist in completing this work, focusing on aspects o f
financial and operational restructuringo fthe companies to create them as viable business units.

The Project will also provide support, if necessary, to EUAS and the Government to implement mechanisms to
address generation supply security needs in the period beyond 2008. The initial work on assessing options and
strategies is being funded through separate grant funds.

Financing Plan
The proposed Bank loan will finance the main rehabilitation contract. This contract will cover all the major critical
aspects o f the rehabilitation included in Component 1 such as the rehabilitation o f the boiler and firing system, the
electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), the main cooling water and condensate water system (covered under the Balance
of Plant Mechanical), control and instrumentation, and ash and coal handling.

The remaining portions o f Component 1 will be financed from EUA$' operating and maintenance budget since
these elements are either currently ongoing or are logically covered by the annual maintenance budget. The most
important sub-component covered by EUAS is the ongoing rehabilitation o f the steam turbines and generators.
EUAS' maintenance budget will also cover elements such as the switchgear, transformers and other general
instrument supplies (Balance o f Plant Electrical), cooling tower coating and reinforcement, and environment
monitoring. The bidding documents for the main contract will contain suitable provisions to reflect the fact that
some works are ongoing, and that EUAS will provide some components from its own resources.


The operational and maintenance practice improvement services, and specialized project management services will
be funded through the Bank loan.

Undercomponent 2 the Bank loan will be usedfor services to facilitate the financial and operational restructuring of
EUAS in to multiple generation companies. In addition, provision will be made under component 2 to utilize the
earmarked resourcesto implement mechanisms to address generation supply security needs inthe medium-term.

Component 1- Afqin Elbistan A Rehabilitation

Af7in-Elbistan i s Turkey's largest thermal power generation complex. The complex uses domestic lignite
which i s mined adjacent to the two generation stations:
        Af9in-Elbistan A with a nominal capacity o f 1,355 MW (3x340 + 1x335). The four units were
        commissioned between 1984 and 1987; and
        Afvin ElbistanB, with a capacity of 1,440 MW (4x360). Two unitswere commissioned in2005
        and the remaining two unitswill be commissioned in2006.

.
The output and performance o f AfSin-Elbistan A has deteriorated significantly over in the last 20 years
and the plant i s inneed o f major rehabilitation.
        Capacity Derating Available capacity i s currently about 1,000 MW o f the original name-plate
                              -
        capacity of 1,355 MW - or about 74% o f the design capacity.
a       Availability has declined from 85% to below 40%.
                      -
a       Plant efficiency -has declined fi-om 36.6% to about 27%.

Several factors have contributed to this pre-mature decline inperformance inaddition to general wear and
tear.

(a) Variation in Lignite Quality from Design Specification (1987-1994) - the boiler was designed for
    lower lignite quality than was initially made available to the plant by the miningcompany (which was
    then separate). The lignite fiom the mine has a low calorific value, typically 1000-1,500 kcalkg.
    With dryer and higher calorific value lignite, the control systems in the bruden system were not able
    to maintain the necessary re-circulation o f combustible particles to the burners, which led to boiler
    combustion temperatures not being stabilized at the design level. This in turn led to excessive
    slagging and fouling o f tube surfaces and led to severe damage to boiler pressure parts.        The
    ownership o f the mine was transferred to the power company in 1994, which improved coordination
    and quality control o f the lignite supplied. However, irreversible damage to the boiler had already
    been done.

(b) MaintenancePractices- The power station maintenancepractices have not been upto the required
    standards owing to the shortcomings in:
        Planned and predictive maintenance - Plant maintenance was generally carried out inresponse to
        operating problems and equipment failures, with inadequate attention to systematic monitoring at
        each maintenance event followed by historical data analysis. Scheduling o f periodic maintenance
     .  inspections and work was not done as it should have been, partly owing to the budget restrictions
        on maintenance.
        Budget provision for spare parts - Budget allocation practices led to phases when essential spare
        parts and maintenance materials could not be procured. Equipment wear increased substantially
        duringthese phases.
        Departures o f experienced and qualified staff - Over 200 trained staff who left the station for
        postings within the company or for alternative employment were not replaced.

Plant Performanceafter Rehabilitation
     .
The rehabilitation work is expected to improve the plant performance as follows:
        Plant output o f each unit will be increased from about 260 MW net to 300 MW net
        Capacity factor will be increasedfrom below 40% to 75%
        Plant efficiency will be increased fiom 27% to 31% (30.6% with the FGD)

Performance parameters such as: availability, steam output, boiler efficiency and auxiliary power
consumption) will be guaranteed by the rehabilitationcontractor.

RehabilitationScope
EUAShas finalized the feasibility report prepared by RWEInternational, and has approved the scope of
work after a comprehensive reviewjointly with the Bank's power engineers. The key sub-components o f
the rehabilitation scope and cost estimates are summarized below. Each rehabilitation sub-component
was selected based on an economic and technical assessment o f options ranging from doing no
rehabilitation, to repairinghenewing the system or replacing the system entirely. The finally selected
scope was defined based on an overall least-cost solution that would achieve a guaranteed power plant
performance that engineering contractors could be held accountable for. The scope o f the environmental
pollution control systems were definedbased onregulatory requirements.

       Boiler
       The interiorand exterior of the boilerwill be cleaned. Detailedinspectionand repair work of the boilerwaterwall,
       superheater, reheater and economizer tubes, headers and other pressure parts. The waterwall bottom section
       of the boiler (hopper) and the lower economizerwill be replaced. Damagedparts, the superheater, and reheater
       tubes will be repaired to the extent possible or otherwise replaced. A new boiler cleaning system and soot
       blowing system will be installed. This will improve the boiler efficiency as well as preventing slugging which
       causes tube failures.

       Steam Turbine Rehabilitation
       The high pressure (HP), intermediate pressure (IP) and low pressure (LP) inner casing and blades will be
       overhauled and replaced in selected units in order to achieve efficiency improvements and plant output
       increases. The turbine governors will be replaced for better frequency control. The boiler feed water pump
       turbinewill be overhauledto preventunexpectedfailures and unplannedoutages, thus increasingthe availability
       and reliability of the plant. The steam turbine system is funded by EUAS separately (and not financed by the
       Bank) because the turbine overhaul has already been scheduled under the periodic maintenance agreement
       negotiatedwith Alstom: the originalequipmentsupplier (OEM).

       High Pressure Piping
       Damaged pipe hangers will be replaced and repaired. Boiler pressure parts and major piping including main
       steam, cold and hot reheat, and feed water pipes will be inspected and non-destructivetesting (NDT) will be
       carriedout to maintainsafe operation of the plant.

                                          RehabilitationSub-Component


Precipitator
An additional compartment will be added to the main boiler flue gas and the bruden vapor Electrostatic
Precipitators (ESPs) to achieve the required particulate emission level (100 mglNm3). This is necessary to
comply with the Turkish environmental regulations for Afsin (150 mglNm3) and the Bank's environmental
guidelinesfor rehabilitatedexisting plants.

Control and Instrumentation
The complete boiler and turbine control system will be upgraded to the modern Distributed Control System
(DCS). The existing control panels in the control room will be replaced by computer display panels which will
allow the operator to access plant control, monitoring and alarm systems.             All the boiler and turbine
measurementtransmitterswill interfacewith the new DCS and all the actuators requiredfor the new DCS will be
overhauled, modified or added. Continuouswater quality monitoring and emissions monitoringsystems will be
added. These measures will enable more flexible operation of the plant, record keeping, and thus helping
improvementof operationand maintenancepractice, and improve efficiency, availability and reliability. After the
rehabilitation, the plant will be able to participate in the primary and secondary frequency control systems
requiredby UCTE.

Ash and Coal Handling
A dry bottom ash handling system (the Magaldi system) will replace the existing system which has had severe
problems in the past, causing plant outages, high water requirements and pollution around the power plant.
There is experience with dry bottom ash handling systems in Turkish imported coal plant, and at lignite fired
plants in Portugal, Italy,and Macedonia.Analysis conductedby RWE during the feasibility study has shown that
the dry bottom ash handling system will be suitable for Afsin-Elbistan A. The fly ash handling system will be
changed to a pneumatic transport system, and new filters for the pneumatic system will be installed. These
measures will improve availability and reliability of the plant, as well as environmental problems caused by the
current ash disposal system. Enhancement of the coal handling system including covering tops of conveyers
and lightingsystems,will improve availabilityof the plant.

Civil Works
The reinforcedconcrete, steel structure for the boiler,turbine and balance of plant will be repaired and replaced
The civil works also includeexterior and interior painting, earthquake safety (additionalwalls) repair of damaged
clear covers, and exposedreinforcement,protectivecoatingsand new foundationsfor concretestructure.

Plant Water Chemistry
Systemsfor new Condensatepolishing,demineralization,decarburization,ammonia and oxygen injection,water
steamcircuit,coolingwater treatment and sewagetreatmentwill be installed andlor renewed.

Environmental Monitoring
Environmental monitoringsystems will be installedto monitorthe environmental quality near the power plant so
that the emission and ambientlevels are within the limitof the regulations and guidelines.

Operation and Maintenance Practice Improvement
Operationand maintenance practices are critical to keep the plant in a good operating conditionand to ensure
availability after rehabilitation. Priority will be given to improving performance and maintenance monitoring, as
well as maintenance planning. A comprehensive program of improved operation and maintenance practice
including systematic monitoring, historical data analysis, regular overhaul, predictive maintenance and non
destructive testing (NDT) of materials will be introduced. A plan for rationalizationof the O&M budget and staff
numbers etc will be developedfor both the power plant and lignite mine. Training on the blending system at the
mine side will also be includedin the TA.

FlueGas Desulphurization(FGD)

The flue gas desulphurization (FGD) unit i s not included in the initial phase o f the rehabilitation project
given the five year transition period granted by the Ministry o f Environment and Forests (MOEF). In
accordance with this transition period granted by MOEF, EUAS will need to install the FGD by the end
o f 2010. The FGD retrofit project i s estimated to cost US$ 250 million and will be funded separately by
EUAS and the Government.

A wet limestone FGD system will be used. The basic design for the system has recommended that the
treated flue gas be emitted from the cooling tower instead o f the chimney. This design requires polymer
coating and reinforcement of the cooling tower.     There is adequate space for the FGD and connection
ducts (See Figure4.3 below).

The scope o f work will include:
-       construction and installation o fthe FGD,
        Bruden flue gas ducts to connect to the FGD,
        replacement of the ID fans    - new IDfans with approximately twice the capacity o f existing fans
        are necessary as the Bruden flue gas will need to be directed into the FGD unit inaddition to the
        main flue gas from the boilers,
         ducts connecting to cooling towers,
         facilities for limestone preparation, gypsumtreatment and storage.

Lignite M i n e Development

To ensure adequate lignite for the new AfSin-Elbistan B Station and the rehabilitated Af$n Elbistan A,
lignite production capacity has to be almost doubled in the mine.              Based on the planned rehabilitation
schedule (i.e. 3 units commissioned in 2008 and 1 unit in 2009), and FGD installation in 2010 lignite

Both options require around EUR424 million investment and extensive use o f contractors for overburden
removal, estimated at 30 million tons per year at the Kislakoy mine.            The second option requires
additional boxcut overburden removal o f about 30 million tons annually at the Collolar mine. Ifthe new
mine i s developed by a private entity as EUAS i s expected, significant amount o f upfront investment cost
i s required for option 2. Further, given that the development o f a new mine would require 5-6 years to
complete, inorder for bothplants to operate at full capacity in 3 years, the existing mine would have to be
extended even in option 2. Thus, although the development o f a second mine will improve supply
reliability and increase employment in the mine, the costs of this option i s not justified. A levelized
lignite production cost in option 2 i s about EUR 0.5-1.5/ ton higher than that of option 1. Therefore, the
available analysis shows that option 1 (i.e. extension o f the Kislakoy mine) i s the most economic option
for increasing lignite production to meet the demand of rehabilitated Afvin A and plant B. Coal
production and demand are shown inthe table below.

The production capability o f Kislakoy mine has to be increased from the present 18 million todyear to a
maximum o f 34.6 million ton by 2012 by means o f contracts for overburden removal, a performance
improvement program, 2 additional compact size bucket wheel excavators (2 x 10 million m3p.a.) and 2
additional medium size bucket wheel excavators (2 x 28 million m3p.a.) with a total investment of EUR
324 million. In addition, rehabilitation investment o f EUR 100 million has to be made to maintain the
existing capacity o f excavators and other equipment. The capacity increase will be carried out more
effectively and efficiently by a private entity as EUAS expected, considering the engineering and
management capacity of EUAS at the existing mine. After the installation o f the FGDat Afvin Elbistan A
plant due to the net efficiency reduction o f the power plant, the mine capacity needs to be further
expanded to 36.0 million ton by 2011.

To achieve this capacity increase, the following milestones have to be met:
         Contract with overburden removal contractor by the middle o f 2006;
         Engineering and procurement o fmine equipment and belt conveyors by the middle o f 2007;
         Manufacturing, delivery and start o ferection o f the first equipment inthe second half o f 2008;
         Commissioning o fthe first equipment inthe second half o f 2009;
         Last equipment to be commissioned inthe second halfo f 2011.

The above milestones will be supervised duringProject implementation.

From the point o f view of the long-term strategic need to increase the electricity generation capacity,
EUAS is continuing its technical and feasibility study for opening the new Collolar Mine along with its
plans for a 3'd lignite fired power plant (Af9in Elbistan C). These studies will be shared and discussed
with the Bank team duringimplementation. Ifconsideration is given to developing a new mine (Collolar)
rather than expand production inKislakoy, EUAS will present a comprehensive economic case for such a
choice.

ImplementationAgency
The project will be implemented by EUAS, the Government-owned generating company owning and
operating about 24,000 MW o f thermal and hydro plants. A special Project ImplementationTeam (PMT)
has been established to oversee the implementation o f the Project. The PMT i s managed by and staffed
with engineers and other staff experienced in thermal plant operations and rehabilitation.                The
rehabilitation will be carried out by a contractor chosen based on ICB procedures o f the Bank. The
contractor will be overseen by the PMT aided by RWE who will report to the PMT and EUAS top
management. Inaddition, there will be considerable focus given to the monitoring o f the environmental
impacts o f the project and the plant in general, either as part o f the implementation consultant contract, or
as a separate contract. Because o f the importance o f this project to EUAS and to Turkey, EUAS
management will follow its progress closely.

It is likely that during project implementation, EUAS will be restructured into separate portfolio
GENCOs. In this case, AfSin-Elbistan A will be transferred to the portfolio company containing the
AfSin-Elbistan complex, hereinafter referredto as AfSin GENCO. The responsibility o f rehabilitationand
supervision will be transferred to AfSin GENCO. The PMT, with adequate staff in Afgin GENCO, will
be suitably enhanced to ensure that implementationdoes not suffer.

The Bank loan will remain with EUAS' successor, EUAS Hydro. EUAS Hydro will enter into a back-to-
back loan with AfSin GENCO.

ImplementationSchedule
The rehabilitationo f Afgin-Elbistan A i s expected to take about 33 months after contract award. The two-
stage bidding process and contracting is likely to take about 11 months after preparation o f technical
specifications, with contract signature estimated by end-March 2007. Thereafter, as shown in Figure 4.1
inAnnex 4 above, contract implementationwill start with the delivery ofmaterials, whichwill take about
 14months, and rehabilitationwill be carried out for each unit sequentially. This i s an ambitious timeline,
and will require very close and regular monitoring to be implemented. Based on this schedule, the first
rehabilitated unit will be commissioned inmid-2008, and the entire plant will be re-commissioned inthe
second half o f 2009. Under an alternative compressed schedule project duration i s estimated at 22
months, with the assumption that work will continue during winter months and that several units can be
rehabilitated inparallel. This will have cost implications.

A.        Summary of FinancialManagementArrangements
An assessment o f the financial management arrangements for the project was undertaken duringOctober
20-3 1, 2005 and the assessment will be updated during appraisal and before Board. The current financial
management arrangements for the project are marginally satisfactory to the Bank and an action plan i s
developed to bringthe arrangements to a satisfactory level for the Bank.

Detailed financial management questionnaire i s presented as an annex to this report. A summary o f the
conclusions are as follows:

Country Issues
State Economic Enterprises in Turkey are subject to basic accounting and auditing obligations which
apply to companies in Turkey. These are laid down in the Commercial Code, which was last revised in
1956. More detailed requirements were introduced in the Tax Procedures Law o f 1950 (which has since
been consolidated into the Tax Procedures Code). Under the powers granted to it by the Code, the
Ministry o fFinance (MOF) introduced a Uniform Chart o fAccounts which became effective on January
1, 1994. This prescribes certain fundamental accounting concepts, a code o f accounts, and a format for the
presentation o f financial statements. The mainpurpose o f these requirements i s to provide information to
the taxation authorities, there i s no obligation to publishthe financial statements, nor are they subject to a
mandatory financial statement audit.

RiskMitigationStrategy
Country financial management risk -the project will be implemented by EUAS, a state owned enterprise
which has adequate financial management arrangements inplace.

Control risk - an action plan is agreed with EUA$ to reduce the control risk to a negligible level before
Board.

ImplementingEntity
The project implementation will be carried out by EUAS. There will be a Project Management Team
(PMT) responsible for the daily implementation o f the project. Overall project coordination will be
carried out by the deputy general manager responsible for power plants. The technical departments will be
responsible for the procurement o f goods and services and the physical progress o f the project. The
financial management functions will be performed by the Loans Directorate under the Financial Affairs
Department o f EUA$.

Currently there i s one manager and two assistant managers working in the Loans Directorate which
requires the support o f an additional staff with the necessary qualifications.

The related technical departments, together with a consultancy firm, will prepare the technical
specifications or Terms o f References (TORs) for the goods, works, and services required. The evaluation
committee will be made up o f representatives from EUAS power plants and other departments o f EUAS
e.g. the finance department. The acceptance and oversight o f the related items procured will be the
responsibility o f the technical department. The consultancy firm will supervise the implementation o f the
project in line with the TORs. The Loans Directorate will make the payment fi-om the Designated
Account following the approval o fthe technical departments.



                                                       43

The Loans Department will document the format and the contents o f the information required from
technical departments to make payments following the project financial management manual.

The risk associated with implementingentity i s negligible. EUAS i s a well established SOE.

FundsFlow
There will be one designated account for the project for disbursements. The Designated Account will be
inEUROSand will be at an acceptable commercialbank. All payments to the contractors, suppliers and
consultants will either be made directly from the loan account or from the Designated Account with the
authorization o f the responsible personnel.

EUAS obtained a budget allocation o f YTL 52 Million for the AfSin-Elbistan Plant Rehabilitation. The
State Planning Organization approved the feasibility studies o f the project on March 27, 2006.
Accordingly, the project funds can be utilized when they become available.

The risk associated with funds flow i s considered as negligible.

Staffing
The Loans Directorate, which will be responsible for the financial management functions, i s currently
staffed with a manager and two assistant managers. The department i s responsible for the financial
management functions o f all foreign loans o f the company. Considering the additional work that will be
introduced by the project it i s important that an additional staff with the necessary linguistic skills and
computer literacy i s assigned to the Loans Directorate.

The risk associated with staffing i s assessed as moderate. EUAS will assign an additional staff with
satisfactory qualifications and experience to the Loans Department by May 15,2006.

Accounting Policies and Procedures
The project transactions will be entered into the main accounting system o f EUAS however the
accounting system does not have the capability o f having detailed sub accounts or codes for transactions
relating to the World Bank loan to facilitate project reporting. Therefore, EUAS will assign a specific
ledger code for the project under the relevant accounts and at the same time it will make use o f
supplemental Excel spreadsheets to account for transactions based on activities and disbursement
categories. Those spreadsheetswill be reconciledwith the main accounting records on a regular basis.

EUAS is a well-established SOE and the current accounting policies and procedures are acceptable to the
Bank. The company uses the Uniform Chart o f Accounts and applies the accounting policies as required
by the Ministry o f Finance. The financial management procedures relevant for the project will also be
included in the financial management manual for the project. The financial management manual will
cover (a) the financial and accounting policies and procedures for the project (b) organization of the
financial management functions (staff responsibilities) (c) the financial management information system
(d) disbursements (e) budgeting and financial forecasting and (f) project to be finalized. The draft project
financial management manual will be prepared by M a y 30,2006.

Currently, EUAS has a partially centralized accounting system. Thermal power-plants, hydraulic power-
plants and other similar directorates have the responsibility for recording their own transactions into the
accounting software. The accounting data i s then sent on a quarterly basis to the Financial Affairs
Department inthe General Directorate, where the control and consolidation work i s done. EUASplans to
replace the existing accounting system with a fully integrated ERP system, the tendering process for

which i s completed. EUAS expects that the project will be completed by the end o f 2007. The project
financial management will than be fully integrated into EUAS system and therefore the successful
implementationo f ERP will be a dated loan covenant.

The risk associated with accounting policies and procedures i s considered as moderate. EUAS will
generate the excel worksheets to facilitate accounting in foreign currency and project reporting by M a y
30,2006.

InternalAudit
There i s not an internal control department which undertakes regular audits o f the departments within
EUAS andtherefore noreliance will beplacedon internal audit.

EUASdoes not fall withinthe scope o fthe enacted Public FinancialManagement and ControlLaw which
requires internal control departments to be established at Government institutions. However, since EUAS
i s committed to modernize its financial management systems it i s important that the Organization
considers the establishment o f a modern InternalAudit Department.

ReportingandMonitoring
The Loans Directorate will maintain records and will ensure appropriate accounting for the funds
provided. Financial statements for the project will be prepared by the Loans Directorate. The interim un-
audited financial reports - also expressed as Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR), will be prepared
quarterly and will be submittedto the Bankno later than 45 days after the end o fthe quarterly period.

The format and the contents o fthe FMRhave been discussed and agreed between the Bank and the Loans
Directorate. The financial management manual o f the project will include a section on the FMR. The
FMR will include financial reports, output monitoring reports and procurement reports. The responsible
unitsfor the preparationo feachofthese reports have alsobeenagreed.

The financial accounting software is not capable o f producing the financial reports. Excel based
spreadsheets satisfactory to the Bank will be preparedby the Loans Directorate by May 30,2006.

The risk associated with reporting and monitoring i s assessedas moderate.

InformationSystems
EUAS uses an in-house developed accounting software. The project transactions will be recorded using
the current software and the Loans Directorate will prepare separate financial reports based on Excel
spreadsheets. Currently, EUAS has a partially centralized accounting system. Thermal power-plants,
hydraulic power-plants and other similar directorates have the responsibility for recording their own
transactions into the accounting software. The accounting data is then sent on a quarterly basis to the
Financial Affairs Department in the General Directorate, where the control and consolidation works are
done. EUAS plans to replace the existing accounting system with a fully integrated ERP system, the
tendering process for which is completed. (See above.)

The risk associated with information systems i s assessed as moderate. EUAS will generate excel
worksheets to support project and will successfully implementthe ERPby December 31,2007.

StrengthsandWeaknesses
The significant strengths that provide the basis for reliance on the project financial management system
include (a) experience o f the staff in the Loans Directorate under the Financial Affairs Department in




                                                    45

 World Bank projects, (b) preparation o f a financial management manual for the project satisfactory to the
 Bank before Board.

 A weakness inthe project's financial management system is the staffingissuewhich will be addressedby
 EUAS by assigning additional qualified staff with CVs satisfactory to the Bank to the Loans Directorate
 before Board

 Action Plan
 It is concluded that the financial management arrangements for the project marginally satisfy the Banks
 minimum requirements. The following action plan is proposed to develop the financial management
 system to a satisfactory level before the loan i s submitted to Board:




     ctorate for the financial management of the



 ended Decembe; 31,2006.
I7. Financial Monitoring Reports integrated to the   1December31, 2007
 ERPsystem

 SupervisionPlan
 Duringproject implementation, the Bankwill supervise the project's financialmanagement arrangements
 intwo mainways: (i) the project's quarterly financial managementreports as well as the project's
                        review
 annual audited financial statements and auditor's management letter; and (ii)during the Bank's
 supervision missions, review the project's financial management and disbursement arrangements
 (including a review o f a sample of SOEs and movements on the Designated Accounts) to ensure
 compliance with the Bank's minimum requirements.                As required, a Bank-accredited Financial
 Management Specialist will assist inthe supervision process.


 ExternalAudit
 EUAS was established in 2001. As there was no legal obligation for having its accounts audited by
 external auditors, the company didn't receive such services until 2005. Considering the fact that the
 external audit will be mandatory with the starting o f the project in2006, the company decided to have its
 accounts for the years ended 2002,2003,2004 and 2005 be audited prior to that date. Accordingly, EUAS
 has completed the tendering process for the audit services and assigned external auditors who will audit
 the company's financial statements for 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 in accordance with International
 Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Standards on Auditing.(ISA). The audit firm
 assigned by EUAS to carry out the audit o f the financial statements for the years ended 2002 to 2005 is a
 local firm however it i s included inthe Capital Market Boards list o f accepted audit companies. Once the
 loanbecomes effective the audit TOR will be revised for 2006 and onwards to include the audit o fproject
 financial statements.

State Owned enterprises in Turkey are subject to the audit o f Higher Audit Board (YDK). YDK was
established in 1938 to audit State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) on behalf o f the Parliament. The YDK
reports for the years 2003 and 2002 were reviewed. The main findings relating to financial management
issues are that inventory and registration procedures relating to the fixed assets transfers from other
government institutions to EUAS are not completed.

The IFRS financial statements audited in accordance with ISA will be reviewed once they are received. If
the results o f the audits reveal any weaknesses inthe financial management o f EUAS, an action plan will
be agreed with the company to address the issues identified and progress will be monitored during
supervision.

The risk associated with external audit i s considered moderate.        EUAS' IFRS and ISA financial
statements are not available but the YDK report has been reviewed and no major internal control issues
were identified. EUAS will assign the auditors acceptable to the Bank for the year ended December 31,
2006 byNovember 30,2006.

B. DisbursementArrangements

Designated account:         EUAS will open and maintain a Designated Account (DA) in EURO at an
acceptable commercial bank. The DA will be used following procedures to be agreed with the Bank, and
will have an authorized allocation o f 20 million. Two signatures indicated in the list o f authorized
signatures submittedby EUASwill be required on the withdrawal applications. The minimumapplication
size for payments directly from the Loan Account for issuance o f Special Commitments i s 4.0 million.
Applications for replenishment o f the DA will be submitted to the Bank on a monthly basis, or when the
balance o f the DA is equal to about half o f the initial deposit or the authorized allocation, whichever
comes first, and will include a reconciled bank statement as well as other appropriate supporting
documents.

Use of statements of expenditure (SOEs): Disbursements will be made against Statements o f
Expenditures for: (a) goods costing less than 5 million equivalent per contract; (b) consulting contracts
with firms, costing less than E 275,000 equivalent each; (c) consultingcontracts with individuals, costing
less than E 75,000 equivalent each. Full documentation in support o f SOEs would be retained by EUAS
for at least one year after the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last
withdrawal from the Loan Account was made. This information will be made available for review during
supervision by Bank staff and for annual audits which will be required to specifically comment on the
propriety o f SOE disbursements and the quality o f the associated record-keeping.


Utilization of Loan Proceeds: EUAS will finance the turbine rehabilitation expenditures, other elements
such as the switchyard etc., taxes, interest during construction, and contingencies. The Bank loan will
thus finance about 70% o fthe total project cost (excluding VAT).

Retroactive Financing: Expenditures incurred for consulting services after April 30, 2006 may be
financed, upto amaximum o fE 500,000.

                                          RESTRUCTURING

A. General
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the
provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general descriptions o f various items under different
expenditure categories are described below. For each contract to be financed by the Loan, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for two-stage bidding, estimated costs,
prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team
and listed in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated regularly to reflect the actual
project implementationneeds and improvements in institutionalcapacity.

Procurement of Works: No Works contracts are foreseen inthe Project.

Procurement of Goods/Supply and Installation: Goods procured under this project would include:
Rehabilitationo f AfSin-Elbistan Lignite fired power plant including all equipment supply and installation.
Because o f the size and complexity o f the rehabilitation works, two-stage bidding will be conducted in
accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.6 o f the Procurement Guidelines. The Bank financed part
of the rehabilitation works will include the rehabilitation o f boilers, firing system, piping, balance of
plant, electrostatic precipitators, instrumentation and controls, ash and coal handling, civil works,
chemistry plant. Turbine and generator rehabilitation will be done by EUAS'S own sources. The
environmental monitoring will be financed by EUAS'Sown sources under a separate contract including
equipment supply.

Basically, there will be one large Goods/Supply Installation contract in this Project and it will be
conducted through two-stage International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. The cost estimate for
this bigcontract was done by German firm RWEwhich has been employedby EUASunder the scope of
feasibility study. The cost estimate has been reviewed by the Bank's technical experts and found
conservative in order to allow for unforeseen situations during the rehabilitation works. It has been
estimated that overall uncertainty does not exceed 15% o f the base cost.

The procurement will be conducted usingthe Bank's latest Standard BiddingDocuments for Supply and
Installationo f Plant and Equipment.

The Goods/Supply and Installation Contract will be subject to prior review by the Bank.

Procurement of non-consulting services: No non-consulting services are foreseen inthe Project.

Selection of Consultants:        Consulting firms would be required for Financial and Operational
restructuring o f EUAS, improvement o f O&M practices of EUAS, and assistance to EUAS Project
Management Team duringthe implementationo fthe project regarding the specialized subjects. Short lists
of consultants for services estimated to cost less than 160,000 equivalent per contract may be composed
entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant
Guidelines. Individual consultants may also be required for highly specialized subjects and for support to
the Project Management Team.




                                                     49

The envisaged procurement methods for the Selection o f Consultants inthis project are:
        -    Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS);
        -    Selection Based on the Consultants Qualifications (CQS) for the services estimated to cost
             less than 160,000;
        -    Individual Consultants.

Consultancy services estimated to cost above 275,000 per contract and Individual Consultants estimated
to cost above 75,000 per contract will be subject to prior review by the Bank. Regardless o f the
estimated cost, the first two contracts for each selection method and the Terms o f References o f all
individual consultancy contracts will be subject to prior review by the Bank.

OperationalCosts: The project will not finance any operational cost.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by EUAS.

Assessments o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the
project has been carried out by the Bank team between September 2004 and October 2005, and updated in
February 2006. The assessments reviewed the organizational structure and procedures for implementing
the project.

EUAS has established a Project Management Team (PMT) under the coordination of Deputy General
Manager responsible from Department o f Thermal Power Plants and Mining Areas. The PMT
composition i s as follows: the Department Head, Deputy Department Heads, one Mechanical Engineer,
one Environmental Engineer. The PMT will be supported by the procurement staff experienced inpublic
procurement and other international procurement procedures during the procurement process. EUAS'
existing consulting firm, RWE, which prepared the feasibility study and basic design, will help EUAS in
preparingthe biddingdocuments for the main supply and installation contract. This firmwill also conduct
the site supervision o f the rehabilitation works and will be continued to be financed by EUAS' own
sources.

EUAS as an institution has experience in the procurement and implementation o f large international
contracts. However, EUAS does not have experience under the Bank's procurement Guidelines (except
the selection o f consultants under PHRDTrust Fund).

Considering that the EUAS staff has little experience inthe Bank's procurement procedures the following
action plan for reducingprocurement riskwas agreed:

    1. During the project preparation stage between September 2004 and February 2006, the Project
        Management team staff was informed about the Bank's procurement Guidelines, Standard
        Biddingdocuments andthe procedures.
    2. The Project Management Team Staff participated in the procurement training given on June 24,
        2005 by the Bank's procurement specialist inthe Bank's Ankara office.
    3.  Since EUAS intends to initiate the procurements before the Loan negotiations, in the preparation
        o f the bidding documents EUAS' staff and the Bank's procurement specialist agreed to work
        closely.
    4. EUAS staff will participate in regular monthly procurement meetings arranged by the Bank's
        procurement specialist.

The overall project risk for the procurement i s high.


                                                     50

C. ProcurementPlan
The Borrower has developed a Procurement Plan (Attachment 1 to this Annex) for project
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed
between the Borrower and the Project Team on April 26,2006 and is available at the Project Management
Team's office in EUAS. It will also be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's external
website. The Procurement Plan will be updated annually inagreement with the Project Team to reflect the
actual project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.


D. FrequencyofProcurementSupervision
Inadditionto the prior review supervisionto be carriedout from Bankoffices, the capacity assessmentof
the Implementing Agency has recommended semi-annual supervision missions to visit the field to cany
out post review o fprocurement actions.

The Project Management Team in EUAS will keep a complete and up-to-date record o f all procurement
documentation and relevant correspondence in its files which will be reviewed by the Bank staff during
supervision missions.

Monitoring reports and on procurement progress inthe form o f completed-ongoing-planned procurements
will be submitted semi-annually as an integral part o f the Financial Monitoring Report on Project
implementation.

E. Other
EUASmay initiate procurement o f consulting services scheduled in2006 (or before the Loan effectiveness
date) in accordance with the Bank's Consultant Guidelines [Refer to paragraph 1.12 o f the Consultant
Guidelines]. The contracts which will have beenreviewed by the Bank may retroactively be financed by the
Bankas described inthe Loan Agreement.

Summarv
a  The hovernment forecasts electricity demand growing by about 8.3% per annum till 2010
   (and gradually slowing thereafter) whereas supply from existing plants and those under
   construction i s expectedto grow only marginally after 2005.
a   Supply shortages are expected to start in the period 2008 to 2010, depending on the actual
   growth indemand inthe interveningperiod. It i s prudent to prepare for a shortage starting in
   2008-09.
a  Rehabilitating Af9in-Elbistan A is the fastest response that the Government can provide for
   mitigating the risks to supply security. Rehabilitation can be completed in 2-3 years, and
   about 8 TWh of energy can be generated once the plant is re-commissioned. The increased
    generation from Af$n A will defer the shortages by around a year, giving the Government
    more time to arrangefor the construction of new plants to meet the shortage.
a   A rehabilitated Af9in-Elbistan A power plant is also the least cost option for additional
    generation in this time frame. After rehabilitation, the plant can generate at a discounted
    price of about 3.8 U.S.cents/kWh with an FGD. The next lowest cost option is a combined
    cycle gas plant using imported natural gas which will cost about 4.4 U.S.cents/ kWh
    (discounted).
a   The rehabilitation will reduce the dust emissions significantly - dust emissions have been
    reported by the local population as beingtheir most important concern with the plant. While
    this benefit is not quantified in the economic analysis, the health benefits are clearly
    significant.


I. ECONOMICANALYSIS

Maineconomicbenefitsofthe rehabilitation
The rehabilitation of Af9in-Elbistan A has been analyzed from two broad aspects - one, from the
point of view of its importance for ensuring supply security, and second, from the point of view
of whether the rehabilitation is the least cost generation option for Turkey. The main benefits
from the rehabilitation of Af9in Elbistan A are summarized here, and discussed in detail
thereafter:

    Security of supply -The rehabilitation of Af9in-ElbistanA can be completed very quickly,
    in 2-3 years, just in time to meet the shortages anticipated in 2009-10. The incremental
    generation from Af$n A will defer the shortages by around a year, giving the Government
    critical time to arrange for additional capacity.
    Least cost source of generation-At alevelizedprice of about 3.8 centskWhwith the FGD,
    the rehabilitated Af9in-Elbistan A i s the least cost option for additional generation.    A
    combined cycle gas plant using imported natural gas will cost about U S cents 4.4/ kWh
    (levelized).
    Reduction in dust emissions- Dust emission has been reported by the local population as
    being their most important concern with the plant, and rehabilitation will reduce dust
    significantly.

A. Security of supply
The analysis o f demand and supply forecasts shown below indicate that Turkey may beginfacing
growing shortages starting in 2008-2009 under the scenario o f high demand growth with or
without dry conditions, and 2009 under a more conservative scenario o f dry conditions and low
demand growth. The rehabilitationo f AfSin Elbistan A i s critical to meetingthe shortages.

Electricity demand and supply inTurkey
Table 9.1 below shows the growth rates o f GNP and electricity consumption for the past two
decades Inthe 1980s and 1990s, electricity demand grew at a rapid average rate o f 8.6 % but
varying from 4% to 13% per year. The impliedelectricity demand to income/GDP elasticity in
these two decades ranged from an average o f 1.00 to a high o f 5.56 but averaged 2.0. In the
current decade, demand growth has slowed owing to the economic crisis o f 2001. However,
demand has since then grown at 5.9% per year which - although representing a healthy rate o f
growth - implies an electricity demand to income/GDP elasticity averaging about 0.83.

Demand forecasts           The Government has prepared two forecasts for growth o f electricity
    .
demand. These are based on economic growth scenarios prepared by SPO and the forecasting i s
done usingthe MAEDmodel (Model for Analysis of Energy Demand) that i s runby MENR.
         High Case: Electricity demand growth o f 8.6% per year - based on a GDP growth o f
         5.5% per year. This implies electricity demand to income/GDP elasticity o f slightly over
         1.5.
         Low Case: Electricity growth rate in demand o f about 6.3% per year. This i s based on
         the same forecast o f GDP growth but makes different assumptions in the MAED model
         about the composition o f manufacturing. It assumes that Turkish manufacturing moves
         towards less energy intensive industries compared to the high case. This implies an
         income elasticity of about 1.0.

These forecasts are inTable 9.3 as the "high case" and the "low case" respectively.

Energy Intensity The Bank reviewedthe energy intensity o fthe Turkisheconomy as part o fthe
Energy and Environment Review work. Turkey has been below the OECD average energy
intensity measured as total primary energy supplied divided by GDP measured on a purchasing
power parity basis. Ifinstead o f usingpurchasing power parity, GDP were measured based on an
exchange rate basis, Turkey would be at or a little above the OECD average intensity although
considerably lower than some developed OECD countries. While this leaves considerable room
for growth in energy demand, unlike most o f Eastern Europe Turkey has not had subsidized
energy and therefore has not developed the highdegree o f energy intensity so common inEastern

  There were some negative elasticities also when electricity demand continued to grow duringrecessions.

The Government i s endeavoring to improve energy efficiency over time through various demand
side means as well as supply side efforts such as improvement o f power plant operations.
However, electricity demand is likely to witness an offsetting factor in the rapid growth o f
urbanization (and especially the rapid growth o f air conditioning loads especially along the
Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas). The high growth anticipated in demand forecasts
discussed above therefore, seem consistent with comparable energy intensity across countries.

ExistingCapacity and Addition Projections As o f end 2004 Turkey had 36,822 MW o f
installed generating capacity, o f which about 60% i s owned and operated by EUA$ and its
affiliates, with the remaining under private operation. The last 4 years (2000-2004), have seen a
steady increase in generating capacity, a compounded average growth o f 8% per annum. Almost
this entire increase in capacity (99%) came from the private sector, and EUAS' share of total
capacity declined from 80% in2000 to about 59% in2004.

Generating capacity i s adequate to meet the current level o f demand and there i s adequate
reserves capacity to meet the anticipated increase in demand over the next few years.                          A
significant amount o f capacity (2,573 MW) has been completed in 2005 (mostly lignite fired
power plants' and hydro power plants being built by EUAS) taking the total capacity to about
39,000 MW. However, after that there are few additions to capacity anticipated, and compounded
average annual growth from 2005 to 2010 i s expected to be only 1% (the growth in energy
availability i s even lower). Table 9.2 below shows the growth in existing installed capacity, and
the forecast 2010 capacity.

Energyoutput sensitivityto hydro conditions The                  Turkish electricity        system     i s  very
dependent on hydropower output. The present share o f hydropower capacity is about 34% and
this is expected to increase to 37% by 2010. Ina normal rainfall year, hydro energy contributes

around 30% o f total energy availability. In dry periods therefore, which occur very regularly in
Turkey, hydropower production drops sharply and can reduce the ability o f the country to
produce hydro electricityby as muchas 40%.

Supply Forecasts This analysis has used three forecasts o f supply growth (shown inTable 9.3
     ...
below). These forecasts are based on estimates by the TEIAS Planning Group o f the expected
generation ability o f existingplants and plants under construction:
           Dry conditionssupply forecast assumes lower than average rainfall in each year in the
           future and that Af$n ElbistanA i s not rehabilitated,
           Normal hydro conditions forecast assumes average rainfall in the future also without
           rehabilitation o f Afgin ElbistanA, and
           The last forecast assumes normal hydro and rehabilitation of Afyin-Elbistan A as
           planned.
Because o f the continuing growth o f demand and the slower growth innew capacity after 2005,
Turkey i s expected to begin experiencing shortages of energy in the latter part o f this decade
unless additional capacity, which i s not currently planned, i s provided. Inthe scenario with "dry
conditions", Turkey would start to run short o f electricity in 2008 inthe "high demand case", and
in 2009 in the "low demand case".            Under a scenario with "normal hydro conditions", the
shortfall occurs in2009 inthe "high demand case", and in2011inthe "low demand case". These
results are shown in Table 9.3 below. While it i s more realistic to anticipate shortages in 2009-
10, it i s prudent to be conservative and to prepare for a shortage starting in2008-09.

Peaking shortage Inaddition to the energy shortages shown inthe table below, Turkey will also
face peaking shortages in the future under current demand and supply forecasts. Additional
capacity to meet peak demand i s thus also required, but this requirement i s less urgent than that
for base load generating capacity to meet energy requirements. For example, in the "high case",
additional peaking capacity i s not required until 2010 compared with the requirement for
additional energy in 2008. This delay in the requirement for peaking capacity relative to the
requirement for energy occurs because Turkey has a lot o f hydropower which can provide peak
load intimes of peak requirements but provides much less annual generation since water supplies
for generation are limited.

The main benefit from the rehabilitation o f Afqin-Elbistan A i s that the plant will be able to
supply substantial additional electricity to meet the potential supply shortages shown above.
Currently, the plant generates around 2.6 TWh-3.0 TWh at a capacity factor o f about 30% (based
on the net effective capacity o f 1,040 MW). Further, it i s a strong possibility that in the absence
of major overhaul, the plant's capacity will deteriorate, and its generation will decline over time
until it cannot run anymore. After rehabilitation on the other hand, the capacity o f Afqin A is
expected to go back to design conditions o f about 1360 MW gross and 1200 MW net. Generating
at a capacity factor o f about 75%, Afyin A will thus be capable o f producing at least 8 TWh per
year while being used as a base load plant. The rehabilitation will further extend the remaining
economic life significantly, enabling this high level o f generation to continue for a much longer
time than i s presently possible.

The rehabilitation o f Afqin-Elbistan A provides the Government with the quickest source o f
additional energy at a time to meet the impending shortages. On its own, the rehabilitation can
prevent shortages for about a year. Thereafter, other sources o f generation will be required.
Given however, that most types o f generating plant will take 3-5 years to construct, the
rehabilitation o f Afyin Elbistan A gives very critical breathing space for additional capacity to be
plannedand implemented.


B. Least cost source of generation

The rehabilitation o f Afyin-Elbistan A i s the least cost means o f providing additional electricity
generation in Turkey. The Bank team's estimate o f the economic cost o f generation from a
rehabilitated AfSin ElbistanA i s a levelized cost (discounted at 10%) o f 3.8 U S centskWh with
an FGD. These calculations are based on a cost o f rehabilitation excluding VAT o f US$ 453
million and a cost for the FGD o f US$ 250 million. The rehabilitated plant i s expected to have a
capacity factor of 75%.




                                                      57

The key factor in determining the cost o f generation from the rehabilitated plant i s the cost o f the
lignite. Lignite costs from the Afgin Elbistanmine were US$ 5.9 per ton for the first 10months o f
2005. Currently the mine is operating at about 15 Million tons per year, compared to capacity o f
18 million tons, and it i s primarily supplyingthe Afgin Elbistan B Power Plant. For the past five
years (1999-2004) costs have varied between US$ 3.27 per ton and US$ 11.46 per ton depending
almost entirely on capacity utilization at the mine. Most o f the costs in the mine are fixed and
when production is down, as for example in 2004 (6.1 million tons), then costs are high at US$
11.46 per ton. When the mine is operating at close to full capacity, as in 1999(17.5 million tons),
then the cost is low at US$3.27 per ton.

Looking ahead the current mine will needto be upgraded at an estimated cost o f US$ 140million
spread over 10 years. Also the mine will need to be expanded or a new mine built so that there
will be adequate capacity to supply not only the Afgin Elbistan A Power Plant but also the Afgin
Elbistan B Power Plant .The mine expansion or new mine will have to have capacity also of 18
million tons per year. Based on an RWE study on mine expansion options, it appears that the
least cost approach may be to expand the existing mine, as opposed to developing a new mine.
RWE has estimated that an expansion of the existing mine would cost about US$ 354 million.
The team made a simulation o f the economic cost o f coal from an expanded and upgraded mine
based on the estimated capital costs indicated above as well as current mining costs including
labor, electricity, materials etc. Over a 20 year period the levelized economic cost o f the coal
would be about US$ 5.80 in2006 dollars, and this was used for estimating the cost o f generation
from the rehabilitated Afgin Elbistan A Power Plant.

The heating value o f the coal from the Afgin Elbistan Mine i s quite low. The power plant was
designed on the assumption that the heating value i s about 1050 kcalkg. However, the actual
heating value has been somewhat higher with the mining staff claiming it is close to 1200
kcalkg. To be on the conservative side the Bank team assumed 1100 kcal/kg. If 1200 Kcalkg
were usedit would reduce the levelizedcost o f generationby about 0.1 U S cents.

Given that the rehabilitated plant will be the least cost option for Turkey under any scenario and
have low incremental costs, it will rank very high in the merit order, and will begin dispatching
from the moment it i s commissioned. Afgin ElbistanA is thus likely to displace some higher cost
plants such as plants runon expensive fuel oil or natural gas that currently have to be dispatched
to meet the energy demand. This will result in fuel cost savings for EUAS, but these benefits are
not currently factored into the economic analysis.

Other alternative sources of generation Table 9.4 below gives the respective discounted cost
o f production for different new generating plants. The next least cost alternative would be a
combined cycle gas generation plant using imported natural gas. The cost o f power from a new
combined cycle is estimatedas 4.4 U S cents per kwh(levelized). This estimate assumes capacity
utilization at SO%, construction costs o f $600kW excluding interest during construction (IDC)
and a technical efficiency factor o f 55%.

Currently, EUAS pays US$277 per thousand cubic meters for gas. Ifgas costs were to remain at
this high level a new combined cycle plant would generate at a cost o f over 6 U S centskwh.
However, natural gas prices paid by EUAS follow crude oil and product prices with a lag. They
are in effect indexed to a moving average o f crude and product prices. The Bank's forecast of
crude oil prices was used to forecast the sales price o f natural gas in Turkey to electricity
generators. This price drops from US$277 per thousand cubic meters today to US$ 192 in 2015
after which it begins to rise slowly. Based on this forecast o f natural gas sales prices in Turkey
the levelized cost o f generation froma combined cycle plant i s 4.4 U S cents/kwh.


                                                 58

A combinedcycle plant can also be builtquite rapidly. Most o fthe equipment is off-the-shelf and
a new combined cycle plant could be available to operate in a few years. All o f the other
alternative power plants discussed below would take longer because they have to be individually
designed with most of the equipment specifically built for that particular plant.

For the imported coal plants, capital cost i s assumed at US$978/kW, fuel cost o f US$ 60 per ton,
coal with a calorific value o f 6000 Kcalkg, 38% efficiency, and a 75% capacity utilization factor.
The resultant levelized cost o f production i s 4.9 U S centskwh. (Ifcoal prices were to fall to US$
45 per ton then the cost o f generation would be reduced to around 4.3 cents.) In the unlikely
scenario where an FGD i s required (the new importedcoal plant at Iskenderun has one although it
i s not required to meet Turkish emission standards if low sulfur coal i s used) it raises the cost
from 4.9 U S centsfkwh to 5.2 U S cents/ kwh.

Another alternative would be to buildan entirely new plant at Afyin Elbistan (Afvin Elbistan C).
This new plant would however, be substantially more expensive than the rehabilitation o f Afvin
A. Based on information provided by the TEIAS planning group, RWE and the actual cost o f
Afqin B, it is estimated that a new Afqin C with an FGDwould cost around $ 1.98 billion. Thus
a new Afqin C would cost over twice as much as rehabilitation o f Afqin A. In addition the new
plant would take longer to construct and would be unlikely to be available before 2011. Finally
the levelized cost of production from this plant (assuming the same coal costs as for Afvin A and
37% efficiency) is about 4.9 U S centsfkwh           - significantly above the cost o f production fiom a
rehabilitated Afqin A (including an FGD)o f 3.8 U S centskwh.

Table 9.4 below shows several other options. The first i s a fluidized bed plant, which does not
need an FGD, and would cost around US$ 1416kW to build. The lignite cost is assumed to be
US$21 per ton with a calorific value o f 2470 Kcalfkg., it i s assumed to have 38% efficiency and
to operate at 75% capacity. At current coal prices it appears to have about the same cost as an
imported coal plant. The estimated cost o f nuclear power o f 4.4 centsfkwh i s based on a cost o f
construction o f US$ 1750kW. The wind power cost depends on the capacity utilization factor
which in turn i s site-specific and cannot be generalized. The estimated wind energy cost of 7.1
US cents/ kwhis TEIAS' estimate for a new plant ina reasonable location.

The table also shows an estimated cost for electricity imports fiom Bulgaria. This cost i s based
on what Bulgaria's Balkan neighbors pay to import electricity since Turkey does not currently
import any energy. Moreover, this source o f electricity is limited. The Balkans are becoming
power short and Bulgarian exports may not be available in substantial amounts when the nuclear
units, Kozloduy 3 and 4 are closed as i s currently planned.

C. Environmental benefits

The plant dust emissions are far in excess o f Turkish emission standards, even at its current low
level o f utilization, and this is a major problem for the population inthe immediate area. Most o f
the complaints inthe area relate to the dust levels perceived to be caused by the plant. As part o f
the project, the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) at the plant will be rehabilitated and as a result
dust emissions are expected to decline sharply. While dust emissions exceed Turkish standards,
the current ambient dust conditions for the smaller dust particles (PM,,)              around the plant as
measured by the EIA consultants were within the permissible daily limits (a maximum o f 300
micrograms per cubic meter 95% o f the time). However, the plant i s operating at a low level. If
the plant were to operate at a higher capacity (which would be needed after 2008) without
improving the ESPs, the ambient dust conditions are expected to exceed the Turkish Standards
more than 5% o f the time. Modeling shows that after rehabilitation o f the ESPs, ambient dust
(PM,,)     levels are reduced by almost 99% and under the conditions o f full capacity Turkish
ambient dust standards would be met. The main benefit from this i s likely to be a lower incidence
o f respiratory disease. In addition, the local population argues that settleable dust which should
be trapped by the ESPs are settling on crops and reducingproductivity. This issue should also be
minimized when the ESPs are rehabilitated.                  Neither o f these benefits, however, has been
quantifiedinthe economic analysis.

Economic Rate of Return (ERR)- The Project has an ERR of 25%.
The economic value o f the incremental electricity from the plant is considerable whether it is
valued based on the wholesale price o f electricity, or it is valued based on the cost o f unserved
energy. Unserved energy i s energy which i s indemand but i s not supplied because o f a shortage
o f supply or transmission constraints etc. Given that the rehabilitated Afyin A will enable the
existing demand to be met, it i s possible to assign an economic value to this electricity based on
the cost o f unserved energy. Estimates" o f the cost o f unserved energy are typically in the range
o f US$ 0.50 to US$ 1.00 per kWh- this value derives from the cost that a shortage imposes on
consumers such as industries and relates to the costs o f coping mechanisms or the costs o fceasing
operations. Using a value o f 38.5 Euro cents/ kwh" for unserved energy, which was used by
Bank consultants working in the Balkans, the additional electricity from the rehabilitated Afyin-
Elbistan A would be worth about US$ 2 billion per year, providing the project with a payback
period o f 4 months and producing an ERR o f more than 100%.

A more realistic estimation of economic rate o f return i s however, based on the forecast level of
wholesale prices inTurkey once a market i s fully functioning. This has been assumed to be about
5.0 U S centskWh. Using 5.0 US cents as the value o f the incremental electricity generated by
the rehabilitation o f Afyin Elbistan A provides the rehabilitation project with an ERR o f 25%

including the FGD. The financial rate o f return which includes taxes that would be paid by the
plant, but otherwise has the same assumptions as the economic analysis, i s 22.1%.

Sensitivity Tests A number o f sensitivity tests were done on the project to ascertain the impact
of variations invarious parameters as follows:
         Increase inlignite prices,
         Increase inrehabilitationcosts,
         Reduction inelectricity prices,
         Reduction inthe estimatedlife o f the plant after rehabilitation, and
         Reductioninthe output o f the plant.

As can be seen from the table below, the rehabilitationproject is very robust to changes inthese
parameters and remains quite attractive under different sensitivities.

11.      FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

The Government has decided to create 7 companies from EUAS (including the successor
company o f EUAS, EUAS Hydro, which will operate the large hydros). One o f these companies
-Af9inGENCO-willcontaintheAfgin-ElbistanAandBplants. AfyinGENCOalsoincludes
the Hopa (Fuel Oil) and Altinkaya, Derbent, and Karkamis (Hydro) plants, with the total effective
installed capacity o f about 3,400 MW before rehabilitation, and 3,788 MW after rehabilitation.
Annex 9 contains a detailed discussion o f the historical and forecast financial condition of EUAS,
as well as the estimated future financial condition o f Af9in GENCO. The timeline for the
creation o f AfSin GENCO has not been finalized, but the accounts o f the company have been
separated and these are usedto forecast the financial condition.

Past andCurrent FinancialPerformance-EUAS

Profitability and Cash Flow              EUAS'Sprofitability has beenreasonable throughthe period (the
abnormal changes shown below fiom year to year are due to adjustments in foreign exchange and
in inflation).     The inordinate increase in revenues and average sales per unit in some years i s
primarily on account o f the impact o f favorable changes inthe generation mix, and not because o f
increase in tariffs. EUAS' cash flow, with its debt service amount and its receivables beingat a
significant level, i s a concern for the future, and inthe past, EUAS has managed primarily due to
its non-payment to suppliers and due to the low level o f investments that have been permitted by
the Government. Table 9.6 below shows a summary o f EUAS's historical financial performance
(EUASwas created in2001 and the income statement for that year i s thus only for 3 months).

In 2004, the Debt to Equity ratio improved from 0.7 to 0.4 with the increase in paid in capital
from about US$ 800 million to US$ 5.2 billion. Equity capital was increased by conversion o f
accumulated capital reserve to equity capital, and does not involve cash infusions. Improvement
inDebt to Equityratio and Debt Service Coverage indicates that EUAShas room for additional
financing. However, the vulnerability of the cash flow from debt service and receivables should
be kept inmind.

Arrears for Sale of Electricity

At the end of 2005, EUAShad an estimatedUS$2.8 billionof outstanding trade receivables from
TETAS, representing about 11months o f electricity sales. There was also an additional US$ 900
million o f Other Receivables carried over from the time of the restructuring o f TEAS, which
includes receivables for sale o f electricity. The rate o f accumulation o f receivables has decreased
significantly in the past two years on account o f improvement in collection efficiency from
484%% in 2002 to 36% in 2004 (see Table 9.7). In the past, EUAS has financed these large
receivables by building up payables, which have accumulated to over a year o f fuel purchases,
primarily to public economic enterprises that supply fuel such as TKI, TTK and BOTAS.
Currently the longer payable period allows EUAS to generate sufficient cash flow, but also i s a
risk factor in the future cash flow and financial projections as these entities work to collect their
receivables.

                                  Table 9.7: Receivablesand Payables- EUAS




EUAS' receivable accumulation is due to the collection shortfalls o f the Turkish Electricity
Distribution Corporation, TEDAS. TEDAS receivables have been growing due to the following
reasons:
(a)        TEDAS' collections, although improving over time, currently average only 90% o f sales
           revenue.
(b)        50% o f the accumulated receivable i s from the public sector, which prevents aggressive
           enforcement o f collection. Municipalities are particularly notorious for not paying their
           bills-they alone account for about US$ 1.3 billiono fthe accumulated receivables.

The burden o f receivables gets passed on from one company to the next (see Figure 9.1 below),
resulting in cash shortfalls being financed by increasing payables to the next company in the
chain. The issue i s complicated further by the fact that at the time o f the break-up o f TEAS in
2001, the receivables were not settled but carried over to the newly restructured companies. The
accounting systems of the SOEs do not indicate readily the actual "age" o f these receivables, thus
it i s difficult to calculate the loss inNPV terms. Ideally, these receivables would be provisioned,
and thereafter written off, but this has not been the practice in the government-owned electricity
utilities.




                                                        63

The issue o f receivables from Government agencies has two facets to it - first, the stock or
"overhang", i.e., the accumulation o f receivables over the past, and second, the ongoing problems
related with nonpayment o f current bills by public agencies. Receivables from the public sector
including municipalities and street lighting make up about 47% o f the accumulated receivables as
o f November 2005 - and these are receivables that TEDAS cannot pursue aggressively through
the use o f disconnections and legal actions. Accumulated receivables inflate the balance sheet o f
electricity utilities unrealistically, since there i s little prospect o f such dues being collected in
their entirety.

Addressing the stock of accumulated receivables from all government agencies EUAS and
the Government are evaluating solutions for addressing the issue o f accumulated receivables.
Among the options being considered i s the settlement o f cross-dues among government agencies.
The legal and fiscal implicationso f such action are beingcarefully considered. Specific attention
i s being given to avoiding the issue o f moral hazard which could result from a perverse incentive
on the part o f the companies as well as consumers to not behave commercially. The Bank will
remain engaged inthis discussion with the Government through its policy dialog.

Specifically with regard to municipalities, which are the largest concern interms o f nonpayment,
the Government has processed new legislation which aims to improve payment discipline. The
Law on Municipality (Law No. 5393), ratified in July 2005, provides for the establishment o f a
"Reconciliation Committee" under the Undersecretariat o f Treasury. The Committee i s expected
to focus on the restructuring o f accumulated receivables and debts to public institutions and
authorities by municipalities, affiliates and companies in which a municipality owns shares more
than 50%. One gas utility has already undergone this process, and the payment schedule has been
agreed among all parties.         The process is an important step in strengthening financial
responsibility o f the public sector, although the fact that the participation to the process i s
voluntary leaves room for doubt on its enforceability.

Addressing the problem of poor collections from government agencies Even ifthe overhang
i s resolved through a combination o f means, the real problem o f cash flows will continue, since
this will not address the ongoing nonpayment by municipalities and other government agencies.
The Government i s considering several mechanisms, including legislative changes that would
allow SOEs to enforce collections against public sector entities. Inaddition, there will also be a
need for adequate budgeting, especially for municipalities, for electricity bill payment on an
ongoing basis.

Forecast Financial Performance of EUA$

Table 9.8 below shows the forecast financial performance o f EUAS. The impacts from the rehabilitation
project are factored in (these impacts are discussed later, while discussing the finances o f AfSin GENCO).
The forecasts are based on conservative assumptions regarding commercial efficiency improvements such
as collections. No significant gains from privatization o f distribution or generation are factored in. The
forecasts also assume that EUAS will no longer be able to defer its fuel and other purchases, and that
gradually payables will reduce to approach normal commercial levels. Due to the forecast electricity
shortage in 2009, EUAS will have to ramp up generation from its high-cost diesel and fuel oil plants,
which will raise variable costs even after assuming that the diesel plant i s converted to LNG. The
projections assume that the fuel oil plants will begin operating in 2008, and the resulting increase in cost
will necessitate a marginal increase in tariffs               -the current tariff regulations allow a pass through o f fuel
costs. The diesel plant has not been factored insince there are plans to upgrade the plant to enable the use
o f natural gas, and the timeframe for this investment i s not clear at this stage.

Profitability and Cash Flow           As shown in the table above, despite the pressure o f increased
investments and financing, EUAS' profitability i s projected to be sustained at current levels. Cash flows
are projected to be constrained by the tightening o f credit terms and the increase in debt servicing
requirements, but are expected to remain at reasonable levels. EUAS' internal resources are considered
sufficient for financing the increase in the investment program, with the self-financing ratio remaining
above 25% inthe future. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) will decline over time as debt servicing
increases, but i s expected to remain above 1.5 throughout the forecast period.

The decline inprofitability from 2005 to 2006 i s attributable to the transfer o f hydro assets, as well as the
commissioningo f Afgin ElbistanB (US$2.5 billion). Due to the forecast supply shortage in2009, EUAS
will have to ramp up generate from its high-cost hardcoal and fuel oil plants, which raisesthe costs. As a
result, EUAS' profitability decreases slightly, and will require marginal tariff increases from 2010
onwards. The commissioningo f the Afgin Elbistan A plant will assist in lowering operating costs and an
increase in output, leading to a positive impact on the bottom-line. Indeed, the rehabilitation will offset
some of the increases incosts from other factors, thus reducingthe pressure on the tariff.

The main assumptionsdrivingthe forecasts are briefly discussed below.

DemandForecast           The Government has prepared two forecasts for growth o f electricity demand.
These are based on economic growth scenarios prepared by SPO and the forecasting is done using the
MAED model (Model for Analysis o f Energy Demand) that is run by MENR (Refer to the Economic
Analysis section above for details).

The low caseprojection o f demand used inthe financial projection as the base case.

Generation Projection            Least cost dispatch i s assumed inprojecting the generation projections, through
the simulation o f a merit order dispatch based on unit variable cost. Based on the base case demand
forecast, the hard coal and fuel oil plants which are partially dispatched until 2008 are assumed to
dispatch to their capacity thereafter, the diesel fired plant (Aliaga) is not assumed to be dispatched as
conversion of the plant to LNG-fired plant i s being planned due to its high cost o f generation (about
$0.40/Kwh in fuel cost alone). Among the main factors here are the commissioning o f Afgin-Elbistan B
in2006 andthe rehabilitationofAfgin-ElbistanA.

Transfer of Hydro Assets Historically, DSI (State Hydraulic Works) has been responsible for the
construction, and EUAS has been responsible for the operation, o f hydroelectric dams. Therefore,
although EUAShad costs and revenues o f these dams on its income statement, it did not have these assets
on the balance sheet. In line with the market liberalization policies, these hydro assets (31 dams, total
original book value o f US$ 11 billion) are planned to be transferred to EUAS in 2006. Although the
details o f the transfer are uncertain at this stage, the forecasts assume that the transfer o f hydro assets to
EUAS fixed assets would be "balanced" with the injection o f equity capital.

Tariff Level Assumptions with regard to tariff increases are driven by cash (a target self financing ratio
o f at least 25%) and debt servicing requirements (target DSCR o f at least 1.2). The financial burden o f
debt service and receivables will require EUAS to increase its tariffs by about 3% in 2006. After this
period, tariffs will ease up and decrease over time as a result o f the positive impact o f the rehabilitation.
Thereafter, once debt servicing for the investments begin, tariffs will require gradual increases from 2010.

Investments       The investment requirement for EUAS is large in the medium term, with most o f the
investments in rehabilitation and maintenance. The investment needs in the next five years amount to
more than US$ 2 billion (including 15% contingency), adding to the debt service burden. The amount
required for rehabilitation o f existing plants and FGD installations on thermal plants is forecast at US$
223 million per year starting from 2011, and in addition to the identified investments inthe medium-term.
No investment has been assumed for new plant construction, as there are no current plans for EUAS to
buildnew generating capacity.

                                  Table 9.10: InvestmentSchedule EUAS  -


(The above estimatesinclude 15% contingency)

Capital Structure The increase incapital structure in2004, along with capital increase expected from
the transfer o f hydro assets will provide EUAS with the cushion it needs to manage its large liabilities,
with the debt to equity ratio o f only 0.1 throughout the entire project period. Debt service coverage is
expectedto be maintained at the range o f 1.7 and 2.2, fluctuating as debt service for midterm investments
starts.

Trade Receivablesand Payables Conservative assumptions have beentaken inlight o f the uncertainty
surrounding the receivables. Collection efficiency i s assumed to gradually improve to 90% by 2007 and
stabilize thereafter. On the other hand, the projections assume that the large accumulation o f payables




                                                        68

will not be tolerated inthe future. Payables are assumed to decrease gradually to 90 days o f purchases by
2015.

Forecast Financial Performanceof Afgin GENCO

Af$inGENCO is vulnerable to risks relating to collections, significant investment program in the near
future, and the resulting increase in debt service liability. The large debt servicing liability i s primarily
due to the construction o f Af$in Elbistan B over the past 5 years and its financing through a JBIC-
syndicated loan o f JPY 5.85 billion (approximately US$ 494 million). Inaddition to the rehabilitation,
additional investments will be required for Afyin GENCO in the near future, such as the lignite mine
expansion (EUR 424 million) and FGD installation to Af$n Elbistan A (EUR 181 million). As a result,
the debt servicing obligation (interest and principal repayment) i s expected to increase from US$ 121
millionin2005 to US$253 million in2015.

Although these risks pose a significant burden on AfSin GENCO financials, the cash flow i s expected to
remain reasonable due to the cash cover from depreciation and increase in generation output as result o f
the rehabilitation. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio i s expected to be at 1.3 in 2005, but will improve to
2.0 in 2007 then decline gradually to 1.3 from 2013 onwards, as debt servicing requirements start
increasing. The self-financing ratio i s expected to remain above 25%, indicating an ability to finance the
additional investments. The leveraging i s also at a conservative 0.7 in 2005 and will gradually decrease
to 0.3 in2015, as planned investments end at 2010.

The main assumptions used inthe forecasts are discussed below briefly.

Improvements from Rehabilitation                   The rehabilitation i s expected to increase the effective installed
capacity o f AfSin ElbistanA plant from 1,000 MW to 1,360 MW. It i s also expected to not only improve
the efficiency o f the plant, but also to improve the consistency o f the lignite fuel through improvements in
the lignite feeder system. The net efficiency o f the plant i s expected to improve from 27% to 31%,
though internalenergy consumption o f the FGD unit lowers the efficiency to 30.6% from 2011.

 Generation Forecast For the projection o f generation by AfSin GENCO, the least-cost dispatch based
 on variable costs were assumed. Under this assumption, all o f the plants under Afvin GENCO would be
 dispatched (hydro and lignite plants).

 Tariff Levels and Profitability Tariffs have been set to achieve break-even profits and positive cash
 flows. The commissioning o f Afvin Elbistan B, and the resulting increase in depreciation decreases the
 profitability      ratios from 2007, but the significant increase in generation and efficiency gains from the
 rehabilitation o f the Afyin Elbistan A plant results in a significant decrease incosts, and hence inaverage
 tariffs, by about average o f 7 % in2009 and 2010. The start of repayment for the rehabilitation and other
 requirements will be off-set somewhat by the decrease in lignite price due to economy o f scale, as it
 gradually decreases from US$ 7/ ton to below US$ 6/ ton by 2013 after the mine expansion.




                                                                 70

Investment Plan The investment requirements for Genco inthe medium term are significant. The lignite
mine that supplies both Af$n Elbistan A and B, would need significant expansion to accommodate the
lignite demand o f Af9in B after the rehabilitated Af$inElbistan A plant i s re-commissioned. Lignite
productionis expected to increase from the current 18 million tons per year to 30 million tons per year in
2008 after the expansion of the mine i s completed. The preliminary total investment amount estimate for
the mine expansion i s EUR 424 million (excluding 15% contingency). The FGD installation i s assumed
to be required after the 5-year transition period. The estimated cost o f investment i s EUR 181 million.
The investment programs beyond 2010 have not been formulated yet.

A.        Environment

The Afvin-Elbistan A plant uses local lignite, which has a sulfur content o f 0.7% on average13. Currently,
the plant i s in compliance with the Turkish ambient air quality standards for SOz. The power station
emissions o f sulfur dioxide (SO2) however, exceed Turlush regulations. Air quality modeling done as
part o f the EIA shows that after rehabilitation, the plant will continue to comply with ambient air quality
requirements for SO2.

Duringpublic consultations as part o fthe EL4process, dust emissionswere citedbythe localpopulace as
the most significant environmental impact inthe vicinity o f the plant. The project includes rehabilitation
o f the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) which will reduce dust emissions from current levels o f 400-6000
mg/Nm3to 100mg/Nm3inaccordance with Turkishregulations.

Inaddition to significant positiveenvironmental impacts -by greatly reducingparticulate emissions, the
rehabilitation scope for Afvin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Station i s designed to improve the reliability,
availability and efficiency, and to extend the plant's operating life.

TheEnvironmentalImpact Assessment(EIA)
EUAS used a PHRD grant for the environmental impact assessment (EM), which was carried out by a
consortium comprising Cinar and KEMA. Though Turkish EL4 regulations did not require an EIA for
this project, the EIA was carried out per Turkish and World Bank guidelines.                             The Ministry o f
Environment and Forestry (MOEF)reviewed and approved the EIA on September 9, 2005 (EIA Positive
Certificate Issued). The EIA concluded that:

               The rehabilitation o f the ESPs on the main stack gas and the Bruden stacks is essential to
               address the dust and particulate emission problems.
               With Afvin-Elbistan A Power Plant operating at full load after rehabilitatiodupgrade, the
               Afvin Elbistan airshed will meet both the long-term and short-term Turlush air quality
               standards for SO2.

The Afvin-Elbistan A Power Plant operating at full load will not meet Turlush SO2emission standards. In
the evaluation o f the EIA by MoEF however, it was recognized that plant performance does not affect
compliance with Turkish air quality standards for SOz in the plant vicinity.                    Since the plant exceeds
emission standards for SOz, the Government has evaluated the option o f installing an FGD on Afgin
Elbistan A, along with all the other existing thermal plants. MoEF has decided to provide each thermal
plant with a transition period for complying with emission limits, and has prepared an amendment to the
Regulation for the Control o f Air Pollution Caused by Industrial Facilities (RCAP). This amendment
provides an extension of time by 5 years for installing the FGD in order to comply with SO2emission
requirements. Providing time extensions for FGD installations i s not unusual because of the substantial
investment costs. The EUhas granted such extensions to candidate members such as Romania (for 8 to
 10years) as well as newlyjoined members, such as Poland (for 5-12 years).


l3 chemical characteristics ofthe lignite are
  The                                            highly variable: calcium oxide content in ash can vary from 8% to 78%, and
sulfur content can vary from 0.5% to 2.5% as a result.


                                                             72

 Compliancewith Turkishenvironmentalregulations Turhsh environmental regulations encompass
 ambient air quality standards as well as emission standards. The Regulation on Air Quality Protection
 (RAQP) provides the short term and long term ground level concentrations limits (ambient air quality
 standards) to be observed in a defined impact area. The Regulation for the Control of Air Pollution
 Causedby IndustrialFacilities (RCAP) defines the limits for stack gas emissions for specific industries.

 The following table summarizes Turhsh ambient air quality standards and the modeled results (per the
 EM) for the existing situation, and post-rehabilitation for the plant runningat full load. As a basis for
 comparison with Turkishstandards, EUair quality standards are also presentedinthe table below.

  Currently, the plant i s incompliance with Turhshambient air quality requirements for SOz. As indicated
  inthe table above, air quality modeling results carriedout as part of the environmental assessment (EA)
  show that after rehabilitation, the Afgin Elbistan airshed will continue to comply with Turhsh short term
  and long term air quality limits. The plant will also generally comply with EU standards and will also be
  within the World Bank indicators for good air quality (annual average concentration above 80 pg/Nm3is
  considered as moderately degraded air quality; average concentration above 100 pg/Nm3i s considered as
  poor air q ~ a l i t y )in the impact area o f the project. While over the project impact area, air quality i s
                          ' ~
  within international standards and guidelines, modeling indicates that at two locations out o f 12 villages
  inthe project impact area, air quality falls outside the levelsprovidedinthe Bank guidelines, and that at
  an additional three villages the air quality may not comply with the stricter WHO guidelines
  (50pg/Nm3)'5. When the FGD unit i s installed at the end o f the transition period all international
  standards for ambient levels o f sulfur dioxide will be incompliance.

  The plant currently does not comply with regulations regarding particulate emissions, though modeling
  shows that after rehabilitation, particulate emissions reduce dramatically and the plant begins complying
  with Turhshregulations (100 pg/Nm3).The Turhshstandard is the same as the relevant EUstandard as
  well as the Bank's guideline for dust emission for a plant with the size and fuel type such as that o f Af8in
  Elbistan A - the ESPs are therefore designed to meet both EU and World Bank standarddguidelines on
  dust emissions for rehabilitatedthermal power stations.


  l4PollutionPrevention and Abatement Handbook, 1998
  l5These are indicative statistics, and do not represent a non-compliance, since the guidelines and standards referred to here apply
  over a wide geographic area and not specifically to a particular point of measurement.


                                                                  73

NOzemissions from the plant are also in compliance with the regulations and will remain incompliance
after rehabilitation.

Stack emissions o f sulfur dioxide (SO2)however, are inthe range o f 2,000-15,000 mg/Nm3depending on
the sulfur content o f the lignite, while Turlush regulations specify an emission limit o f 1000 mg/Nm3.
The plant therefore, requires the installation o f flue gas desulphurization (FGD) units inthe plant inorder
to enable compliance with emission regulations.

Time extensionfrommeetingemissionrequirementsof the RCAP                     The Government has evaluated
the option o f installing FGDs on existing thermal power plants, including Afgin A. Inthe evaluation o f
the EL4 for Afgin A by MoEF, it was recognized that plant performance does not affect compliance with
Turkishair quality standards for SO2inthe plant vicinity. MoEF has therefore, prepared an amendment
to the RCAP allowing plants with a 5-year time extension from the requirement o f meeting emission
standards. This amendment i s currently being processed and i s expected to be approved in early-2006.
Thus, AfginA is currently requiredto install an FGDin5 years. Providing time extensions is not unusual
because o f the substantial investment costs involved in retrofitting existing plants with FGDs. The EU
has regularly granted such transition periods to candidate members as well as newly joined members.
Turkey also hopes to negotiate the Environment and Energy chapters o f the EUAcquis Communautaire
and hopes to be providedsimilar time extensions from the requirements o f these chapters.

The investment requirement in an FGD i s substantial, estimated to be in the range o f US$ 120-170
million. The Task Team agrees with the Government decision to provide time extensions for installing
FGDs, and believes that such an investment should bejustified on the basis o f signifcant current and/or
projected or potential environmental impacts from the sulfur dioxide emission levels. For this primary
reason, the Task Team with concurrence o f the ECA Regional Safeguards Unit assigned the project
EnvironmentalAssessment (EA) Category A, in accordance with World Bank Environmental Assessment
policies and procedures (OP/BP/GP 4.01). The chief objectives o f the EIA were to: (a) assess impacts to
the human, physical and biological environment from current, past and future (post-rehabilitation)
operations o f the Af$in-Elbistan A Thermal Power station, and (b) function as a decision document for
both the Government o f Turkey and the World Bank to establish the need for an FGD with future
operations o f the rehabilitated plant.

The EA process involved extensive monitoring o f existing air quality conditions and detailed modeling o f
air quality under a variety o f scenarios aimed at examining the incremental effect o f the power station
rehabilitation and installation o f an FGD unit. The EA consultants, Cinar and KEMA, utilized the U S
EPA ISCST3 (Industrial Source Complex Short Term) model for forecasting air quality conditions under
these scenarios.

The EA study determined that air quality impacts from: (a) the smallest particulates (PMlo) emitted from
the power station and normally associated with human health effects are within the Turlush ambient air
quality standards, (b) the larger particulates, possibly linked to impacts upon agricultural production, are
the main problem (as shown by the feedback during consultations), (c) sulfur dioxide levels and nitrogen
oxides levels are within Turkish regulatory requirements for ambient air quality, (d) air quality modeling
results for current plant operations are inagreement with the air quality measurements, and (e) no impacts
on soils or water quality are evident from current plant operations. Furthermore, as mentioned above, air
quality modeling results indicated that the plant, after rehabilitation, would be in compliance with
regulatory requirements on ambient air quality with respect to sulfur dioxide even without the installation
o f an FGDunit.

TransboundaryImpacts
The issue of transboundary acid rain impacts was not analyzed as part o f the EA because o f several
reasons, discussed briefly here. First, factors such as the relatively short stack heights (120-145 meters)
and the location o f the plant inland in the south-westem part o f Turkey are expected to result in the
deposit o f a majority o f the sulfur dioxide locally with little impact because o f the alkaline nature and
buffering capacity o f the soils. Furthermore, the prevailing wind patterns are expectedto carry any minor
remaining sulfur dioxide to the Black Sea and thus SO2is not expected to reach other countries in any
appreciable quantity. Lastly, the phenomenon o f transboundary impacts is highly complex and depends
on a wide range of factors (the formation i s favored by lower temperatures and humidconditions, and the
presence o f water bodies is likely to create complexities in the high altitude wind circulation patterns).
These impacts therefore, were not considered significant enough to justify a long-term complex study
involving significant resources.

EnvironmentalManagementPlan(EMP)
The EIA included an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) that addressed the common issues
associated with construction activities (dust, noise, disposal o f wastes, etc.). During operation, the chief
issues addressed in the EMP are dust emissions, noise, waste management (hazardous and non-
hazardous), and wastewater. The EMP also includes issues associated with operation o f the FGD
(notably management o f the gypsum sludge produced), which would be effective when the derogation
period ends and the FGD i s installedand i s fully operational. Table 10.2 i s the summary o f the EMP.

Public Consultations
A public meetingto discuss the draft EIA was conducted on March 17, 2005. The chief issue raised was
the dust that i s deposited on agricultural crops. The draft document was disclosed locally in Turkishon
August 15, 2005 in the Municipalities of Cogulhan Town, Afvin and Elbistan Districts, Kahramanmaras
Directorate of Environment, and also placedon the website o f the EA consultant, Cinar.

Lignitemine extension
The Afvin Elbistan.A plant i s supplied by an existing mine at Kislakoy near the plant. This mine currently
has a capacity o f 18 Million tons per year - it i s currently primarily supplyingthe B Power Plant because
the A Plant i s operating at a very low level. The mine i s an open pit mine which was built using World
Bank funds in the 1970s. It has an operational license from MENR and i s inspected periodically by
various government agencies.

    (d) MENR inspects the mine to see whether it is conforming with the MiningLaw (which prescribes
         overburden and waste disposal guidelines);
    (e) The Ministry o f Labor (MOL)carries out inspections for worker safety issues; and
    (0 MoEFinspections focus onadherence withenvironmental safeguards.

Overburden fiom the mine and the ash from the power plant are used as backfill in the mine and covered
over with soil. Over 400,000 trees have been planted on the backfill area which is now wooded as a
result.
