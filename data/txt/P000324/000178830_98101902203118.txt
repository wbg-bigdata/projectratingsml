REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT AND LOAN
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit for the equivalent of US$ 24 million and a proposed loan
for the equivalent of US$ 24 million to the United Republic of Cameroon to
help finance! a second highway project. The credit would be on standard IDA
terms, and the loan would have a term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace,
with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The findings of the latest economic mission to Cameroon are reported
in the report Recent Economic Development of Cameroon (No. R 72 - 247) dis-
tributed on November 27, 1972. Annex I gives the country data. An economic
updating mission is currently visiting Cameroon.
3.        Cameroon is endowed with varied, although not abundant, natural
resources. The country has good agricultural potential based on a range of
soils and climatic conditions which permit cultivation of a number of export
and other crops. The economy, however, is still vulnerable to fluctuations
in the output and price of its two main exports, cocoa and coffee. Fundamen-
tal to exploiting Cameroon's development opportunities are investments to
raise rural productivity and to overcome serious transport bottlenecks.
4.        Cameroon's rural areas sustain 80 percent of the population, mainly
in agriculture. There is no evidence of serious malnutrition. However,
there are wide income disparities within rural areas and between the rural
and urban populations - rural incomes are about 50 percent of average per
capita GNP (US$ 180). The opportunities in agriculture lie in tropical com-
modities for export, substitutes for imported agricultural products, and im-
provements in output, marketing and processing of traditional foods and fibers
to meet the needs of a growing urban population.
5.        Cameroon's urban population is expected to rise from 22 percent of
total population in 1970 to 38 percent by 1985. Rapid urbanization has in-
creased the need for measures to cope with rising urban underemployment and
inadequate public services. Industrialization is an essential part of a
balanced rural-urban strategy. Industrial opportunities lie in processing
agricultural and forestry products for export, and in producing import sub-
stitutes (particularly intermediate products and consumer goods) needed for
the growing domestic market.
6.        Without an adequate transport system, however, Cameroon will not
realize its full potential. Development of suitable port facilities and



- 2-
establishment of an adequate land transport infrastructure are essential
to provide cheap internal distribution of inputs, efficient transit services
for neighboring countries, evacuation of the country's outputs and to broaden
local and regional markets.
7.        During the first decade of Cameroon's independence (1960/70), the
Government made a successful start in tackling some of these development pro-
blems. Considerable progress was made in the establishment of a basic trans-
port and communications network. Output of agriculture, industry and commerce
grew rapidly and is outpacing the capacity of this network. Real growth dur-
ing the first decade of independence reached six percent a year, which was
well ahead of population growth. Until recently, however, economic manage--
ment was complicated by a top-heavy government structure which had three
separate administrations (the Federal and two State Governments) with frag-
mented responsibility for public services and development. Creation of the
United Republic of Cameroon in May 1972, with a unified government structure,
opened prospects for better programming of available domestic and foreign finan-
cial resources in relation to economic and social development priorities and
for more efficient project preparation and implementation.
8.        Cameroon's third five-year Plan (1971/76) was announced at a time
when prospects for export earnings from traditional crops had deteriorated.
Since then, coffee and cocoa prices have recovered and timber prices have
shot up. However, only when transport facilities have been improved, can
Cameroon look forwaid to largely increased timber exports. The volume of
coffee and cocoa exports is also likely to grow slowly so that total export
earnings will probably show only modest growth. In the modern sector, private
investment oriented in the past towards substitution of imported consumer
goods appears to have levelled off. Some decline in overall economic growth
below the high growth rates of recent years (6.7 percent a year during FY
1967-71) is already in evidence and is likely to persist during the next few
years.
9.        With reduced growth rates, public savings have been levelling off.
Budgetary surpluses increased rapidly during the late 1960's and reached
CFAF 9.0 billion, the equivalent of 2.2 percent of GDP in 1970/71. In addi-
tion, stabilization funds reserves rose sharply due to high export prices.
However, in 1971/72, the current budget surplus remained at the same level as
in the preceding year and was probably insufficient to cover debt service and
the regular capital budget. Thus, 1971/72 probably has yielded a small bud-
get deficit.  At the same time, stahilization funds reserves were substan-
tially depleted by the financing of large extra--budgetary investments.
10.       In view of the prospect of fairly slow economic growth, revenues are
likely to grow less rapidly during the next few years than during FY 1967-71
(11.9 percent a year). Even with due restraint,, current expenditures will
continue to grow, partly because of expenditures on development-related activi-
ties such as road maintenance, education and rural development. Therefore
Cameroon's budgetary situation will remain tight for some time.



-3-
11.     While plan priorities are basically correct and most of the proposed
investnents are desirable for Cameroon's development, the pace of plan execu-
tion will have to be reviewed in the light of available resources and the sharp
increase in the cost of public investment which is occurrirg in the wake of
recent ,monetary developments. In the past, Cameroon has followed sound fiscal
and monetary policies and, when simila:- financial problems occurred in the mrid-
sixties, the Government curtailed expenditures and exercised the necessary
discipline to live within its means.
12.     Cameroon's ability to make effective use of external resources and the
Government's dedication to development are reasons for increased external
support. Although debt service is still low (4.3 percent of export earnings)
and although the country can carry some additional debt on conventional terms
years of slimmer public savings appear to be ahead, and despite its efforts to
mobilize additional domestic resources, Cameroon can make only a modest contri-
bution to the financing of future public investment. To avoid rapid build-up
of debt servicing obligations, lenders, including the Bank Group, should there-
fore provide a large part of their assistance on concessionary terms. Because
of its low income, modest export prospects, and limited savings capacity,
Cameroon should continue to be regarded eligible for IDA assistance.   Given
the limnited scope for raising the level of public savings in the next few
years, lenders, including the Bank Group, should also be prepared to finance
a high proportion of project costs, including when necessary a part of local
cost.
13.     Over the second half of the last decade disbursements of foreign aid
amounted to about CFAF 11 billion a year. While at the beginning of this
period 65,V of this were grants, the proportion of loans has been slowly in-
creasing as grants declined. A major part of external assistance was provided
by France and concentrated in infrastructure and productive sectors. The aid
giving agencies of the EEC (European Development Fund and European Investment
Bank) directed their lending mainly to agriculture, with infrastructure in
second place. Bank Group disbursements were small during this period. During
the Third Plan reriod (1971/72 - 1975/76) foreign aid disbursements are expected
to amount to CFAF 65 billion, or an annual average of CFAF 13 billion, of which
some 40' is expected to be in the form of grants.   The Euarean Development
Fund wil1 probably increase its aid progran during the plan period moderately
over the level of the past five years. If present trends continue, the Bank
Group is likely to becone the main lender during the course of the Third Plan
period. The most recent external public debt figures available are for the
end of 1971.  At that date, Cameroon's external public debt (including undis-
bursed) armonted to about USg230 million of which the Bank Group accounted for
approximately 30>.. The last economic mission estimated that the Bank Group's
share of external public debt could rise to '0X by the end of the Third Plan.
-owever, service on Bank Group debt by 1976 would amount to only 26' of
Carneroon's total. public debt service, which is not expected to exceed 6.5i
of export earnings.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
14.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. The
Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now slightly exceed US$ 80 million and
cover nine projects: three in agriculture, three in transportation, two irn
education and one in public utilities. Agriculture, transportation and the
other sectors taken together have absorbed about one-third each of the total
amount of our past commitments. Projects have generally been satisfactorily
implemented, although considerable delays have occurred in some cases. Re-
cently, the Executive Directors have approved supplemental financing for a
cost overrun on the SOCAPALM oil palm plantation project.
15.       The Bank Group's strategy for the future is to support the Government
in its efforts to equip the country with infrastructure, to accelerate rural
development and to increase the efficiency of Cameroon's institutions.
16.       Recognizing the crucial importance of transportation to economic
growth in Cameroon and in neighboring countries, the Government has devoted
the largest portion of public investments to this sector. The Bank Group
will continue to help Government develop transport facilities. Given rapid
traffic increases and the backlog of required investments, massive injections
of capital will be nec 3sary over the next years to modernize the network.
While two preparatory Bank loans for port and railway development were modest
in size, financing requirements for the expansion of the port of Douala
(scheduled for Board presentation in FY 75) and a possible realignment of the
Douala-Yaounde railway line (scheduled for Board presentation in FY 76) will
be sizeable. A small interim railroad project is being considered for Board
presentation in FY 74. In the road sector, the proposed project completes
Bank Group lending for the establishment of the basic trunk road system;
hereafter the emphasis will shift from constructing trunk roads to improving
road maintenance and agricultural and forestry feeder roads.
17.       Investments in agriculture have so far beer hampered by the weakness
of government agencies responsible for project preparation and implementation.
The Government has recently stepped up its efforts to foster rural develop-
ment and we have under consideration for FY 74 a cocoa rehabilitation and
planting project in the southern region as well as a livestock project in the
northern central region which will benefit an as yet untouched segment of
Cameroon's population. The proposed road project would also provide assis-
tance to the Government in formulating policies for a more rational exploita-
tion of Cameroon's forests, a major area for future development.
18.       Following last year's action to give the country a unitary adminis-
trative structure there are good prospects for improving the effectiveness of
government services and agencies with the creation, within the main technical
ministries, of units responsible for programming and project preparation and



supervision. The recently approved supplemental loan for SOCAPALM lays the
basis for a reorganization of project preparation and management in the
plantation sector. The proposed road project would assist and train the
personnel of the Ministry of Transport.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Infrastructure
19.       Despite the requirements imposed by the country's geography at inde-
pendence, Cameroon's transport infrastructure was appreciably less developed
than in most other West African countries. The country's location on the
Gulf of Guinea, at the junction of West and Equatorial Africa, makes it an
important gateway for its landlocked neighbors, Chad, and to a lesser extent,
the Central African Republic (C.A.R.). The distances between Cameroon's prin-
cipal agricultural areas and the sea are great. Given these distances and
the country's dependence on exports and imports, low-cost transportation is a
prerequisite to economic growth. During the last ten years major investments
have been made in transportation, all designed to reduce transport costs,
open up new areas for development (especially in the remote North), improve
transit services for its landlocked neighbors, and unify the once divided
country.
20.       At present the system comprises one major port, 840 km of railways,
23,000 km of roads (of which 1,500 km paved), one navigable waterway, and five
airports (two of which international). The trunk land transport system radi-
ates from Douala, the main port, industrial and commercial center, and is
being developed along two main axes. The 300-km Douala-Bafoussam-Foumban
route serves the Western Region which is densely populated and produces cocoa,
coffee and bananas. The 1,700-km Transcameroon route, which combines rail
and road links, heads east from Douala to the cocoa producing region around
Yaounde, the capital, then north to the cotton, meat and rice producing north-
ern Cameroon and the Chad border. This route also carries timber traffic and
part of Chad's imports and exports.
21.       Thus, the network provides access to the vital areas of economic
activity. However, many sections which were built decades ago can no longer
cope with increasing traffic. The first highway project of 1970 includes the
improvement of about 300 kms of roads, between N'Gaoundere and Garoua and be-
tween Tiko and Viktoria. Because of administrative delays at the outset work
fell 1-1/2 years behind schedule but is now proceeding satisfactorily. The
proposed project, together with other investments from bilateral and multi-
lateral sources (including the Bank Group's First Highway Project), would
bring the trunk road system to the capacity and quality standards required.
With this project, the Government will have completed the major transport
routes between the underdeveloped North and the more industrialized South, as
well as between the former federated states of East and West Cameroon.



Organization, Planning and Coordination
22.       Transport planning was in the past dictated by the broad geographical
distribution of population and economic activities. For the transport needs
of the 1980's, Government will have to tackle new problems such as the organ-
ization, financing and equipment needs of road maintenance; distribution of
freight traffic between road and rail and regional transport coordination.
23.       Government has only just begun to organize itself for the tasks
ahead. Thus, the Ministry of Transport, which has the responsibility for
transport policy, planning and coordination, was set up in 1970 and still
lacks qualified staff. Construction and maintenance of the road network
is entrusted to the Department of Roads of the Ministry of Equipment. Its
Cameroonian engineering staff is young and will benefit from further on-the-
job training. All road maintenance equipment is centralized in a semi-auto-
nomous Central Equipment Pool set up in 1968 within the Ministry of Equipment,
from which Department of Roads and local authorities have to borrow equipment.
This arrangement does not appear to have always worked well. The proposed
loan/credit includes funds for the study of these questions and for experts
to strengthen the planning capability of the relevant Ministries and to train
their Cameroonian staff.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Purpose
24.       The project is designed to upgrade and complete Cameroon's network
of major trunk roads. The project would also improve the organization and
policies of the Ministry of Transport and would prepare the next important
phase of highway investment for road maintenance and feeder roads development.
The appraisal report entitled "Second Highway Project" (No. 180-CM dated
June 11, 1973) is being distributed separately. A Loan/Credit and Project
Summary is in Annex III of this report.
Background
25.       The Government first requested Bank Group financing for the roads
Garoua-Mora and Douala-Pont du N'kam. Studies were financed under the First
Highway project and carried out by the French and Canadian group Ingeroute-
Lamarre Valois. Studies for a third road Pont du Noun-Foumban, were done by
Gauff, a German firm, and financed by the Government. The project was ap-
praised in January/February 1973 and negotiations for a loan and credit
were held in Washington in May 1973 with a Cameroonian delegation headed
by Mr. Tchoungui, Cameroon's Ambassador to the United States.



-7-
Description
26.       The project covers the period 1973/74 - 1976/77 and consists of:
(a)  reconstruction of three road sections, totalling about
485 km
(i)     Garoua-Mora:   260 km;
(ii)     Douala-Pont du N'kam (Kekem):   175 km; and
(iii)     Pont du Noun (Bafoussam) - Foumban:   50 km.
(b)  consulting services for:
(i)     supervision of the above works;
(ii)     technical assistance to formulate forestry policies;
(iii)     a feasibility study of forestry feeder roads;
(iv)     a study to improve highway maintenance and to define
a betterment program for secondary and feeder roads;
(v)     technical assistance for improving transport planning
and coordination, and studies of special problems in
that area.
Road Reconstruction
27.       The three road sections would be reconstructed to two-lane paved
standards consistent with traffic requirements. The Garoua-Mora road is the
only unimproved road stretch of the rail/road Trans-cameroon route linking
the populated northern region and Chad with Yaounde and Douala. The Douala-Pont
du N'kam and Pont du Noun-Foumban roads link Douala, the main port, with one
of the most productive and densely populated agricultural regions. The first
road coverirng 175 km between Douala and Kekem carries the heaviest traffic in
Cameroon. It was paved 20 years ago and has considerably deteriorated. The
Pont du Noun-Foumban road has a laterite surface which has deteriorated to
the point where it will soon no longer allow all-weather traffic.
Studies and Technical Assistance
28.       Road maintenance is deteriorating due to lack of funds, trained per-
sonnel and equipment, and to inadequate organization and vehicle weight con-
trol. The studies to be made under the project would lead to proposals to
improve coordination between agencies responsible for maintenance and their
working methods and to the development of a program of road betterment and
maintenance. The technical assistance included in the project would help
improve transport planning as required by the next, more complicated phase
of highway investment, taking into account regional traffic and transport
coordination, in order to ensure the best allocation of resources between
transportation modes. Studies of the need for organizing the transport
industry to foster Cameroonian participation and maintaining sound competi-
tion will be carried out by an expert financed by UNDP.



- 8 -
29.       Feasibility studies will cover feeder roads in the southern or in
the southeastern forestry zones. The need for such feeder roads was identified
by a 1972 mission from our field office in Abidjan.    Technical assistance for
forestry policy formulation would help the Government devise a comprehensive
policy for the very promising forestry sector including necessary legislation
to ensure a rational exploitation of the timber resources, adequate reforesta-
tion and improved taxation.
30.       The Government has agreed to hire consultants and experts accept-
able to the Bank to assist the Ministries of Planning, Transport, Equipment
and Agriculture; to seek concurrence of the Bank regarding implementation
of the recommendations of the consultants; and to consult the Bank before
passing new laws or modifying existing laws regulating the road transport
industry. It has further undertaken to coordinate its road and rail invest-
ment in the two major transport corridors (Transcameroon and Douala -
N'kongsamba routes) in order to ensure the most economical allocation of
traffic between the two modes of transportation.
Execution
31.       The Ministry of Planning would be responsible for overall execution
of the project and would be assisted by other government departments or
agencies, in particular: the Ministry of Equipment (and within it the Roads
Department) for roai construction as well as maintenance and forestry roads
studies; the Ministry of Transport for transport planning and coordination;
and the Ministry of Agriculture for forestry policies.
Project Cost and Financing
32.       Total project cost, including taxes of about US$ 7 million equivalent,
is estimated at about US$ 71 million, as follows: (in rounded figures)
(in US$ '000)
Local      Foreign       Total
Road Construction:
Garoua - Mora                       7,000      14,700       21,700
Douala - Pont du N'kam              7,500      15,800       23,300
Pont du Noun - Foumban              1,600       3,400        5s000
Subtotal                 16,100      33,900      50,000
Construction Supervision, Studies
and Technical Assistance               1,500       3,700        59200
Contingencies                            4,900      10,400       15,300
Total                    22,500      48,000      70,500



-9-
33.       The Bank would make a loan of US$ 24 million, repayable in 25 years
(including a five-year grace period), and the Association a credit of US$ 24
million to cover the foreign exchange component, which amounts to 75 percent
of the total project cost (excluding taxes). The loan and credit would be
made to the Government, which would finance the local costs. Cost estimates
include a contingency allowance of 10%-15% for increases in physical quantities
which was found appropriate due to unforeseeable costs in relocating utility
lines, diverting traffic, and rock excavation in mountainous terrain. A
further 15% contingency allowance has been added for price escalation.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       All procurement would be by international competitive bidding after
prequalification of bidders. The loan and credit would be disbursed during
1973/74 - 1977/78, and would cover:
(i) 68 percent of the total construction work expenditures, and
(ii) the foreign exchange cost of consulting services for super-
vision of construction, technical assistance, and studies.
Since there are at present no qualified Cameroonian road contractors, it is
expected that all contracts would be awarded to foreign firms. We hope to
be able to make recommendations on ways of promoting local contractors as
part of our forthcoming small and medium scale industries study. The consul-
tants who will prepare a road maintenance and betterment program have also
been asked to give attention to this matter.
Economic Justification
35.       The combined economic return on construction of the three roads would
be about 20 percent based on estimates of vehicle operating cost savings alone.
Time savings and a reduction in accident levels, not included in the calcula-
tion of benefits, would also be substantial. The project fits well within
the Government's strategy of improving the inadequate land transport network,
to open up new areas, to service landlocked Chad and to accelerate exploitation
of the country's resources. The road sections to be constructed under the
project serve densely populated and economically important areas of Cameroon
where the investment would stimulate agricultural development. The technical
assistance included in the project would improve the administration's perfor-
mance in highway maintenance, transport planning and coordination, and lay the
ground for future high priority investments.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Cr. No. 100, Ln. No. 490   CAMDEV Project; USO1:L mil-Lion Credit of March 28,
1967; Closing Date: June 30, 1972 and US$7 million
Loan to CAMDEV of same date; Closing Date: December
31 1974.
The original planting program has been reduced by eliminating
l,DOO ha of tea. 'Project implementation is satisfactlory but funds have been
seriously depleted by cost increases due to general inflation, lower than ex-
pected yields from non-project plantings and excessive overheads. Disbursemrents
for this project are slightly behind schedule. Government has recently agreed
to implement econormty measures to reduce CAIMEV's deficit.  A new contract has
been negotiated for the continuation of the present managing agency arrangements
with Commonwealth Development Corporation until December 31, 1974.
In. No. 593 and SF) ;.n. No. 886  Oil Palm Project; USP7.9 million 4-,an to Sopame
of April 15, 1969; Closirg Date: December 31,
1976 and US$1.7 million Supplemental Loan of
April 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
After successful initial implementation significant cost overruns
occurred and it was found that one of the two oil palm estate sites was unsatis-
factory. A substantial part of the cost overrun was due to the underestirmation
of -orice inflation wihen '-he project was first appraised. Following reappraisal
in 1972 the project was modified from 9,000 ha to 8,500 ha but estimated produc-
tion will remain unchanged as higher yields are now anticipated. The project is
n)ow on schedule and proceeding satisfactorily.
Lii. No. 604  Water Supply Project; US05 -million Loan to SNEC of June 2, 1969l :
Closing Date; June 30, 1974 (intermediate Closing Dates: May 31,
1972; September 30, 1972; December 31, 1972)
This project was completed ahead of schedule with substan-tial
saving,s whica have been approved for investment in further water distribution
works; however, disbursements have lagged due to the strong working capital
position of the borrower and the closing date has been postponed thrice in
order to allow re7laining funds to be disbursed. There was still an unused
balance of US'218,000 by March 31, 1973.
-,' These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
orogress of projects in execution, and in particu:lar to report any problems
which are being encountered', and the action beir' taken to remedy ther.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to nresenu a Ualanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in prcject execution.

Cr. No. 161   First Education Piroject; US%10.5 million Credit of September 23,
1969; Closing Date: June 30, 197th.
"his project is about 12 months behind schedule due tc delay in
appointinr, consulting architects and the need to call for new bids for il
rroj-ect schools in the South after revisions of the proposed design which were
accepted by the Governrnent. Construction of the schools in the North is
expected to be completed in October 1973. The new bids for the schools in
the South were accepbed by the Association and the contracts have been signed
in early 1973. All contracts are within appraisal estimates and construction
of the schools in the South is expected to be completed early in 197t.
Cr. No. 180, Ln. Ho. 663   Highway Project; US07 million Credit of Mlarch 27,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973 and USg 12
million Loan of same date; Closing Date: December
31, 1973.
This project had a slow start due primarily to administrative
delays on the part of the implementing ministries. By December 1971, however,
all construction and consultants contracts had been signed and since then work
has been )roceedirg satisfactorily. The project is expected to be completed
by late 1974.
Ln. No. 687   Railway Project; USL5.2 mrillion Loan to REGTFEMCAy of June 9, 1970G
ClosinE Date: June 30, 197T.
Project execution has been saLisfactory for track renewal work and
delivery of mnotive power and rolling stock. Unforeseen tecinical difficulties,
suC3 as extremely bad subsoil conditions, make a furtier study necessary before
selectirng the optimum design of the railway bridge at Japoma, near Douala. New
bids will be cre.Ied, and the closing date will have to be extended by one year,
to June 30, 1975. The final economic study of the proposed realignment of the
Douala-Yaaounde line is to be received shortly.
Cr. No. 228   Douala Port Project; US$1.5 million Credit of January 1lh, 1971;
Original Closing Date: June 30, 1973.
After considerable delay in starting the project, largely because
of ti-ie consuming Government procedures invelved, the project is now proceedirg
s-itisfTlctorily. The revised estimated date for full credit disbursement is
September 1973, nine months later than originally planned. The closing date has
been extended by 6 months to Decemqber 31, 1973.
Cr. No. j02   SEMIfY Rice Project; US93.7 million  Credit of April 26, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project implementation began in mid-1972, and is -orogressing satis-
factorily. First year construction targets and IDA disbursements are in line
with aporaisal estimates. Following the 1973 US dollar devaluation, and after
providing for some additional works, the revised estimated total project costs
are expected to increase by about 15 percent. It is too early at this stage to
revise the financing arrangements, but this may be necessary within the next 12
mronths when further project costs have been established.
