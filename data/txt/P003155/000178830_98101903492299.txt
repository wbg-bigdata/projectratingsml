INDUSTRIAL FORESTRY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Zambia has applied for a Bank loan to help
finance the investment costs of a long-term afforestation program
intended to meet Zambia's demand for industrial wood. This is the first
forestry project appraised by the Bank.
ii.       The program provides for new plantings over the 25 years 1969
to 1993, by which time 75,000 acres of Pine and 30,000 acres of Eucalypt
plantations would have been established. At full development the program
would produce about 25 million cubic feet of roundwood annually. The
program is well conceived and technically sound. The fir.ancial rate of
return, based on conservative estimates, would be about 10% and the rate
of return to the economy is estimated at 13%. Revenues from operations
would exceed the cost of planting, excluding debt service, from about
1979 onwards.
iii.      The project consists of eight years (1969-1976) of the planting
program. During the eight years, 20,000 acres each of Pine and Eucalypt
would be established. The proposed Bank loan of US$ 5.3 million would
cover the foreign exchange component estimated at 48% of the total invest-
ment cost of this phase of US$ 11.1 million equivalent.
iv.       The project would be managed by the Industrial Plantations
Division of the Forest Department. With the arrangements described in
paragraph 7.02, the project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$ 5.3 million to be repaid in 25 years including a 10-year grace period.






ZAMBIA
INDUSTRIAL FORESTRY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Zambia has applied for a Bank loan to help
finance its industrial forestry program. The project was prepared by the
Forest Department of Zambia's Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism
with the help of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, and consists of an
eight-year planting program which forms part of Zambia's long-term affor-
estation program. This appraisal is based on the findings of a Bank
mission to Zambia in July 1967, composed of Messrs. L. H. Helmers,
M. Palein and C. S. Hubbard (Consultant) and a mission to Zambia in May
1968 by Mr. M. J. Walden of the Bank. The project is the first forestry
project for which a Bank loan is proposed.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Zambia (formerly Northern Rhodesia) emerged as an independent
republic within the Commonwealth on October 24, 1964. The country, an
enclave in the southern part of the African continent, has an area of some
290,000 square miles and supports a population estimated at 3.6 million in
1964 (98 percent Africans) growing at an estimated annual rate of 2.9
percent.
2.02      Most of the area consists of savannah shrub land having a general
elevation of between 3,000 and 4,500 feet. The country is drained by the
Zambesi River and its tributaries, and the Luapula River. The climate is
sub-tropical with a wsrm, wet season from November to April, a cool dry sea-
son from May to September (15-270C), and a hot dry season approximately from
September to November (27-320C). The average rainfall is about 50 inches in
the northwest decreasing to about 30 inches in the central regions, around
Lusaka the Capital.
2.03      The copper industry is the mainstay of Zambia's economy. In 1966,
it contributed 50 percent to GNP and 90 percent to total exports. The
industry employs some 55,000 people and has given rise to a highly developed
complex of towns, railroads, power lines and secondary industries including
light engineering. The mining industry absorbs a significant portion of the
total market for forest products.
2.04      Farming by Europeans and Africans who have settled north and
southwest of Lusaka along the "line of rail", i.e. the access from the
south to the Copperbelt, forms the other basis of the economy. Less than
two percent of the 450,000 farming families produce cash crops representing
about 36 percent of the total value of agricultural output. About 12 per-
cent of GNP originates in agriculture.



-2-
2.05      Because of its dependence on the mining industry the economy is
vulnerable to fluctuations in the world price of copper. The average rate
of growth of GNP in 1955 through 1965 was 2.3 percent per annum. The aver-
age per capita GNP of less than $200 a year (1965) covers wide disparities
in distribution.
2.06      Imports of about K 246 million ($344 million) in 1966 consisted
mainly of manufactured goods, fuels, chemicals, machinery, transport
equipment, wood and wood products, and agricultural commodities. Exports
were valued at approximately K 492 million ($689 million) of which copper
and other minerals accounted for approximately 95 percent. The only sig-
nificant agricultural export is tobacco. The country's present trade
balance is positive and large.
2.07      The Zambian Government is anxious to broaden the base of the
economy and to reduce its dependence on imports of primary products and
manufactured goods. Progress and diversification of agriculture and
forestry are prerequisites to development in other fields, particularly
if domestic markets for industry are to be expanded.
B.  Significance of the Forestry Sector
2.08      The forestry sector accounts for a relatively low proportion of
GNP (probably less than 2 percent). Enployment in the forests and in
forest industries in 1965 was estimated at about 8,000 persons. Of Zambia's
total land area of approximately 290,000 square miles, some 22,000 square
miles are reserved forests directly administrated by the Forest Department
of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (mainly for the purpose
of providing mining timber and firewood to the local population).
2.09      Zambia has always been a net importer of forest products.   In
1966 such imports amounted to about K 9.6 million, while exports were
valued-at approximately K 728,000 (see Annex 1).
2.10      Apart from a limited area of Baikiaea (Zambian Teak) forests in
the southwest, the main forest resources of Zambia consist of low-yielding,
slow-growing Brachystegia (miombo) woodlands, the more accessible of which
have been, or are being, exploited mainly for mining timber and firewood
for the local population. The mining industry's annual demand is currently
about 4 million cubic feet (roundwood equivalent V ) (see-Annex 2).
Recent estimates indicate that economically accessible supplies of Brachy-
stegia timber, suitable for the mining industry will have been largely
exhausted by the late 1970's. Apart from the mining industry this timber
is of limited use.
1/   Unsawn wood under bark.



-3-
2.1       The proposed Industrial Forest Plantation Program in the Copper-
belt area would replace this slow-growing, low-yielding exploited miombo
wood lands of Brachystegia, with fast-groving, high-yielding plantations of
exotic species, mainly Pinus khasya and Eucalyptus grandis.
C. Forestry Organization
2.12      The Forest Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Tourism is responsible for the management, protection and regeneration of
the forest areas in Zambia necessary to supply forest products required
by industry, housing, farming and other wood consumers. In addition to
these functions, the Department's responsibilities include a research pro-
gram connected with the growing, exploitation and utilization of indigenous
and plantation wood, the operation of a Forestry Training School (2-year
course with about 60 students) and flood and erosion control. About threee
years ago a special Industrial Plantations Division was created within the
Department, charged with the implementation of the afforestation program
for which Bank financing has been requested.
2.13      The organization chart of the Department is presented in Annex 3.
The present staff is competent. With the exception of two Zambians, all
professional posts are held by expatriate civil servants (under Government
contracts). The total professional staff is 32 of which 5 are employed in
the Industrial Plantations Division.
2.14      Forestry budget funds are allocated from general government funds,
and supplemented by transfers from the "Forest Regeneration Fund". The
latter resources consist of Forest Department revenues (about K 360,000
in 1966) related to timber royalties (5 ngwee per cubic foot) from indigenous
forest exploitation. Forestry expenditures more than doubled from K 766,600
in 1961 to K 1,558,000 in 1966, mainly because of the industrial plantations
establishment for which up to the end of 1966 about K 1.2 million has been
spent out of the Forest Regeneration Fund.
2.15      The Department has been subject to normal Government regulations
resulting in extremely slow procedures hampering the Industrial Plantations
Program. Because of such procedures the Department has been ill-equipped
to operate along commercial lines. The Government has modified these pro-
cedures relating to accounting, audit, procurement, professional staff terms
of service, piecework rates for labor and produce sales. Consequently, in
future, the operations of the Industrial Plantations Division will be more
suited to a commercial operation.

III. FORESTRY PROGRAM
A. General Description
3.01      The Forest Development Program, prepared by the Forest Department
of Zambia's Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism envisages the estab-
lishment of 30,000 acres of Eucalypt and 75,000 acres of Pine plantations.
The output of the program would suipply the bulk of Zambia's future needs in
industrial wood, including those of the mining industry. It would result
in substantial savings in foreign exchange, reaching K 7 million per annum
by the year 2000.
3.02      The program areas are located within the Copperbelt area at an
altitude of about 4,000 feet. The region has an annual rainfall of about
45 inches over the period November to April, and has a seven-month dry
season from May to November.
3.03      The plantations are to be established in three main blocks,
located at Chati, Lamba and Ndola (see map), all of which are situated
between 5 and 40 milea by road haul from the mines of the Copperbelt, which
comprise a large timber market. Communications are excellent and the
plantations are relatively close to sources of power, factors which will
enhance the prospects of subsequent industrialization. Labor is plentiful,
both for industrial and plantation projects. There is no immediate popu-
lation pressure on land in the region. The land on which plantations are
to be established is Government owned.
3.04      The land in the program areas is generally flat and covered with
indigenous Brachystegia forest of very limited commercial value.  In select-
ing sites, the main soil criteria are depth and texture.  The soil should
not be less than 5 feet without impediment and preferably over 8 feet deep,
and sand to sandy clays are preferred to heavier soils. Some 160,000 acres
of land (of which about 50,000 acres for Eucalypts) so far have been found
suitable for the program.
3.05      The main species to be planted are Pinus khasya and fast-growing
Eucalyptus grandis. Both species are suitable for commercial planting under
conditions in the Copperbelt and the yield from them would meet respectively
future soft wood and hard wood needs of the country from the early seventies
onwards. They would be managed respectively on rotations (age of tree at
time of final felling) of 30 and 12 years.
3.06      The planting program consists of 2,500 acres of Pine and 2,500
acres of Eucalypt annually until 1978, when the 30,000 acres Eucalypt
forest would have been established. From then onwards, Eucalypt fellings
would be replanted. The program of 2,500 acres of new Pine plantings would
continue after 1978 until the 75,000 acre Pine forest would have been es-
tablished (after 30 years).



-5-
3.07      The cost of establishing the 75,000 acre Pine forest over a
30-year period would be about K 19.6 million (US$27.4 million) and for the
30,000 acre Eucalypt forest over a 12-year period about K 6.2 million
(US$8.7 million) at present-day prices. The sustained annual yield (yield
at full development 1/) from these plantations would be about 18 million
cubic feet of Pinus khasya and about 7.5 million cubic feet of Eucalyptus
grandis wood.
B. Technical Aspects of the Program
3.08      The earlier plantings (prior to 1955) of exotics were not
successful because of the combined effect of insufficiently deep soils,
the seven-month dry season and the intense competition from aggressive
local grass and wood vegetation.
3.09      Intensive silvicultural research in Zambia by the Forest Depart-
ment has shown that success can be achieved provided that:
(a) the plantation soils are sandy in nature up to a depth
of 8 feet;
(b) the indigenous vegetation must be completely cleared and
the ground brought to a fine state of cultivation before
the exotics are planted;
(c) that only transplants, carefully raised in the nursery
in polyethylene tubes, are used; and,
(d) after planting, the ground is intensively cultivated to
ensure complete weed control and conservation of moisture.
3.10      The annual planting program envisaged of 5,000 acres (2,500 acres
Pine, 2,500 acres Eucalypt) is regarded, from a marketing and managerial
point of view, as the limit which in present circumstances should be under-
taken.
C. Yields
3.11      Annex 4 gives the details of the yields per acre for Pine and
Eucalypt respectively.- The yield per acre from Pinus khasya over its
rotation period (30 years), from total thinnings over this period and
1/   Full development is reached when the 75,000 acres of Pine and the
30,000 acres of Eucalypt are established. Thereafter areas which are
felled are immediately replanted with the same species, thus main-
taining a permanent stream of production.



-6-
final felling, is about 7,100 cubic feet, and the yield per acre from
Eucalyptus grandis over its 12 year rotation period from total thinnings
and final felling is about 3,000 cubic feet. These figures are conservative
and are based on actual yield measurements in Zambia. They are used in pre-
ference to more recently calculated yield estimates based on other sample
plots which indicate the possibility of substantially higher yields.
3.12      The planting program is shown in detail in Annex 5, and the total
annual yield obtained from the program is set out in Annex 6. Total output
of Pine stabilizes in 1998 at about 17.8 million cubic feet of timber per
annum and in 1980 for Euealypt at about 7.5 million cubic feet per annum.
D. Marketing
3.13      Demand projections have been made for the various outputs of the
program, and are presented in Annex 7A. The assumptions made (see Annex TB)
are conservative, e.g. the demand for mining timber and poles has been
treated as a stable demand, and increases for building timber and trans-
mission poles, etc. are based on relatively moderate growth rates.
3.14      A comparison of the utilizable output from the plantations (Annex
6) with projections of assured demand (Annex 7) is set out in Annex 8 and
shows that the proportion of Pine versus Eucalypt is compatible with market
prospects.  Some surpluses of small wood occur.   Such Burpluses have not
been taken into account in the calculation of revenues, though a UNDP study
to investigate the feasibility of secondary small wood-using industries
(block-board factory, hardboard factory) has just been started, and it is
expected that such industries might be established from 1973 onwards.
Already an existing secondary industry (a local small match-making factory)
is using all available supplies of small pine wood.
3.15      Prices for forest produce have been assumed to be significantly
lower than the present landed cost of imported wood or locally produced
Brachystegia wood. The prices used (per cubic foot roundwood equivalent
under bark at ride (dirt road) side) are N 15 for small wood and refinery
poles, N 25 for sawn timber and N 60 for transmission poles, and are about
30-40 percent lower than current levels.
E. Cost Estimates of the Program
3.16      Total cost of the program (see para. 3.07) is about K 25.8
million (US$36.1 million). The basis for the various cost estimates is
given in Annex 9. The cost estimates are conservative and are based on
the present method of operation. It is expected, however, that economies
of scale and the adoption of further improved development techniques will
lead to cost reductions of at least 10 percent. Such cost savings provide
an adequate contingency to cover possible price and wage increases.



-7-
3.17      The cash flow statement of total revenues and expenditures of the
program is presented in Annex 10.
3.18      Until 1978 the Division would require funds from Government, in-
cluding Bank disbursements, to finance its program costs. From 1979 through
1990 the Division would finance its program from its self-generated funds
and would be able to pay some, but not all, of its interest liability.
From 1991 through 1998 the Division would pay interest and make repayments
of its funds drawn from Government. After 1998 the Division would be cap-
italized entirely from its own resources and substantial sums would be
available annually either for the benefit of Government or further forestry
development beyond the full program now planned.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General
4.01      The project for which Bank financing is proposed would consist
of an 8-year planting program (1969-1976) which forms part of Zambia's
long-term industrial afforestation program, intended to meet Zambia's
demand for industrial wood. The project would be managed by the Industrial
Plantations Division of the Forest Department.
4.02      At the end of this period about 33,000 acres of Pine and 27,000
acres of Eucalypt would have been established. This includes 13,300 acres
of Pine and 7,000 acres of Eucalypt established prior to 1969 (see Annex 5),
but these acreages would not form part of the project. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that any modification to the 8-year planting pro-
gram would be acceptable to the Bank.

4.o4      Cost estimates are conservative (see para. 3.16) and provide an
adequate contingency to cover possible price and wage increases. The
foreign exchange component would be about K 3.8 million (US$5.3 million).
Details of total investments and foreign exchange components are presented
in Annex 11.
C. Proposed Financing
4.05      The proposed Bank loan would be US$5.3 million, covering the
foreign exchange component (48 percent) of the K 8 million (US$11.1 million)
investment program during the years 1969-1976. The Bank loan proposed
would be made to the Government of Zambia. It would be disbursed over a
period of eight years (1969-1976) and repaid in 25 years including a grace
period of 10 years. The following table presents the sources and require-
ments of funds.

4.o6      The financing plan shows that enough funds would be generated
from operations to pay the Bank interest and a portion of local costs
during the 8-year period. The Government would provide the necessary funds
to the Industrial Plantations Division for working capital purposes and to
finance the remainder of the local costs of the program. Annex 10 shows
the funds needed by the Industrial Plantations Division to finance the full
program.
D. Disbursements
4.07      The Industrial Plantations Division would submit to the Bank the
necessary documents regarding expenditures for the establishment of the
forest from 1969 - 1976. The goods would be procured as explained paras.
5.07 - 5.09. The disbursement procedures would be as follows: the Bank
would disburse 100 percent of the CIF cost of imported equipment (tractors,
dozers, graders, etc.). An import duty of 10 percent, however, is levied
on commercial vehicles imported into Zambia. This duty,. coupled with com-
paratively small numbers of vehicles required and shipping costs, will make
locally assembled trucks and personnel vehicles more competitive than possible
external suppliers. For these and all other categories, the Bank would dis-
burse a percentage of actual expenditures (estimated at 44 percent) which
would represent the average foreign exchange component (see Annex 11).
4.o8      The accounts of the Industrial Plantations Division would be subject
to an independent audit annually by accountants acceptable to the Bank. This
would not.relieve the Auditor General of Zambia of his constitutional respon-
sibility and hence he would either endorse the report of the independent
auditors or conduct any further investigations he deemed necessary.



- 10 -
4.o9      Investment costs already incurred prior to the date of loan
signing would not be financed by the Bank, and the unused balance of the
loan at the end of the disbursement period, if any, would be cancelled.
E. Operating Results
4.10      The expected financial results for the Industrial Plantations
Division are shown in Annex 10. The financial rate of return of the program
would be 10 percent. However, it should be borne in mind that this is based
on conservative assumptions and that in all probability the total return
would be two or three percentage points higher, which is compatible with
what in general can be expected from a commercial forestry undertaking.
4.11      The financial rates of return for the Pine and Eucalypt parts of
the program have also been calculated under the same conservative assump-
tions and are respectively 9 and 12 percent.
4.12      The effect of the longer rotation for Pine (30 years) compared to
Eucalypt (12 years) accounts for the difference between the rates of return.
However, it is reasonable to expect that reductions in the cost of estab-
lishment will be effected and result in a higher rate of return.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. The Managing Entity
5.01      The Industrial Plantations Division of the Forest Department as
it has functioned to date would not be able to manage the proposed project
satisfactorily. The Forest Department has several other functions to ful-
fill in addition to the management of the Industrial Plantions scheme
(research, training, management of forest reserves, flood control, etc.).
The Industrial Plantations Division has been operated on lines of procedure
appropriate to the department'of a Ministry but inappropriate to the conduct
of a commercial forestry business.
5.02      The Government would not wish, and the Bank concurs, to form a
separate statutory corporation for the management of the project as many
of the services provided by-the Forest Department are necessary for'both
the Industrial Plantations Division and other activities of the Department
(research, training, etc.).
5.03      The Government has modified various of its procedures relating
to-the project which will enable the Industrial Plantations Division to
function on a commercial basis while remaining within the Forest Department
(para 2.15). A separate budget, for both capital and revenue receipts and
expenditures will be maintained by the Division and allocations for the
Industrial Forestry project from the Government Capital Plan estimates will



be entirely distinct from other Forest Department and other Ministry allo-
cations. Such allocations to the Division will be net after the sales
revenues from which the Division is expected to provide certain of the
funds required for its development (para. 4.05).
5.04      It would be necessary to strengthen the staff of the Industrial
Plantations Division with two accountants (one cost accountant and one
commercial accountant) experienced in commercial forestry. One of these
would be required shortly; the other in 1972 when sales revenues would
become substantial. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
head of the Industrial Plantations Division, the plantations manager, and
the heads of production and accounting would be mutually acceptable. The
staff presently in office in these positions are acceptable to the Bank.
B. Marketing Organization
5.05.     In the calculation of the revenues, it has been assumed that the
Industrial Plantations Division would sell the output of the project stacked
on ride (dirt road) side. It may be possible, however, that in certain
circumstances the wood will be sold standing or at stump (felled but not
removed to ride side).; The mining industry has already expressed its willing-
ness to set up an organization tor logging and transportation of the plant-
ations produce for mining purposes when it becomes available in sufficient
quantities. Also other parties (importers) have expressed their willingness
to set up a saw mill to process the plantation output. The prospects that
commercial enterprise will absorb the yield from the plantations are
sufficiently promising to make Government participation in marketing un-
necessary and the Government should encourage any such private activity.
C. Fire Risk
5.06      Normal forest fire prevention measures would be undertaken (Annex
\9A) and fire risks under Zambian conditions are considered below average.
As is the case with most government owned plantations in other countries
the Government would assume the fire risk itself.
D. Procurement
5.07      Of the various types of physical equipment (see Annex 9B), inter-
national competitive bidding would be applicable for tractors, dozers and
graders, trucks and personnel vehicles. The trucks and personnel vehicles,
however, are expected to be procured locally (para. 4.07).
5.08      Fire tenders and other small items of plantation eouipment
representing less than 5 percent of the total cost of the project would
not be subject to international competitive bidding as the tenders would



- 12 -
be too small and equipment too diversified. Competitive local bidding
would, however, be applied.
5.09      Construction of buildings and roads would be done by the Industrial
Plantations Division with its own labor. Materials would be subject to
competitive local bidding. Land clearance work would be subject to inter-
national competitive bidding, but it is expected that local contractors would
obtain the contract, as the work is probably too small to be of interest to
international contractors. All other establishment costs being normal forest
operation and as such not subject to international competitive bidding,
would be undertaken by the Industrial Plantations Division.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
A. Economic Rate of Return
6.01      An analysis has been made of the economic return of the 8 year
project and the full program. This analysis consists of comparisons of the
cost stream resulting from each with the cost stream which would result from
the next best alternative providing the same quantity of wood. This alter-
native assumed the exploitation of indigenous forests for the mining indus-
try and the import of timber for the other wood-using industries. Impbrts
would be more costly than timber supplied by the\Industrial Plantations
Division, and exploitation of local forests would soon become as expensive,
as supplies near the mines become exhausted (transport cost is about 1/5
ngwee per cubic foot per mile and roads and mills would have to be construc-
ted).
6.02      Taking the above considerations into account, the economic rates
of return of both the project and the full program work out to about 13
percent.  It may be mentioned again that in this calculation the output of
the smaller wood thinnings for which presently no market exists, has not
been taken into account.
B. Other Benefits
6.03      In the calculation of the economic rate of return official ex-
change rates have been used though it may be expected that in the future
some rationing of foreign exchange will take place. The savings in foreign
exchange, after loan service of the proposed Bank loan, due to the project
would be about K 2 million per annum, starting in 1983 and increasing to
K 7 million as of the year 2000.
6.o4      The project would provide employment for about 400 laborers until
1976 and 900 when Pines come into production. The availability of reasonably-
priced locally-grown wood would result in the establishment of additional
secondary wood-using industries.



- 13 -
6.05      The rates of return as calculated are sufficient to justify the
project. In addition, the project would result in substantial foreign
exchange savings, help to ease the unemployment problem and result in the
establishment of ancillary industries.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The proposed project is. intended to meet Zambia's demand for
industrial wood, and consists of an 8-year planting program which forms
part of a long-term afforestation program. During the 8-year period about
20,000 acres of Eucalypt and 20,000 acres of Pine would be planted. The
savings in foreign exchange due to the program would be substantial and
the rate of return to the economy of the country indicates that the pro-
gram is economically justified. The program is technically sound and
financially feasible.
7.02      Satisfactory assurances were obtained from the Government during
negotiations that:
(a) any modification to the 8-year planting program would
be acceptable to the Bank (para 4.02);
(b) the key staff of the Industrial Plantations Division
would be mutually acceptable (para 5.04).
7.03      With the arrangements in the previous paragraph satisfied, the
project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 5.3 million, representing
about 48 percent of the investment cost (excluding interest) of the program
during the eight-year planting period 1969 - 1976 and to be repaid in 25
years including 10 years of grace.

ANNEX TB
ZAMBIA INDUSTRIAL FORESTRY PROJECT
Assumptions for Demand Projections
1.        Demand projections have been made by applying growth rates to
the various categories of timber consumed in Zambia as shown for the base
year 1965 in Annex TA. These various categories of timber consumption do
not comprise the whole timber market of Zambia, but only what could reason-
ably be considered to be assured markets that could be supplied by the
project.
2.        The demand for small poles by mining and agriculture was estimated
to be 800,000 cu ft roundwood equivalent in 1965. Out of this 500,000 cu
,t could be provided by Eucalypt and 300,000 cu ft could be provided by
Pine. The very conservative growth rate of four percent was assumed for
this demand.
3.        The 1965 consumption of saw logs consist of (a) that of the mining
industry 1,950,000 cu ft (an appropriate breakdown would be 650,000 cu ft
Pine, 1,300,000 cu ft Eucalypt) and (b) that from other industries such as
construction of about 2,550,000 cu ft (of which 2,050,000 cu ft would be
Pine, and 500,000 cu ft Eucalypt). It has been assumed that the demand for
jaw logs by the mining industry would remain at the 1965 level, in spite of
demand projections by Government and industry shoving a five percent growth
rate, in order to account for possible substitution by non-timber products.
The demand from the building and other industries has been assumed to grow
at a six percent rate. This is considered conservative as the National
Plan shows a demand projection for the next five years of 20 percent.
ii,       The demand for refinery and smelting poles (950,000 cu ft in 1965),
iimilarly with mining saw logs, has also been assumed to remain constant.
5.        The demand for transmission and telephone poles was about 200,000
eu ft in 1965, and should grow along with the electrification program very
strongly. Though growth of 15 percent is expected in Zambia, only a seven
percent growth rate in the long-term has been assumed for the projections
in Annex 7A.
6.        A comparison of the output from the plantations (annex 6) with the
aemand projections (Annex 7A) has been set-out in Annex 8 and shows market-
able output. Where production exceeds demand, only estimated demand has been
tiken into account in the calculation of revenues. Such surpluses consist
imainly of small wood. Though expectations are that secondary small wood
using industries will soon be established, no value has been ascribed to
this small wood in order to have a conservative projection.



ANNEX 7B
Page 2
7.        The prices used (per cu ft roundwood equivalent under bark at
ride side) in the calculation of revenues (See Annex 8) are K 0.15 for
small wood and refinery poles, K 0.25 for saw logs and K 0.60 for trans-
mission poles. These prices are about 30-40 percent below current landed
prices of imported wood and have been assumed at this level in order to
leave a margin which would constitute an incentive for private enterprise.
They should be considered conservative.

ANNEX 9A
Page 1
ZAMBIA INDUSTRIAL FORESTRY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
1.   Revenues
Revenues include only marketable produce, i.e. production up to
the demand forecasts (see Annex 7). at the folloving rates per cubic foot
under bark at ride side: K 0.15 for small wood and refinery poles, K 0.25
for saw logs and K 0.60 for transmission poles.
2.   Capital Costs
All capital costs have been conservatively estimated on the basis
of the present method of operation. It is expected, however, that economies
of scale and the adoption of further improved development techniques will
lead to cost reductions of at least 10 percent. This provides an adequate
contingency to cover possible price and wage increases. The number of units
of physical equipment needed for the project is presented in Annex 9B, and
explained below:
3.   Tractors
It has been assumed that the average lifetime of a tractor will be
four years, representing 8-10,000 hours of service. The average price of a
tractor is K 2,800; no import duties are levied. The work involved in the
planting of 5,000 acres during the period November/December requires a fleet
of 53 tractors. During the rest of the year these tractors would be fully
employed on weeding and other operations. In addition to this fleet a trac-
tor is needed for about every 300,000 cubic feet of wood harvested. Thus,
for instance, in the year 1969, when about 600,000 cubic feet of wood will
be exploited the total tractor fleet would be 55 units. In 1979 a yield of
9 million cubic feet would require a fleet of 53 + 28 = 81 units. Up to
that date fleet utilization is divided equally between Pines and Eucalypts.
Additional tractors would be needed for the Pine program until a total of 94
tractors is reached in 1994. Economies of scale will be possible by using
specialized logging equipment. This has not been taken into account.
4.   Dozers/Graders
One bulldozer (K12,000) and two graders (at K 13,500 each) are to
be kept at each of the three plantations for road construction, maintenance,
building dams, collecting nursery soil, etc. Lifetime is five years; no
import duties are levied. The total investment costs are to be charged half
to Eucalypts and half to Pines.
5.   Fire Tenders
A fire tender consists of a watertank and pump on a 4 x 4 chassis.
Cost K 5,200. There are no import duties. Lifetime is six years. One



ANNEX 9A
Page 2
fire tender would be required for each 3,000 acres of Pine over three years
of age. As Eucalypts have less fire hazard than Pines, but still need some
protection, a nominal charge of 20 percent of the investment costs should be
applied to Eucalypts up to 1978. Any increase after 1978 is to be charged
to Pines.
6.   Trucks
Three trucks would be needed at headquarters for transport of
building materials, etc., and six trucks would be needed to transport
nursery soil and road filling. For the weeding of 12,500 acres per annum
(Eucalypts are not weeded in the third year) 10 trucks would be needed to
transport men and materials. In addition to these 19 trucks another 2
trucks would be needed for each 5,000 acres of plantation established
starting in 1970 for general supervision and maintenance. The cost of a
truck is about K 3,300. No import duties are levied on trucks assembled in
Zambia. Otherwise there is a ten percent duty. The investment costs should
be borne equally by Pine and Eucalypts until the Eucalypt plantation has
been established (1978). The increase in trucks after this date is for
Pines. Lifetime of a truck is four years.
7.   Personnel Vehicles
The number of personnel vehicles required is based on the number
of staff necessary for the project (see Annex 9C). The average cost per
vehicle is K 1,160, and the average lifetime is assumed to be four years.
Ten percent duty is levied on vehicles not assembled in Zambia. Investment
costs are equally divided between Pines and Eucalypts until 1978, all in-
crease after that is charged to Pines.
8.   Plantation Equipment
The average value of the plantation equipment consisting of plows,
harrows, winches, trailers, frontend loaders, grasscutters, etc., and
necessary to establish 5,000 acres per year is K 90,000. Average life is
five years.
9.   Buildings
Each beat (2,500 acres) requires a Forester Station of 9 super-
visor houses, 2 stores, 1 garage and 1 office and 1 hall, i.e. 14 units.
Each 10,000 acres requires a principal Forester Station and Nursery of 17
supervisor houses, 1 hall, 4 stores, 2 garages, 1 workshop, 4 offices, and 6
miscellaneous buildings, i.e. 35 units. In addition to this, houses have
to be provided for labor under Zambian law. For each beat, about 46 labor
quarters are necessary. The average cost of a building unit is about K 1,160,
with a lifetime of 30 years. The number of units required is shown in
Annex 9B. Up to 1978 the investment costs are equally divided between Pines
and Eucalypts, after 1978 all increases are for Pines.



ANXEX 9A
Page 3
10. Roads
The road intensity per 100 acres is 0.8 miles of gravelled earth
road costing K 600 per mile and 0.8 mile of ride (ungravelled) costing
K 72 per mile. The average cost per mile is thus K 336. The number of
miles necessary for the plantations is shown in Annex 9B. Up to 1978
investment costs are equally divided between Pines and Eucalypts, after
1978 all increases necessary are to be charged to Pines. As the roads are
maintained annually, the lifetime of a road is indefinite.
11. Miscellaneous
Each 2,500 acres planted requires a fire tower with radio at an
average cost of K 1,600, and the Forester Station for such a beat requires a
water installation costing K 4,000. In addition to this a water/power
installation costing K 12,000 is necessary for each Principal Forester
Station of 10,000 acres. Average new investments per year with a lifetime
of 10 years are thus K 17,200 for a planting program of 5,000 acres.
12. Land Clearing and Preparation
Land clearing and preparation includes knockdown and windrowing
(K 23.50 per acre), stumping (K 7 per acre), land clearing and tractor
clearing (K 4.20 per acre), filling of holes, plowing and discing (K 5.30
per acre). Total cost is K 40 per acre, of Which knockdown and windrow-
ing is by contract. The cost of K 40 per acre is reduced to K 16 an
acre in second rotation. These cost estimates are conservative. For
instance, it has not been taken into account that for certain areas up to
K 10 per acre may be paid by the local population for the right to charcoal
burn the knockdowns.
13. Nursery
The cost of providing nursery transplants works out to about
K 14.34 per acre. This includes about K 12 for labor, K 2 for materials
and K 0.34 for fuel and lubricants. Also these costs have been estimated
conservatively and could be reduced substantially.
14. Planting and Fertilizing
The total cost to plant an acre is about K 2.42, of which about
K 2 is for labor and K 0.42 for fuel and lubricants. Only Eucalypts are
fertilized at a cost of K 9.16 per acre (3 ozs of NPK and 4 ozs of borate
per plant at K 7.82 per acre, fuel and lubricants at K 0.30 and labor at
K 1.04 per acre fertilized).



ANNEX 9A
Page 4
15. Weeding and Cleaning
Weeding and Cleaning costs per acre are as follows:
- - - - - Pines - - - -      ----    Eucalypt--
Labor.   Fuel &     Total    Labor   Fuel &   Total
Lubric.                     Lubric.
1st year K   4.38      0.70      5.08     4.38     0.70     5.08
2nd year K   3.56      o.60      4.16     0.24     0.20     0.44
3rd year K   0.50     0.40       0.90      -        -       _
Only Pines are weeded for three years.   To these costs must be added the
cost of singling (removal of double leaders) of Eucalypts and Pines at 6-18
months at a cost of K 0.078 per acre. The total cost for the 12,500 acres
annual weeding and cleaning program is thus about K 25,400 for Pine (7,500
acres) and K 14,000 for Eucalypt (5,000 acres). These costs are conserva-
tive, as it is anticipated that the weeding program can be reduced without
detrimental effect to the establishment of the forest.
16. Pruning
Initially pruning will be restricted to only Pines. The first
pruning operation will be at 4 years age up to 8 feet at a cost of K 2.54
an acre (538 trees). The second operation to 15 feet at 6 years at a cost
of also K 2.54 an acre (300 trees) and the third to 22 feet at 8 years at
a cost of K 3.58 an acre (200 trees). The cost of pruning stabilizes in
1974 at a total of K 21,700 per year.
17. Assessments
The costs of assessments are relatively small and consist of the
cost of labor required to assist forest rangers on assessment of work con-
tent for payment rates, stock-taking, etc.
18. Fire Protection
Fire protection will increase in proportion to the area of Pines
over three years of age. This category includes the cost of fire watchers,
patrols, maintenance of cleared fire breaks, etc., and will increase by
about K 2,500 per year. Any increase after 1978 is to be charged to Pines.
19. Staff
The total staff requirements and cost estimates are presented in
Annex 9C. All increases in staff after 1978 are for the Pine program.
Salaries are based on present conditions in Zambia. Increases in salaries
can be compensated by reductions in staff, as the attached schedule presents
a conservative estimate.
