A: PROGRAM PURPOSE AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
1. Program purpose and program phasing (see Annex 1)
The purpose of the Agricultural Sector Public Expenditure Program (PROAGRI) is to improve the impact
of public expenditure in securing an enabling environment for sustainable and equitable growth in the
rural sector such that poverty is reduced and food security improved, while the physical and social
environment is protected. With macroeconomic and agriculture sector policy reforms largely completed,
the policy environment is now favorable for growth in the agricultural sector. What remain to be
undertaken are institutional reforms to complement the policy reforms - institutional reforns of MAP
itself and of its programs. At present, MAP's institutional structure and its portfolio of programs still
reflect an historical heritage in which MAP's role was considerably different from the role which it will
now be expected to play. Further, MAP's programs are supported through a confusing and uncoordinated
array of donor initiatives. PROAGRI would encompass all public expenditure programs managed by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP), excluding the fisheries subsector. PROAGRI would reform
MAP's structures around a rationalized set of core activities and would coordinate donor support to these
programs. This reform would be guided by functional analysis, much of which has already been carried
out during the course of preparation. PROAGRI would be effectuated through a graduated fifteen year
three-phased (five years each) Adaptable Program Lending instrument (an APL). In addition to financing
some on-going core activities of MAP, the first five-year phase of PROAGRI would be focussed upon (i)
transforming MAP's institutional structure and its programs of activities to make them more congruent
with its newly-defined core functions; and (ii) strengthening MAP's capacity to undertake its newly-
defined core functions. Two subsequent five-yearphases would also finance MAP's core functions, with
Govemment gradually assuming responsibility for all recurrent costs over a fifteen to twenty-year period.
2. Program development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1)
At one level, the objective of the first five-year phase of PROAGRI would be to establish an institutional
structure designed to provide cost-effective delivery of a core set of agriculture and natural resources
related services. This would result in a down-sized MAP focused on a reduced set of activities. Some
functions would be devolved from MAP at the national level to the Provincial or the District level. In this
regard, the impact of this first phase of PROAGRI would be assessed against process-related indicators
related to progress toward bringing about institutional change. These would include indicators such as:
changes in MAP's staffing (number of employees, skill mix, capacity, level of deconcentration); the
success with which some services formerly carried out by MAP have been privatized or contracted out;
and, the extent to which operational management of MAP's programs has been decentralised to the
provinces and to beneficiaries. At a more basic level, the objective of PROAGRI would be to enable
sustainable and equitable growth in the agricultural sector (see paragraph 1 above). Consequently,
PROAGRI would also be assessed against impact indicators such as: the extent to which competition and
volume are increased in agricultural input and output markets as evidenced by the number of traders
participating in a given market; the narrowing of the gap between prices received by farmers and those
prevailing in local markets and at the border; increases in agricultural production and productivity;
increases in the contribution of marketed agricultural produce to household income for small-holder
subsistence level families; the number of wildlife present in national parks and reserves; the area of forest
under sustainable commercial and community management; the number of properties demarcated, land
claims adjudicated, and titles registered; the extent to which water-users have become responsible for the
O&M of irrigation schemes; hectares under sustainable irrigation systems. These indicators would be



2
refined and monitored during the implementation of PROAGRI. Satisfactory performance against such
indicators in PROAGRI's first phase would "trigger" continued IDA support to PROAGRI in the form of
a second-phase of the APL ("trigger points" are established in attachment 1 to Annex 1). Over the course
of the first five-year phase of the APL, similar triggers would be set for the APL's third phase.
B: STRATEGIC CONTEXT
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goals supported by the program (see
Annex 1)
Three primary strategic priorities are raised in the CAS (presented to the Board on December 18. 1997).
The first, and broadest, of these is an emphasis on taking steps to ensure thiat future economic growth be
broad-based - this for reasons pragmatic as well as equity-based. Mozambique's GDP growth has been
impressive in recent years - an estimated 12% per annum in 1997. However, per capita GNP remains very
low at an estimated US$140 for the same year. Eighty percent of all Mozambicans are rural based, and two
thirds of them live in absolute poverty. Agriculture and natural resource exploitation is the dominant
economic activity in rural areas, employing 70 percent of the labor force but contributing only 32 percent
to GDP - an indication of how low returns to labor are in rural areas. Following the end of civil war and
severe drought in 1992/93, the agricultural sector has grown by an average of 14 percent per annum, albeit
from a very low base. While this rapid growth partly reflects a recovery effect, it is also due to gradual
liberalization of macro and sectoral policies which started in 1987. Interest rates and exchange rates are
now stable and market determined. Agricultural markets have been liberalized and Govemment has
withdrawn from direct intervention in most economic activities. The Government's capacity to carry out
essential regulatory and public support functions is weak but vital in the liberalized economic
environment. These functions are prerequisites for a growth-nurturing economic environment, but can also
play an important equity-related role in making broad participation in economic activities possible for the
wealthy and the poor alike.
The second strategic priority of the CAS focuses on human resource development, which includes
strengthening Govemment's institutional capacity. Govemment's capacity is weak, in part, because civil
service salaries and benefits are very low and it is hard to retain good staff. Only 3 percent of the country's
95,000 civil servants are educated to tertiary level, and 80 percent of all civil servants have only six years
of schooling or less. In MAP itself, only 395 (7 percent) of the total of 5,900 employees have received
university education and most (around 80 percent) of these relatively well-trained staff are located at the
central level. Intemal management processes are ineffective, and Government has only recently begun
reviewing its functions to meet the requirements of a market-oriented economy. Provincial and district
level implementation capacity is weak in both the public and private sectors.
The third strategic priority of the CAS is the strengthening of developmenit partnerships among
Govemment, donors, NGOs, civil society, and the private sector. This is particularly crucial in
Mozambique due to its unusually heavy dependence on donor support. The Government budget
represented 29 percent of GDP, about US$ 770 million in 1997. Of this, 47 percent was recurrent, and 53
percent capital. Donors financed 45 percent of the budget, with funds directed mainly at capital
expenditure. The situation in agriculture is even more unbalanced. Public expenditure through MAP
(some 6-7 percent of total Government expenditure in 1997) was US$ 48 million, of which only US$ 5
million was contributed by the Govemment. It is imperative that public expenditure in support of the
agriculture sector be used effectively, and that the use of donor support reflect the priorities of society.
Historically, development partnerships and donor coordination have been difficult to establish and
maintain.



3
PROAGRI would address each of these three CAS priorities. PROAGRI would "promote rapid, broad-based, private
sector-led growth" through reforming MAP's activities so that they are designed to create an attractive economic
environment for sustainable development. Through rationalization of MAP's institutional structure to improve
management effectiveness, and through investments in capacity building within MAP and at provincial and local
levels, PROAGRI would directly support the CAS goal to "build capacity and develop human resources". With
regard to the CAS goal of strengthening development partnerships, PROAGRI would provide a concrete and direct
framework for building consensus and collaboration among donors and with Government in their joint support of
the agricultural sector.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy
Because of its important share of the economy and of the labor force, and because of its physical potential.
agriculture will be the most important engine of growth in the Mozambican economy for some time.
However, at this juncture it must start from a very low base and faces many challenges. During the
widespead conflict of the 1980s and early 1990s, much of the country's physical and marketing
infrastructure in rural areas was damaged or destroyed. Work-oxen, livestock and wildlife populations
were decimated. Most farmers are totally decapitalized having been displaced from their farmsteads
during the period of conflict. Their farming endeavours are significantly constrained by limited access to
seeds, tools, fertiliser, and pesticides, and other inputs required to intensify production and to expand
output. Consequently, smallholder farmers mainly employ traditional low-input methods characterized by
the use of handtools and the almost complete absence of purchased inputs. The only significant exception
to this is found in cotton-based farming systems serviced by commercial ginneries. Consequently, despite
Mozambique's favorable agroecological endowment, crop yields are low relative to their potential and are
even low relative to those achieved by farmers in neighboring countries. In recent years, good rainfall has
made it possible for total production of food staples to exceed the aggregate needs of the 16 million
population. Even so, the threat of food insecurity continues to loom large for a high proportion of rural
households.
At present, it is estimated that only 40 percent of cultivable land is used, but access problems and
inadequate support services constrain development to areas where population density is high and overuse
of natural resources and degradation are issues. At the same time, the allocation of large land concessions
threatens to further marginalize smallholders' claims and access to the land. While market liberalization is
virtually complete, private sector engagement in input supply is limited so far, and the effectiveness of
public services in supporting agricultural development is low. Elimination of high inflation and
privatization of retail banking have laid the basis for financial sector growth, though access to credit for
smallholders is still virtually nonexistent. Limited access to output markets for farm produce also
constrains growth in the sector. Improvements in rural infrastructure will be key to improving this
situation.
The issues highlighted above underpin the strategy outlined in the Bank's recent Agricultural Sector
Memorandum (Report No. 16259 MOZ; April 30, 1997). That strategy is broadly consistent with the
sectoral objectives established by Govemment in its "Agricultural Policy and Strategy for
Implementation" (PAEI) of 1995, paraphrased as "transform subsistence agriculture, linking it ever more
closely into production, marketing and processing activities, and increasing marketed surpluses, while
also developing an efficient commercial sector". The four main elements of this strategy are to:
(i) Continue to develop an enabling environment for market-based agricultural development;
(ii) Improve the road transport and communications infrastructure;
(iii) Intensify small-holder production through making appropriate technologies available; and
(iv) Regulate agricultural markets and natural resource use to establish the "rules of the game" and
ensure that negative and positive externalities are intemalized.
Continuation of Government's current course of prudent macroeconomic management, civil service
reform, and ongoing and planned public expenditure programs in education, environmental management,



4
health, transport infrastructure, and water resource development will complement PROAGRI in creating
conditions conducive to sustainable agricultural development. A further initiative outside the scope of
PROAGRI will address the issue of availability of rural credit. A working group comprising Government,
donor, NGO, and private sector representatives, has initiated a review of best practices in rural credit and
will attempt to formulate a policy framework for micro/rural finance that will guide public support for
formal and informal intermediation between the commercial banks and the urban and rural poor.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the program and strategic choices
PROAGRI would provide the mechanism through which MAP would implement its strategy (as
summarized above) to address the key issues facing the agricultural sector. With regard to MAP's strategy
to:
(i) develop an enabling environment for market-based agricultural development - PROAGRI would
support agricultural policy analysis, policy fonnulation, and monitoring, allowing MAP to improve
competition and transparency in agricultural markets. This would enhance MAP's capacity to identify
activities which should be contracted out or privatized, and would strengthen MAP's capacity to carry
out either of these options. PROAGRI would also strengthen MAP's capacity to gather, analyse, and
make available agricultural information;
(ii) improve the road transport and communications infrastructure - F'ROAGRI would strengthen
MAP's capacity to assist the National Directorate of Roads and Bridges in identifying key roads for
rehabilitation so that smallholders have greater access to local and regional markets;
(iii) intensify small-holder production through making appropriate technologies available - PROAGRI
would improve the effectiveness of public support services for agriculture through developing
decentralized and demand-driven approaches to crop, forestry, and livestock research and extension,
small-scale irrigation development, and market intelligence; and
(iv) regulate agricultural markets and natural resource use to establish the "rules of the game" and
ensure that negative and positive extemalities are intemalized - PROA.GRI would support further
design and implementation of improved land tenure regulation, to reinforce smallholder tenure
security, and establish the incentives for sustainable exploitation of forests, rivers, coasts and other
natural resources. PROAGRI would also support MAP in addressing issues surrounding intellectual
property rights and patents for the import and sale of trademark genetic material and other technology;
and restricting the use and increasing the availability of information on agro-chemicals with
potentially harmful health and environmental effects. These developments would strengthen MAP's
ability to assess trends in the market-based economy, to formulate and advocate policies to enhance
smallholder access to the market, diminish the impact of market failures, and increase private sector
participation in agricultural input and output markets and in provision of services.
PROAGRI would empower MAP to carry out the strategy outlined above through investing in
institutional strengthening and reform with emphases in the following areas:
(i) strengthening MAP's capacit, to manage at all levels. This would entail training activities and
technical assistance to set in place modem transparent management systems with which to administer
MAP's programs;
(ii) decentralization of responsibility for many core functions, decentralizing annual budgeting,
planning, and administration, investing in human resources, and increasing farmer participation in the
definition of strategies and the implementation of support programs;
(iii) limiting MAP's role to core functions, interventions in support of agriculture that fall outside
MAP's mandate, such as credit and rural infrastructure, would not be included in PROAGRI;
(iv) building fiscal sustainability by quantifying from an early stage PROAGRI's budgetary impact,
and discussing at six-monthly intervals with the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF) the
availability of Government funds, and priorities for use of local and dcnor funds;



5
(v) building of a consensus in Government on: (a) the positions outlined in MAP's policy statement of
1995 (PAEI) and in the Agricultural Sector Memorandum (1997) and reflected in the "Letter of
Agricultural Development Policy" (see Annex 11); (b) the strategies implicit in the Basic Principles
(see Annex 11, Attachment 2) that guide MAP's activities under PROAGRI;
(vi) strengthening stakeholder "ownership" of MAP's activities through greater local participation in
the assessment of issues, and in the preparation of subsectoral strategies and PROAGRI components.
Formulation has been led by MAP's Directorate of Economics, which is responsible for planning, and
has involved each technical directorate and agency at the centre and in all provinces, and systematic
consultation with representative public and private sector stakeholders at all levels. Widespread
involvement of MAP staff in the preparation process has contributed to development of their planning
and budgeting skills, and to a new understanding of MAP's role in a market-based economy; and
(vii) building consensus among donors and with Govemment on the approach and priorities for
assistance to the agricultural sector. IDA has provided technical guidance and strong linkages across
sectors and with different public agencies. Several other donors have also contributed financial and
technical assistance to the formulation process. Government and FAO have coordinated donor
participation. DANIDA played a significant role in facilitating the development of a joint donor
vision, by sponsoring a donor meeting on PROAGRI in Copenhagen. At appraisal, eighteen donors
affirmed their commitment to PROAGRI and others have also shown interest in supporting the
program. The strong partnership developed among donors and with Government will facilitate the
resolution of problems during implementation.
4. Program description and performance triggers for subsequent credits
PROAGRI would be the first phase of a long term program aimed at supporting Government's
agricultural development goals by rationalizing sectoral public expenditure and the role of MAP and
improving its effectiveness in policy formulation, regulation, and service provision. MAP and MPF have
agreed on a five-year budget (CYs 1999-2003) for PROAGRI of US$216.5 million including
contingencies that includes all MAP's investment and recurrent expenditure over the period, all
Govemment and existing donor commitments channeled through MAP, and new donor commitments.
PROAGRI would replace fragmented donor-driven projects with a comprehensive program consistent
with MAP's role in a market-based economy. Donors are committed to cofinancing PROAGRI against a
set of basic principles (see Annex I 1, Attachment 2) that guide the direction of MAP's transformation and
its support for the sector, while leaving flexibility for MAP with regard to the actual evolution of its
institutional structures and activities. A set of milestones with which to assess MAP's progress toward
carrying out programs which are consistent with the basic principles was agreed at appraisal. These
milestones will be reviewed by MAP and donors annually. The basic principles provide a point of
reference which will orient discussion concerning the program between MAP and donors and which will
empower MAP to coordinate donors. MAP's adherence to these basic principles in its planning and
implementation of programs, as evidenced at the planning stage by plans which are designed to achieve
the milestones, and as evidenced in the actual achievement of milestones over time, will be the basis for
annual reviews and approval of work plans and budgets. Given the evolutionary approach adopted for
PROAGRI and the long term support required to ensure significant agricultural growth and fiscal
sustainability, IDA financing will be provided through an Adaptable Program Credit (APL). The APL is
an instrument which will permit flexible IDA support to PROAGRI predicated upon Government
compliance with the agreed basic principles and milestones. Implementation capacity will be developed
gradually and funding will depend on prior year performance and adherence to the basic principles.
Demonstration of progress against selected milestones would be the trigger for annual support to the
programs as well as to the development of subsequent tranches of IDA funding under the APL (see Annex
I attachment).

2. Key policy reforms supported by the program
The Letter of Sector Policy (see Annex 11) articulates the status of rural development policy in
Mozarnbique, key issues to be addressed, and the actions to be taken by M.AR and other government
agencies to address these concerns. In brief, exchange rates and interest rates are now market determined.
Inflation in 1997 was 6 percent and is currently negligible. Nearly all policy-induced distortions affecting
the agricultural sector have been removed. Parastatals no longer control marketing of produce or inputs.
Prices for all agricultural commodities are effectively market determined. International trade in
agricultural commodities and inputs is substantially liberalized, with protection for the cashew and sugar
processing industries the main outstanding issue. However, the key areas where Govemment action is
needed in the near term to encourage agricultural growth relate to improving farmer access to markets and
market information, improved planting material, tools, storage facilities, fertilizer and other inputs, and
strengthening of tenure security for smallholders. PROAGRI actions to address these concerns would
include, inter alia: establishing capacity in MAP to monitor the effects of government policies on
agriculture, formulate new policies, and influence the decisions of public agencies responsible for
transport infrastructure, credit and other interventions, in the interests of smallholders; collection and
dissemination of market information; increasing smallholders' exposure to improved technologies;
promotion of farmers' and producers' associations and private sector provision of extension and input
supply; and support for the regulatory and administrative framework required to implement the new Land
Law.
3. Benefits and target population
PROAGRI will support a process which (i) brings coherence and a policy focus to Govemment and donor
expenditure in support of sustainable agricultural development and natural resource management, (ii)
rationalizes the role of Govemment, and (iii) increases the effectiveness of (Government in policy making,
sectoral monitoring, regulation and the provision of key public services. PROAGRI will also result in an
increase in the effectiveness of public expenditure in infrastructure, communications, health, education
and other aspects of rural development which depend on MAP for policy guidance and leadership. Under
PROAGRI, a more effective, decentralized and rationalized Government should result in reducing
constraints to smallholder agricultural growth: the development of incipient markets in produce, inputs
and labor, increased investment in the provision of essential agricultural services and rural infrastructure;
and improvements in the security of land tenure for the smallholder sector. These changes will improve
the enabling environment for private sector investment, and will result in a sustained increase in the
agricultural growth rate, which implies higher incomes for farmers, reduced prices for consumers and
increased export earnings and tax revenues for the country. While responding to the needs of the sector as
a whole, PROAGRI will focus on overcoming failures in markets and reguLations which hold back the
development of the 3 million smallholder subsistence farmers. This will have a positive distributive
impact since poverty in Mozambique is mainly rural, and of this rural population, two thirds live in
absolute poverty.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements
The existing institutional structure of MAP still reflects the legacy of past approaches to public sector
involvement in the agricultural sector. With the results of the functional analysis of the public sector's role
in the agricultural sector are emerging new visions for MAP's core functions (see the basic principles in
attachment 2 to Annex 11) and for the agricultural development strategy to be pursued by MAP (see
Section B.2. above). Realization of these new visions will require changes in MAP's institutional
structure. PROAGRI would support restructuring of MAP. The main features of the restructuring will be:
(a) reduction of MAP's activities to core functions appropriate for the public sector in a market-based
economy; and (b) measures to improve administrative effectiveness, includitg progressive



9
decentralization of authority to subsidiary agencies and the provincial level. The first round of functional
analysis of MAP has been completed resulting in an initial definition of functions that must remain with
the Ministry, and of activities that can be privatized or contracted to the private sector. The next steps
include definition of the allocation of decision-making and implementation authority among the central,
provincial and district levels, and elaboration of functional models for each level. This will provide the
basis for determining staffing and training requirements. Completion of the functional analysis and
initiation of the implied restructuring of MAP are scheduled for 1999. Led by the Directorate of
Economics, a Task Force comprising focal points in each directorate and province will manage the process
of institutional reform and modernization. To support decision making on the proposed reforms and
intersectoral coordination, consultative groups with other representative stakeholders including the
Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF), the Ministry of State Administration (MAE), and donors, will
also be established.
Several important structural changes have already been agreed for implementation in 1999. First,
reorganization of the Directorate of Economics to establish capacity for i) in-house sector policy analysis
and formulation, collaboration with universities and local research institutes on policy analysis and
discussion, and increased coordination with other sector ministries on cross-sectoral issues and policies;
ii) definition of appropriate planning, monitoring and evaluation, and impact assessment systems for
PROAGRI's implementing agencies; (iii) consolidating reports and annual work plans prepared by the
implementing agencies; (iv) preparing semi-annual monitoring and evaluation reports and a Mid-Term
review for the program; (v) organizing independent monitoring and evaluation exercises. Second, the
merging of individual projects' financial and procurement arrangements into a unified PROAGRI system
under MAP's Department of Administration and Finance (DAF). DAF will be strengthened in order to
assume these responsibilities. Third, an Agricultural Research Council will be created, responsible for
coordinating agricultural and natural resource related research activities and setting budgetary priorities
and allocations for these activities. Fourth, preparation of a statute to make the cashew, cotton, and sugar
institutes autonomous and self-financing.
Common implementation arrangements: The PROAGRI joint donor coordination meeting held in
Copenhagen in October 1997 resulted in agreement to the principle of common implementation
procedures with regard to budgeting, financial management, asset management, local procurement,
auditing, monitoring, evaluation, reporting, staff incentives and national consultancies, supervision and
program review missions. Subsequently, PROAGRI was selected as a pilot for enhanced harmonization of
donor procedures within the framework of the Special Program for Africa. Many of the donors are
constrained to follow institution-specific procedures which are not always consistent with those of other
donors. Not all of these implementation procedures will be fully harmonized at the outset of the program,
but donors are committed to continue working towards ever more complete harmonization during the life
of PROAGRI and the result will be a set of procedures which will evolve over time.
Financial Management, Management Information System (MIS), and Procurement: The smooth operation
of financial management, MIS, and procurement procedures are preconditions for effective
implementation of PROAGRI. They are also preconditions for the contemplated decentralization of
MAP's activities. Financial management and management information system studies have been
completed by consulting firms. These studies provide recommendations on system design, and the
training needed to upgrade the skills of MAP's staff (and that of provincial offices). Government will
contract an independent company for the first two years of the program, to establish and implement the
proposed financial management and procurement system, including the training of MAP staff, and another
company for one year to establish and test the management information system. A representative
Financial Management Committee (including MPF) will be set up to oversee establishment and operation
of the unified financial management system. Pending development of the unified system to be
administered through MAP's DAF, ongoing and new IDA funds (i.e. the PRDSA and the new Credit) will
both be managed by the existing IDA-funded Agricultural Services Rehabilitation and Development



10
Project (PRDSA) management unit. In order that the project unit is capable to take on the additional
responsibility of the management of the new IDA funds (to become available under this Credit), the
PRDSA unit will be strengthened by an accountant and a procurement officer. Once the new systems are
in place to the satisfaction of IDA, administration of both projects would be gradually transferred to
MAP's DAF.
Decentralization: In line with Govemment's decentralization policy, implementation of most PROAGRI
activities will be carried out by the Provincial and District Directorates for Agriculture and Fisheries.
PROAGRI will give high priority to the development and strengthening of'managerial and
implementation capacity at provincial and district levels. In 1998, progress in this direction has already
been initiated via the mechanism of the planning and budgeting process - each province was assisted in
the preparation of its own annual work plan and budget for 1999. This first-ever set of decentralized work
plans and budgets haSbeen reviewed and endorsed by MAP and MPF as well as by all donors. A similar
procedure will be followed in subsequent years. The ongoing functional analysis will further establish the
functions to be devolved to local levels, and complementary work will be undertaken to identify the
mechanisms and structures which will be needed at local levels to take on these responsibilities.
Training of provincial staJff A training program for provincial staff will be launched in 1999 to strengthen
their skills in client consultation, planning, budgeting, financial management, procurement, and
monitoring and evaluation. Each province will be reinforced by the recruitment of a budget/financial
specialist and a procurement planning specialist.
Human resources assessment, career development, and staff incentives: Improving human resource
management in MAP, including strengthening career development functions and establishing a
performance-based incentive system, are prerequisites for successful implementation of PROAGRI. A
human resource assessment of MAP staff has been carried out in close collaboration with the Ministry of
State Administration. The conclusions of this assessment in conjunction with the functional analysis
provide the basis for a career development program for MAP embracing relocation of staff, retrenchment,
training and performance-based incentives. Donors have agreed to fund all expenditures related to the
career development program, and some donors (other than IDA) will also fund the costs of reform-related
staff retrenchment. Under Government's civil service reform program, the first step in salary reform
became effective in 1998, benefiting medium- and upper-level management. In addition, MAP is
negotiating with the Ministry of Planning and Finance an on-budget bonus system which would be a
vehicle for facilitating deconcentration and retention of the most able and better qualified staff. All donors
have agreed to cease financing off-budget "topping ups" but would finance, on decreasing percentage
basis, an on-budget bonus system consistent with overall Government human resource policy.
D: PROGRAM RATIONALE
1. Design alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The alternative to the program approach proposed through PROAGRI is a continuation of the current
pattern of piecemeal project activity carried out by individual donors. Currently, donors fund 90% of all
public expenditure in agriculture and natural resources through a large number of separate project
activities which are mostly independent of each other. Experience has shown that this results in a lack of
defined priorities, and a plethora of uncoordinated technical approaches and administrative
implementation units. The haphazard pattem of activities which has resulted from this situation has had
limited development impact. The Government has not been able to gain effective control of the myriad of
activities of donors in order to coordinate them into a coherent development program.
In response to the problems of donor coordination, but also in response to the need for a thorough review



11
of MAP's core functions, the concept of PROAGRI as a program approach emerged. Under PROAGRI,
MAP's own institutional structure, its portfolio of activities, and the support of donors would all be
reviewed as an integrated whole. Much of this review has already been completed over the course of
preparation of PROAGRI. The eventual result of this review, once completed, would be a reformed
institutional structure for MAP and a new direction for its portfolio of programs. Further, through
PROAGRI, donors' support would be integrated and coordinated by MAP to explicitly support the new
structure and direction of MAP's programs.
It is ambitious to reform MAP's entire institutional structure as well as its entire portfolio of programs and
activities all at once, particularly given MAP's limited capacity at central and local levels. An alternative
strategy might have been to review and reformulate each of MAP's programs, one by one. However,
Govemment and donors agreed early on in the process that, in order to formulate a coherent overall
framework for the long term, a global (rather than a partial) review and functional analysis of MAP and its
entire set of programs would be necessary. The practical outcome of that exercise has been the joint
formulation and endorsement by Government and donors of the basic principles for the program.
While functional analysis and the formulation of an overall framework for PROAGRI are being
undertaken at a sectoral level, actual implementation of PROAGRI will be undertaken through a more
gradual and incremental approach. In the very short-term, most of MAP's on-going donor-supported
activities in the field (including IDA supported PRDSA) will be continued under their current
arrangements, with adjustments being made as required to bring them into conformity with PROAGRI's
basic principles. During the first two to three years of PROAGRI, most new support from donors would
be concentrated on institutional reform and capacity building, both at MAP headquarters and at the
provincial and local levels. In the case of IDA, for the first three years of PROAGRI, the new credit
would primarily finance institutional strengthening and capacity building for the Ministry and provinces,
and innovative design, piloting, and adoption of new decentralized approaches in the research, extension,
and land components. This would, in the initial months, be carried out through the mechanism of the
existing PRDSA project unit within MAP. Most other donors would also continue with on-going
activities and procedures in the short run while supporting activities to put institutional capacity into
place. As institutional capacity is established, donors (including IDA) would gradually broaden the scope
of activity and would increase the extent to which their resources are channelled through common
implementation procedures.

Donors have agreed to integrate each of these ongoing projects (with the exception of the RRP, which is
not under MAP) under PROAGRI. This means that: (i) the activities supported under the ongoing projects
will be reoriented as necessary so as to be consistent with PROAGRI's Basic Principles; and (ii) the
administrative mechanisms and procedures will gradually be reoriented so as to conform to the common
implementation procedures for all donors. These reorientations will not happen instantly, but will be
phased in through a transition period over the first several years of the program.
3. Lessons learned and reflected in the program design
First Lesson. A cornerstone upon which the successful implementation of any sector program depends is
the existence of an appropriate policy environment. In the case of PROAGRI, virtually all of the policy
reforms required to establish an appropriate policy environment have already been completed. Therefore,
the primary policy issue to be addressed under PROAGRI is the maintenance and, in some cases,
deepening of the policy reforms already put into place.
Second Lesson. A second cornerstone upon which the success of an agricultural sector program rests is
the establishment of conceptual clarity with regard to the role of the public sector in the agricultural sector
and agreement about the principles which should characterize activities and programs designed to carry
out the agreed upon role. In the preparation of PROAGRI, the development of a set of basic principles
and milestones has provided clarity on these issues. The basic principles orient all discussion about



13
PROAGRI activities and serve as a point of reference around which Government and donors can hold
each other accountable.
Third Lesson. Sector programs are by their very nature complicated amalgamns of sub-sectoral programns
which threaten to overwhelm the managerial capacity of many Ministries of Agriculture. The strategic
response to this threat under PROAGRI has been to: first, utilize the basic principles for conceptual clarity
as to the strategic directions of each sub-sector program; second, focus in early stages upon institutional
development and capacity building while only gradually taking on the broader tasks of transforning
MAP's entire portfolio of activities; and third, divide supervision responsibilities among donors letting
donors with special interest or technical expertise in certain components take the lead in supervising those
components leaving other donors to focus on other s- this division of labor makes it possible to avoid the
need for any donor to monitor every component in detail. For the first three years of PROAGRI, IDA
support will be primarily directed at institutional strengthening and capacity building with some support
to on-going activities in research, extension, and land management and some support to the design of the
innovative evolution of these programs, initially through piloting. Further, IDA support will take the form
of an APL under which flexibility permits the financing of plans which evolve and are further developed
over the life of the program rather than requiring a rigid set of blueprints to be fully in place at the time of
effectiveness.
Fourth Lesson. The extremely fragmented nature of donor support prior to PROAGRI has taxed MAP's
implementation capacity beyond sustainable levels, resulting in poor project coordination,
implementation, and impact. Through PROAGRI, donor programs will be integrated into one coherent
planning process and one program. Implementation arrangements will be simplified through the
establishment of common financial, accounting and auditing procedures and the unified administration of
donor support. Experience with implementation of other ASIPs/ASPEPs highlights the challenges
involved in adopting common implementation procedures.
Fifth Lesson. Because objectives and constraints are not always identical among donors, and because
coordination is by nature difficult, donor collaboration can break down as implementation difficulties and
frustrations emerge. To avoid this, a great deal of investment has been made to solidify the commitment
of donors to work together in their support to PROAGRI. A shared vision has been articulated in the form
of the basic principles, a systematic program of democratic interaction and dialogue among donors has
been put into place through the Donor Working Group, and Government has been encouraged increasingly
to take the lead in coordinating donors.
Sixth Lesson. Implementation experience with ongoing IDA operations in the sector shows that to
successfully deliver improved services, financial management and monitoring and evaluation systems
must be established at the provincial level. One of the key actions envisaged for the first year of
PROAGRI is rationalization of donor support and a capacity-building effort at the provincial level in work
planning, budgeting, accounting, and monitoring and evaluation.
Seventh Lesson. Donor-financed projects have often suffered from unavailability of counterpart funds.
Although, in many contexts the Govemment's cofinancing share may be low (5 to 10 percent of project
costs), there have often been difficulties with timely release of these funds. This inevitably leads to
implementation problems, delaying progress and jeopardizing the achievement of the project objectives.
Explicit provisions have been taken to avoid counterpart funding problems under PROAGRI. Care has
been taken to ensure that the planning process for PROAGRI incorporates all the relevant stakeholders,
including MPF, so that PROAGRI budgets and plans will reflect a consensus on national priorities.
PROAGRI's budget, prepared in collaboration with MPF, matches the investment ceiling for the sector
and counterpart funding availability. PROAGRI's implementation arrangements provide for six-monthly
discussions with donors of work plans and budgets. This provides an opportunity to respond to the results
of implementation and to adjust to shortfalls in Government revenues and allocations.



14
Eighth Lesson. Experience gained in the implementation of IDA's ongoing operations in the sector
suggests that successful integration of a project's administrative and implementation activities into the
routine functions of government departments and under the responsibility of regular line managers likely
requires the creation of a stable career development program that enhances accountability and provides
financial incentives for desirable perfonrnance. This is particularly relevant with regard to the challenges
of filling positions located in the field. MAF has initiated the first step towards salary reform in the forrm
of a proposal to MPF. This proposal may result in MAF's designation as a pilot Ministry in order that it
be allowed to implement the proposed reforms to the incentive system on a pilot basis. PROAGRI would
support such on-budget reforms to the incentive system .
Ninth Lesson. For donor involvement in a program such as PROAGRI to continue. it is essential that
Government fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities, and that funds: (i) only be spent on those activities which
have been sanctioned for support, (ii) be available in a timely fashion where needed, at central, provincial
or district level; and (iii) be accounted for in an accurate and timely fashion. Financial management
systems should be refined and strengthened as one of the initial steps, if implementation is to be
successful. To respond to this concem, a financial management study has been completed for PROAGRI
and a locally based company of management accountants will be contracted for two years to help
establish, run, and build MAP's capacitv in the recommended system.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
PROAGRI has been prepared by Government, and reflects its longstanding concerns with sector
management. In 1993, all UNDP projects were rationalised under MAP. MAP took the initiative in using
UNDP support to start preparation and capacity building for a sector wide agriculture progran. MAP
called this initiative the Pre-program for Agriculture. Initially, progress was slow as MAP focused on
emergency needs in the wake of war and severe drought and the period leading up to the country's first
multiparty elections in 1995 was not conducive to long-tern decision-making on the Ministry's future.
After elections in 1995, and under new leadership, MAP moved ahead with the preparation of PROAGRI.
An Executive Secretariat was created to coordinate the preparation of PROAGRI. This Secretariat was led
by the Vice-Minister of Agriculture and had 10 technical working groups. The Secretariat also coordinated
donors, holding regular meetings with representatives of the donor community. MAP's working groups,
with technical assistance support, prepared a strategy and an investment plan for each PROAGRI
component. In September,1996, a Sector Institutional Assessment was carried out. This exercise
effectively consolidated the process of institutional analysis and reform. In March, 1997, initial
PROAGRI proposals were reviewed in a Joint Donor Pre-Appraisal Event. At this event, donors
formulated a series of recommendations, stressing the limitations of institutional capacity and local
funding, and requesting further work on the identification of essential Government functions in the sector,
in restructuring program activities to address priority sectoral issues, and in addressing the issues of
decentralization, and financial management. MAP responded vigorously to these suggestions, carrying out
a functional review of each department, and a logical framework analysis for each component.
Participatory workshops were carried out with stakeholders, including NGOs and farners' associations, in
three representative provinces to discuss the PROAGRI approach, the role of the provinces, and the activities
to be carried out during the first year of implementation. A financial management study, a management information
study, and a human resource assessment of MAP were also undertaken in response to donor concerns.
Government prepared detailed proposals for each component for the period 1999 to 2003. This was a
massive undertaking - demonstrating commitment to the program approach on the part of Government
both at headquarters and the provinces. Donors reviewed the proposals during appraisal (May, 1998) and
accepted them as a basis for their support to PROAGRI. However, it is recognized that completion of the
functional analysis and the resulting reform of MAP in combination with the gradual adoption of common
implementation procedures for donors' support to PROAGRI will inevitably irequire adjustments and



15
changes to MAP's proposals for each component. The willingness to sustain and host the dialogue which
will surround this process is seen as another indication of Government commitment.
Throughout the process of program preparation, MAP has undertaken broad consultation within Government on
PROAGRI. The Program has been regularly discussed with the Ministry of Planning and Finance and has been
scaled so as to be consistent with investment ceilings for the sector and the counterpart funds requirements. A policy
seminar chaired by the Prime Minister was carried out with high-level intersectoral representatives to discuss the
coordination of policies and investments that have impact on agriculture but are not directly under the responsibility
of MAP. As a result of this systematic consultation and coordination, because of the careful preparation which has
gone into it, and because of the agriculture sector's importance to the Mozambican economy, PROAGRI is given
high priority by Government.
5. Value added of IDA support in this program
IDA has contributed to the establishment of a consensus among donors of the benefits of the program
approach, and in collaboration with other donors has provided MAP with mentoring and technical
assistance in the design of PROAGRI. IDA was also instrumental in convincing Government of the need
to adopt the necessary, institutional reforns. An IDA funded Sector Institutional Assessment (SIA) was
carried out in late 1996 which led to preparation of an Institutional Action Plan, and the preliminary
functional analysis of MAP. In addition, IDA has been actively engaged in the policy dialogue which has
yielded results in market liberalization and institutional reforms, and enabled a linkage between policy
concerns and program design. Lastly, through the funding of PROAGRI, IDA will work with Government
to ensure effective coordination of donors throughout implementation.
E. SUMMARY PROGRAM ANALYSIS
(Detailed assessments in program file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4)
The benefits of PROAGRI will result from better use of public expenditure in carrying out the
Government's agricultural and natural resource development strategy. By bringing public expenditure
under unified management, PROAGRI will: (i) reduce the confusion, the duplication of effort, and the
bureaucracy which results from the current situation in which MAP is implementing 42 separate donor-
supported projects; (ii) induce greater coherence across subsectors and districts and provinces in MAP's
programs; (iii) ensure that the sectoral budget responds to policy priorities and reflects the best use of
public funds in attaining sectoral development objectives, and (iv) enable the donors to develop a single
consistent position, and to speak with one voice when negotiating budgetary support with the
Government. The returns to these improvements are difficult to quantify, but they are large enough to
warrant the effort taken by Government and donors, during the PROAGRI preparation process, to bring
the expenditure program under control.
The process of rationalizing Government involvement in the agriculture and natural resources sectors is
underway. Large numbers of agriculture and related parastatals have been dismantled, and removed from
MAP's budget. Large, integrated regional development projects where MAP was managing road
construction, health and school rehabilitation, have been restructured to focus on the delivery of
agriculture services. MAP has initiated a process of reviewing the functions of every department, and
assessing whether the activities carried out are legitimate public sector activities which address some type
of market failure, or address issues of poverty reduction. Where appropriate, these activities will be
eliminated, or transferred to the private sector. The returns to the reduction of inappropriate Government
intervention in markets and service provision will be high, if the private sector responds rapidly to fill the
void. This has been happening following the process of adjustment in Mozambique. Rates of growth in



16
the agriculture and natural resource sector have been high (averaging 14% per annum, albeit from a low
base) since the end of civil war in 1992 and the drought in 1992/93.
The greatest emphasis in PROAGRI's design, however, is on improving effectiveness in the delivery of
MAP's essential functions (identified during preliminaiy functional review). Continuation of the
functional analysis will determine the most appropriate form of service del.ivery: by Government or by
contractors in the private sector or rural communities. At this stage, conclusions differ by subsector and
directorate within MAP. The Forestry and Wildlife Directorate, for example, expect to hand over
management of large areas of land and forest for management bv communities or the private sector, once
the areas have been surveyed and demarcated, and the terms and conditions of a privatized management
regime specified. If the delivery mechanism is retained by Govemment, PROAGRI will help make the
service more efficient and responsive to client needs by decentralizing decision-making and management
to the provincial level and below; and through improved logistical support, administrative, financial, and
human resource management and development, and monitoring.
Returns to improved regulation and service delivery are estimated to be high, and worth the effort at
institutional redesign and reform. The without-PROAGRI scenario is assurned to be a gradually declining
public expenditure for the sector, as donors and the Ministry of Planning and Finance become disaffected
with results, and no change in the level of service effectiveness. The impact on agricultural GDP which
would be needed to generate an economic rate of return of 16 percent to PROAGRI would be an
incremental annual rate of growth in agriculture GDP of 0.76 percent per annum. Some aspects of service
delivery are amenable to quantitative assessment, and have been subjected to a preliminary economic and
financial analysis. The results indicate that returns would be satisfactory (see Annex 4).
2. Fiscal Impact
Govemment has committed itself to use its own funds to finance a minimum of ten percent of the overall
PROAGRI budget over the life of the first five-year phase of the program. It is expected that
Government's contribution would rise gradually over time with a medium term goal that Government
would eventually cover the full recurrent costs of the program (estimated at USS 15 million per annum -
about triple the level of the initial annual commitment by Government).
With IDA's support, Government is undertaking a Fiscal Management Review of its Medium Tenn
Budget framework and management system. The sector expenditure approach is complementary to this
effort. Sector expenditure programs will improve management of overall public expenditure, and make
medium term planning more realistic. PROAGRI has been designed within this context, and is intended to
respond to improvements in the budgetary system to be put in place by MPE
3. Technical
PROAGRI's technical basis is sound, having taken into account the lessons learned from the past ten
years of donors' support to the agricultural sector in Mozambique. To date there has been a major influx
of resources, with only minor impact on the ground (official donors' contributions to the country's
development have been equivalent to about 80 percent of GDP during the course of the 1990's).
PROAGRI's implementation strategy is based on the decentralization of allocation decisions and the
delegation of executing responsibility to local stakeholders (provinces and ultimately districts), while
strengthening the main operating systems of MAP -- financial management, management information
systems, and human resource management and emoluments.
To achieve PROAGRI's goals and outputs, a series of activities in institutional reform and
modernization will strengthen MAP's capacity to formulate, implement ancl monitor envisaged actions.



17
PROAGRI will address the resource and information management weaknesses within MAP through a
comprehensive human resource development program encompassing staff redeployment, retrenchment,
training and a performance-based incentive system. The institutional reform process supported under
PROAGRI will make use of a variety of participatory tools (workshops, study tours, client consultation,
client satisfaction and attitude surveys, etc.) to build consensus, commitment and ownership. The
improvement of service delivery will follow from the definition of essential functions which MAP should
be responsible for. Decisions will then be taken on whether delivery is given to the public or private
sector. Operating methods will be tested to maximize efficiency and impact of Government resource use,
where possible linking in to activities carried out already by the private sector. This is of particular
importance in research, extension, and livestock service delivery. The sustainability of services will be
enhanced through measures of cost recovery and, in some cases, privatization. The strengthening of the
linkages between farmers/researchers/extensionists will be fostered using a farming-systems approach and
participatory diagnostic methods for problem identification, planning and service delivery. A farming
system pilot program is being funded under an ongoing IDA project, and the results of this pilot will be
incorporated into PROAGRl's support for agricultural services
4. Institutional
To address MAP's weak implementation capacity, PROAGRI will be developed gradually, focusing the
first three years on building capacity, developing mechanisms and standard procedures for
decentralization and investing in priority ongoing activities. High priority will be given to developing and
strengthening the managerial and implementation capacity at provincial and district levels. PROAGRI
will be implemented by the directors and the management teams of the individual technical directorates
(center and provinces). These constitute the line structure of MAP and no new parallel implementing units
will be established. Existing project management units will be phased out as common implementation
mechanisms are established. Overall coordination and, in particular, management of the institutional
modemization process will be the responsibility of a Task Force comprising the national directors with the
Directorate of Economics (DE) acting as Secretariat. MAP's Department of Administration and Finance
(DAF) has been given responsibility for ensuring the establishment and operation of common financial
management, procurement, and reporting procedures for PROAGRI, which are acceptable to IDA and
other donors. An independent company will be contracted for the first two years of the program to
strengthen DAF's capacity and to establish and manage the unified financial management and
procurement system at central level. Establishment and operation of the unified system will be overseen
by a representative Financial Management Committee (including MPF). Donors will also provide
technical assistance to establish subsidiary financial management capacity at the provincial level. Pending
development of the common systems, IDA funds will be managed by the ongoing IDA-funded
Agricultural Services Rehabilitation and Development Project (PRDSA) unit. As conditions of
effectiveness, the PRDSA unit would be strengthened by the appointment of an additional accountant and
a procurement officer, and upon the appointment of a national director for DAF, the unit would be
transferred from the DE to DAF.
5. Social
PROAGRI will contribute to broad-based development and poverty alleviation by supporting agricultural
growth through improvement in the quality of service delivery, provision of mechanisms for the
sustainable use of natural resources, and through ensuring security of tenure for smallholders. PROAGRI
will facilitate the evolution of the smallholder agricultural sector from its subsistence orientation toward
one of more active and successful engagement in agricultural markets. Given the (regionally-specific)
gender divisions of responsibilities and tasks in Mozambican agricultural production, these developments
are likely to affect rural men and women differently. A gender review has been carried out for each of



18
PROAGRI's components and recommendations for addressing gender issues under each component have
been incorporated into design and implementation plans. Further, a section of the Basic Principles is
dedicated explicitly to gender-related issues. Specific recommendations made under the institutional
development component include: (i) creation of a pemmanent MAP gender unit (to be located in the
Directorate of Economics) with sufficient capacity and resources to provide gender training to MAP staff
and to be effective in mainstreaming gender in the planning process; (ii) inclusion of at least two persons
from the MAP gender network into the Institutional Reform Group monitoring the ongoing process of
institutional reform of MAP; (iii) a survey of MAP staff to guide preparation of gender specific training;
(iv) creation of conditions for facilitating women's access to basic agricultural training; and (v) design of
gender-sensitive staff policies for recruitment and in-service training.
Another set of important social issues addressed through PROAGRI has to do with the regulatory
framework being established to govem implementation of the Land Law and the evolution of forestry
exploitation. It is of fundamental importance that the new regulations be designed so as to ensure that
communal rights to land are enforced in the process of land distribution (concessions) and adjudication.
Pilot programs of community participation in forestry exploitation and management of parks and wildlife
reserves are being developed and should provide the framework for PROAGRI's interventions in these
areas.
6. Environment Assessment:
Environmental Category       I I A   [XI B   [j C
An initial environmental assessment for PROAGRI has been completed (see Annex 12). Numerous
potential environmental impacts have been identified - both positive and negative. Potentially positive
environmental impacts include reduced rural poverty, by improving farming families' production,
productivity, incomes, food security, nutrition, and resilience to drought and flooding, as well as growth in
rural employment opportunities, decreased migration to urban centres, improved stability and
sustainability of farming systems through PROAGRI's emphasis on better land husbandry and the
increased integration of livestock. The Natural Resources Management subprogram in particular should
lead to conservation of endangered ecosystems and biological diversity; an increase in wildlife
populations; an increase in the stock of woody biomass; protection of watersheds and reduction of
erosion; a greater store of carbon in biomass and soils; improved surveillance and monitoring of natural
resource use; strengthened communal rights to resources; guidance of agricultural expansion into those
areas where cropping will be sustainable; and, more sustainable irrigation development.
Potentially negative environmental impacts include localized land degradation, increased risk of forest
fires, reduced biodiversity, increased conflict over land and water due to expansion of cropping, livestock
husbandry, forestry, and ecotourism, reduced water flows and water tables down stream of irrigation
schemes, increased pollution and salination of soils and watercourses, and pesticide induced health problems.
The environmental assessment identified constraints to environmental management, measures to mitigate potentially
adverse environmental impact, and measures to optimise potentially positive impacts. To ensure integration and
follow-up of these environmental actions in work plans and budgets, PROAGRI will support: establishment of an
environmental planning capacity in the Directorate of Economics at national and provincial level; appointment of an
environmental monitoring committee chaired by MAP with representatives from PROAGRI-related ministries,
donors, and independent environmental organizations; conduct of detailed environmental impact assessments for
irrigation and livestock development, use of agrochemicals, and exploitation of foresit and wildlife resources;
preparation of an environmental management implementation and monitoring plan for PROAGRI; preparation of
simple brochures and organisation of workshops at all levels to increase awareness of environmental issues; and
short courses for key staff in the principles of good environmental management. A second phase of the
Environmental Assessment will be carried out during 1999 to further develop these plans for establishing capacity to
deal with environmental issues related to MAP's activities and responsibilities (see Annex 12).

F: SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
. Sustainability
Sustainability will depend on PROAGRI's success. There are three important features that auger well for
PROAGRI's success: i) Govemment ownership is assured as PROAGRI was designed by Mozambicans
and will be using existing institutions for implementation; (ii) Donors' commitment to the program
approach is high, as they have participated in PROAGRI's preparation and started discussions with
Govemment on their funding of the operation; and (iii) PROAGRI has been reviewed and approved by the
Ministry of Planning and Finance thereby ensuring the likelihood of adequate Govemment funding. The
financial sustainability of PROAGRI is contingent on five main conditions: (i) the continuation and
deepening of Govemment's economic reform program, particularly in the agricultural and financial
sectors; (ii) donor collaboration and commitment to support PROAGRI over a 15-20 year period; (iii) the
timely and sufficient provision of counterpart funds; (iv) a substantial improvement in the managerial
capacity of MAP and the implementing agencies at the provincial level; and (v) the preparation by
Govemment of a human resource development program including incentives and special pay grades.
2. Critical Risks
Critical risks could include: inadequate funding of Government's share of local costs; failure by donors to
dovetail their projects into the PROAGRI framework; a derailment of the macroeconomic reform
program; and failure to obtain an incentive program for human resources. The probability of these events
occuring is not high, given the high level of donor and Govemment participation in the design of
PROAGRI, and strong Government commitment, with IDA and IMF backing, to its reform agenda.
Several donors have already responded to MAP's request to carry out a complete review of their portfolio
in the sector with the objective of ensuring consistency with PROAGRI's strategy and expenditure
priorities. In addition, Government and donors are collaborating actively on the design of an appropriate
staff incentive system for MAP. The prospects for achieving PROAGRI's objectives, therefore, are good.

sustainability.                       and indirectly through the expansion of agricultural production and markets. In
the short term, Government has committed itself to finance a minimum of ten
percent of the program cost. It is expected that the actual percentage will be
higher.
Insufficient financial   Low to       Donors' funding of PROAGRI is not likely to be an issue. Ongoing
support from donors could  moderate    undisbursed cormmitments represent 50% of PROAGRI's total costs. Together,

donors' support will be contingent upon performance and Government's
adherence to the basic principles in its implementation of PROAGRI. Donors'
investmnent of time and resources into donor coordination will be an important
element in maintaining donors' financial commitment.
Political pressures force    Moderate    A number of important steps have been taken to liberalize the sector and to
delay of the economic                 ensure conditions for sustainable development (e.g. passage of the new Land
liberalization process.               Law). Through its focus on institutional development and through adherence
to the Basic Principles, PROAGRI support for policy formulation will ensure
that these steps are rooted and irreversible. The IDA also has other instruments
to stay engaged in the dialogue on policy andl institutional change.
Institutional development  Moderate   Donors have agreed with Government on a set of basic principles and
steps key to modernization            milestones related to MAP's modernization which will condition the annual

3. Possible controversial aspects
Some activities, such as credit, which are being contemplated by MAP for its various development funds
are inconsistent with PROAGRI's Basic Principles. MAP and donors have agreed to conduct a study to
examine the degree to which activities financed by MAP's development funds conform to PROAGRI's
Basic Principles and core public sector responsibilities.
An important issue discussed throughout the preparation of PROAGRI is the need for regulations to
guarantee access to and security of land rights for smallholder farmers. A regulatory framework for the
new Land Law was drafted by the Technical Secretariat to the Intenninisterial Land Commission, which,
inter alia, safeguards the interests of communities against the allocation of concessions including those
requests initiated but not completed under the former legal framework. Tre Council of Ministers formally
approved these regulations in December, 1998, providing necessary safeguards for the effective
enforcement of the Law.
G. MAIN CREDIT CONDITIONS
1. Basic principles and milestones
Government and donors have agreed to commit funds to a program of public expenditure for the
agricultural sector (PROAGRI) on the basis of mutually agreed program objectives and Basic Principles.
These Basic Principles will guide the institutional reform of MAP as well as the nature of its support to
the agricultural sector (see Annex 11, Attachment 2). Against each Basic Principle, Government and
donors have also agreed Milestones to make it possible for the path towards achievement of results and the
development objective to be charted and monitored. The Basic Principles and Milestones would be
reviewed annually by Government and donors and would be modified and updated as deemed appropriate
by mutual agreement between Government and donors. Consistency between MAP's programs and
activities and the Basic Principles, and MAP's progress toward achieving the agreed upon Milestones
through the implementation of the PROAGRI program would be the basis for joint Govemment and donor
reviews and approval of each annual work plan and budget.

Annex 2: Program Description
Mozambique: Agricultural Sector Public Expenditure Program (PROAGRI)
The purpose of PROAGRI is to improve the impact of public expenditure in securing an enabling
environment for sustainable and equitable growth in the rural sector such that poverty is reduced and food
security improved, while the physical and social environment is protected. PROAGRI includes all the
public expenditure managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP), excluding the fisheries
subsector.
The objective of the first five-yearphase of PROAGRI is to put in place improved institutional
arrangements for the financing and delivery of agricultural services for smallholders, and the capacity to
cost-effectively provide for the essential public and merit good functions of MAP. Subsequent phases will
continue financing MAP's essential functions, with Government gradually assuming full responsibility for
the recurrent costs over the course of a fifteen to twenty-year period.
PROAGRI comprises eight thematic components congruent with MAP's functional divisions that can be
clustered into three subprograms: (i) institutional development; (ii) agricultural support services; and (iii)
natural resource management. The broad thrust of each subprogram over the period 1999 to 2003 is
presented below. Detailed strategies and investment plans have been prepared by Government for each
component and are available in the Program files.
Donors have anchored their commitment to PROAGRI against a set of overarching and component
specific Basic Principles and Milestones (see Annex 11 - attachment 2). MAP's success in implementing
these Basic Principles will be the basis for joint Government and donor annual reviews and approval of
work plans and budgets.
Initially, IDA will contribute to financing of the Institutional Development, Research, Extension, and
Land components. Other donors will support differing combinations of components. Beginning in the
fourth year of implementation, in addition to the four components listed above, IDA may finance some or
all of the remaining components.
Institutional Development Subprogram (total cost US$ 62.3 million)
Objective. To improve public administration of the agricultural sector, transforming MAP into a modern
institution focused upon policy formulation and implementation, regulation, and the creation of a sectoral
environment which nurtures development of the private sector.
This subprogram component supports: (a) an ongoing review of the institutional structure of MAP and the
roles and responsibilities assigned to the central, provincial and district levels in a market-based
framework for sector development; (b) development of human resources, comprising right-sizing of the
workforce, proper deployment of staff and establishment of retrenchment and career development
programs to bridge the skills-gap of MAP, and to effect adoption of an on-budget staff incentive system
consistent with the overall civil service reform; (c) improvement of MAP's capacity at central and
provincial level in financial management, budgeting, planning, and environmental assessment; (d)
development of the information system comprising the set up of a network for data collection and
development of M&E and sector performance indicators; and (e) establishment of a policy analysis and
formulation capacity within the Directorate of Economics, and advocacy and implementation of policies

PROAGRI Benefits
The benefits of PROAGRI will result from making better use of public expenditure to enable the sector to
progress towards the goals of the Govemment's agricultural and natural resources development strategy.
PROAGRI seeks to improve the development impact of the public expenditure program for agriculture
and natural resources by: (i) bringing all development expenditure on agriculture and natural resources
under unified management, ensuring that public expenditure responds to policy priorities; (ii) rationalizing
the role of Government in the agriculture and natural resources sector, defining 'core' functions which
entail intervening to correct market failures, influencing growth to ensure poverty alleviation, or providing
essential public goods; and (iii) improving the effectiveness of Govemment in carrying out these 'core
functions'.
By bringing public expenditure under unified management, PROAGRI will: (i) reduce the duplication of
management talent, physical and financial monitoring systems which exists with the 42 separate projects
under implementation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP); (ii) induce more learning and
information transfer within and across subsectors, reducing artificial barriers created by administrative
reporting needs and differentiated funding sources; (iii) ensure that the allocation of resources in the
sectoral budget as a whole, as well at the provinces, teflects the best use of public funds in attaining
sectoral development objectives, and (iv) enable the donors to develop a single consistent position, and to
speak with one voice when negotiating budgetary support with the Govemment. The budget for public
expenditure on agriculture and natural resources for 1997 totalled US$ 48 million, of which US$ 43
million was provided by donors -- much of it provided in individual project form. The retums to these
improvements in management are difficult to quantify -- but they are sufficiently large to warrant the
effort taken by Government and donors, during the PROAGRI preparation process, of bringing the
expenditure program under control.
The process of rationalization of Government is already underway. Large numbers of agriculture and
related parastatals have been dismantled, and removed from MAP's budget. Large, integrated regional
development projects where MAP was managing road construction, health and school rehabilitation, have
been restructured to focus on the delivery of agriculture services. The Ministry has initiated a process of



32
reviewing the functions of every department, and assessing whether the activities carried out are legitimate
public sector activities (which address some type of market failure, or address issues of poverty reduction.
Where appropriate these activities will be eliminated, or transferred to the private sector. The returns to the
reduction of inappropriate Govemmental intervention in markets and service provision will be high, if the
private sector responds rapidly to fill the void, and to move into areas hitherto occupied by public
agencies, or regulated out of existence. This has been happening following the process of adjustment in
Mozambique. Rates of growth in the agriculture and natural resource management sector have been high
(averaging 14% per annum) since the end of the civil war in 1992 and the drought in 1992/93.
By far the greatest emphasis in PROAGRI design, however, has been to improve effectiveness in the
delivery of the 'core' Government functions (determined following the functional review). This aspect
of PROAGRI has three features: (i) the determination of the most appropriate form of service delivery:
whether by Govemment itself, or by outside contractors in the private sector or rural communities; (ii) if
the delivery mechanism is retained by Govemment, then how to make the delivery of the service efficient
and responsive to client needs -- this has led to the decision to decentralize decision making and program
management to the provincial level, and below, as much as possible over the course of the implementation
period; and (iii) in those cases where service delivery remains with Govennment, it then becomes essential
to design measures which will improve the effectiveness of the Govemment's administrative apparatus.
Here, PROAGRI relies on a "three part" approach, with assessments and work being developed to
improve: (a) financial management and administrative control systems; (b) physical monitoring of
PROAGRI execution, and logistical and procurement management systems, and (c) human resource
management, career development and performance-based incentive systems.
During the design stage there has been an effort to assess the most appropriate form of Government
intervention, and to develop a position on whether to have Government produce the service itself, or to
contract it out to third parties. This assessment is still underway, and concliusions differ by subsector and
department within the Ministry. The Forestry and Wildlife department, for example, expect to hand over
management of large areas of land and forest for management by communities, or the private sector, once
the areas have been surveyed and demarcated, and the terms and conditions of a privatized management
regime specified. In addition, during the first two years of PROAGRI, improved financial, administrative
and logistical systems will be put in place, the human resource management function strengthened, and
performance based incentive packages negotiated and tested.
The returns to improved regulation and service delivery are estimated to be high, and worth the effort at
institutional redesign and reform. The counterfactual for PROAGRI is assumed to be a gradually declining
public expenditure program for the sector, as donors and the Ministry of Planning and Finance become
disaffected with results, and no change in the level of service effectiveness. A broad assessment of the
increased cost of PROAGRI (against the counterfactual), matching it to the changes in agricultural GDP
which would be needed to justify the increased expenditure, indicate that it would take an incremental
annual rate of growth in agriculture GDP of only 0.76 percent per annum to provide an economic rate of
return of 16 percent on incremental expenditure. Some aspects of service delivery are amenable to
quantitative assessment, and have been subjected to a preliminary economic and financial analysis. The
results indicate that returns would be satisfactory.
Quantitative Analysis
In attempting a quantitative assessment of PROAGRI, an exercise has been carried out to assess the
minimum change needed in the growth rate in agricultural (and natural resource) GDP necessary to justify
the proposed public expenditures on the PROAGRI. It has been shown that the proposed PROAGRI
expenditures are justified, and would generate an economic rate of return of about 16 percent, if the
PROAGRI were to induce an increase in the growth rate of agricultural GDP of 0.76 percent (i.e. less than
I percent per annum impact.

While this level of incremental growth appears eminently feasible, a second exercise was carried out, to
assess the returns to certain components where such a calculation is possible. Using the assumptions noted
below in working through the potential production benefits attributable to PROAGRI, it is shown that the
production increases necessary to generate the above mentioned rate of return are eminently feasible from
the institutional investments to be made under PROAGRI. The benefits from the economic activities
noted above included the returns (net of on and off farm costs) to improved yields from seven major crops
(maize, sorghum, rice, millet, beans/cowpeas, groundnuts and cassava) as well as the returns to improved
husbandry from the traditional and commercial livestock producers (beef, pigs, small ruminants and
chickens). From the forestry and wildlife sector, benefits include the retums to increased timber
production, fuelwood production and tourism revenue from improved wildlife management.
The off farm incremental costs of PROAGRI included the cost of operating the research, extension and
regulatory services for agriculture, as well as the costs of both the Governmental regulatory framework for
forestry and wildlife management, and the private sector investments needed to exploit these resources.
Some of the key parameters which underlie the estimates include the assessment that over a 10 year
period, some 12 percent of smallholder farmers are likely to adopt improved crop production technologies
produced and promoted under PROAGRI. In addition, some 17 percent of livestock producers, including
both traditional and commercial farmers, are likely to have shifted to improved husbandry and nutrition
techniques. The returns to improved management of natural resources are calculated as the net incremental
returns to the various stakeholders (communities, concession holders, Government) from improved
management of national wildlife parks, game reserves, coastal parks and hunting areas, as well as the
improved productivity of forestry concessions, as well as sustainable management of fuelwood production
and wildlife and coastal resources. The main outputs are tourist revenue (various types of fees), timber
production and fuelwood production. Finally, investments in smallholder irrigation are evaluated, under
which a target of 2500 ha would be rehabilitated for use by some 4,000 smallholder households.

Financial Assessment of Improvements in Service Delivery
A financial analysis was carried out for the various components, based on three types of retums: (i) to crop
production, (ii) to livestock production; (ii) to forestry and wildlife, and (iii) to irrigation investment. For
crop and livestock production, the net on farm retums from improved crop productivity were set against
the incremental costs of the Government extension service, research service and regulatory functions. The
financial rate of return on crop production activities was about 29 percent, and for livestock activities,
about 27 percent. The economic rates of return were similar. The financial return to forestry and wildlife
activities are estimated at about 68 percent, indicating a fairly high retum, to all stakeholders, from this
sector. The irrigation rehabilitation activities had much lower retums, with an estimated financial return to
the Government's investment of 17 percent
Public Expenditure on Agriculture and Natural ]Resources
Govemment expenditure in Mozambique represented some 29 percent of GDP, about US$ 770 million in
1997. Of this, 47 percent was recurrent, and some 53 percent capital. Donors financed 45 percent of the
budget, with funds directed mainly at capital expenditure. Public expenditlre through the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries constitutes some 6-7 percent of total Govemment expenditure. However, the
situation in agriculture I is even more unbalanced. In 1997, total expenditure on agriculture was about US$
48 million, of which only US$ 5 million had been contributed by the Government. It should be noted that,
in agriculture, Govemment is contributing a significantly lower share than its share of total expenditure:
10 percent in agriculture, versus 49 percent overall. Within the agriculture budget, some US$ 27 million
had been designated as capital expenditure, with the remaining US$ 21 million recurrent. Thus, donors
were contributing 100 percent of the capital budget, and some 76 percent of recurrent expenditure. To
date, donor coordination has not been exceptionally good, and MAP is horne to a plethora of projects,
negotiated bilaterally with different donors, managed independently and in fragmented fashion by various
departments and agencies, which do not necessarily focus on those areas most appropriate for Govemment
intervention in support of agricultural growth. The negative effect of this hiaphazard implementation of
donor funded projects is large, due not only to conflicts and potential duplication in the implementation of
existing projects, but also in terms of the alternate, high impact uses to which such scarce resources could
be put.

Fiscal Impact
PROAGRI is designed to continue and gradually increase Govemment's contribution in support of the
agriculture sector. The current 10 percent contribution would be respected, and the value of the
Government's financial support for the sector would set the ceiling for donor funding. Thus, at current
Government contribution of US 5 million a year, donors would restrict their contribution to the sectoral
expenditure program to US$ 45 million per annum. It is expected that Govemment will gradually increase
its contribution to sectoral public expenditure due to: (i) the increase in Govemment tax receipts from the
agricultural sector, with growth in output and (ii) with the improvement in Government's ability to
monitor and tax such increases in output. Of particular import are the increased receipts expected from the
Forestry sector, land related fees, and Wildlife. A reasonably large share of these incremental receipts
(estimated at US$ 52 million a year by 2008) is assumed to return to fund the agriculture and natural
resource sector; and (iii) the improved effectiveness of MAP's policy analysis and advocacy function,
enabling it to 'sell' MAP to the Ministry of Planning and Finance as an effective development tool. The
objective of donor involvement, and the level of donor financial participation will be designed to have
Government gradually increase its contribution so as to eventually cover the full recurrent costs of
PROAGRI (estimated at some US$ 15 million per annum -- three times the Government contribution).
While far from achievable at present, it does not represent an insurmountable goal in an economy growing
at 6-7 percent per annum. It is likely that a 15 to 20 year period of program type assistance and support
will be necessary before full sustainability from local resources can be achieved, with Govemment
covering the full recurrent costs of PROAGRI.
It is important to note that the IDA is working with Government on a Fiscal Management Review of its
Medium Term Budget framework and management system. The sector expenditure approach is entirely
complementary to this effort. Sector expenditure programs (and PROAGRI in particular) will improve
management of the public expenditure program, and make medium term planning more realistic. By
putting in place effectively managed sector expenditure programs in agriculture, education, health,



36
transport, and water resource development, the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF) will be in a
position to delegate resource management within the sector to the sector program machinery, reducing its
concerns to those of the more strategic resource allocation decisions, as well as to revenue raising.
PROAGRI has been designed within this context, and is designed to respond to the improvements in the
budgetary system to be put in place by MPF.                                                         I

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arraingements
Mozambique: Agricultural Sector Public Expenditure Program (PROAGRI)
Procurement
1.    Institutional Set-up. The smooth operation of procurement procedures is vital for effective
implementation of PROAGRI. It is also essential for the contemplated decentralization of MAP's
activities. Government will contract an independent company for the first two years of the program, to
establish and implement the proposed financial management and procurement system, including the
training of MAP staff. Pending development of the unified system to be administered through MAP's
DAF, procurement activities related to use of ongoing and new IDA funds (i.e. the PRDSA and the new
Credit) will be managed by the existing IDA-funded Agricultural Services Rehabilitation and
Development Project (PRDSA) management unit. In order that the project unit is capable to take on the
additional responsibility of the management of the new IDA funds (to become available under this
Credit), the PRDSA unit will be strengthened by a procurement officer. Once MAP's management
capacity has been sufficiently strengthened, to the satisfaction of IDA, administration of both projects
would be gradually transferred to MAP's DAF. In the meanwhile, at least three staff of MAP
Headquarters will undertake advanced procurement and management training at a seminar to be held in
Maputo in March, 1999. The MAP headquarters will carry out all intematicinal procurement (International
Competitive Bidding -ICB- and Limited International Bidding-LIB) for PROAGRI and carry out the
selection of consulting services on behalf of the provinces. It will also be responsible for the coordination
of all procurement activities at provincial level, and will assist the provinces by providing standard bid
documents, construction designs and specifications. Over time, capacity will be strengthened at MAP's
provincial offices so that procurement where non-ICB procedures are acceptable can be carried out at that
level. It is expected that some provinces would begin to carry out procurement functions by January, 2000.
2.    Donor Harmonization. Donors have agreed to harmonize procurement procedures to the extent
possible. Discussions as to how to accomplish this are underway - at present a draft document setting out
the parameters under which harmonization could take place (Donor's Harmonization Reportfor GEDEP
and PROAGRI in Mozambique, prepared by IDA) is being circulated for comment and discussion. It is
expected that some of the donors will agree on: common thresholds for procurement under NCB; the use
of common post-review and reporting for-mats; common standard bidding documents and procedures for
advertising, evaluating, and awarding contracts.
3.    Procurement of Works. Civil works include construction and renovation of buildings and
infrastructure (see Annex 2). The total cost of civil works for the program is estimated at about US$24
million of which IDA will finance US$2.00 million. While the size and location of works to be financed
by IDA are such that the use of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be limited, ICB will be used
for any contract packages of a value of more than US$500,000 equivalent. National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) will be used for works below the individual contract threshold of $500,000 equivalent (for up to an
aggregate US$400,000). NCB however may not be the most suitable method of procurement for some
very small works in rural areas where contract size is under US$50,000 equivalent. In such cases, simpler
methods of procurement may be used under Community Participation guidelines. Under such
arrangements, communities may supply labor and purchase construction materials such as cement,
aggregates and fixtures. For other small works, lump sum fixed-price contracts may be awarded on the
basis of quotations obtained from three qualified national contractors.
4.    Goods. The total cost of goods for the program is estimated at about. US$58.65 million of which
IDA will finance US$9.00 million. Goods to be procured include vehicles, equipment, and inputs (see
Annex 2). Procurement of goods will be consolidated into procurement packages as large as possible to



39
minimise administrative procedures and to provide cost benefits through bulk purchasing. Vehicles,
equipment and other products not available locally will be packaged in large contracts and purchased
using ICB. Goods estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent may be procured using NCB
procedures. Goods costing less than US$20,000 equivalent (up to an aggregate of US$250,000 equivalent)
may be procured using Shopping Procedures satisfactory to IDA.
5.     Services. The total cost of services under PROAGRI, including training and technical assistance,
is estimated at US$60 million of which IDA will finance about US$12 million. Training will include both
local and foreign degree programs, in-service training, seminars, workshops and study tours. Technical
assistance will use both long and short term local and foreign consultants, pilot projects, contracted
research and studies. Selection of consulting services and training will follow the procedures described in
IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (January, 1997 edition). Quality and Cost-Based Selection
(QCBS) will be used for most contracts, though selection by fixed budget may be used for periodically
repeated services such as for auditing and administrative tasks for which precise cost estimates are
available. Selection by "Qualifications" may be used on exceptional basis for small assignments.
Individual consultants will be recruited under the procedures specified in Section V of the IDA Guidelines
for the use of Consultants, on the basis of their qualifications through comparison with other candidates.
6.    Prior Review. All contracts of works under ICB and all NCB contracts above the individual
contract threshold of $200,000 will be subject to prior review by IDA. In addition, all NCB contracts for
works of any value carried out by each province will be subject to prior review by IDA until such time as
IDA is satisfied that adequate administrative capacity has been established in said province. Similarly,
contracts for goods procured under ICB and any NCB contract above the threshold of $100,000 will be
subject to IDA prior review. In addition, all NCB contracts for goods of any value carried out by each
province will be subject to prior review by IDA until such time as IDA is satisfied that adequate
administrative capacity has been established in said province. Contracts below the thresholds for prior
review will be subject to post-review following the procedures described in IDA Procurement Guidelines
(in Appendix I, section 4 of that document). Consulting services above the threshold of $100,000,
individual consultants contracts above $50,000 and all TORs will be subject to IDA prior review, as
described in Appendix 1, section 2 of IDA's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants.
7.    Procurement Plan. Prior to Board presentation, a procurement plan for all ICB to be undertaken
under PROAGRI should be presented to IDA. Prior to credit effectiveness, standard bidding documents to
be used by Provinces for NCB contracts, and an overall procurement plan for 1999 for each of the
Provinces, will be presented to IDA. A sample procurement schedule for ICB procurement of goods is
attached below.
Disbursement
8.    Table C shows the allocations of the proceeds of the credit. The proceeds of the IDA credit of
US$30.0 million will be disbursed over the first five-year tranche of the program from 1999 through 2003.
A period of six months will be allowed after the closing date to request disbursements for expenditures
incurred prior to the closing date. The annual estimated disbursements are indicated in a table on the first
page of this Program Appraisal Document.
9.    Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements for all expenditures will be against full
documentation except for items of expenditures under contracts and purchase orders for (a) civil works
contracts costing less than the equivalent of US$500,000, (b) goods contracts costing less than the
equivalent of US$100,000, (c) technical assistance contracts with firms costing less than the equivalent of
US$ 100,000 and technical assistance contracts with individuals costing less than the equivalent of
US$50,000, and all force account works, recurrent operational costs, and training. Expenditures not
requiring full documentation as a disbursement condition will be supported by Statement of Expenditures
(SOEs) with supporting documentation maintained by the Borrower and made available for periodic
review by IDA and/or its authorized representative.



40
10.   Special Account. To facilitate disbursements of eligible expenditures for, goods, and services, the
Government will open a Special Account in a commercial bank under terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA, to cover part of IDA's share of eligible expenditures. The authorized allocation of the Special
Account would be US$1 Million covering an estimated four months of eligible expenditures to be
financed by IDA. Upon credit effectiveness, a sum of US$500,000 will be deposited by IDA into this
account. Further deposits by IDA into this account may be requested as needed. DAF will be responsible
for submitting monthly replenishment applications with appropriate supporting documents for
expenditures. To the exten possible, all of IDA's share of expenditures should be paid through the Special
Account.
11.   Audit. The program accounts, SOEs and the Special Account will be audited each year by an
independent auditing firm under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. In addition to the annual
financial statements conforming to International Standards on Auditing (IFAC Standards), the audit report
will include comments on the accuracy and propriety of expenditures withdrawn under SOE procedures
and the extent to which these can be relied upon as a basis for credit disbursements. Joint audit reports will
be submitted to IDA and other donors no later than six months following the end of the Borrower's fiscal
year.
12.   Accounting and Financial Management. Subject to recommendations made as a result of the
Financial Management Study financed by the EC, financial management and accounting of the PROAGRI
program will, for eighteen months following credit effectiveness, follow th,e present system used by the
IDA financed Agricultural Services Rehabilitation and Development Project in the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP). Accounting and Financial Management will be reviewed by IDA and
donors during program supervision missions. Gradual modifications will be made over time with a view
toward improving the efficiency and transparency of MAP's accounting and financial management.

Table E. Allocation of Credit Proceeds
For the first three years of PROAGRI (until January 1, 2002), Credit proceeds would be available for
disbursements against expenditures incurred under the following four components: Institutional
Development; Agricultural Research; Agricultural Extension; and Land Management. Beginning on
January 1, 2002, while Credit proceeds would continue to be available for disbursement against
expenditures incurred under the Institutional Development, Agricultural Research, Agricultural Extension,
and Land Management components, on that date Credit proceeds would also be available for disbursement
against expenditures incurred under the Irrigation, Livestock Support Services, Forestry and Wildlife
Management, and Support for Crop Production. Disbursements against any component would be subject
to the authorization of IDA based upon its judgement as to the extent to which they are being
implemented in a manner consistent with PROAGRI's basic principles and with progress toward
achieving the agreed milestones.
Allocation of Credit Proceeds
Expenditure Category           Amount in SDR Equivalent           Financing Percentage
(I) Civil Works:               Up to SDR 150,000 in the            100% of foreign exchange
aggregate for the approved annual  costs and 95% of local
plan for CY 1999 and thereafter such  expenditures (or such other
amount as may be allocated for each  percentage as may be

Dear Mr Wolfensohn,
Re; MOZAMBIQUE'S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR POLICY AND STRATEGIES
Mozambique is endowed with abundant natural resources and, with a predominantly rural
population , the potential for agricultural growth Is huge. However, despite employing over
70 percent of the labour force, agriculture and natural resource based Industries currently
contribute only 32 percent to GDP - an indication of how low retums to labour are in rural
areas. Indeed, two thirds of the rural popultion live in absolute poverty. The Govemment
accords high priority, therefore, to the agriculture seoctor's role in promoting growth and
reducing poverty.
This letter highlights the agriculture sector's main constraints and the Government's
strategies to address them. This policy and strategy framework will guide the Governrnent's
support for the sector and, in partcular, the use of the public expenditure channelled
qwpwuh VMS Miniatry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP). Matrices attached to this leter
provide additional detail on ta 4"A*4 O 9qWtjIt   development policy In Mozambique,
key Issues to be addressed, and the actions that welt bo W   bW     M
government agencies to address thes concems (refer to attachments 1: Table 1&2 and
attachment 2 to this ler).

Background
The structure of Mozambican agriculture today reflects the legacy of the colonial era, the
adoption of a centrally planned economy after independence, including government control
of agricultural markets, and the widespread conflict of the 1980s and early 1990s, which
resulted in damage and destruction to much of the country's physical and marketing
infrastructure and also led to decimation of the livestock and wildlife populations.
Following the end of conflict and severe drought in 1992193, the sigriculture sector has
grown by an average of 14 percent per annum, albeit from a very low base, and in the last
two years, total production of food staples has exceeded the aggregate needs of the 16
million population. While this rapid growth partly reflects a recovery effect and good rains,
it is also due to a graduai liberalisation of macroeconomic and sectoral policies which was
initiated in 1 987. Exchange rates and Interest rates are now market deptermined. Inflation in
1997 was 6 percent and currently negligible or even slightly negative. Nearly all distortions
effecting the agricultural sector have been removed. Parastatals no longer control marketing
of produce or inputs. Prices oi most agricultural commodities art effectively market
determined. International trade in agricultural commnodities and inpouts is substantially
liberalized.
Notwithstanding recenT progress, the challenges ahead are Immense. Most farmers are
dacapiltilized as they have only recently returned from refugee or displaced status to
reoccupy their homesteads. Smaliholders use handtools and little or no extemal inputs,
except in cotton-based farming systems serviced by commerciall ginnerias. Despite
Mozambique's favourable agroscological conditions, crop yields are low compared to
neighbouring countries, and a high proportion of rural households remain food insecure for
prolonged periods. Development is constrained by difficulties In obtaining access to seeds,
tools, fertiliser, and pesticides, in financing labour and other inputs required to expand
output, and in selling produce advantageously after harvest. Only 40 percent of cultivable
land is used, but access probiems and inadequaTe support services constrain development
to areas where population density is high and overuse of natural resources and degradation
are issues. At the same time, the allocation of large land concessions threatens to
marginalize smaliholders. While market liberalization is virtually complete, private sector
engagemenT in inputs supply is limited so far, and the effectiveness of public services in
supporting agricultural development is low. Although the elimination of high inflation and
privatisation of retail banking have laid the basis for financial sector growth, improved
access to credit may not occur for smaliholders without some form of public support for
rural financisI inter-mediarion.
Strategies and Actions
The Government's objectives for agriculture, as articulated in its statement of Agricultural
Policy and Strategy for Implementation (1995), are to transform sub.sistence agriculture.
linking it ever more closely into production, marketing and processing, and increasing
marketed surpluses, while also developing an efficient commercial sector. To achieve these
objectives, the Government's strategy has six main elements:
(i) Continue to develop an enabling environment for marks.t-based agriuulturd
development, providing incentives for investment and growth. Government will
*upurt *pwelsmemnt of MAP's capacity in agricultural policy formulation,
monitoring, informatlon gathering and dlsimtnetlon, with a view to improving
competition and transparency in markets, and influencing the decislon of other
public agencies responsible for complementary interventions in the interests of
farmers.

(ii) Improve the road transport and communications Infrastructure. Access to input
and output markets Is fundamental determinant of rural  welfare  and  growth
prospects. This will be addressed primarily through the multi-donor supported
transport Infrastructure program and by strengthening MAP's capacity to assist the
National Directorate of Roads and Bridges In Identifying key roads for rehabilitation
so that smallholders have greater access to local and regional markets.
(iii} Redress the lack of appropriate technologies available for smaliholder farmers.
Government will improve the effectiveness of pubDlc support services for agriculture,
mainly crop, forestry, and ilivestock research and extension, small-scale irrigation
development, and market intelligence. Promotion of farmers' associations, and,
whers' advantageous, outsourcing of service delivery to the private sector and Non-
Governmental Organisations will be important step in this direction.
(iv) Regulate agricultural markets and natural resourGe use to establish the rules of
the game' and ensure that negative and positive externalities are internalized. A key
element of the strategy in this regard will be adoption of land tenure regulations, to
reinforce smaliholder security, and establish the incentives for sustainable
exploitation of soils, forests, rivers, coasts and   other natural resources. Also
important     are intellectual property rights and pantents for the Import and sale
of trademark genetic material and other technology; and restricting the use and
increasing the availability of information on agrochamicals with potentially harmful
health and environmental effects.
(v) Continuation of stable macroeconomic policy and mnasures to Institutionalize
.good govemance' throughout the public sector will reduce distortions and
inefficiencies while enabling prtvate sector-led growth. Prudent macroeconomic
mnanagement, civil service reform, and ongoing and planned rationalization of public
expenditure in agriculture, education, health, transport infrastruture, water resource
development, and the enforcement of sound environmental managemont practices
will have a synergistic effect in enhancing the potential for sustainable agricultural
development.
(vI) Establish a policy framework for micro/rural finance that will guide any public
support for formal and informal intermediation between the commercial banks and
the urban and rural poor. Difficulty In gaining accessing To credit remains an
important constraint for smallholders throughout the country. In order to address
this issue, a working group comprising Government, donor, private sector and civil
society representatives, has initiated a review of best practices and will begin the
formulation of a policy proposal in this area. Issues which will receive attention in
this review will include, among other things, the following: identification of
appropriate mechanisms to support the formulation of savings and credIt groups
among smaliholders and other rural people; Identification of the elements.of a legal
framework which would be required to underpin the development of rural financial
markets; and, identification of non-dlstortlonary measures to support the
development of private sector activity in providing rural financial services. The
emphasis of this policy w.juld be to move away from intervention in the form of
public-sector owned parastatal activity In rural finance markets and toward the
encouragement of greater private sector activity in this aree.
The Government Is fully committed is ths Iureuft ff the 0oU#I%% and strategies outline
above. The Govemment's main Instrument for effecting the implementatin oft 1ts
agricultural policies and strategies Is the recently approved Agriculture Sector Public
Expenditure Program (PROAGRI).

Agriculture Sector PubUc Expenditure Program
PROAGRI Is seen as the first phase of a long term program aimed at supporEing
Government's agricultural development goals by rationalizing sectoral public expenditure
and the role of MAP and improving its effectiveness in policy formulation, regulation and
service provision. MAP and the Ministry of Planning and Finance haive agreed a five-year
budget (1999-2003)  for PROAGRI of US$200 Million (US  :216 Million including
contingencios) that includes all of MAP's investment and recurrent expenditure over the
period, all Government and existing donor commitments channelled through MAP, and any
new donor commitments which are to support public sector program in the agricultural or
natural resouress sectors. PROAGRI will provide Government a mechanism with which to
co-ordinate what is now a very fragmented set of donor-driven projects and shape them
into a comprehensive program consistent with MAP's role in a markat.-based economy.
The Govemment commit itself to implement PROAGRI in a manner wlhich is consistent with
the set of program objectives and Basic Principles which have been agreed with donors
(presented In attachment 2 to this letter). These Basic Principles will guide the institutional
reforms of MAP as well as the nature of its programs and activities in the agricultural
sector. For each Basic Principles, the Government and donors have established MDestones
(also artachment 2) which will make it possible for the path towards achievement of results
and the development objective to be charted and monitored. The Govemment commits
itself to implement PROAGRI in a way designed to lead to the achievement of the
Milestones.
PROAGRI will be calibrated against the Basic Principles and Milestone through two annual
meetings with donors. Govemment and donors will update Milestones, and Basic Principles
,may be modified as appropriate, by mutual agreement. In the fourth quarter of each year,
Government and donors will review the annual work plan and budget. The basis for review
and approval will be consistency of the planning and the Implementation of PROAGRI with
the Basic Principles, and progress toward achieving the agreed upon Mlilestones.
In conclusion, many of the policy initiatives required to promote growth and reduce poverty
have already been undertaken. The Government believes that implementation and
adjustment of these initiatives, as required, will have a significant impact on the agriculture
sector's performance and in enhancing the welfare of the Mozembican people.

Attachment 2: Basic Principles for Financing of PROAGRI
Donors and Goveniment will commit funds to a program of expenditure against commonly agreed Basic
Principles that define the nature of MAP's transformation. MAP's success in implementing the principles
will be the basis for annual reviews and budget approval. The principles constitute a contract among
donors and Government that will be mutually enforced. The milestones in the middle column will be
reviewed annually.
Overarching Principles
Approaches:
* Poverty reduction
* Decentralisation and Empowerment
* Good Governance - Transparency, Accountability and Participation
* Policies, program and activities designed with attention to gender-related issues and implications
* Policies, programs and activities reflect increased attention to rights and needs of smallholder farmers concerning
access to land, inputs and markets
* Policies, programs, and activities designed with attention to environmental and social sustainability
* Market-Oriented Policy Framework

Research
Approaches:
*  Priorities focused (but not exclusively) on adaptive and applied research in a farming systems (zoned setting)
context; snall farmer issues and especially women farmers; sustainable natural resource use.
*  Representation by stakeholders (particularly farmers) at National Agricultural Research Council (NARC) and
Zonal Research Council (ZRC) level and in research program committees at all levels with priorities and resource
allocation decided by these stakeholders.
*   Linking research, extension and training through close cooperation between research institutions, extension
services, universities and other relevant training institutions.
.   Financing of research through a plurality of sources: Government core funding, cost-sharing, private sector
financed contracts, competitive grant facilities.
*   Provision of research through a plurality of institutions: public and private.

Extension
Approaches for publicly-financed extension:
*  Open to multiple delivery mechanisms, including private sector enterprises, associations, NGOs.
*  Demand-driven, flexible and responsive to diverse and changing needs of farmers.
*   Market-oriented to help farmers effectively commercialise products and obtain highest return.
.  Realistic scale, objectives, expected outcomes, with effective monitoring and impact assessment.
.   Cost-effective so services are delivered at the lowest possible cost to achieve intended objectives.

Livestock
Approaches:
.  Emnphasis of livestock program must reflect needs, constraints, opportunities of family farmers by designing
interventions (including species and breed) around their specific livelihood systems, production potential
and resource capacity.
*  Development of animal health service delivery must reflect financial viabilitv and affordability. Private
sector, cormmunity or producer-association managed livestock services, including para-professionals, should
provide the services where appropriate.
*  Government support to livestock development should recognise complementary role of private sector; encompass
animal production, emphasise small stock. prioritise activities and geographic areas.

communities, private sector, with possible joint ventures involving all stakeholdler groups.
* Sustainable use of all forest and wildlife resources will be ensured through adaptive management.
* Ministerial coordination mechanism for natural resource mnanagement in recognised priority area.

* Users of irrigation schemes must be responsible for O&M costs and contribute to future investments;
* Priority to small-scale irrigation with full participation of farmers, including women, in all stages of development
(planning, construction, operation, maintenance to ensure sustainability);
* Financial, environmental, economic and biodiversity analysis to be undertaken and investment priorities justified
accordingly;
* Emphasis on rehabilitation and management of existing schemes rather than new construction.
* Private sector involvement in service provision: consultancies, construction, input supply & marketing;

Annex 12: Summary of the Environmental Assessment
Mozambique: Agricultural Sector Public Expenditure Program (PROAGRI)
A first sectoral environmental analysis entitled "Phase 1: Overview and Environmental Assessment of PROAGRI"
has been conducted (5/98). A second detailed environmental analysis for Phase 2 will be carried out in early 1999.
The EA for Phase 1 focuses on (i) the potential impacts of the govermment's agriculture sector strategy on the
quality and productivity of the natural resource base, natural habitats, land use and tenure, human welfare and quality
of life; and (ii) identification of institutional responsibilities, incentives and capacities to ensure environmental
sustainability of agricultural development and to monitor impacts of policies and activities. As the location and
extent of various activities had not yet been defined, the EA lists environmental impacts that might occur.
The overarching key recommendations under Phase 1 include
*  the establishment of an environmentalplanning capacity within MAP, to be located within the planning
division of DE-MAP. This work will involve senior personnel specialized in environmental management, and
will be responsible for the successfuil implementation of the environmental management recommendations into
the PROAGRI. The unit will also have adequate operational representation at the provincial level;
*  the establishment of a PROAGRI environmental monitoring conumittee, ideally chaired by MAP, and to
include representation from PROAGRI-related ministries;
*  the commitment to conduct the planned Phase 2 detailed environmental assessment;
*  donors and/or the World Bank (as well as MAP) must include the above-mentioned environmental management
structures in their budget planning.
The EA for Phase 2 is likely to focus on the following preliminary key tasks:
*  identification and implementation of EA studies required under PROAGRI sub-components;
*  development of environmental management and monitoring plan for the implementation of PROAGRI's sub-
components;
*  development and production of appropriate environmental awareness building materials;
*  initiating enviromnental training and capacity building program related to PROAGRI;
*  strengthening the relevant executing agencies responsible for environmental management in general, and
environmental assessment in particular.
It has been agreed during negotiations that all EAs for PROAGRI's sub-components shall have Environmental
Management Plans (EMPs) incorporated in the Annual Work Plans and Budgets, that:
(a) are appropriately costed;
(b) clearly define their institutional arrangements and
(c) clearly defme the institutional arrangements for the execution of the monitoring plan under the
Department of Planning and Monitoring of DE.
The Mozambican team has committed itself to undetake the above measures once funding is obtained for the
implementation of the AWPBs. The team further committed itself that a member of the Environmental Assessment
and Review Team of the Africa Region will be part of the supervision team to ensure the implementation of the EMP
as well as participate in an annual review meeting scheduled under the project.
