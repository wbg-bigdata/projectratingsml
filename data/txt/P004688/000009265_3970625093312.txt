PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
THAIAND - FOURTEI EDUCAION PROJECT
(LOAN 1271-T21)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report (PCI) ou the Fourth Education
Project in Thailand, for which Loan 1271-TK was approved on May 27, 1976 in
the sum of US$31.0 million. At the request of the Government, a total of
US$4.7 million (about 15% of the loan) was cancelled in October 1982 and
March 1983.   The undisbursed balanee of US$910,185.51 was cancelled on
September 6, 1984, vhen the loan was officially closed.
The PCR was prepared by a UNESCO project completion mission under
the auspices of the World lank-UNESCO  Cooperative Program.   The mission
visited Thailand in December 1983. Prior to the field visit, the mission
made a study of the project files in the Bank's East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office. While in the field, the mission consulted relevant draft
documents prepared by the authorities and held discussions with Government
officials involved in the implementaiton of the project. Following a Bank
review of the draft PCR in February 1984, UNESCO completed the PCR in August
1984. The PCR was further updated in November 1984 by the Education Projects
Division of the East Asia and Pacific Region, particularly the Basic Data and
project costs based on the final disbursement figures provided by the Loan
Department.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project perfor-
mance auditing, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft PCR vas sent to the Borrower and its agencies and comments received
have been taken into account in finalizing the report and are reproduced as
Attachment I.

6.    Conclusions drawn suggest that: (i) the CPU's eKtension of
authority yielded positive results and reduced delays considerably
(paragraph 2.3); (ii) although the centralized pattern of the secz!d-
ary education sub-unit say have definite advantages over the decentral-
ized one of the adult education sub-unit, a crucial fact remains the
competence and degree of involvement of high-ranking administrative
officials and technical staff of the unit; in additi-i, several key
NEED personnel involved in the project feel that there are definite
advantages in the decentralized pattern, such as closer coordination
between project and non-project components, smoother transfer of work
after project completion to regular operating units and opportunity to
upgrade staff in all sections of the Department rather than in the pro-
ject unit alone; aid (iii) desig  of furniture should be oetrusted to
e perienced staff directly involved in the Implementation of the pro-
ject aid that quality control at delivery is of the utmost importance.
The Diversiied Secondary Schools (DSSs)
7.    Obervations on this compcnent are  the DSSs offer mainly the
compulsory part of the diversified curriculum which is a rational deviation irom
the educational reform and the appraisal proposals (paragraphs 4.9 to 4.12); the
facilities proviked are adequate for the programmes offered and the staff is
well trained; enrolments surpassed by 18 per cent the target which created
over-crowding in Lertain workshops (paragraphs 4.13 to 4.16); practical
facilities are fully utilized during regular school hours but, so far, rarely for
adult education activities which are among the appraisal proposals (paragraphs
11.17 to 4.20).
S.    Conclusions are:  (i) the present practice of- offering only the
compulsory practical part of the curriculum is sound and it is in line with the
proposals for rationalizing secondary education (paragraphs 4.11 and 4.12 and
Annex IV/4) (ii) the fact that enrolments surpassed the target did not seriously
affect the quality of education as it is to a large extent offset by the revised
programmes which offer little or no specialized subjects (paragraphs 4.9 to
4.12); (iii) the programmes are well structured and organized which reflects the
beneficial influence of the technical assistance programme for the DSSs
(paragraphs 4.21 and 4.22); and (iv) now that the regular programmes are well
organized and functioning, attention should be turned to organizing adult
education programmes.
The Adult Education Experience
9.    The adult education component provided for a pioneer programme in
this area intended as the first in a series of interventions in this respect.
Highlights in this component are: the impressive performance of the Non-
Formal Education Department (NFED) surpassing by far the targets (paragraphs
4.31 and 4.32) and it's awareness of the several problems and shortcomings
manifested by corrective action in the right direction (paragraphs 4.40 and
4.47). Most of the problems observed were identified at the appraisal stage and
the project had been designed to contribute to their solutions. They can be
summed up as follows: (i) weaknesses in inter-agency coordination, resulting in
overlapping and duplication, particularly in skill development programmes
(paragraphs 4.34 to 4.40); (ii) inadequate collaboration between regional and
provincial centres because of unclear definitions of their respective roles and
staff weaknesses (paragraphs 4.37 to 4.39); (iii) insufficient coverage of the
rural areas because of a limited number of provincial centres, financial
constraints, scarcity of qualified staff, and, in retrospect, provision of facilities
encouraging "in-centre" rather than field activities (paragraphs 4.41 to 4.43);
and (iv) programmes not adequately suited to the specific needs of the
community because of difficulties in micro-planning and in securing the
services of competent staff (paragraphs 4.44 to 4.46).



- (vii) -
10.   Recommended action involves:  (i) strengthening the inter-agency
coordination (paragraph 4.36); (ii) delineating further the role of the regional
and provincial centres, improving the quality of their staff, and reassessing the
staff requirements of the regional centres (paragraphs 4.38 and 4.39); (iii)
i .creasing the number of the provincial centres and restructuring their
iacilities to enable them to focus on field activitVes (paragraphs 4.46 and 4.47);
and (iv) establishing intermediary (between province and village) support
services for the provincial centres so as to increase their coverage and to
facilitate planning at community level thus providing the necessary elements
for programrne adaptation. Action in the last two recommendations is already
under way as can be concluded from proiect VII preparation document which
reflects the official position of the NFED (paragraph 4.47).
Technical Assistance
II.   On the whole, the technical assistance component was successfully
implemented and contributed substantially to the smooth implementation of the
project and the operation of the project institutions. There were cuts in expert
services for the secondary education component which, apparently, did not
affect the programme, and considerable delays with the long-term degree
fellowships for the adult education component due to changes in the selection
criteria and the involvement of the Teachers' Council in the selection process
(paragraph 4.50).
12.    Of the 12 who received degree fellowships, four are working in
the regional centers and the three who are pursuing doctoral studies are
expected to return to their regional center positions upon completion of
their studies. The graduates from the degree fellowships have contributed
significantly to the technical competence of the system and have been key
figures in the development of research and evaluation, training materials
developent and the radio correspondence project.
Evaluation of Projects and Studies on Primary Education
13.   Among the additional components of the project, there are two
evaluation studies included, one for the DSSs, the other for the adult education
component (paragraphs 4.51 and 4.52). A general observation is that in such
studies, there is a tendency to ignore the results of other studies on the same or
similar subjets already existing. Also, at times, two or more different agencies
undertake at the same time to evaluate one and the same project without
coordinating their efforts or consulting with each other. In the view of this
mission, the NEC should undertake the overall responsibility for organizing and
coordinating evaluation studies as this is among its principal tasks. Setting up
special groups or hiring outside agencies proves costly and is, in general, less
effective.
14.   Among the same additional project components, there are also two
studies on primary education (paragraphs 4.56 to 4.60). In the view of this
mission, Study I which deals with primary education in general did not take
sufficiently into account the results of existing studies (school mapping, sub-
sector survey study on primary education as part of the Education Sector
Survey Study, and other relevant NEC studies).

SOCIO-ECONOMIC SETTING
1.1   Thailad, with a total area of S14,000 sq. km. is divided into fow main
geographical regions: Central Plain, North, North East, and South, and 12
educational regions.
1.2   The majority of the population, now estimated at some 47 milion, belongs
to the Thai ethnic group. However, there are several minority groups - includig
the Lao, Khmer, Mao, Karen, Malay and several hill tribes - who speak different
dialects and laguages.
1.3   Table 1.1 below illustrates the socio-economic situation of the country at
the time of the formulation of the project (1975176) as compared to that towards

1.    By the cosing date of the project (end of 1983) the country had completed
its Fourth Development Plan (1977181) and was in the second year of the Fifth Plan
(1982186). Evidently, there was a remarkable progress, particularly in terms of
economic growth, during the Fourth Plan (Tabe 1.1 above). However, rapid
economic growth has also brought financial instability, balance of payments
deficits, widening income disparity and environmental problems, such as
deforestation and soil erosion.  As a result, the Fifth Social and Economic
Development Plan reflects the Government's concem for better income
distribution, employment, and restructuring of the economy.
EDUCATION
The System and its Philosophy
1.5    Under the National Education Chart approved by the National Education
Commission in 1977, education is conceived as a continuing life-long process which
promotes the quality of life of the citizen enabling him to live a useful life in
society. An educational reform was launched in 1978 aiming at introducing more
flexibility and diversity into the system, providing more equitable opportunity and
preparing students better for entry to the labour force.
1.6    The salient features of the Reform  include:  (i) unification of all
educational administration under the Ministry of Education and decentralization of
administrative responsibility to the provinces; (ii) resucturing of the education
system below university level as shown in Table 1.2 below arid the diagram in
Annex 1/1; (iii) integration of separate specialized secondary schools into single
comprehensive schools; (iv) abolition of entrance examinations to secondary schools
and adoption of a geographical quota system and; (v) consolidation of fragmented
curricula subjects around a flexible national core with regional variations.

1.7    Among the major weaknesses of the education system, as detected by the
Appraisal, were: {i) only about half of the age group 11 to 13 is enrolled beyond the
fourth grade, (ii) the quality of education is low in provincial towns and rural areas
mainly due to poorly trained teachers, irrelevant curricula, and inadequate
instructional materials and supervision; (iii) secondary and higher education are
heavily concentrated in Bangkok which, with 10% of the nation's population, has
some 60% of total upper secondary and 95% of higher education enrolments and;
(iv) less than two per cent of the adults have access to non-formal educational
programmes related to their needs.

most important among them being the Department of Non-Formal Education, the
Department of Vocational Education within the Ministry of Education, and the
Ministries of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Public Health, and Interior

(Department of Public Information, Department of Community Development and

Educational Achievements and Perspectives
1.12   Quantitative achievements during the Fourth Social and Economic
Development Plan (1977-81), whose implementation period coincided for the most
part with that of Project IV, fell short of the targets for all levels and types of
education except for teacher training and higher education where, with the open
universities, growth got out of proportion. Table 1.6 below substantiates this
statement.

Educational Finance
1.13   Details on central Government expenditure and education expenditures are
given in Annexes I/7-1/10. According to these data, the share of the educational
expenditures in the central Government budget has been fluctuating between 19.6
and 21.5 per cent since 1977; it was 19.8 per cent in 1981. Central Government
education expenditures absorbed some 3.4 per cent of GDP in 1981.
1.14   The share of primary education in total central Government expenditures
for education has stabilized around 55 per cent since 1978 having risen from 48 to
57 per cent between 1970 to 1976, while that of secondary education is now 16 per
cent as against 12 per cent in 1976.
THE PROJECT
Proiect Generation
1.15   The first three Bank education projects in Thailand, with two loans and one
credit totalling some US$ 41 million, dealt with secondary and higher education.
Pursuing the main objectives of manpower development, quality imnprovement and
more equitable coverage, the projects succeeded in strengthening the Govemment's
institutional capacity for trade and industrial and agricultural training (First
Education Project, Loan 471-TH); expanding and relocating part of KasetsarE
(Agricultural) University and developing various departments of the MOE (Second
Education Project, Loan 822-TH); and developing teacher training, rural secondary
schools, a national curriculum development centre and the Prince of Sonkla science
faculty (Third Education Project, Credit 369-TH).
1.16   The first mention of a fourth education project was made in August 1973,
in connection with the Government's interest in deve!oping educational radio and
television (ERTV).  Ad hoc preparations for the project were made by the
Government which, in July 1974, submitted to the Bank a request for a loan to
finance the fourth project.  Originally the proposal comprised four main
components, namely: ERTV; non-formal education; secondary schools; and training
of accountants. Following an appraisal in September 1974, the appraisal mission
recommended three major changes: (i) to establish one-half of the proposed
educational radio network and defer the remainder to a possible second phase
project; (ii) to reduce the investment in educational television to an experimental
programme; and (iii) to focus investment in secondary schools on the provision of
equipment rather than large-scale construction.   The appraisal mission also
recommended that the Government approach multilateral and bilateral agencies
for the technical assistance component of the project. In particular, since the
training of accountants largely involved technical assistance, it was suggested that
UNDP be requested to support the whole of the accountant training request.
1.17   The Bank proceeded to process the project on the basis of the above
recommendations. In February 1975 the Bank invited the Government to negotiate
a loan of US$ 24.5 million to help finance the Fourth Education Project. In April
1975, the Government informed the Bank that it was withdrawing its request for
Bank financing for a modified request involving the remaining project components.
The modified request was received by the Bank in early August 1975. A post-
appraisal mission was in Thailand during 18-30 August, 1975 to review the modified
request, which included non-formal education, secondary schools and the training
of accountants. The post-appraisal mission recommended that the Bank support
the project, subject to certain modifications to the non-formal education and



-6-
secondary school components and relegation to UNDP support of the accototant
training component. However, the Ministry of Education then declared that it was
uncertain whether to request Bank financing for the project at the "hgh cost' of
8.5% interest rate. Following further discussions between the Government and the
Bank in October 1975, a Bank 'technical review' mission went to Thailand in
January 1976 to complete the appraisal of the modified proposed project, which
finally comprised two major components: non-formal education and secondary
schools. Negotiations were held in 21-26 April, 1976, and the project was
presented to the Board on 27 May, 1976. The project became effective on 9
February, 1977.
Project Objectives
1.18   As specified in the Appraisal Report, the Fourth Project is designed to
assist the Government in implementing the education reform in two key areas,
namely: (i) to extend the provision of diversified secondary education in provinces
outside Bangklok and; (ii) to establish a nationwide adult education system.
Project Components
1.19   The project items can be grouped under four major components as follows:
Component A: Secondary Education
(i)   Training and Maintenance Centre (additiol construction, furniture
and equipment);
(ii)  50  diversified  secondary  schools (extension, furniture  and
equipment).
Component B: Adult Education
(i)   one coordinating unit (establishment through technical assistance);
(i)   four regional adult education centres, (construction, furniture and

PROJECT IMPLEEI£TATION
OVERALL IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
2.1    The diagram in Annex ill presents the overall project implemetion
schedule, actual and estimated. There were delays in the mplemetion of both
the Diversified Secondary Schools and the Adult Education components mainly For
scarcity of funds because of budget cuts to counter financial constraints. Delays
were more important in the Adult Education component because of staffing
problems of the respective Project Implementation Sub-Unit (paragraph 2.6).

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM
2.3    The Ministry of Education through its Central Project Unit (CPU) was the
implementing agency for Project IV. The CPU was strengthened with additional
staff and a full-time expatriate advisor and assumed responsibility for overall
coordination of the Project, liaison with other agencies, and correspondence with
the Bank. To simplify time consuming procedures, the strengthened CPU was
granted authority to review and arrange for the approval of tender documents, bid
invitations and evaluation of contracts.
2.4    At the operational level, two sub-project units were resporsible for the
implementation of the project, one each for the Secondary Education and the Adult
Education Components. The major responsibilities of the sub-project units are
summarized in Annex 1112. (Section A).
Secondary Education Project Implementation Sub-Unit
2.5    The sub-project implementation unit in charge of the Rural Secondary
School Component of Project m was reinforced to take charge of the DSS
Component. This sub-project unit operated within the Office of Special Projects
(OSP) which is a service of the General Education Department established with the
purpose of supervising the operations of pioneer project institutions for limited
periods. The Unit had six sections (Administration, Architectural, Operations,
Planning, Contracts, Accountancy, and Materials) and it was headed by a Project
Director, assisted by a Deputy Director.
Adult Education Project Implementation Sub-Unit
2.6    For the Adult Education Component a second sub-project implementation
unit was established within the Adult Education Division under the name of the
"Office of the Non-Formal Education Development Project" (Project Office). For
the first two and-a-half years of operations, this Office was directly responsible
for the implementation of the project; it was headed by a Director, assisted by a
deputy director and had a professional staff of 15 persons.On March 22, 1979 the Adult



-10-
Education Division was upgraded to a departm-nt (the Non-Formal Education
Department - NFED) and the "Project Ofiice" ceased to have the sole
responsibility of the implementation of the project. In fact, its staff was dispersed
among the several divisions/sections of the newly-established department where
they continue to carry out their project-related activities in addition to the
functions corresponding to their new post. The Project Office continued to
function but assumed the role of a coordinating rather than an implementing unit.
Details on the structure and functions of the Project Office before and after the
above-mentioned changes are given in Annex UI2 (Section B).
2.7    The changes in the Project Office created serious gaps in the Project
implementation mechanism and the attention of the authorities to this effect was
drawn repeatedly by the the supervision missions. Finally, changes of personnel in
higher posts within the Department, including the director, and assignment of
project implementation tasks to truly devoted and hardworking staff compensated
to a large extent the shortcomings of the new arrangement.
SITES
2.8    All new building facilities for the 50 DSSs included in the project were
constructed within the property of the existing schools (extensions) and those for
the Training and Maintenance Centre were built inside the property of existing
similar facilities and warehouses of the Ministry of Education.
2.9    The sites selected for the three Regional Adult Education Centres are from
5 to 20 kms outside the municipal area of the provincial capital, all accessible by
paved roads. The fourth Centre (Ubon) is located within the municipal area of the
capital and it took over the site of the Thai-Unesco Fundamental Education Centre
(established over 20 years ago). The areas of the sites vary from 57 hectares
(Central Region) to 227 hectares (Northern Region).
2.10   Of the 24 Provincial Centres, nine are located within the municipal area of
the Province's capital city, twelve within 10 kms from such municipal areas and
three still farther. The area of their sites varies from 9 to S1 hectares. Follow up
of the activities of the centres indicates that those located more than ten
kilometres away from the municipal boundaries encounter difficulties in
communicating with other governmental agencies, have high public utility costs
and present numerous inconveniences to the users.
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
2.11   The overall responsibility for planning, design and execution of civil works
(including furniture) of all project components was with the General Education
Department (GED) of of the Ministry of Education. After the establishment of the
Non-Formal Education Department (NFED), responsibility for the Adult Education
Component was assigned to the new Department.
2.12   The planning, design and preparation of the architectural and engineerng
drawings, as well as supervision of the construction, were carried out by the Office
of Special Projects (OSP) of the GED. Private consultants were used to carry out
land surveys and special studies related to soil and foundations.
2.13   A private consulting firm was hired to prepare the design studies (including
architectural and engineering surveys as well as furniture design) of all the items
included in the Adult Education Component. The Project Office's Construction
Section and, later, various sections of the NFED coordinated the work and assured
the supervision of the construction.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNS
2.14   Standard designs were prepared for the new buildings of all Diversified
Secondary Schools providing  facilities for Academic Teaching;   Science
Laboratories; Agricultural, Home Economics, and Industrial Arts workshops; Multi-
Purpose Hall; Nursery; Staff Houses; and Sanitary Areas. Built-areas vary from
school to school. In 31 schools, these were above the Appraisal estimates but in 19,
they were below. The total built-area, including the Training and Maintenance
Centre (TMC),is only 4.7 per cent above the appraisal estirnateld.
2.15   The design of standard types of buildings is an improvement over previous
designs but the use of the same type of building in different regions of the country
has not given the best results concerning the local climatic conditions and the
functional and aesthetic aspects. The TMC design study provided for specially
designed  buildings for warehouses, conference  rooms, agricultural power
mechanics, metal shops, boarding facilities and staff houses for an area of some
five per cent below the Appraisal estimates. The design is simple and appropriate.
2.16   Standard designs were prepared for all types of buildings of the new
Regional and Provincial Adult Education Centres. Facilities for the regional
centres include: classrooms, library offices, workshops, a dormitory, housing units
for some staff, a cafeteria and a small printing facility. Facilities for the
provincial centres include: five classrooms, four multi-purpose workshops, a
library, a meeting hail and boarding accommodation for 12 persons.
2.17   The following observations concern both the Regional and Provicial
Cen Eres   (i) separate buildings create  inconvenience  in communication,
particularly during the rainy season; (ii) standard designs do not adapt to local
climatic conditions and environment; (iii) the design and details in certain
categories of buildings such as the ibrary (mezzanine with no natural ventilation
and lighting) and the workshops and laboratories for the Regional Centres (designed
for teaching students and not for teaching teachers and instructors), are
inappropriate; (iv) buildings for storage, animal sheds etc.,are over-designed. Use
of simpler and less expensive structures adapted to local practices is advisable; and
[v) staff houses have minimal space and lack of certain facilities.
CONSTRUCTION
2.18   There were considerable delays in the construction for both components for
the following reasons: (i) an initial three-month clelay in signing the Loan
Agreement and a two-month postponement of the effective date; ;ii)budget cuts
because of financial constraints resulting, at times, ira cancellation of contracts;
and (iii) long 'red-tape' procedures and personnel problems as explained in
paragraph 2.6.
2.19   For the Secondary Education Component, civil works contracts were
distributed in 51 packages (50 schools + one Training anc Maintenance Centre) to be
executed in three phases. In fact, two schools were constructed in two phases,
hence the final number of the packages was 53. Construction was executed in
three phases, as foreseen, but there was an 'advanced' phase added to counter
urgent needs. The timing is presented in Table 2.1 belo-w:
11    See Annex IV/3 for details on areas and unit costs.

2.20   For the Adult Education Component, civil works were also planned in three
phases parallel to those of the Secondary Education Component. In practice, the
three phases were broken into two sub-phases each and were executed as shown in
Table 2.2 below:

FURNITUR' AND EQUIPMENT
2.21   Furniture for both project components were procured through local
competitive biddings and equipment through international biddings according to
Bank procedures.
2.22   For the Secondary Education Component, lists, design, specifications and
cost estimates for f umiture were prepared by the architect of -the Office of
Special Projects (OSP). Contracts were awarded to local manufacturers and were
effected in packages, one per school, from 1978 to 1981, starting one year after
civil works. Fumiture procurement was achieved 100 per cent according to plans.



- 13 -
2.23   Master lists and specifications for equipment for the Secondary Education
Component were prepared by OSP in collaboration with other competent divisions
of the General Education Department. Procurement was effected item by item
between 1977 and 1979. After delivery and inspection, equipment was handed over
to the Division of Supplies and Educational Materials which would then despatch it
to the Project schools. A total of 117 items, mainly snall equipment and tools
(total value Baht 2.65 million), were not procured because of unsuccessful bids or
contract cancellations.
2.24   Problems encountered with regard to the quality and procurement of
furniture and equipment for the Secondary Education Component are: (i) low
quality of furniture and certain equipment (e.g. typewriters); and (ii) difficulties in
the procurement of equipment because of cumbersome approval procedures and
ineffective biddings due to inadequate specifications and tendering procedures.
There were long delays in the procurement of certain items and some had to be
changed. In fact, a batch of lathes has just been delivered.
2.25   Furniture design, cost estimates and specifications for the Adult Education
Component were prepared by the architects of the consulting firm which designed
the buildings. Contracts for furniture were awarded to local manufacturers and
were effected in packages corresponding to the needs of the centres by region.
Furniture procurement was achieved 100 per cent according to plans. Master lists
and specifications for equipment were prepared by work groups established by the
Project Office with the assistance of an expatriate procurement expert.
2.26   Three major shortcomings have been observed in the quality and
procurement of furniture for the Adult Education Component: (i) the initial design
prepared by the consulting firm had certain limitations regarding durability and
design. For certain furniture design had to be revised and furniture already
manufactured had to be modified. Also, furniture designs were mostly new to the
market which increased the cost in comparison to similar furniture already on the
market; (ii) built-in furniture was not included in the civil works. This created
problems of installation in cases where the civil works were behind schedule with
the result that some furniture had to be modified or redone; (iii) delays in the civil
works created also problems of delivery and storage and; (iv) shortage of qualified
technical staff in the new NFED created difficulties in reception, quality control
and installation of furniture.
2.27   With regard to the provision of equipment for the Adult Education
Component, the master lists were revised after the first year of project operations.
Changes were also introduced during the second and fourth years.  Towards the
end of the project, funds were used for the purchase of supplementary books,
audiovisual equipment and other training materials for the centers (para. 1.91D).
2.28   Major problems encountered with regard to equipment for the Adult
Education Component are: i) in preparing the lists it was difficult to determine in
detail the required equipment, because the institutions were new to the country.
Initial lists had to be adjusted several times; (ii) inflexibility of procedures to allow
for local purchases, specific regional and provincial requirements could not be
reflected in the lists; (iii) initial specifications were for high quality, durable and,
therefore expensive, equipment. Budget allowances for the first biddings were
based on lower standards and bids had to be cancelled so that specifications could
be adjusted. This caused considerable delays and led to the purchase of certain
low quality items; (iv) the change in the administration with the creation of the
new Non-Formal Education Department created staff problems (paragraph 2.6) and
consequent delays in the procurement and the processing of claims for
reimbursement and; (v) storage facilities were not adequate and some of the
equipment awaiting shipment suffered loss and breakage.



TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
2.29   There were delays in the implementation of Technical Assistance
particularly for the fellowships for the Adult Education Component (Annex WIII).
The main reasons for the observed delays were cumbersome procedures in the
selection of candidates and the application -of disputable criteria. Such selection
was entrusted to the Teachers' Council and the Adult Education Division had little,
if any, involvement. Initially the selection criteria applied were not in conformity
with those agreed upon wnth the Bank and the Supervision missions repeatedly had
to draw the attention of the competent authorities to this fact.
OTHER COMPONENTS
2.30   Other components include assistance for the preparation of future projects
foreseen in the Appraisal and the items which were added towards the end of the
project (paragraph 1.20 D). The implementation schedule of these itens
is shown in Annex III14 together with their costs.

3.2    The actual project cost expressed in US dolar values was 60.32 million or
77 per cent of the total stimated cost. However, coverted into Baht values (US$
I = 20 Baht up to 1981 ard lS$ 1 = 23 Baht thereafter), the actual cost (Baht
1,244.4 millio represents 79.4 per cent of the estimated cost CBaht 1,566.9

3.3   The main reasons for overall lower costs can be summarized as follows: C)
a change in the exchange rates as shown in the preceding paragraph; (i) site
development cost for the DSS Component and professional fees for both
components were overestimated; (iii) equipment costs were lower after the revision
of the original lists and a small part of the equipment for the DSS Component were
not purchased and; (iv) Technical Assistance funds were not fully utilized. Details
are discussed under the appropriate headings in this Chapter.
CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND AREAS
3.4    The actual construction costs, including site works and cost escalation,
amounted to 70.2 per cent of the total project cost and represented 76.6 per cent
of the Appraisal estimates in US dollar values and 78 per cent in Baht values. For
Component A (DSS) construction cost was far below the estimates (69 per cent in
Baht values), while for Component B (Adult Education) such cost was 118 per cent
higher than the estimates.



-16-
3.5    The relatively low construction cost of the DSS Component is due mainly
to the lower than estimated site development cost, as all buildings were erected in
existing school sites where additional site development work was minimaL
3.6    Reasons for the high construction costs in the Adult Education Component
are: (i) site development costs were much higher than estimated (for certain items
up to 200 per cent); (ii) during the second phase of constuction, costs went up by 30
to 40 per cent in comparison to the first phase construction costs and; (iii)
variation of materials cost from one province to another were far more important
than those estimated..
3.7    A comparison of planned and actual gross areas by project component and
item is given in Annex E11/3.
Professional Services
3.8    The actual cost of the professional services amounts to only 40 per cent of
the Appraisal estimates and involves professional fees for civil works and services
for the preparation of future projects (V and VI) as foreseen in the Appraisal
(Component C (iii)), as well as services for some of the additional items
(Component D)_. Professional services costs related only to the original project
represent 29 per cent of total project cost and correspond to only 11.6 per cent of
the estimates.
3.9    Reasons for the low cost of professional services are: O estimates were
based on the total construction cost which was lower than estimated (paragraph
3.4); (ii) construction involved mainly standard type of buildings; ii design, study
and supervision of the DSS Component were carried out by the Ministry of
Education's technical staff with consultant services limited to soil surveys and
other minor studies.
FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT COSTS
3.10   Total expenditure for furniture was US$ 4.61 million or 28 per cent higher
than estimated, ( 32 p-r cent in Baht values). Price increases, faulty design and
design not conforming to current designs on the market (paragraph 2.26) were the
main reasons for the observed cost overrun.
3.11   Total expenditure for equipment was US$ 11.26 million or 75 per cent of
the estimated Appraisal costs with 16 per cent representing additional items not
included in the Appraisal. It appears that the main reason for this relatively low
cost is a simple overestimate of the equipment for the Adult Education Component
because of lack of experience in equipping this type of institutions, new in the
country; see paragraplh 2.28.  Also it appears that the price excalation was
overestimated.
TECHNICAL ASSiSTANCE COSTS
3.12   The cost of the Technical Assistance programme amounted to 70.4 per cent
of the estimates because of cuts in both expert services and fellowships. Details
on this matter are given in Chapter IV (Project Outcomes) under the appropriate
headings.

CHAPTER IV
ATTAINMENT OF PRO3ECT O3ECTIES
4.1    The overall objectives of the project "to extend the provision of diversified
secondary education in provinces outside Bangkok and to establish a nationwide
adult education systemu, have been achieved. The contribution of the project to
the diversification proces has been substantial and the adult education system is
well established and functionug. The fact that the Adult Education Division was
upgraded to a department during the project implementation, despite serious
difficulties at the outset (paragraph 2.6) contributed greatly at the end to the
success of the project because of the dynamic approach and personal involvement
and hard work of the staff of the new department. NaturaUly, in retrospect, there
are gaps and shortcomings and lessons to be learnt. A brief account of the
observations of the Mission is given in the following paragraphs of this Chapter.
4.2    The major agreements reached between the Government and the Banlc
during the Appraisal Mission are referred to as "specal covenants", in the
supervision reports. Although with certain delays, aUl these agreements were
eventually fulfilled as shown in Annex IV/1 which is reproduced from the
Supervision Report of February, 1931.
DIVERSIFIED SECONDARY SCHOOLS
k.3   The degree of success of a project can be assessed only within the overall
context of the education system and its evolution during the implementation of the
project. The introduction of new concepxs and experimentation may reveal
alternative ways for resolving a particular issue and may lead to modification of
the expected outcome of the project without, however, implying failure. It is on
the basis of this thnking that this component is reviewed.
4.4    For a number of years among the Government's major policies has been the
emphasis given to rural development so as to combat rural poverty and to redress,
as far as possible, the inequitable distribution of income. Responding to this
concern, the Ministry of Education has assigned new roles to the secondary schools
as reflected in the educational reform proposals. These roles can be summarized
as folows: (i) to give general knowledge and practical instrction to its students to
enable them to develop favourable attitudes towards manual work and equip them
for self-development and social advancement; (ii) to educate the communitiese out-
of-school population through non-formal education and; (iii) to provide public
services for the community by disseminating general and vocational knowledge to
the local population informing them of innovative and technological changes which
are relevant to their daily experiences. The three DSS project objectives were:
(a) to improve the educational quality of provincial schools on a par with
those schools in Bangkok Metropolis with a view to upgrading general educa-
tion and increasing semi-skilled -anpover to the provinces where these
schools are located; (b) to provide education suitable for the aptitude,
interest and ability of the learner; and (c) to provide pre-occupational
training activities as an integral part of general education.
The Process of Diversification
4.5    The diversification of secondary education is among the major object-
ives of the educational reform and aims at providing the schools with the nec-
essarv facilities and persounel to enable them to adapt their curricula to
everyday needs and to prevailing local conditions thus fulfilling the import-
ant functions mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
4.6    Diversification is well under way through the implementation of a
number of projects, namely: the comprehensive schools project supportedby
CIDA (20 schools) and the World Bank projects III through VI. Upon completion



-20 -
of the projects under way (V and VI), there will be 644 secondary schools
diversidfied out of a total of some 1,500 public schools. In Project V there
are 12 Area Vocational Centres included, under the Vocational Education
Department, to provide services for some 50 satellite schools in the area.
All other schools have been diversified tbrouth the provision of lndividual
facilities.
4.7    Annex IV12 presenEs the curriculum outine and programme time-table for
the lower secondary schools (grades Ml-M3). According to this Annex, practical
subjects constitute a large part of the programme and are: (i) compulsory, under
the heading work experience and; (ii) optional, under the heading occupational
education. Work experience includes courses in agriculture, home economics,
industrial arts and business education, depending on the facilities of the school and
the availability of teaching staff. Four periods per week in each grade or some
11.4 per cent of the total instruction time is devoted to work experience in schools
included m Bank projects. Optional subjects cover some 23 per cent of the
instruction time, namely, six periods each in grades Ml and M2, and 12 periods in
grade M3. In theory, students can select any subject in the school curriculum as
optional, which suggests an idealy flexible and malleable programme. In practice,
however, there are restrictions which unveil a different picture. Namely, in grades
Ml and M2, all students have to choose to take at least four periods of Engtish as
"optional", which leaves only two periods for other choices. Also, in grade M3,
students who plan to continue their studies in M4, that is the vast majority of
them, have to oDt for six periods of English and six periods of mathematics, which
leaves none for other subjects.
4.8    At the upper secondary level, the reform curriculum is at its final year of
implementation (grade M6). Annex IV13 presents a general outline of this
curriculum. Although it is too early to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of this
curriculum, it appears that: (i) its flexibility is remarkable with some 60 per cent
of the instruction time devoted to elective subjects; (ii) there is a large variety of
electives with relatively few restrictions and; (iii) practical subjects constitute a
considerable portion (1/3) of the compulsory part of the curriculum under the
heading foundation of vocational education. As the large variety of elective
subjects in the curriculum risk leading to small classes, which are uneconomical to
run, schools offer pre-structured programmes with fixed major and minor electives
in accordance with the type, size and level of their facilities and the availability of
teaching staff.
Curricula of the Proiect Schools - A Proposal for Rationalization
of Secondary Education
4.9    The Diversified Secondary Schools, as conceived at the Appraisal stage,
were expected to offer both the compulsory and the elective vocational subjects,
the latter being far more specialized. At the same time the educational reform
provided that the general and vocational schools should merge into a unified type
of institution, the diversified secondary school. However, this integration never
took place and the latter continue to offer specialized training in conjunction with
their general subjects. With the Education Project V a new type of institution was
introduced, the Area Vocational Centre (AVC). Although the AVCs are adequately
equipped to offer specialized courses, their facilities are widely used to provide the
compulsory practical part of the curriculum for students in the satellite schools.
4.10   In practice, the project schools as well as other diversified schools rarely
offer among their pre-structured programmes (paragraph 4.9), specialized practical
subjects as major electives. Understandbly so, as the universities towards which all
secondary schools aim, do not require such subjects for entry. On the other hand,
all project schools of fer the compulsory vocational part of the curriculum as
described in t aragraphs 4.7 ar,d 4.8 above.



-21-
Reassessint the Role of the Diversified Schools
i.11   A lesson learnt from the implementation of this project and subsequent
experiences is that there is- a need for rationalization of the secondary education
and of clear delineation cof the role of each general and vocational education
institution. This issue is dealt with at length in the recent Sector Survey Report
(January, 1983); the proposal included in this report is reproduced in Annex IV/4.
4.12   In sum, the diversified schools should offer only the compulsory practical
part of the curriculum (as most of them do), leaving the optional specialized part
to specialized institutions such as vocational schools, Area Vocational Centres,
polytechnics, etc. To diversify small secondary schools for which provision of
individual facilities and permanent specialized staff would be uneconomical,
consideration should be given to providing "extension services" from larger "base
schools" in the area or Area Vocational Centres as described in dhe Annex.
Experimentation in this respect is proposed in Project VII now at the post-appraisal
stage.
Enrolments and Output
4.13   According to the Appraisal Report, enrolments in the 50 project schools
were expected to rise from 82,000 in 1975 to 98,000 upon completion of the
project. In reality, enrolments surpassed the target by some 18 per cent
approaching 116,000 in 1983. In part this is due to the extension of the upper
secondary cycle from two to three years as foreseen by the educational reform.
Indeed, the proportion of students in the upper cycle increased from about 20 per
cent of the total in 1975 to 46 per cent in 1983.
4.14   Increase in enrolments far beyond the Appraisal target created problems of
overcrowding particularly in certain workshops. The tendency for overcrowding
became evident from the early stages of the implementation of the project and the
attention of the authorities to this fact was drawn repeatedly by the supervision
missions. The problem still remains although it is compensated, to a large extent,
by the fact that most of the facilities are used mainly for the compulsory part of
the curriculum.
'.15   Only from the lower cycle of project schools are graduates from cohorts
who entered after completion of the project. Conforming to a special agreement
in the Appraisal (Annex IV/1), a tracer study unit has been established within the
General Education Department to follow up the graduates of project schools.
Information available so far on the 1978/82 cohort reveals that of the lower
secondary cycle graduates, less than 10 per cent take up jobs. Average salaries are
Baht 1,000 per month (in line with the Ministry's target) for 4 per cent and higher
for 3.6 per cent of them. Of the rest, some 90 per cent continue their studies in
the upper secondary cycle. Of the upper cycle graduates, some eight per cent take
up jobs with a wide range of monthly salaries (Baht 200-7,500). Of the rest, the
vast majority enter universities or other post-secondary institutions.
4.16   On-the-spot investigations during the mission came to a similar conclusion
as to the percentage of students who seek employment after graduation. Also, an
initial tracer study by the Ministry of Education for the period 1974/78 concluded
that 6 to 9 per cent of the lower cycle and 8 to 14 per cent of the upper cycle
graduates take up employment. This suggests that, so far, the diversified ctrricula
have not influenced the graduates' attitudes in this respect. However, there are
definite indications that there is a favourable tum towards vocational studies,
confirmed by the fact that since the introduction of the diversified curricula in the
lower secondary cycle, the proportion of students entering the upper vocational
cycle kept constantly increasing.



-22 -
Adequacy and Use of Practical Facilities
4.17   The extensions included in the project were built in accordance with local
standardized designs. Although further research on the design and building
materials rmay yield certain savings, the approved standardized construction is
functional and can be considered satisfactory.
4.18   The equipment provided is adequate and appropriate for the programmes
offered at present (compulsory practical part of the curriculum). However, more
sophisticated equipment would be needed for the schools to be in a position to run
effectively the specialized part of the curriculum (vocational electives). This
supports the view set forth in paragraph 4.12, that specialized courses should be
left with the specialized institutions.
4.19   The fact that certain equipment was not procured (paragraph 2.23) did not
affect the teaching process as it involved minor items (total value Baht 2.65
million) and, to a large extent, were replaced by local purchases. However, delay
in the delivery of lathes, (paragraph 2.24) caused inconvenience and had some
repurcussions on the implementation of the programme.
4.20   All practical facilities are fully used (between 25-30 periods per week)
during school hours but in very few instances do schools use their facilities for
adult training or other out-of-school activities as foreseen in the reform and the
project. Among the reasons for this appear to be: (i) existence of other adult
training facilities in the area; (ii) lack of specialist teachers; and iii) the fact that
the school directors gave priority to organizing the complicated diversified
programmes rather than to what they consider as side activities.
Staff DevelcDment and Technical Assistance
4.21   About 20 per cent of the teacting force are trained practical subject
teachers which, in global terms, can be considered satisfactory.  A staff
development programme, proposed at Appraisal, included 600 man/months of
fellowships for key personnel for the project schools. The programme was reduced
to 400 man/months and it was executed by the University of Alberta (Edmonton,
Canada) which had undertaken a similar programme for Project HIl (Rural
Secondary Schools). The training consisted of a four-month intensive course in the
philosophy and administration of comprehensive high schools. One hundred persons
(the directors and assistant directors for academic affairs of the 50 project
schools) attended the programme which proved to be very effective.  The
programme was executed in four stages (four groups of 25 each) between
September 1977 and May 1979, slightly behind the Appraisal schedule (January 1977
to September 1976).
4.22   There were 36 man/months of foreign advisory services foreseen at
Appraisal for the implementation of the DSS Component. However, the Office of
Special Projects, which had the overall supervision of the project, felt that with
the experience gained during the implementation of the Rural Secondary Schools
Project, such services were not indispensable. Hence, this part of technical
assistance was not implemented.
The Cost of Diversification
4.23   Past experience shows that the cost per student place for a non-divrersified
secondary school is of the order of Baht 11,700 (1980 prices), including furniture
and elementary equipment. For a diversified school, the cost per place, calculated
on the basis of the actual DSS project cost is some Baht 14,000 or 25 per cent



-23 -
hiher. Elements used for this calculation are: (i) the cost of the Project (Baht 501
million); (ii) initial (1975) enrolments in the 50 project schools (2,000) and; (iii)
final enrolments as being 107,000 which lies between the Appraisal esfimates
(93,0) and the actual (116,000) and it is oonsidered appropriate if the school
offers only the compulsory practical part of the crrioculum. Calcuations based on
diferent data and presented in the Sector Survey Report (Januay 1983, page 12)
gave similar results.
4.24   OveraRl recurrent unit costs for the Secondary Schools are of the order of
Baaht 2,400 per student per year (Annex 1/10). Calculations effected during Project
VI preparation and the Sector Survey Mission show that such costs are some 24 per
cent higher in diversified through individual facilities schools, which is somewhat
higher than Appraisal estimates (20 per cent). Actual recurrent costs separately
for the project schools are not on hand at present.  The Sector Survey Report
suggests that additional recurrent costs can be dropped to about 17 per cent with
alternative ways of diversification (cf. extension services as suggested in Annex
IV/4). Workshop materials and maintenance costs are covered, to a large extent,
by students' fees which vary from school to schooL On the whole, they are
between Baht 600-700 per annum for diversified schools.
DSS Evaluation Surveys
4.25   The Loan Committee requested, in August 1981, that an.evaluation of the
already completed DSS project be carried out. The World Badc approved this
request and a sum of Baht 310,000 from the surplus project funds was allocated to
tis activity. A 15-member Committee composed of representatives of the NEC,
the NESDB, the Budget Bureau, the Central Project Unit and the General
Education Department was established to carry out the Survey. The final report
was expected to be submitted to the Bank by January 1984. At the time of the
Completion Mission, only a Thai version was available in draft form. A summary of
the conclusions of the draft report (translated during the Mission) is presented in
Aneex IV/5. According to these conclusions, the project had positive results with
an above average rate of success (between average and good).
4.26   Other evaluation studies on diversified schools include: (i) a study en the
DSS project undertaken by the OSP and expected to be completed shortly; Gi) a
study on Community Secondary Schools (still under way) undertaken by the NEC;
and (iii) a comprehensive study on the Rural Secondary Schools executed by the
University of Alberta and published in 1980 (a summary is included in the Project
m Completion Report).
4.27   Evaluation is of course, indispensable. However, it should be rationalized
and each additional study on a given subject should be linked firmly to the previous
ones. In principle, evaluation of educational projects should be among the regular
tasks of the NEC and should be carried out in close collaboration with the agencies
involved. Although financial support might still be necessary, it would be more
economical and effective than setting up special groups or contracting outside
agencies.
TRAINING AND MAINTENANCE CENTRE (TMC)
4.28   Extension of the TMC forms part of the Secondary Education Project
Component. The TMC started functioning in 1970 as a teaching aids production
unit with the comprehensive schools project and moved to its new premises near
the Bangkok Airport in *:975.  The Centre is unde; the General Education
Department and has a staff of some 100 persons of whom 30 are technicians.
There are three sections, namely: teaching aids production; in-service training in
equipment and building maintenance; and equipment supply.



-24 -
4.29   Production of teaching aids is done with the assistance of the supervisory
unit and involves the preparation of teaching manuals, slides, filmstrips and other
teaching aids. Training is focused on the maintenance of equipment and buildings
and consists of short courses (5-10 days) for practical subject teachers, other
schools employees (storekeepers, procurement officers, etc.) and janitors
(maintenance of buildings).
4.30   The facilities provided by the project (paragraph 2.15) helped substantially
the Centre in improving and extending its activities. Throughout last year there
were 840 persons trained in the Centre and five training courses were organized in
the provinces by the Centre's technicians
ADULT EDUCATION COMPONENT
Proiect Obiectives - Targets and Achievements
4.31   The overall purpose of this project component "to develop the institutional
capacity of the Government to manage and operate a national programme of Adult
Education' (Appraisal Report, paragraph 4.10) has been achieved to a large extent.
The specific objectives of the project were to:  (i) improve planning and
administration by strengthening the Adult Education Division; (ii) provide
programme support services in curriculum development and evaluation, and in the
training of adult educators by establishing four Regional Adult Education Centres;
(iii) unify adult education activities by establishing 24 Provincial Adult Education
(or Lifelong Education) Centres; and (iv) develop an infrastructure to serve as an
outlet at the level of the community for non-formal education by providing
services necessary to establish 8,400 village newspaper reading centres and their
supporting committees.
4.32   The quantitative targets of the project were reached or supassed. Examples
are: (i) there are 8,405 village newspaper reading centres functioning at pesent;
(ii) there are 19 provincial centres operating (six in temporary buil4ings) at the
Govemment's initiative in addition to the 24 provided by the project!l; (iii) radio-
correspondence reached 3,500 youths and adults in 1982 as against 2,800 targeted;
and (iv) a total of over 535,000 persons benefited in 1982 from direct services
(literacy, general and vocational education, special interest groups and radio-
correspondence (see table in paragraph 1.1)) and over three million if audio-visual
activities, public libraries, etc. are included (Appraisal target 1.8 million),
Maior Issues
4.33   Despite the success of the project and the impressive performance of the
Non-Formal Education Department (NFED), certain shortcomings, already
identified at Appraisal, still persist in the area of adult education; understandably
so, as the project was intended as the first in a series of interventions aiming at
initiating action in this area and at setting the necessary framework for an
effective long-term programme. The major issues, as they appear at present, can
be grouped under two headings: (i) overlapping and duplication of services; and (ii)
limited coverage linked with insufficiently adapted programmes and premises.
These issues have been discussed at length in the Sector Survey Report (January
1983) and the solutions proposed have been adopted in formulating the non-formal
education component of Project VII.
1    The final 1990 target is to establish a total of 73 provincial centres to
cover all provinces.



-25-
Overlapoin and DutpUcation
4.34   There is a large number of public and private agencies involved in non-
formal education and training activities. Among the functions of the Non-Formal
Education Department is to act as the secretariat to the National Commission on
Non-Formal Education whose purpose is to coordinate the organization and delivery
of the non-formal education and traiing programmes. At the provincial level,
there are branches of the National Commission but they act as steering
committees for the provincial education centres rather than as coordinating
agencies.
4.35   The most significant and costly duplication occurs in the skill development
prograrnmes where a number of institutions offer programmes addressed to the
- ie clientele without adequate coordination.  The same human and physical
resources could be used to reach a greater number and spectrum of people and
provide a more eftective training adapted to the needs of the individual. Another
area in which overlapping creates problems is the programme of trainig villagers as
group leaders or resource persons. Oftentimes, several agencies choose the same
person thus limiting the participation opportunities and overloading the individual.
4.36   The problems of inter-agency coordination is far too complex and can only
be resolved at the national policy making leveL This project intended to contribute
to this end through the creation of the Adult Education Coordinating tJnit whose
functions included "helping to provide the coordination and planning of adult
education which presently is lackirg". [ndeed, the NFED placed much importance
on coordination and achieved a great deal at the operational level: centres were
able to work in close cooperation with field staff at other agencies, particularly at
the district and sub-district levels-, coordinated needs assessment, operation and
follow-up have been shared; several centres developed systems promoting
integrated vilage level operations. The next step towards achieving overall
coordination should consist of strengthening the coordination mechanism at the
national level and converting the provincial branches of the National Non-Formal
Education Commission into sub-committees of the Provincial Development
Committees with terms of reference to oversee and coordinate all non-formal
education activities in the Province (Sector Survey Report, paragraph 3.31).
4.37  In addition to the inter-agency coordination problems there have been
considerable internal difficulties stemming mainly from unclear delineation of the
roles of the regional and provincial centres. The problem of coordination was
noted by the supervision missions during the implementation of the project and the
attention of the authorities was drawn to this effect. Specifically, the Supervision
Report of February 1981 states, among others, that "the NFED should define more
clearly the role of the RECs (Regional Education Centres) and LECs (Lifelong
Education Centres) to reduce duplication and take further steps to coordinate LEC
activities with those of other development agencies in the area and with the formal
school system".
4.38   According to the functions attributed at appraisal to the regional and
provincial centres, the former can be considered as overall planning and resource
mechanisms for provincial centres including training of adult educators and
production and distribution of teaching aids. Annex IV/6, extracted from the
appraisal, shows the intended function of the two institutions. In practice, it
appears that often regional centres were involved directly in adult training
activities while provincial centres tended to ignore the guiding role of the regional
centres. According to the comments of the NFED on the draft version of this
report, the above-cited problems belong to the past. However, the Department
agrees "that there is a need to delineate further the role of the two types of
centres, to strengthen the quality of staff and equipment and to find ways to
achieve closer working relations".



-26-
4.39   Shortcomings in the functioning of :he regional and provincial centres
identified by the mission with the assistance of NFED officials include: (i)
weaknesses in key staff of some of the regional centres creating difficulties in
grasping the importance of the guiding role of their institutions; (ii) regional
centres appear over-staffed for their principle role, especially in terms of teachers
and instructors. Side activities help keep their staff occupied; (iii) regional centres
are over-equipped in terms of conventional workshops and under-equipped in terms
of teaching aids production facilities. As adult educators are not trained for skills,
the need for conventional workshops is minimal. On the other hand, printing
facilities are inadequate and there is no multi-purpose workshop where teachers
can practice in the production of their own improvised aids and equipment; and (iv)
the provincial centres are not linked adminstratively to the regional centres; as a
result, the former tend to ignore their existence.
4.40   In order to solve the physical facilities problem, the NFED started
converting some of the conventional workshops into workshops and laboratories for
the development of teaching materials and into seminar rooms and offices. In
addition, the Department "plans to develop, in the near future, the regional centres
into sub-centres for information and data systems, as well as assigning them with
the responsibility for reviewing the provincial plans arkd their implementation"1/.
This, if properly implemented, would elevate the status of the regional centres into
that originally intended by the project. In the view of the report which, in the
overall, is in line with that of the NFED, further action in the area of coordinating
the functions of the regional and provincial centres should be based on the results
of a thorough study of the actual situation and should involve: clear delineation of
the role of each institution; enlightenment of key personnel of both institutions
through conferences and study tours; possible changes in the overall administration
mechanism and the staffing and equipping of the regional centres. Project Vll now
under consideration, provides a good opportunity for studying and launching the
appropriate changes.
Limited Coverage and Inadapted Pro2rammes and Premises
4.41   Despite the multitude of agencies involved in non-formal education
activities and the impressive progress in the number of participants in major
programmes achieved by the NFED through the project, the population reached
constitutes only a small proportion of the target population. As an example, in the
1970 Census, over four million people were found to be illiterate. Within 1971 and
1980, only some 124,000 of these were reached; if the target of the Fifth Plan to
reduce illiteracy from 14.5 per cent in 1981 to 10.5 per cent in 1986 is to be
achieved, literacy programmes should be enormously expanded and, possibly, the
whole approach should be revised.
4.42   Although definite attempts are being made, particularly by the NFED, to
penetrate the rural areas, the majority of the non-formal programmes offered by
the several agencies are still confined to municipalities and are, to a large extent,
inaccessible to the rural masses. A survey on non-formal education programmes
carried out by the NFED in 1980, claims that over 70 per cent of the Government's
non-formal education programmes are organized on a nationawide basis and some
56 percent of them are addressed to the general public.  This greatly hampers
aEtempts to reach specific target groups and to provide for specific local needs
which are among the main objectives of the non-formal education strategy. On the
other hand, while the population reached constitutes a small number of the
total target, a ?Tational Education Commission analysis of participant pro-
files indicates that the programs do reach rural and educationally disad-
vantaged persons.

-27-
4.43   The programmes of the provincial centres do reach the rural masses but
there is still much to be desired; a large number of provinces are without centres
and there are budgeting, equipment and staff limitations hampering a massive
expansion of the rural programmes; also, many courses are not designed for the
rural peoplel'. In addition, the structure and nature of the facilities provided by
the project, encourage "in-centre" activities which attract mainly urban and sub-
urban populations who have access, anyway, to a number of similar training
programmes. It should be noted that originally the provincial centres were
designed to serve urban and sub-urban areas as well. However, subsequent
Governments' policy to expand the polytechnics and to introduce the Area
Vocational Centres diminished the importance of the role of the provincial centres
in this respect.
4.44   Linked to the problem of reaching adequately the appropriate target
groups, is that of the nature and structure of the programmes: (i) many of the skill
development programmes deal with standard industrial skills which, at times, are
irrelevant to the needs of the rural community; (ii) iniufficient stress seems to
be placed on using locally relevant instructional materials; (iii) a dis-
proportionate program emphasis is placed on general education rather than
on skills more directly related to employability and income generation.
4.45   Efforts of the regional centres to relate the programmes to the specific
needs of the target population include assessment surveys of the needs at
provincial level; revision of the functional literacy and second choice general
education curricula; introduction of the modular approach in skill training; and
production of printed material, radio programmes and educational slides and tapes.
4.46   The efforts of the NFED in this respect are hampered by: (i) difficulties in
identifying specific needs at community level and/or translating such needs into
concrete programmes; (ii) the qualifications of the staff available. Staff are
usually trained in traditional skills and teaching techniques. It is difficult to secure
the services of competent staff with the flexible and imaginative approach
necessary for this particular purpose; and (iii) the nature of the facilities provided
(paragraph 4.43). Staff finds it easier to work in the centre with the facilities
available than to organize courses in the field. An outstanding example to combat
this attitude is that of -he management of the Nakhon Sawan Centre who
convinced its permanent staff to work exclusively in field activities using part-
time staff for "in-centre" ones. However, it should be borne in mind that reduced
"in-centre" activities would result to under-utilization of the installed capacity,
which is already happening and the Department is being accused of this.
4.47   All the above-cited shortcomings are not unknown to the NFED as can be
concluded from the 1983 Sector Survey Reporti/ and the Project '!11 preparation
document which reflects the official position of the Department in this respect.
The proposal irf Project VII to establish provincial centres in all provinces and to
i/    In a centre visited by the mission, the main clientele for home economics
courses were wives of Government employees in the province.

support their activities by providing simple infrastructure at the district level,
answers the limited coverage problems, enhances the capacity of the Department
to reach the rural masses and facilitates the response to specific needs at
community level. The simplified structure proposed for the accommodationh' of
the new centres, supplemented by the attachment of light mobile units, places the
accent on field activities thus further supporting the coverage of rural areas and
limiting the possibility of duplication in "in-centre" skill development activities.
With regard to the existing provincial centres, consideration should be given to
establishing ciose collaboration with specialized vocational training agencies (e.g.
Vocational Education Department and National Institute for Skill Development) in
utilizing fully the available capacity.
The Technical Assistance Impact
4.48   The Technical Assistance foreseen at Appraisal for the Adult Education
Component included: (i) 468 man/months of fellowships for 46 Dersons (four for
Ph.D., eight for Master Degrees and 34 for short training); (ii) 108 man/months of
foreign expert services in seven areas (project technical consultant, radio-
correspondence, correspondence education training, materials production training,
curricula development training, research and evaluation and programmes materials
training); and (iii) 840 man/months of local expert-services (staff training, course
development and research and evaluation).
4.49   A private organization the "World Education Inc." was hired to provide the
foreign expert services necessary and to place the recipients of fellowships for
Study. The World Education Inc. has been working with the Adult Education
Division since 1971 on programme development.  Its services proved fully
satisfactory.
FellowshiPs
4.50   Although the long-term  degree fellowship programme has certainly
contributed to the promotion of Adult Education, there are doubts as to its overall
effectiveness in this particular case. Selecti3n criteria set by the Teachers'
Council focused on English language ability and written examination skills which
precluded most of the experienced staff of the Adult Education Division. All
trained personnel (12) were placed at the regional centres upon corrpletion of their
studies, which was the original purpose of the exercise. At present. there are only
four in one of the regional centres. Out of the rest, three work in the NFED in
Bangkok, three continue their studies and two have left the Ministry of Education.
Expert Services
4.51   Foreign expert services were provided in 11 areas, instead of the seven
requested, to cover urgent unforeseen needs in the Project Office (paragraph 2.6).
The total man/months provided were 129 as against the 108 foreseen at the
Appraisal. There were no additional costs, as the World Education Inc. secured free
services through the British Council, Colombo Plan (24 man/months) and other
bilateral sources.
1/    These  include:   administration  building, multi-purpose  hall, work
preparation place for 15 instructors, storage for the mobile equipment,
garage for the transport units and maintenance workshop for the mobile
units and equipment. Total surface: 880 square meters.



-29-
4.52   Local expert services also had the expected impact. There were nine long-
term experts hired for a total of some 430 man/months and several short-tern-, nes
for a total of 410 man/months.
Evaluation Surveys on the Adult Education Component
4.53   In 1980, a limited evaluation survey of non-formal education programmes
was carried out by the NEC and the report was published in English in 19821/. The
survey covered only the subject of typing and sewing and focused on: (i) measuring
the skills gained by the participants in courses of different duration; (ii) identifying
variables having an effect on the achivements of the participants; (iii) investigating
whether the graduates rook up employment within six months of the end of the
course; and (iv) discussing how participants utilized the skills acquired.
4.54   The report ends with the following summary of conclusions "for sewing it
would appear that the important variables which affect the work of the centres are
teacher training, both pre- and in-service, the quality of facilities, the shif E
(morning shift performed better) and the length of the course (150 hour course
participants performed better than the 200 hour course participants and earned and
saved more). It would be unwise to comment on typing because it was impossible
to evaluate it accurately partly because so many of the participants are still
studying".
4.55  A full evaluation report a expected to be PUsblisd in Febrary 1984. 7be views Of
t.his kLcisIos on the evaluatim process are expressed in pararaph 4.27. It a  be added
that tde -prema¢re or partial evaluation as the o  untioned in pararaph 4.50 above
camot yield reliable results for the assessmen of a project.
PRIMARY EDUCATION STUDIES
4.56  Tihere were two studies on Primary Education (Study I and Study 1)
financed from the surplus funds of this project (Annex [11/4). The original idea, as
expressed in the Preparation Report for Project VI, was )o carry out a simple
practical study to help identify the needs in buildings and equipment of the
provincial primary education offices with a view to conver zing them to resource
centres to support the quality improvement effort (Project VII). After the study
was launched, the original idea was abandoned and the study took the dimension of
a fully-fledged overall research and evaluation project. As a result, a second study
(Study II) had to be launched to answer the initial questions.
4.57   Study I is divided into three parts as follows: Part I deals with enrolments
and enrolment projections. It has been undertaken by NIDA and only a draft Thai
version had been completed at the time of the completion mission; Part II is a
sample study of existing facilities and it is undertaken by the Teacher Training
Department. It has been completed but not yet published; and Part In deals with
trends and current issues and proposes guidelines for development.  It was
undertaken by the ONPEC-2. It is complete and was published in May 1983.

THAILAND FOURTHI EDUCATION PROJECT                Age 1Vf3
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REASESSING THE ROLE OF THE DIVERISED SCHOOLS
(extracted from the Sector Survey Report, January 19S3)
RATIONALIZING THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING SYSTEM
4.39   This topic involves a number of agencies and it is connected to several on-
going programmes. It is for this reason that the relevant analysis and the rationale
leading to the formulation of this proposal are found scattered under several
headings of Chapter Two (paragraphs 2.47, 2.48, 2.52 to 2.57 and 2.70 to 2.72) and
Chapter Three (paragraphs 3.27 to 3.32).
4.40   ln sum, there is a multitude of institutions offering practical courses either
as part of the diversified secondary school curriculum (diversified schools and Area
Vocational Centres - AVCs) or as preparation for a vocational occupation
(vocational schools, polytechnics, AVCs, Non-Formal Education Centres, National
Institute for Skill Development, and Community Development Centres). InadequRite
delineation of the area of responsibility of eachi institution and lack of coordinatici.
cause confusion and duplication resulting in unnecessary spending and waste in
human and financial resources.
4.41   The diagram which forms the last page of this annex, is intended mainly to
serve as a basis for discussions on this sensitive issue. It ilustrates an attempt to
rationalize the process of practical training taking into account that: () as a result
of the educational reform, the role of vocational schools and that of the diversified
schools would eventually become practically identical; (ii) only a modest
percentage of the output of the vocational schools take up jobs as skilled workers;
(iii) there is much difficulty in mobiLizing the whole school population of several
schools in order to take the cmpulsory practical part of the curriculum in nearby
AVCs; (iv) it appears to be uneconomical to equip each secondary school with
individual pract;--l facities and specialist staff to achieve diversification and; (v)
there are several advantages in training skilled and semi-skilled workers through
short intensive courses.
4.42   To simplify the presentation in the diagram, the general structure of the
diversified curriculum is shown as composed of four basic parts as follows:
Part I       Theoretical subjects            Compulsory
Part II      Science subjects                Compulsory
Part III     Work Experience                 Compulsory
Part IV      Vocational (or other) Specialization  Optional
4.43   According to the diagram, parts I and II of the curriculum would be offered
by all general secondary schools, Part III by the secondary schools with individual
practical faciities and by other institutions/means whose effectivness could prove
satisfactory as a result of the proposed experimentation (paragraphs 4.454.49) and
Part IV by specialized institutions dealing with skilled worker training such as
AVCs, polytechnics, NISD centres and restructured vocational schools (paragraph
4.50).
Experimenting with Alternative Ways for Diversification
4.44   Pursuing further the rationale of the preceding paragraphs and taking into
account that completion of diversification of secondary education is among the
principal objectives of the educational authorities, this Report suggests that, at
this stage, vigorous experimentation would be necessary if the most effective, and
at the same time, most economical ways for completing diversification were to be



- 58 -                   ANNEX IVA4
(page 2 of 3)
found. The problem lies mainly in the diversification of relatively small secondary
schools for which provision of individual facilities and full-time specialist staff
would be uneconomical (private schools also face financial problems). With the
envisaged expansion of secondary education with priority given to under-privileged
areas, the number and proportion of such schools will be increasing constantly for a
number of years to come.  The proposals that follow are intended to serve as a
basis for initiating discussions with a view to selecting the areas of
experimentation.
4.45   The AVC (Area Vocational Centres) experience Proved so far that the
latter should rather use their premises exclusively for specialized courses at skilled
and semi-skilled worker level open to both students in satellite schools who opt for
the vocational part (Part IV) of the curriculum and to out-of-school youths
(paragraph 2.26). The compulsory practical part of the curriculum (Part it) in the
satellite schools should be served by providing "educational extension services"
through: (i) attaching light mobile units to the AVCs; (ii) providing elementary
equipment to the satellite schools and using the AVC specialist staff for teaching
on a part-time basis and; (iii) combining the two above-mentioned formulae.
4.46   The proposed reconsideration of the functioning of the AVCs brings them
close to the polytechnics which, at present, offer only specialized courses open to
out-of-school youths. Broadening the scope of the polytechnics to accept students
who opt for Part IV of the curriculum and arranging for them to offer Part III of
the curriculum as well, as mentioned above, makes their role identical to that of
the AVCs and thus augments the possible inputs into the diversification effort
considerably.
4.47   Accepting that it would be practically impossible to provide each
secondary school with equipment for adequate diversification, in addition to the
AVCs and polytechnics, other inputs would be necessary if diversification is to be
completed within a reasonable time span.
4.48   To this end, a similar type of experimentation is proposed using as a base
for prcviding "extension services" large diversified schools in the place of AVCs
and polytechnics. Light mobile units could be attached to such schools to serve
several satellite schools and/or elementary equipment could be provided to serve
all the satellite schools which would be served by mobile staff from the base
school.
4.49   It should be made clear that the proposed experimental mobile units are
different from the old MTTUs (Mobile Trade Training Units) which were finally
"iimmobilized" and converted into stationary training centres (Provincial Non-
Formal Education Centres) under the Department of Non-Formal Education. They
are conceived as light transport units intended tX carry equipment for one or two
areas at a time (e.g. woodwork and audio-visual) arna spe:ialist staff to satellite
schools. Such equipment would be left with the school for a pre-determined period
of time, after which they could be exchanged with equipment for other areas (e.g.
electricity and home economics). The satellite schools will be provided with a
multi-purpose area suitable for the acommodation of the equipment on loan.
Because of the proximity of the satellite schools to the base schools and the AVCs,
the "mobile" staff would have a permanent residence which was not the case with
MTTUs.

ANNEX lV/6
THAILAND FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ADULT EDUCATION
Functions of the Re ional and Provincial Centres
(Reproduced from the Appraisal Report)
Regional Centres
Four regional centres would be established each having rtsponsibility
within their region:
(i)  to identify non-formal education target groups and their learning
needs and develop appropriate curriculum materials;
(ii)  to train adult education; and
(iii)  to provide feedback and evaluation on non-forma; eduction
activities.
Present adult education programmes suffer since these functions have been ignored
or treated in an ad hoc manner. The regional centres would design materials to
suit the specific learning needs within their regions, while the national coordinating
unit, with the support of other units of the AED, would develop these core
materials which could be used nationally. Training of personnel conducted at each
centre would be aimed ar supporting adult education services within the region.
Through the training programme, the centres would serve to coordinate non-formal
education activities within each region, and they would provide a means for regular
interaction between adult educators involved in various programmes. The fc"r
regional centres proposed are:
Lifelong (Provincial) Education Centres (LECs)
During the project period, it is proposed that 24 LECs be establish;-d in
three phases. Each LEC would:
(i)   promote education extension activities, particularly the on-going
special interest group and village reading centre programmes by
providing villagers with appropriate training and field support;
(ii)  operate a film truck to show films at villages within the changwad
(iii)  accommodate mobile units to provide skill training to villages
throughout the changwad, and offer skill training at the LEC;
(iv)  organize functional literacy and second-chance education courses at
meeting places within the changwad and at the LECs; and
(v)   house a public library and serve as a local community centre.
The specific operational programme for the LECs would be formulated by the
national coordinating unit of the AED in cooperation with the regional AECs.

ATT&CW4KNT I
(Page 2 of 7)
NFE: Coimments on the Project Completion Report of the
Fourth Education Project (Loan 1271-TH)
Introduction
The following comments are directed to specific sections of the
Completion Report that deal with the Adult Education Subproject. The relevant
sections are identified by chapter heading, subheading, and the paragraph and
page numbers.
Comments
1. Project Highlights, the Project and its Objectives, paragraph #1, p.v.
Issue
"...closed on September 6, 1984 with 26 months delay, due mainly to
the scarcity of counterpart funds and staffing problems in the adult education
project implementation subunit (paragraphs 2.1 and 2.6)."
Comment
The reasons given for the 26 month delay in the project closing date
are misLeading if not inaccurate. Moreover, the latter reascn seems to
contradict a statement made several paragraphs below (#5) that "there were no
major implementation problems," unless, of course, a 26 month delay in project
closing is not considered `major." Finally, it does not appear to be
supported by the data found in "Annex II/I, Project Implementation Schedule
Appraisal and Actual." This data indicates that, if the project closing date
is 12 months after the project completion date and if AED construction and
procurement were the delaying factors, the project could have closed at the
end of the first quarter of calendar 1983, 9 monLhs later than the date set in
the Appraisal. If AED fellowships, not even mentioned here, are taken into
account, the project could have closed with a dela;7 of 15 months.
While not denying that the scarcity of counterpart funding and
"changes in functions in" or, as used later in the report, "the decentraliza-
tion of the adult education project implementation subunit" contributed to
some delays, they were certainly not the main reasons or the only main reasons
why the closing date was delayed so long. Other critical factors were related
to the request by the Ministry of Education, approved by the Bank, to use some
portion of the project's leftover funds for matters not covered in the
original agreement. These matters are referred to in the Completion Report as
"additional" or "other" project items (cif. p. 7 and Annex III/4). As the
report itself indicates, several of these "additional items" were not
initiated until after the original closing date and all but one were not
completed until 6 to 15 months after it (clf. Annex III/4).
2. Project Highlights, The Implementation Process, paragraph 6, p. vi.



- 65 -
ACMENT I
(Page 3 of 7)
Issue
"...the centralized pattern of the secondary education subunit has
definite advantages over the decentralized one of the adult education sub-
unit..."
Comment
It is understood that the intention here is to emphasize the import-
ance of the "competence and degree of involvement of the ranking administra-
tive officials and technical staff of the (implementation) unit." However, it
is unfortunate that at no place in the report are the gains achieved by and
potential benefits of the "decentralized pattern" discussed. There are
several key NFED personnel who were involved throughout the project who feel
that there are several advantages in the decentralization pattern such as
closer coordination between project and nonproject components, smoother
transfer of work after project completion to regular operating units and
opportunity to upgrade staff in all sections of the Department rather than in
the project unit alone. Discussion of issues such as the centralized vs.
decentralized implementation subunit concepts would make the Report more
valuable to future projects.
3. Project Highlights, Technical Assistance, paragraph 12, vii.
Issue
" ...the initial selection criteria for the adult education comr-
ponent...could have helped to keep the trained persons longer at their posts
(eight of the twelve had left their posts in the regional centers for which
they were trained) or perhaps short-term practically oriented studies couild
have yielded better results than degree fellowships (as in the case of the
four month fellowships for the DSSs)."
Comments
The initial criteria may have !Lad some advantages, but the best may
have been a combination of the two, i.e., the initial criteria for the
doctoral fellowships and the revised criteria for the MAs (to secure some
"fresh blood"). In any case there is no strong indication that grantees who
had previously worked in adult education were less likely to request transfers
out of the regional centers than those who had not. Moreover, the reasons for
such requests vere personal (generally family hardships, frustrated idealism,
and stifled ambition due to the inequities perceived by younger staff between
opportunities for advancement in civil service Department positions vis-avis
teacher service regionaL center positions).
This highlight's use of numbers is misleading. While it is true
that at present only 4 grantees are working in the regional centers, the 3 who
are pursuing doctoral studies have worked at and still hold regional center
positions and are expected to return to them upon completion of their studies.



- 66 -                             ATTAMUMT I
(Page 4 of 7)
It is unjustified to conclude, even with the use of the modifier
"perhaps," that short-term, practically oriented studies could have yielded
better results than the degree fellowships. For those who are familiar with
the development of the regional nonformal education centers and the Department
of Nonformal Education, it is clearly evident that the graduates from the
degree fellowships have contributed significantly to the technical competency
of the system. With no exception, they have been key figures in the develop-
ment of research and evaluation, training material development and the radio
correspondence project.
4. CHAPTER 1 - PROJECT BACKGROUND, Statistical Data/Nonformal
Education, paragraph 1.11, p. 4
Issue
Table 1.5 is a summary of the NFEM's structural "course type"
programs only and it is not clear if all such activities are included (e.g.,
short term vocational courses, rural adult training programs, etc.) and, if
so, under which program-type.
Comnent
Despite the clarification provided by the sentence which follows the
table, it would perhaps be more helpful if the table heading was changed along
the following Lines; "...Number of Participants in Structured Courses by
Program Type."
5. CHAPTER II - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, Adult Education Project
Implementation Subunit, paragraph 2.6, p. 9.
Issue
"In April 1979 the Adult Education Division was upgraded..."
Comment
The date was March 22, 1979.
6. CHAPTER IV - Attainment of Project Objectives/AduLt Education
IssuelCowment
In general, the revised draft presents a more in depth and under-
standing description of the situation. A few observations, however, must be
made on the following issues:
7.1 Nowhere in this chapter was there any mention of the NEC's
participant's profiles analysis. The analysis, carried out in response to the
suggestion by a World Bank Mission, would clearly indicate the extent to which
NFED programs are reaching the rural and educationally disadvantaged group.



-67-                             ATThU1UIENT I
(Page 5 of I7
7.2 The conclusion "not enough emphasis is placed on the importance
of using local raw materials" (paragraph 4.44) should be based on analysis of
the curriculum not on a visit to one isolated lesson.
7.3 The statement "much emphasis is given to general education
programs to the extent that they risk becoming competitive with the formal
general school programs", reflect a general lack of understanding of the
situation. SureLy the intention here is not to suggest that given equal
options many individuals would choose UFE program over the regular school pro-
gram. Even if such a situation should occur, where is the risk? Monformal
education curricula are now providing functional education with equivalency
certifications at a lower cost for both the students and the organizing
agencies. Finally, should nonformal education not provide individuals who
lack access to school programs with a viable option?

NEC: Comments on the Project Completion Report of the Fourth Education
Project (Loan 1271-TH)
4.59      The construction of classrooms and of the  Sri Saket PPERC was
completed in April 1983 with Government budget while the Pattani PPERC is
expected to be compLeted shortly. The purchase of equipment was undertaken
according to the schedule. The equipment was purchased in September 1983,
delivered to the provinces in February 1984 and handed over to school clusters
in April 1984. Sixty-five percent of the cost thereof Twas covered by the
World Bank loan. With regard to the staff development, 7 training projects
were implemented in accordance with the plan with the targeted number of
trainees. The major problem in the implementation was the shortage of operat-
ing budget of the Provincial Education Centers and the schooL clusters in
these provinces. For the evaluation of the project impact on the impro-ement
of students' achievement, NEC is now preparing the summary report on the
project evaluation which is expected to be completed at the beginning of May
1985. The necessary funds have been committed but not entirely paid as yet
(Annex III/4). Annex IV/6 presents the schedule for the study and the imple-
mentation of this pilot project.
