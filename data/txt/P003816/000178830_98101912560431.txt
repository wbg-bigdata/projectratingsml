I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Indonesian Government has long,favored increased use of
fertilizers as one of the key means of achieving increased food production.
During the 1970s, consumption of the two main foodcrops fertilizers, urea
and triple superphosphate (TSP), increased at average annual rates of 15%; in
1980, their use increased by 50% over the previous year. This sudden surge
in fertilizer use can be largely attributed to two factors: first, the fast
spread of brown planthopper-resistant rice varieties, which require
increased fertilizer application (and water) for optimum yields and permit
higher cropping intensities; and second, the much more favorable ratio
between paddy (unhusked rice) and fertilizer prices.
1.02      Indonesia is a low-cost producer of urea,/l and the Government has
authorized expansion of domestic production. New urea plants now under
construction have a combined annual capacity of over 1 million tons, and
will begin supplying domestic and export markets in 1982. Two further
plants have been approved, and should be onstream in 1984 and 1985. TSP
production is to be expanded with a new plant commencing operations in 1983.
1.03      The three producers currently operating fertilizer plants have a
1981 production capacity of 2,624,000 metric tons (mt) consisting of
1,979,000 tons of urea, 495,000 mt of TSP or di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), and
150,000 tons of ammonium sulphate (AS). These plants produced 2,462,000 tons
in 1981 and distributed their output through the existing distribution network
(paras. 3.14 and 3.16) which is now, in some parts, operating at about
capacity. Additional production facilities under construction with Government
and bilateral finance, which the proposed project will service, are: (a) one
urea unit in Aceh,/2 northern Sumatera which will come on stream in mid-1983,
owned by ASEAN, called ASEAN I, with an output capacity of about 513,000
metric tons per year (tpy) of which Indonesia is obliged to take 300,000 tpy
and may purchase the balance if the other partners do not buy it; (b) one urea
unit at Bontang, East Kalimantan owned by P.T. Pupuk Kaltimantan Timur
(KALTIM) called KALTIM I, which will come onstream in late-1982 with an output
capacity of about 513,000 tpy of urea and about 165,000 tpy of ammonia;
(c) one unit with an output capacity of 125,000 tpy of AS and about
465,000 tpy of TSP at Gresik in East Java owned by P.T. Petrokimia Gresik
(Petrokimia) which will come onstream in mid-1983 and early 1984; and
/1 "Investment and Production Costs for Fertilizer," World Bank; Fertilizer
Unit, Industrial Projects Department, June 1980, and Annex 2, B6.
/2 This unit is financed by the Association of South East Asian Nations
(ASEAN) excluding in this case Singapore, through take-or-pay
undertakings under which Indonesia has an obligation to take delivery of
60% of the plant's output.

(d) partial output, starting in 1983, of up to 400,000 tpy of urea from the
513,000 tpy PUSRI V unit known as Iskandra Muda Project, which will eventu-
ally be set-up as a separate company to be 40% owned by the largest urea
producer, P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja Indonesia (PUSRI). This unit will be
constructed in Aceh, adjacent to the ASEAN I plant. The proposed project
will provide distribution facilities for the additional output from this
capacity of 2,081,000 tons which, at the end of 1984, will bring Indonesian
total capacity to 4,705,000 tons producing about 4,568,000 tons of product.
These data for fertilizer tonnage are summarized in Table 1.1 below and
detailed in Annex 5 and include 149,000 tpy of liquid ammonia which will be
distributed to Petrokimia and to customers in the Philippines. Map IBRD
15763 shows the structure of the present fertilizer system and the location
of new plants and Figures 4 to 7 show the current and projected flows of
fertilizers.

1.04      Additional fertilizer plants with a total output of 513,000 mtpy
of urea and TSP and 149,000 mtpy of ammonia are planned to commence production
in 1985. By 1987, the rated capacity of fertilizer plants will have reached
5,850,000 tons and production is forecast to reach at least 5,500,000 tons,



-.3 -
about 1,000,000 tons above the level which this project is designed to
serve. PUSRI is preparing a request to the Government for further
assistance to secure the assets needed to distribute this additional amount.
In the meantime PUSRI has the responsibility for handling the additional
total demand of about 1.9 million tons of fertilizer to be distributed in
the period to 1985. The proposed project would expand distribution capacity
to match production capacity of domestic plants through 1984.
II. AGRICULTURE, FERTILIZERS AND TRANSPORT IN INDONESIA
A. Agriculture
(a) General
2.01      The major objectives of the Government's agricultural policies
are: (a) to create productive employment and to raise the incomes of the
rural poor; (b) to increase domestic food supply in pace with rising demand;
(c) to expand agricultural exports, particularly of smallholder tree crops;
and (d) to ensure productive, sustainable use of Indonesia's land, water and
other natural resources.
2.02      Despite rising revenues from oil exports and declines in its
relative share of national income and employment, agriculture remains of
overwhelming importance. It provides 80% of all nonoil export revenues and
employs 60% of the work force. It is the major source of income for two
thirds of rural and one tenth of urban area households.
(b)   Crops and Land Areas: Regions
2.03      For food crops, the regional distributions of land use, production
and employment reflect the traditional dominance of Java in the Indonesian
economy. Java has approximately 57% of paddy land and 69% of secondary food
crop areas. It produces 60% of the rice crop, employs 62% of the rural
agricultural labor force, and uses 77% of domestic fertilizer.
2.04      Java will continue to dominate total food crop production for many
years, although its share of the total will decline as agricultural develop-
ment in the Other Islands expands. The rehabilitation and development of
irrigation systems has concentrated heavily on Java, but now that most works
are complete, under construction or in the planning stage increased attention
will be placed on irrigation development outside Java. For example, projects
are underway to rehabilitate and extend existing irrigation systems off Java
and a number of projects are directed at the development of new projects
including some in tidal swamp areas. The Government is also launching
substantial transmigration and other land development projects for the
production of food crops. In addition, the Nucleus Estate and Smallholders
projects are stimulating agricultural development in the Other Islands.
Cropping intensity, input applications (including fertilizers) and the use of



- 4 -
modern crop varieties and farming techniques are already at a high level in
many parts of Java, but have not reached comparable levels in most of the
other islands with the important exceptions of areas such as South Sulawesi
and Bali. Overall, the proportion of sawah rice planted to modern varieties
was reported to be 57% in 1979 for the whole of Indonesia, whereas it was
estimated to be about 80% on Java. Rice yields on Java are about 45% highLer
than on the Other Islands and fertilizer use is nearly three times the rate
per hectare (ha). Although agricultural development on Java will continue to
be strong, there is a substantial potential for rapid growth in the Other
Islands which will bring with it rapid increases in the demand for fertilizer.
(c)   Rice Production and Imports
2.05      The Government has placed a high priority on increasing the
production of rice, the preferred staple crop for most Indonesians, and has
actively pursued the goal of self-sufficiency in food production since 1968.
Rice production increased by-4.5% p.a. between 1968 and 1974, almost entirely
(3.5% p.a.) /1 due to the extension of irrigated areas and higher yields
following rehabilitation of irrigation systems; the remaining production
growth is mainly attributable to improved fertilizer application. Between
1974 and 1977, however, growth in rice production slowed to 1.7% p.a.,
reflecting the combined effects of reduced fertilizer use in 1975 and 19765,
during a period of restrictions on private fertilizer trade, successive
seasons of untimely rainfall, and unprecedented attacks by pests and diseases,
principally the brown planthopper and associated viruses.
2.06      In 1978 a record rice harvest was achieved, but the poor performance
during Repelita II led to a downward revision of targets for Repelita III to a
3.5% average annual increase in rice production; 1980 was again a record year,
and preliminary crop estimates, at around 20 million tons, are close to the
target set for 1983/84. Estimates for the 1981 crop are for a record harvest
of around 22.0 million tons.
2.07      Details permitting a comprehensive analysis of the reasons for the
recent changes in production are not yet available but roughly one quarter of
the growth in rice production has been due to increases in area harvested and
three-quarters due to increases in yield. Factors which have made this
possible include a major extension in the practice of double cropping,
improved and more assured irrigation water supplies, greater use of short term
modern rice varieties, fertilizer and intensive extension service efforts.
One review of the changes/2 suggests that some farmers achieved three crops in
/1   International Rice Research Institute estimate.
/2 Peter G. Warr, The Indonesian Economy: Survey of Recent Developments,
Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, Vol. XVI, No. 3, November
1980. Mr. Warr estimates that about one-third of the rice production
increase since 1978 can be attributed to these changes in farm practices
and that about 10% of the area being double-cropped in 1978 (about
181,000 ha) on Java were triple-cropped in 1980.



1980. These changes in farm practice, and the potential for their extension,
have been used in developing forecasts of fertilizer use (Annex 3).
(d) Bank Involvement in Agriculture
2.08       Since the first irrigation project was approved in 1967, the Bank
Group's agricultural lending has rapidly expanded to include estate and
smallholder treecrops, sugar, livestock, fisheries, research, extension,
training, seeds, transmigration, and resource survey and mapping. The
Operation Evaluation Department's Sector Operations Review of Agricultural
lending in Indonesia (Report No. 2166, dated August 9, 1978) concluded that
despite deficiencies in some projects, the Bank's portfolio in Indonesian
agriculture was of "overall good quality and likely to contribute substan-
tially to increased production." Within the context of the Government's
agricultural strategy, future Bank lending is expected to focus on (i) a
diversified irrigation, flood protection, drainage and swamp reclamation
program to intensify rice cropping on Java and to extend water management to
the other islands; (ii) production of secondary crops, including second
phase projects for agricultural research, extension and seeds; (iii)
smallholder tree crop planting programs; and (iv) area development projects
aimed at watershed management to conserve soil and ensure long-term
productivity in the densely populated areas of Java, and transmigration. As
of February 1982 there were 31 Bank Group-financed agricultural projects
under supervision in Indonesia.
B. Fertilizers
(a) Application Rates, Consumption Trends and Pricing
2.09       From a slow beginning in the 1960s and early 1970s, fertilizer
consumption has increased rapidly since about 1976. For the two major
foodcrop fertilizers, urea and TSP, the average combined nutrient (nitrogen
and phosphorous-N.P.) application in 1970 was 20 kg/ha; by 1979 this had
reached 65 kg/ha, for an average 15% p.a. consumption growth. In 1980,
associated with the record rice crop fertilizer use increased by 50%.
2.10      For food crops, the average nutrient application is now around
94 kg per hectare, still below the 115 kg /1 per hectare recommended in the
farm credit program for inputs, called BIMAS "A" package, but higher than
rates in most other southeast Asian countries. The average, however, covers
a wide range of application rates with significant differences between
modern and traditional farmers, and between different types of crops. Only
those farmers using the recommended inputs, i.e., the BIMAS-INMAS modern
/1   200 kg urea and 50 kg TSP per hectare; nutrient content 46%.



- 6 -
sector rice farmers /1 on Java, Sumatera and Bali/Nusatenggara, apply
nutrients at or above the national average rate per hectare. BIMAS-INMAS
farmers cultivating wetland rice, as a group, use approximately ten times
more fertilizer per hectare than traditional farmers, and secondary foodcrop
farmers on Java 5-10 times more than farmers on the Other islands.
2.11      These variations can be mainly explained by differences in water
availability, but are also related to price incentives to use fertilizers.
Apart from Sulawesi and Bali, where rice-growing areas are close to major
fertilizer delivery ports, fertilizer prices paid by farmers are uniformly
higher off Java, whether for rice or secondary crops (Annex 5, Table 1). On
Kalimantan, the region with the lowest fertilizer use, fertilizer prices
average some 17% above the Indonesian average, and, for the traditional rice
farming sector, are some 53% above the Java average.
2.12      Nationally also, the broad trends in fertilizer use have tended to
follow price changes. Nutrient consumption for food crops increased by
about one third in 1977 following the extension of government-subsidized
prices to all farmers, leading to an effective real price decline for the
non-BIMAS farmers. More recently, in 1979 and 1980, increases in the use of
fertilizer have paralleled changes in the relative prices of fertilizers and
paddy rice which have led to a substantial increase in the farmer's return
from its use, as is shown in Table 2.1.
/1  INMAS farmers are a rather loosely defined group of farmers includinlg
those farmers not participating in the BIMAS credit program who use
modern practices. BIMAS farmers are eligible to obtain the recommended
inputs, a living allowance and credit. INMAS farmers are given access
to the inputs but without credit for their costs and no living
allowance. The Rural Bank has recently introduced a credit package for
INMAS farmers.

2.13      Prices to farmers for domestically produced fertilizers (urea,
TSP, DAP, AS and some NPK compounds) are substantially below both world
market prices and domestic production costs. Urea has a variable margin
below world prices and domestic production costs depending on whether the
natural gas feedstock is drawn from a relatively small field capable of
supplying only alternative domestic users or from a larger field, which could
justify either a number of export-oriented urea fertilizer plants or
capital-intensive liquification plants for processing LNG exports, where the
opportunity cost of the natural gas may be higher./l For other fertilizers,
domestic production costs, and economic delivered prices to farmers are
above those for imported fertilizers, principally because all raw materials
must be imported, and the domestic demand is too small to achieve economies,
either in freight or the production process itself. The pricing structure
and subsidies for fertilizer are shown in Annex 5. The current official
retail prices represent a discount from world market prices averaging US$200
per ton and for urea a discount under economic production costs of US$90 per
ton.
2.14      The Government also intervenes in retail and farm-gate markets for
rice and other food crops, to support farm incomes and control food prices.
The introduction of fertilizer subsidies can be traced to reluctance, since
/1 But Bank calculations indicate that Indonesia could earn larger net
revenues by exporting urea made from natural gas rather than exporting
liquefied gas, with gas input priced at the current well-head price for
gas now used in liquefaction plants.



- 8 -
the mid-1970s, to raise fertilizer prices in the face of slower than
anticipated rice production growth during Repelita II. Prior to the mid-
1970s, both rice and fertilizer prices hovered around the international
levels, and immediately before the 1978 devaluation were substantially above
them (Annex 5, Table 3). The subsidies were, of course, also high during
the mid-1970s, when markets were disrupted by panic buying following the
1973/74 OPEC price increases and when Indonesia imported some 2.0 million
tons of urea. The mid-1970s also saw a significant increase in the size of
the fertilizer subsidy. At this time the low (government-supported) prices
were extended to the non-BIMAS farm sectors at the beginning of the 1976/77
wet season, as a means of eliminating the black market and cross trading in
subsidized fertilizer between the subsidized farm sectors and the
unsubsidized sectors, and to ensure higher fertilizer applications.
2.15      In 1976 an official attempt was made to estimate the appropriate
incremental benefit/cost ratio between inputs and outputs for rice farmers
needed to encourage increased rice production (and hence increased
fertilizer use). This ratio (2.2:1 for BIMAS farmers) was used to set
prices for rice, fertilizer and insecticide, and to determine a buying
program to support rice prices through the Government's agency, BULOG. Ihe
attempt was not a noticeable success. Rice production continued to increase
at about 3.6% p.a. during the 1970s, and fertilizer consumption changes can
be explained by changes in its price to non-BIMAS farmers. But there is
insufficient data to analyze the reasons for the poor response in rice
production and/or to re-estimate a more appropriate ratio. Bank analysis /1
casts some doubt on the assumptions used on the incremental yields
obtainable from the BIMAS input packages. Restrictions on private trade in
fertilizer during 1976/77 when the growth of usage slowed, further
complicate any analysis of the effective prices paid by farmers or the
timeliness of its delivery.
2.16      In the last two years, farm-gate and retail rice prices have been
allowed to move upwards, with the latest farm-gate price increase in early
1982 calculated to maintain 1976 purchasing power to farmers (measured
against price indices for nine major commodities).  Fertilizer prices of
Rp 70 kg for urea and TSP have not changed, and the present rice prices
provide considerable incentive to use fertilizer, particularly for the fast-
spreading brown planthopper-resistant varieties.
2.17      A minor part of the fertilizer subsidy (around US$2.50 per ton)
can be traced to the transport fuel subsidy which affects all goods and
passenger transport in Indonesia. Despite retail gasoline and diesel fuel
price increases in 1979 and in 1980 and a further 66% increase in the diesel
/1 For example, Indonesia, A Review of the Support Services for Food Crop
Production, Annex 2, Report No. 2060a-IND, December 11, 1978.



-9-
retail price in January 1982, the current diesel fuel price of Rp 85 litre
is still below the world price (fob Singapore) of Rp 175 litre.  During the
latest full year for which data is available government payments of
Rp 136 billion were needed to cover the difference between production costs
and sales revenues for transport sector fuel consumption; of this fertilizer
transport accounts for Rp 4 billion. About 1% or around Rp 150 million per
year of the railway deficit is attributable to fertilizer transport.
2.18      The Government's direct subsidy payments for fertilizer are
arranged so that incentives for efficient production and distribution are
generally maintained. The payments are made through government purchases of
factory output at prices providing an adequate financial return on plant.
Fertilizer is then resold to PUSRI for distribution at prices low enough to
provide adequate returns to distribution activities. However, there are two
indirect effects of the pricing strategy which affect supply. First, gas
producers are not compensated for the low prices at which they must sell gas
to urea plants and they have, in the last few years, not supplied PUSRI with
contracted volumes, resulting in variable production at Palembang. Second,
while distribution between PUSRI's inland storage depots (ISDs) and villages
on Java is competitive, and retail prices are often below the official
prices, smaller volumes and less developed transport systems in more remote
regions mean that transport costs in some of these areas are above the
margin allowed in the pricing structure. Provision is made for compensation
of these extra costs so that prices to farmers need not be increased, but
the procedures are reportedly cumbersome and time-consuming. As a result,
either farmers in remote areas pay more than the official Rp 70/kg (reported
in spot checks at up to Rp 100 per kg) for urea and TSP, or distributors are
unwilling to deliver fertilizer at all.
2.19      Although the proportion of total fertilizer consumption affected is
small, the impact is felt in important growth sectors of smallholder estate
development, irrigated and dryland food crop production in the Outer Islands.
Detailed assessment of the effects of low prices is made difficult because
data are not collected separately on fertilizer use for different food crops;
all recent projections of such consumption rely on the National Fertilizer
Study of 1972, financed under Credit 193.
(b) Pricing Strategies
2.20      The Bank has begun a dialogue with the Government on pricing
strategies, subsidies and marketing interventions in the Indonesian economy.
Discussions of fertilizer pricing cut across various sectoral, social and
economic interests. For example, natural gas prices have an important
effect on various industrial activities other than the fertilizer industry.
In addition, fertilizer prices can not be set independently of rice prices.
Analysis currently available does not provide an adequate basis for firm
recommendations on changes in the current fertilizer and rice pricing



10 -
policies. Nevertheless, it is important that these issues be addressed at
earliest opportunity. The widening gap between rice and fertilizer prices
obviously stimulated an increase in fertilizer use for the rice production
although there is some evidence that at the margin, application rates by some
farmers may be uneconomic. Therefore questions have been raised as to
whether the rice/fertilizer 'price rates should be increased further, or
whether it needs to be as high as it is now.  Answers to these questions
involve considerable analysis and, as noted above, a consideration of
Indonesia energy policy as a whole. Analysis of fertilizer and rice price
policy is underway as part of the Food Crops Sector Study to be completedl in
FY82, and a joint UNDP/Bank mission visited Indonesia in early 1981 and
prepared a comprehensive energy sector review which focussed on energy
pricing among other issues./l In addition the marketing study to be financed
under the project will include an assessment of fertilizer supply and dermand
as part of its Terms of Reference, and thus will inevitably include cons:Lder-
ation of subsidies.
2.21      The other issues on fertilizer pricing, availability and
application rates, require more detailed study. To get a better
understanding of retail level distribution activities, demand levels, and
constraints, PUSRI plans to appoint market intelligence officers, trained at
technician level in extension work or agronomy, to each of their regionaL
marketing offices. About 44 such staff are planned, of which 20 have
already been employed. These appointments would lead to a gradual
improvement in the allocation system underlying the distribution of
fertilizer to different regions, and will assist by identifying actual and
potential bottlenecks at the retail level. It has also been agreed that the
project will include a revision of the 1972 Fertilizer Study, particularly
covering PUSRI's wider distribution responsibilities. Terms of Reference
for the study, estimated to cost about US$200,000 and to be undertaken by
the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) will be agreed with
the Bank shortly, with the objective of completing it by June 1983 (paras.
3.10 and 4.20).
(c) Forecasts of Fertilizer Use
2.22      The project was designed by PUSRI to meet the Department of Agri-
culture's broad forecast that overall fertilizer consumption in Indonesia
would grow by around 12% p.a. until at least 1985. However, with marked
differences in their relative agricultural development potential, it is
likely that growth patterns will be different for Java and the other
islands, and for rice crop and other crops use. Forecasts developed for the
appraisal have principally focused on the extent of these growth differen-
tials, so that a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely regional
patterns of fertilizer use in the mid-1980s.
/1 Report No. 3543-IND, "Indonesia Issues and Options in the Energy Sector,"
November 1981.



- 11 -
2.23      Forecasts for fertilizer use on rice were made in two ways.  The
first, using the Bank analysis and projections on land and cropping poten-
tial made in early 1979,/l forecasts of fertilizer consumption for rice
growing by for rice growing applying standard application rates.  The
second, based on Warr's/2 estimates of the extent and potential of changes
in rice farming methods in 1980, estimates growth in fertilizer use on rice
crops from the potential new rice production. Both methods indicate much
faster growth 27-30% p.a. - off Java, although the Java forecast differs
since the 1979 analysis does not take account of potential triple cropping.
The forecast adopted for the analysis shows an average growth in food crop
fertilizer use arising from increased rice applications of 12% p.a., with a
growth of 7% p.a. on Java and 27% p.a. on the other islands. For urea the
main area of consumption is East Java which used 640,000 tons, or 43% of
Java consumption, in 1980. Urea consumption in East Java is forecast to
increase to 880,000 tons by 1984 and to 1,100,000 tons by 1987 (Annex 3,
Table 1).
2.24      Forecasts for upland rice and secondary foodcrops are based on the
1979 projections of potential cropping area and recommended fertilizer
application rates. Forecasts for estate crops are based on projections of
past trends in application rates per hectare and planned area expansions,
modified by known requirements for estate rehabilitation or extension
projects. Details of the forecasts are given in Annex 3, and the results
are summarized in Table 2.2.

(d)  Projected Demand and Supply Balance and Export Prospects
2.25      The projected balance between planned production, domestic demand,
inventories and foreign trade for domestically produced fertilizers and
excess ammonia to be available from the urea plant at Bontang is shown in
Annex 5, Table 4.
2.26      Since Indonesian urea plants produce at less than projected world
prices, and could continue to do so even if natural gas feedstock prices
were raised to the levels paid by liquid natural gas exporters, it is
expected that all production in excess of domestic consumption and stocks
requirement will be exported. The demand for fertilizer imports in all Far
East /1 countries currently is large being more than 3 million tons of
nitrogen, equivalent to the production of about 10 nitrogen plants. Between
1986-91
/1 Includes all developing and centrally planned economies from Pakistan
eastward (Annex 2, B6).



- 13 -
demand in the Far East will rise by about 4 million tons, equivalent to an
additional 12 nitrogen plants. So far, plans have been announced for four
new plants to come on stream in the Near East; one in Malaysia, one in
Thailand and four in Indonesia. Taking into account the potential for both
acquiring existing markets as the present suppliers become less competitive
and also to gain new markets as demand in the region increases, the
prospects for Indonesia as a major fertilizer exporter in the Far East are
excellent. Oceania also offers a further market and possibly in the future
so does the West Coast of the USA.
2.27      The Indonesia Fertilizer Industry has demonstrated that it can
operate its plants at a high utilization and efficiency and with relatively
low cost feedstock; it is one of the cheapest producers in the world.
Indonesia already has a major investment program for expanding fertilizer
capacity and supporting infrastructure to meet domestic needs. An extension
of this program to develop the ability to satisfy an export market is under
consideration but would require careful planning of investments for both
capacity and distribution facilities. It would also be necessary to ensure
that such plans were compatible with meeting optimum domestic needs.
2.28      The Bank's mixed integer programming model for fertilizer is being
updated and applied to the Southeast Asia Region. It will be used to
determine the optimal location, timing and technology of new nitrogen
capacity and the optimum distribution patterns to satisfy domestic and
export markets. The Government of Indonesia will be advised of the results
of this study and arrangements will be made to instruct representatives from
the Indonesian Fertilizer Industry in the operation and use of the Model.
Thereafter it is intended that the model be transferred to Indonesia
where it can be used as an analytical tool for both operational and
investment planning. The projected exports may begin in 1982, when the new
plant at Bontang begins producing. Exports from the ASEAN plant, where
Indonesia's partners have first option on 40% of production, will begin in
1983.
2.29      The other major export will be excess ammonia produced by the
unbalanced urea plant being constructed at Bontang. Some of the excess will
be used in the plant at Gresik to produce DAP and AS; the remainder will
mostly go to the Philippines. PUSRI is now investigating this market and
has provided assurances about the disposal of excess ammonia (para. 4.14).
Exports would begin in 1984 with an exportable surplus of 111,000 tons,
increasing to around 250,000 tons in following years if the planned 1985
expansion of the KALTDM II plant near Bontang is also unbalanced.
2.30      For TSP, DAP and NPK compounds, Indonesian production costs are
higher than world prices. It is intended that production will serve only
the domestic users, and that surpluses will not be produced for export.



- 14 -
imports of these fertilizers would continue through 1982, after which
domestic production capacity will be sufficient. Imports will continue to
be needed to supplement domestic production of AS until 1985.
(e)  Bank Involvement in Fertilizer Production
2.31      The Bank Group has made three credits and loans to the Government,
totalling US$220 million equivalent, for the expansion of urea production at
the PUSRI complex at Palembang, South Sumatera./L Two of these operatiorns
have been cofinanced; one with the Asian Development Bank, the United
States Agency for International Development, and the Japanese Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund, and one with the Saudi Fund for Economic
Development. Total project financing related to Bank Group operations
totals US$406.6 million equivalent and has created one of the world's
largest urea production complexes.
2.32      Experience with these loans has been remarkably successful because
PUSRI management adopted modern project management techniques and emphas:Lzed
training of its personnel and delegation of authority. This has resulted in
rapid completion of Bank-financed projects and in PUSRI's supplying
management and operator training for all new and currently proposed urea
producers in Indonesia. Further details related to PUSRI's operations are
to be found in Chapters III and VI and in Annex 2, CIO.
C. Transportation
(a) General
2.33      Given the size of the Indonesian archipelago, the development of
an extensive and efficient transportation system is especially important to
the growth of a modern economy based on regional specialization and a large
national market. The rapid growth of the national economy over the past
decade has placed a heavy burden on the transport sector. Total transport
demand is estimated to have grown about 12% p.a. during the 1970s. It is
estimated that for each 1% increase in national GDP, transport demand
increases by about 1.7%. Thus, there is a pressing need to improve the
productivity of the existing transport system and to invest efficiently in
its expansion. This project will deal with the specific problems of the
fertilizer distribution system and is intended to ensure efficient utili-
zation of ships, port installations and railways within that system.

- 15 -
2.34      During Repelita I (1969-74) and Repelita II (1974-79), 15% to 16%
of the government budget was allocated to the transport sector. Throughout
the first two planning periods, emphasis was placed on rehabilitation of the
existing transportation infrastructure rather than new construction and more
than half of government expenditure was allocated to highway and road
development. The development budget for the transport sector during
Repelita III (1979-84) amounts to about Rp 2,998 billion (US$34.79 billion)
or 14% of the total plan budget and is divided as follows: 57% for road
infrastructure and the road transport industry; 8% for railways; 18% for sea
transport infrastructure and the domestic shipping industry; 15% for air
transport; and 2% for inland water transport.
(b) Problems in the Development of the Transport System
2.35      Despite increased budget allocations and private investments the
transport system's ability to meet growing demand for its services remains
inadequate. The country's enormous dimensions and the uneven distribution
of population and income make it extremely difficult and expensive for the
Government to pursue a transport sector strategy which both responds to the
rapidly increasing transport demands in the more advanced segments of the
economy and seeks to improve transport services to those more isolated seg-
ments which have not yet benefitted much from national development. In its
efforts to improve transport sector performance, the Government has con-
tended with a regulatory system which causes distortions in the demand for
transport and creates a considerable drain on public financial resources,
inefficient utilization of existing transport resources due to poor mainte-
nance and low-productivity operations, and uncoordinated and fragmented
arrangements for transport development planning and transport system manage-
ment.
2.36      The Government guides the development of the transport sector
through its investments in infrastructure; its policies on pricing,
subsidies, and taxation; its regulation of private firms; and its ownership
of the railway and a large part of the domestic ship, airline, and bus
companies. The three GOI agencies most responsible for the development of
the sector are the Ministry of Communications (MOC), which plans, regulates,
and controls all aspects of the sector except roads and highways; the
Ministry of Public Works (MPW), which is responsible for the planning,
construction, and maintenance of the highway and road subsector; and the
National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), which reviews sector development plans
and prepares jointly with the Ministry of Finance the development budget.
2.37      Railways.  The railway system was constructed before independence
and comprises about 6,800 route-km, of which about 70% is on Java. The
railway infrastructure deteriorated over the postwar years and carried
diminishing amounts of traffic. A rehabilitation program was started in the



- 16 -
1975-79 period with Bank assistance but was slow to be completed. Poor
accounting and management records, weak administration, poor infrastructure
and serious management problems were responsible for the decline in
passenger and freight traffic during the 1970s, and still are problems but
traffic is increasing due to growth in long-haul traffic. A large
investment program and continued emphasis on proper management and planning
will continue to be needed if the railway is to cope successfully with the
expected increased traffic.
2.38      Domestic Shipping and Ports.  Shipping is the major mode of
interisland transport for both passengers and freight. Domestic marine dry
cargo traffic has increased annually by over 12% since the early 1970s as
Indonesia carried out significant programs for fleet rehabilitation. Domestic
marine traffic in petroleum products and other specialized cargoes such as
fertilizer, timber, and cement has increased even more rapidly. The main
interisland shipping system is the regular liner service (RLS). It is
inefficient and contains many obsolete and poorly maintained ships which spend
too much time in ports which themselves are inefficient. However, petroleum
and bulk shipping, particularly fertilizer shipping, is much more efficient.
Major improvements have been made, with Bank assistance, in the main port of
Tanjung Priok at Jakarta, as well as at some secondary ports. A subsidized
system of pioneer shipping services to remote areas was initiated in 1974 and
has been progressively expanded. The Bank has assisted in the improvement of
the RLS system and is preparing an integrated maritime project to deal with
some of the problems noted above.
2.39      Other.  Road transport is the principal mode.  In the mid-1970s
about 93% of all goods and 99% of all passengers in Indonesia used road
transportation. Domestic air transport of passengers is gaining at about
22% p.a. and air cargo at close to 100% but still accounts for a small part of
total interisland transport where 95% of freight and 75% of person trips are
made by sea.
(c)   Previous Bank Assistance in Transport Sector Development
2.40      The Bank Group initiated its lending program in the Indonesia
transport sector in 1969 with its first highway credit. Since then there
have been seven credits/loans for highway development. All of these projects
included technical assistance and other support to strengthen the
Directorate General of Highways (DGH) and to study transport policy issues.
There have been two lending operations for the shipping sector designed to
rehabilitate and expand the interisland shipping fleet, and one project for
the development of the country's largest port, Tanjung Priok. A railway
project initiated in 1975 sought to rehabilitate track, rehabilitate and
acquire locomotives and rolling stock, and to strengthen the performance of
the state railway, PJKA. Finally, there has been one loan for developing
the capacity to distribute fertilizer output from newly constructed domestic
plants. Total Bank assistance in the sector has mounted so far to

US$546 million, which represents about 17% of the Bank's lending program in
Indonesia through the end of FY80. Major conclusions of the Project
Performance Audit Reports are given in Annex 1.
III. NATIONAL FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
A. General
3.01      In the Indonesian context fertilizer marketing refers mainly to
the functions of market identification; planning and administration of the
movement of fertilizer to meet demands; reporting on crop production and
other developments; proposing and administering the extent and type of
agricultural credit programs; undertaking promotion of proper fertilizer
use; and research related to fertilizer. Distribution includes the securing
and operational management of assets needed to fulfil the marketing function
and to provide the farmer with appropriate amounts of fertilizer at the
right time. Both of these functions, and responsibility for exports, have
been assigned to PUSRI, the organization with the most experience and
success in fertilizer marketing and distribution./l
3.02      The scope of domestic fertilizer marketing and distribution
extends from the producing plant, called Line I, to the bulk storage shed or
bagging station (Line II), through inland storage depots (ISDs) (or Line III)
to the village kiosk operated by retailers or cooperatives, (Line IV).
Between these points there is a complex movement of product, in bags or in
bulk, by sea or railway or truck to either bulk reception and bagging
stations (UPP) or to ISDs. Figure 8 depicts the flow of fertilizer at the
various stages of distribution. Most of the fertilizer is sent in bulk, by
sea or railway or truck to either bulk reception and bagging stations called
UPP, Line II, or to ISDs (Line III, Figure 8). Most of the facilities
involved in the movement of domestically produced fertilizer are owned by
PUSRI or are, like the railway, utilized by PUSRI. Imported fertilizer is
moved initially through regular port facilities, acquired by PUSRI, and then
inserted into the normal fertilizer marketing and distribution channels.l2
In the face of seasonal variations in usage and the need for adequate
storage, PUSRI can rent private or government-owned warehouse space in

1981.

have been exported from UPP located on deep water.

addition to using its own.  As some fertilizer is sent direct by sea from
Line I to Line III, and as some may move in bulk to a UPP and, after
bagging, be forwarded to other UPPs or ports by ship, the total movement is
complex and requires constant administration and adjustment of plans.
B. Marketing
(a) PUSRI - The Company and Its Marketing Organization
(i) Background
3.03      PUSRI, Indonesia's first fertilizer company, was established as a
government-owned company in Palembang in 1959 to manufacture urea from gas
which had previously been flared. The initial small plant, PUSRI I, went
onstream in 1964 and quickly achieved capacity operations - 100,000 mtpy of
urea. Subsequent expansion of output to PUSRI-s current rated capacity of
1.6 million tons of urea at Palembang has been assisted by the Association
and the Bank (para. 2.31).
3.04      PUSRI's excellent record of high capacity operations, its effective
staff development program, and its growing expertise in marketing its owm
and imported fertilizers have made it the key Indonesian organization in the
marketing and production of fertilizers. Executives trained at PUSRI are
currently operating most of the country's other fertilizer production units.
This unique position in the industry and PUSRI:s marketing abilities made it
a logical choice for undertaking the marketing of all fertilizers in
Indonesia when the Government faced the problem of how to market a growing
output of fertilizers produced at different prices by different companies.
The National Fertilizer and Pesticides Distribution Study, carried out with
Bank finance under the First Fertilizer Distribution Project (Loan 1139-IND;
US$68.0 million), recommended that a single fertilizer marketing organiza-
tion be established. The Government agreed with this recommendation and
appointed PUSRI to be the sole marketing agent for fertilizers in Indonesia.
3.05      Prior to this appointment there were only three companies producing
mainly urea and TSP. There were also a number of government fertilizer
importers and government and private fertilizer distributors. PUSRI sold
imported fertilizers allocated to it as well as its own output. Because
domestic and import prices differed, sometimes greatly, the Government first
bought all imported fertilizer and the output of PUSRI, Kujang and Petrokimia
at the factory gate, then resold it to both government and private distri-
butors, including PUSRI. This arrangement led to many problems which the
Government tried to overcome by controlling margins at every part of the
distribution process. This led to delays in payments by farmers for
fertilizer purchases, causing financial problems for distributors and



- 19 -
producers, and a proliferation of pricing and credit regulations. All of
these problems have been resolved by the series of actions taken by the
Government in 1980 to restructure fertilizer distribution in Indonesia.
(ii) Organization and Management
3.06      PUSRI is generally considered to be one of Indonesia's best
managed large industrial enterprises. Whenever necessary, it has relied on
expert technical assistance from foreign advisers and consultants. At the
same time it has developed its own staff to take key responsibilities.
Today, the Government seeks its advice on all aspects of fertilizer industry
development in Indonesia including the project management and initial
operational responsibility for the urea producer under construction in Aceh,
financed by the Association of South East Asia Nations (ASEAN). A PUSRI
joint venture with the Japanese company, UNICO, is carrying out fertilizer
marketing studies for Malaysia in connection with the construction of a new
urea production unit in that country. The company, through a joint venture
with M.W. Kellogg Inc. (P.T. Kelsri), also trains foreign fertilizer plant
operators in its facilities, undertakes procurement for all Kellogg
designed plants in Asia, and is assisting in the construction of two urea
plants in North Sumatera, PUSRI V and ASEAN I (para. 1.03) and in the
proposed project (para. 4.18). The company's subsidiary in Houston, Texas,
procures all parts and chemicals for its plants.
3.07      The management structure of PUSRI, in keeping with Indonesia's
company law, is patterned after the European two-tier model, with a super-
vising Board of Commissioners (Dewan Komisaris) and a Management Board
(Direksi). Members of the Board of Commissioners include: (a) the Director
General of Monetary Affairs (Ministry of Finance); (b) Secretary General
(Department of Industries); (c) a representative of the Minister of
Agriculture; and (d) the Director General of Chemical Industries. Managerial
authority for PUSRI's day-to-day operations rests with a six-man Management
Board, consisting of the President-Director and Directors of Production,
Technology, Finance, Development, and Marketing. Members of the Management
Board, as in the case of the Board of Commissioners, are appointed by the
Government. In January 1981 a new President-Director was appointed for a
five-year term. At the same time, the technical, financial, and marketing
directors who had been with the company in those positions for the past five
years, were reappointed for further five-year terms. New director positions
for production and development were created and experienced PUSRI executives
were appointed. The company, thus, moves into a period of further expansion
of its output and greater marketing responsibilities with an experienced
management team. An organizational chart of the company's marketing and
distribution departments is given in Figures 1 and 2.



- 20 -
3.08      PURSI's Marketing Director and the Technical Director, who control
the marketing and physical distribution functions from Jakarta have been
with PUSRI for about 10 years as senior managers. The marketing department
staff administer 836 marketing and distribution personnel throughout the
country linked to head office by telex and radio. The marketing activities
extend to 12 regional, 10 representative, and 9 subregional marketing
offices in all but four provinces of the country. Each regional and
representative marketing office: (a) plans and controls the supply of
fertilizer to the government-assisted fertilizer users (BIMAS) and to the
free market or non-BIMAS sectors of agriculture; (b) plans and manages the
fertilizer stocks in the region, including railway and truck transportation
and storage and supervises the physical movement of fertilizers by truck and
railway and in the company's 175 special 30-ton capacity wagons; and
(c) sells to distributors and promotes fertilizer at the village level,
using its own local and Head office agronomists, ten in number. Employment
of up to 44 marketing officers, to be added to marketing offices to provide
closer contact with the farmers (para. 2.21) is underway. The marketing
department also cooperates in and carries out research related to fertiLizer
usage, demonstration plots, and new types of fertilizer. The Marketing
Department operates 52 inland storage depots (ISDs), of which 27 are on
railway sidings,/1 and rented private storage located throughout Indonesia
(see Maps IBRD 15763 and 15764).
3.09      The PUSRI marketing group is involved in active cooperation with
research institutes, both those under the Department of Agriculture and
lhose outside Indonesia. In addition, PUSRI has experimented with sulphur
coating of urea pills in order to reduce agglomeration of crystals.
Production of this type of urea may be instituted in the near future. PUSRI
officials attend numerous conferences where the latest fertilizer practices
are discussed.
(b) The Credit System and Sales Programs
3.10      The marketing function also includes the credit system, which is
now limited to those sales related to the BIMAS program. PUSRI sales are
made only to distributors, including a few village cooperatives or Koperasi
Unit Desa (KUD) and cooperative service centers or Pusat Pelayanan Koperasi
(PPK). The credit system is based on a distributor's sales contract and
request submitted to PUSRI's Regional Marketing Office. After approval, the
distributor pays PUSRI 25% cash and provides a post-dated check for the
balance of 75%, as well as a bank guarantee or promissory note. In exchange
PUSRI gives the distributor a delivery order entitling him to draw fertilizer
from PIJSRI stocks. The distributor then delivers the fertilizer to KUDs
where farmers, who have drawn a loan from the rural bank, Bank Rakyat
/1 A further 23 ISDs with 5 on railway sidings, are currently under con-
struction and financed by PUSRI. See also Annex 6. Additional railway
wagons are being acquired (para. 3.23).



- 21 -
Indonesia (BRI), in the form of a coupon called SPPB, receive fertilizer in
exchange for the SPPB. The distributor uses the SPPB to pay PUSRI the 75%
outstanding balance. PUSRI then cashes the SPPB at the BRI. Currently only
about 50% of fertilizer sales are made through the credit system described
above.  Because of the inherent difficulties associated with a rural credit
system based on distribution of credit coupons by village officials, few
farmers who have cash seek credit.  As the cash system is so simple, and
because returns to farmers are adequate, PUSRI expects cash sales to grow
substantially within several years.  For distributors and consumers, such as
estates, which have storage capacity and could take earlier delivery of
fertilizers, there is a good case to be made for PUSRI to offer cash dis-
counts (related to the carrying cost of inventory) in order to smooth its
sales pattern and reduce its need for storage. Assurances have been received
from PUSRI that it will study methods to increase peak storage capacity,
discuss them with the Bank, and make appropriate recommendations to the
Government for any alterations of policies deemed advantageous. This study
(paras. 2.21 and 4.20) is intended to be completed by June 1983.
3.11      There is close cooperation and interaction between PUSRI and the
Directorates General concerned with production (Basic Chemical Industries),
import (Domestic Trade), and agriculture (Planning Bureau), cooperatives
(Cooperatives), finance (Directorate of Food Affairs and Nontax Revenue),
and the national rice procurement and distribution agency, BULOG. Regular
meetings are held by senior PUSRI marketing and distribution executives with
representatives of these organizations to coordinate activities, to resolve
difficulties, and to improve policies related to sales, particularly
regarding the stockpiling and pricing of rice and fertilizer, which is
finally determined by the Cabinet and the President.
C. Distribution
(a) PUSRI - Its Distribution Organization
3.12      The distribution activities consist of a bagging and shipping
division which operates four special self-unloading bulk ships, arranges for
other shipping as required, and administers six bulk reception and bagging
stations (UPP) at ports in Sumatera, Java, and Sulawesi.
3.13      During the expansion of output from 1960 to 1980 steps were taken to
build a distribution system. Shipping facilities at Palembang were enlarged,
warehouses were built in two ports and PUSRI enlarged its shore facilities.
It became apparent, with the approval of a fourth expansion a few months after
Bank approval of a loan for the third expansion, that special steps would have
to be taken to provide for a much larger movement of fertilizer from Palembang
than had been anticipated. Consultant studies, financed by the Bank, showed
that movements of the anticipated production of over 1.0 million tons per year



- 22 -
in bags from Palembang to Java was uneconomic, and a system of bulk shipments
by sea and on land was proposed. To meet these needs the Bank financed part
of the foreign exchange cost of the First Fertilizer Distribution Project
(Loan 1139-IND, US$68.0 million) in July 1978.
3.14      This project provided expanded and new bulk reception and bagging
stations at five ports, 175 special railway wagons and locomotives, four
self-unloading bulk carrier ships, and 57 inland storage depots (ISDs) /1 to
broaden the scope of PUSRI's distribution network and to form a system which
couild be expanded should the need arise. These assets were in operation by
early 1979 and materially assisted the smooth flow of fertilizers from
producers to consumers as consumption grew from 931,000 tons in 1977 to
1,785,000 tons in 1980. Late in 1980 additional efficiencies were
introduced by the successful use of block trains on a pilot basis in East,
Central, and West Java. Currently there are unfavourable trends in railway
wagon turn-around times reflecting continuing difficulties in railway
operations. Steps are included in the project (para 4.21) seeking to
improve the situation. Use of block trains on a regular basis during the
coming years is planned by PUSRI. The Project Completion Report for the
first distribution project (dated June 15, 1981) estimates the ex post rate
of return from the first Fertilizer Distribution project at 24%.
(b) The Fertilizer Transport System
3.15      The largest of the three fertilizer producers, PUSRI, located on
the Musi River at Palembang, South Sumatera, produced 1,480,000 tons of urea
in 1980. Another urea plant, P.T. Pupuk Kujang, located at Cikampek, West
Java, produced 554,000 tons and the third plant, P.T. Petrokimia Gresilk, at
Gresik in East Java, produced a mixture of triple-superphosphate (TSP),
diammonium-phosphate (DAP), ammonium sulphate (AS) and small amounts of
urea, totalling in all 655,000 tons. Of the total quantity of domestically
produced fertilizer in 1980 (2,689,000 tons), 693,000 tons moved directly to
markets by rail and road from the producing plants; the balance moved by
ship to secondary distribution centers from which it was moved by road and
rail to storage or to the farmer or to export markets (110,000 tons). About
two-thirds of the ship movement (1,134,350 tons) was by four special
self-unloading bulk carriers while the balance was shipped in bags by
coastal vessels.
3.16      The flow of fertilizer from the producer to the farmer is betst
described by PUSRI's distribution system. The majority of fertilizer is
sent to Java in bulk by special ships to the bulk reception and bagging
station (UPP) where it is unloaded, stored, and bagged. Some small amount
of PUSRI fertilizer is bagged at Palembang and shipped direct to the outer
islands and, on occasion, to export points which serve ships too large to
reach the production point. The bagged fertilizer is sent to inland storage
/1 Of which 52 were built with about the same total capacity as was pro-
vided for at appraisal.



- 23 -
depots (ISDs) from the UPP or is sold directly to distributors and groups of
cooperatives centers (PUSKUD).  Bagged fertilizer is shipped from the UPP
either by road or by rail to the 27 ISDs located on rail sidings. As the
cost of deliverv to ISDs is cheaper than truck delivery for distances of
over 100 km, PUSRI intends to ship more fertilizer by rail in the future
through the use of block trains, in cooperation with the state railway,
PJKA. Final delivery to the farmer from the ISD is by truck to retailers,
from there it is moved to the farmer by bicycle, car, motorcycle, and by
hand. In the case of producers located in Java (Kujang and Petrokimia)
initial shipment is by rail and truck to ISDs.
3.17      The equipment and facilities used to move the fertilizer from the
production point to the farmer are owned by a variety of organizations and
companies. PUSRI owns many of these assets such as ships, bulk reception
and bagging stations, inland storage depots, and some railway wagons. A
number of shipping companies move bagged fertilizer, the railway provides
facilities, wagons and locomotives to move PUSRI-owned wagons, and private
and state trucking companies transport bagged fertilizers. The distribution
department of PUSRI administers the PUSRI-owned assets and, at the request
of the marketing department, arranges ship charters for interisland
distribution of bagged fertilizer.
(c)   Bagging Capacity and Fertilizer Storage
3.18      Those fertilizer bagging facilities attached to producing plants
are normally considered to be part of the production process. In 1980 this
plant-related bagging capacity amounted to about 2.7 million tpy (Palembang
550,000, Kujang 513,000 and Petrokimia 1,650,000). In that year bagging
capacity also existed at the five PUSRI-owned bulk reception and bagging
stations, totalling 1.4 million tpy and at a private facility at Tanjung
Priok, Jakarta's harbor (0.4 million tons per year). Total capacity for
bagging fertilizer in Indonesia was therefore 4.1 million tpy as a maximum
theoretical three shift capacity. In 1980 these facilities bagged 2.6
million tons of all types of fertilizers with one UPP operating three shifts
per day. By 1985 an additional 2.0 million tpy of bagging capacity will be
constructed at new plants and at Meneng, where about half the increase will
be located.  Total bagging capacity in 1985 will therefore exceed 6.0 million
tpy at which time consumption will be 5.1 million tons. As bagging
capacity can be readily expanded at all locations except Surabaya and
Jakarta, few constraints will arise from a lack of bagging capacity.
3.19      Fertilizer storage capacity above the village level and outside
the production plant amounts to 135,500 tons of bulk and bagged storage at
UPPs, 286,000 tons of PUSRI space in existing ISDs; 107,000 tons of



- 24 -
additional ISD storage capacity under construction by PUSRI and expected to
be available in 1983; 293,100 tons of storage owned by P.T. Bandaragaraneksa
(BGR), a government warehouse company, which is to be expanded to 405,700 tons
by 1985 under a government-financed program, and 170,000 tons of private
storage. Thus, there is 749,100 tons of fertilizer storage capacity at Line
III in 1980 for a throughput of 2.4 million tons. By 1985 there will be at
least 969,000 tons of warehouse storage available at this level for an
estimated throughput of 4.3 million tons. With the growth of cement output
and rice production, other warehouse capacity will be constructed so that
the 1985 supply of warehousing may exceed that noted here. Much of any
private warehouse space can be utilized by fertilizer, which has a different
peak seasonal pattern of need than rice storage and cement use. Storage
capacity at Line III (above the village kiosk) is about adequate if the
appropriate ratio of storage to throughput is set at 1:4 as recommended by
the National Fertilizer and Pesticides Distribution Study (para. 2.19).
3.20      At the village level (Line IV) in 1980 there were 20,000 existing
kiosks, able to store a total of 600,000 tons of fertilizer. The coopera-
tive facilities construction program currently underway, financed and super-
vised by the Department of Finance, will increase this total to 1.3 million
tons in 1988 (para. 3.22). This part of the construction program will be
supplemented by another program to build 130-ton storage units at PUSKUDs
which will increase storage at Line IV by an additional 149,000 tons by
1985. P.T. Pertani, one of PUSRI's distributors, owns storage amounting to
about 450,000 tons throughout Indonesia which is not included in the above
figures. Thus the total storage at Line IV, which was 1.1 million tons in
1980 to handle a throughput of 2.5 million tons, will increase to 1.9 millicn
tons in 1985 with a throughput of 4.2 million tons. There will be virtually
no change in the present ratio of throughput to storage of 2.2 if the
construction program is completed in time; if not the ratio will rise
toward 1:4.
3.21      The distribution system between PUSRI-s line III storage (ISDs)
and village retailers at line IV on Java, which accounts for 85% of ferti-
lizer consumption, is competitive and working well. There are, however,
possible distribution problems on the other islands because: (a) fertilizer
consumption in some areas outside Java will remain low which will limit the
number of deliveries PUSRI can make in full shiploads and at reasonable
costs; (b) demand in other areas is forecast to grow rapidly, in some cases
by 30% p.a., but there is little privately-owned storage that can be drawn
into the system to cope with the surge of demand; and (c) there is some
evidence that distributors are unwilling to deliver fertilizers to remote
areas because of inadequate distribution margins and cumbersome cost
reimbursement procedures.
3.22      These issues have been recognized by PUSRI, and steps are being
taken to deal with them. Of the current PUSRI ISD expansion, half is being
constructed off Java, so that by the end of 1981, 30% of PUSRI ISD capacity



- 25 -
will be on the other islands; PUSRI has plans to expand capacity further as
required. The government warehouse company, BGR, is also expanding off-Java
storage and by 1983 will have provided a capacity of 130,000 tons.  Both of
these expansions provide long-term fertilizer storage. At the retail level,
the first phase of the new program to support the development of farmer-
cooperatives is providing storage capacity on Lombok and Nusa Tenggara.
(Tenders have been let for 179 130-ton stores and 77 30-ton kiosks.) In this
overall program to expand village storage by 710,000 tons, almost half is
planned for the outer islands. Further detail is given in Annex 2, Cll and in
Annex 6. Steps are also being taken to improve marketing and management. The
cooperative expansion program is supported by technical assistance at the
regional level in management and organization of commercial activities.
Village and regional officials determine the pace of the expansion program by
awarding construction tenders (subject to Ministry of Finance approval) based
on simplified procurement and contractor payment procedures and on the
simplified construction manual that has been prepared. PUSRI has agreed to
expand its regional marketing staff to give better market intelligence
services, which would identify potential bottlenecks early (para. 2.21). The
adequacy of distribution margins can be addressed by realigning transport
allowances between the different areas where necessary (para. 2.17). Of these
developments, only the expansion of line III storage and the improvement in
PUSRI market intelligence is necessary to ensure timely deliveries of
fertilizer. The need to expand cooperative line IV storage depends entirely
on farmers' preferences for purchasing fertilizers (and other commodities)
collectively rather than individually. Individual distributors rarely need to
have storage capacity, since they deliver directly to retailers from PUSRI
depots. Assurances have been received during negotiations that PUSRI will
review the content and recommendations of a marketing study discussed below
(para. 4.20) and recommend to the Government corrective action concerning
marketing margins by June 1983.
(d) Roads and Railways
3.23      PUSRI owns 175 railway wagons of 30-ton capacity (compared to the
12-ton wagons of PJKA) and is supplementing these by 220 additional, similar
design wagons being acquired with Canadian bilateral aid. About 200 addi-
tional similar wagons will be provided under the proposed project (para.
4.09). Current use of block trains, some with mixed wagons of PUSRI and
PJKA, to move fertilizer from UPP to 27 ISDs with rail connections has been
successful in a pilot project and has somewhat reduced wagon turnaround
time. Assuming a target of moving 1.7 million tons per year by rail in Java
in 1985 and a reasonably achievable goal of 5.8 days turnaround for PUSRI
block trains, about 535 operational railway cars would be required to move
60% of this fertilizer in block trains (see para. 5.11).
3.24      In 1980 only 18% of fertilizer transported on land moved by rail,
at a very low level of productivity. Productivity will increase with the
use of block trains. Some 606,000 tons of fertilizer (about twice as much



- 26 -
as in 1980) was scheduled to move by rail in 1981, 65% or 394,000 tons
in block trains utilizing both PUSRI and PJKA wagons. Actual performance
was 395,000 tons being shipped by block trains. As PUSRI-s wagon inventory
increases, the block train system is expected to become more efficient but,
until many more railwagons are procured and management improvements are
made, heavy reliance will continue to be placed on road movement from UPP' to
ISD. In 1980, 1.2 million tons was moved by road in Java and about 400,000
tons in Sumatera. All of the increase of 0.9 million tons in Sumatera arid
in Java fertilizer movement, will also be accommodated by road until
additional wagons arrive in 1983 (see also para. 5.10).
(e) Private and Public Distribution Facilities
3.25      PUSRI  is responsible for physical distribution to the farm level
and sells fertilizers at ISDs direct to 43 private, 5 government and
12 cooperative federations (PUSKUDs). In 1979, 52% of sales was made to
private companies, 38% to government companies, and 4% to PUSKUDs. The
balance of sales went into inventory change and exports. These main
distributors sold, in turn, to 714 subdistributors, of which 83.2% were
located in Java and the rest in North and South Sumatera, Bali and the
Lesser Sunda islands [Nusa Tenggara (NT)]. The subdistributors (kabupaten
level) sold direct to farmers and retailers through 3,253 KUDs and 3,288
private retailers. In 1980, just under 77% of final sales were made in Java,
15% in Sumatera, and 8% in Bali and NT, with small amounts being sold to all
other areas.
(f) Cooperatives and Cooperative Service Centers
3.26      Village cooperatives have existed for many years and are an
important part of government policy./l Aside from acting as suppliers of
agricultural imports (fertilizer and pesticides) they now also act as buying
agents for raw sugar and rice for BULOG, the government price support
agency, and they sell processed sugar, cooking oil and salt. These Koperasi
Unit Desa or KUDs provide services through some 20,000 kiosks and their
4,407 units are located throughout the country with just over 50% in Java,
33% in Sumatera, 12% in Sulawesi, and about 5% in Nusa Tenggara. They are
served by 14,000 agricultural extension workers and 625 specialist extension
workers trained in agronomy.
3.27      The Government has recently embarked on a well-conceived and well-
executed program to construct improved facilities for fertilzer and rice
storage and rice processing at the KUDs. The first 256 of 999 new kiosks of
various sizes are under construction and much of the first phase of this
program will be completed by April 1982 (para. 3.22). In order to assist
further in the development of KUDs the Government is forming cooperative
/1 Defined under Presidential Instruction No. 2, 1978.



- 27 -
service centers, or PPKs, which will each provide management and other
assistance to groups of four or five village KUDs. A training program to
staff PPKs is underway and will eventually involve 7,300 people. Additional
details of the KUD improvement program is to be found in Annex 2, A2, A5,
and Cll.
D. Recent Experience with the System
3.28      In 1980 Indonesia used about 2.5 million tons of all types of fer-
tilizers. Of this quantity urea accounted for 1.8 million tons and TSP for
0.5 million tons. The majority of fertilizer was produced and bagged
domestically with only 0.2 million tons being imported. PUSRI s special bulk
carriers, provided under the First Distribution Project, moved 1.1 million
tons of urea from Palembang to six bulk bagging stations (UPP) at Belawan,
Padang, Cilacap, Ujung Pandang, Surabaya and Tanjung Priok. This operation
involved 275,000 tons per ship of 7,400 tons urea capacity, and 152 voyages.
About 0.1 million tons moved from Palembang in small coasting ships direct to
small ports. Some 0.3 million tons of TSP in bags was sent from Gresik, in
Java, to other ports in small ships while the balance of 0.8 million tons was
shipped from fertilizer plants to ISDs by truck. PUSRI's shipping operations
have been hampered by a lack of proper central management supervision, delays
in port clearances, and delays at loading and unloading ports. Total time
taken in excessive delays (i.e., beyond those specifially allowed for)
amounted to 243 ship days in 1980 for the four bulk ships.  PUSRI and the Bank
have discussed the reasons for these delays in the system and management and
operational changes have been instituted. These changes should allow the
shipping system to operate nearer to its designed capacity. This matter is
dealt with more fully in the Project Completion Report on the Fertilizer
Distribution Project (Loan 1139-IND) dated June 15, 1981.
3.29      Except for a small amount shipped direct to certain large users and
some imports, all of the fertilizer moved through the storage system consist-
ing of the UPP and the ISDs. Shipments from UPP in Java in 1980 was 75% truck
and 25% rail. Constraints on the railway, PJKA, arising from low locomotive
availability due to poor maintenance, lack of understanding of the importance
of the movement of fertilizer in block trains, and organizational problems
connected with block train operation have held rail deliveries below expecta-
tions and possible achievement levels. Only toward the end of 1980 did PUSRI
and PJKA make a serious attempt to introduce block trains. This was success-
ful, if erratic in performance (para. 3.14), and indicated that larger amounts
of fertilizer could move by rail if additional equipment is made available and
if the proper coordination of PJKA and PUSRI activities can be achieved. With
the prospect of much larger volumes of fertilizer traffic it is expected that
the railway will succeed in operating block trains and that they will be used
to transport up to 60% of fertilizer traffic in Java on about a six-day turn
around by 1985. Much effort will be required to accomplish this and it may
not be achieved for at least five years. The project includes a study of block



- 28 -
train operations for four major bulk products (para. 4.21).  It is expected
that the results of the first part of this study will be available within six
months of its commencement. These recommendations will deal with the
equipment and administrative and organizational aspects of the current block
train operation and will assist PUSRI and PJKA in maintaining and improving
the movement of fertilizer. Should problems occur, the study results will
form a basis for the Bank and the Government to decide on appropriate
action. The second part of the study, to be completed by about June 1983,
will deal with the use of block trains when new equipment arrives. Because
the smooth movement of fertilizer, cement, rice and oil products by railway
is crucial to the success of the Government's development plans in Java, PUSRI
and PJKA have agreed to cooperate in solving problems which might arise in
block train operations.
3.30      Given the existing institutional constraints which cause ships
and railways to operate below expectations, the present system up to the ISD
level is operating at about its capacity. A lack of storage forward of the
ISD, which will be overcome during the construction period of the project,
has resulted in ISDs being used as storage rather than as transit points so
that there is excess transit capacity in the ISD system. With the increase
in ISDs under PUSRI's own program, ISD capacity outside Java will increase,
which should ease the distribution situation in more remote areas. If
PUSRI's efforts to reduce seasonal sales variations are successful,
distributors will build additional storage. In general, therefore, the
system constraints are to be found in the shipping, railways and UPP
elements. These matters are also discussed in the Project Completion Report
(June 15, 1981) which concludes that PUSRI has agreed to take all
appropriate action to improve ship operations and to ensure that, to the
extent possible, block trains will be operated efficiently. Additional ISDs
are under construction and additional shipping capacity is included in the
proposed project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. The Program and the Project - Purpose and Scope
4.01      The Government has developed a program for increased food
production by the proper application of fertilizers. This program involves:
(a) actions to support the proper management and operation of a nationwide
system of farmer cooperatives; (b) continued support of the farm-gate price
of rice and holding steady the price of fertilizer so as to induce farmers
to utilize it and, thus, transfer some of the benefits of increased oil
revenues to the farmer; (c) finance and construction supervision of a large
number of village kiosks of simple standard design to be used by cooperatives
for storage of fertilizer, for the storage and processing of rice and other
agricultural products, and for various social activities related to health,
training and education; and (d) continued support and finance of fertilizer
output and distribution facilities in the country.



- 29 -
4.02      The program is currently underway.  Farmers receive Rp 4/kg bonus
for selling their rice to a cooperative; the farm-gate price is drifting
upward toward Rp 120/kg; and the price of fertilizer has been held at
Rp 70/kg for the past four growing seasons. The Government has created a
cooperative training group to operate service centers and some cooperative
groups are financially sound enough to buy fertilizer direct from ISDs. The
construction program of kiosks is proceeding well under the supervision of
the Department of Finance, and will continue to be financed in the annual
budget. The final facet of the program is continued government support for
increasing the output of fertilizer, evidenced by the program of plant
construction, and provision of finance for the associated distribution
facilities needed to reach optimum levels of fertilizer output and usage
and/or to develop an export program.
4.03      The proposed national fertilizer distribution project to be
financed by the Bank - Part A of the Project - was prepared by PUSRI with
the assistance of consultants and includes assets and services directly
related to the physical movement of fertilizer from existing and from new
plants now under construction and forms part of the larger program now under
way and financed by the Government. Part B of the Project consists of
finance for preparing port master plans and detailed engineering for three
ports, detailed engineering for a second expansion of the port of Jakarta,
Tanjung Priok and project preparation activities for a proposed Maritime
Transport Project.
B. Detailed Project Description
4.04      Part A of the project consists of:  Urea Handling Facilities which
include (a) construction of a bulk reception and bagging station at Meneng,
East Java, with 25,000 tons of bulk and 35,000 tons of bagged urea storage
capable of bagging 1,000,000 tpy of fertilizer; (b) improvement of urea
bagging and handling equipment at an existing bagging station; (c) design and
construction of two special urea unloading piers at the ports of Meneng and at
Cilacap, where a bulk reception and bagging station exists; Railway Equipment
and Works which include (d) procurement by PUSRI of 200 special railway wagons
of 30-ton capacity for use in fertilizer block trains; (e) land acquisition,
design and construction of a 21 km railway line extension in East Java from
Kabat, near Banjuwangi, to Meneng; Shipping Facilities which include (f)
procurement by PUSRI of three self-unloading bulk urea ships of 7,500 dead-
weight tons (dwt) similar to the four now owned and operated by PUSRI, and of
one refrigerated ammonia carrier of about 4,500 dwt; (g) minor improvements to
unloading and loading capacity aboard the four ships now owned by PUSRI; (h)
spare parts for the ships and the bagging station; Consultant Services for (i)
the design and construction supervision of the additional bulk reception and



- 30 -
bagging station and the ships; and for (j) studies to: (k) revise forecasts
of fertilizer use and consumption; (ii) review the needs of the railway
system to expand the use of block trains for bulk products such as
fertilizer, cement, oil products, rice, sugar, etc. Part B of the Project
consists of preparation of master plans and detailed engineering for about
eleven ports. A detailed description of these items is given below.
(a) Urea Handling Facilities
4.05      Bagging and throughput capacity at UPP at Surabaya, serving East
Java, cannot be expanded beyond its present capacity of 450,000 tons p.a.
due to site constraints. In view of the forecast increase of 880,000 tons
of urea use in East Java (para. 2.23), PUSRI has decided, and the Bank has
agreed, that further UPP expansion should take place at Meneng, about 17 km
north of the town of Banjuwangi, on the strait separating Java and Bali. It
is the only alternative port serving East Java which can be expanded in the
time available. The port is organized under a Port Administrator reporting
to the area port authorities at Surabaya. Pilotage is compulsory and the
port handles about 100,000 to 150,000 tons of rice exports per year over one
pier. A second pier is being planned. Adequate data on current and
hydrographic conditions are available and PUSRI ship masters and the local
pilot agree with the consultants (Swan, Wooster Engineering Co. Ltd. Canada
[SWANCO]) that a ship up to 20,000 dwt could be berthed at the pier proposed
to be built for the project and that the project ships will have no diffi-
culty in berthing.
4.06      It is proposed to construct a bulk urea reception and bagging
station (UPP) at Meneng with an initial capacity of 750,000 tons per year
(tpy) of fertilizer but expanded immediately to 1.0 million tpy in order to
provide buffer storage in case of later than anticipated completion of the
railway line extension (para. 4.11). This facility is similar to five
others provided under the previous project. The UPP would be linked to the
main-line railway by a short rail spur. Recent studies by SWANCO indicate
that sufficient area is available for the new UPP and for a special berth
for discharge of fertilizer from the self-unloading ships. The site is on
firm ground and soils tests have been carried out to determine the civil
works design. The Directorate General of Sea Communications, which controls
the port, has agreed that PUSRI may construct a berth solely for urea
unloading. Land acquisition for the site of the IJPP has been completed.
4.07      Another special berth solely for urea unloading is required at the
port of Cilacap, where a UPP is located to serve Central Java. Unloading of
the urea ships at Cilacap now takes place at a general cargo berth onto
which the urea reception conveyor is moved. This berth is often occupied by
small general cargo ships which usually take several days to unload.  The
PUJSRI ship can discharge 7,400 tons of urea in 24 hours. Construction of a
special caisson-type berth in an unused area of the port near the UPP is
practicable and has been agreed to by the Directorate General of Sea Conmmu-
nications and the port. Its use will markedly improve turnaround time of



-31 -
PUSRI ships at the port where 103.7 days were lost in waiting to unload in
1980. Parts of the existing conveyor system will be used to link the new
pier to the UPP.
4.08      Due to the growth of fertilizer consumption forecast to take place
in North Sumatera, additional bagging facilities are required there by 1982.
It is proposed to install an additional bagging unit at the existing Belawan
UPP to handle growing volumes of TSP, AS and other fertilizer which cannot use
the existing urea facilities unless the bagging operation is shut down to
allow for careful cleaning of the equipment, because of chemical reactions
between urea and other fertilizers. The additional bagging unit will greatly
increase the capacity of existing facilities and will cater to the growth of
fertilizer consumption in the area. Because the general cargo berth area is
used to unload the PUSRI ships and only one conveyor site is currently
available, much time (41.3 days in 1980) is lost waiting to unload PUSRI ships
at Belawan. With increased throughput delays are expected to increase
sharply. To overcome such delays and their repercussions on the shipping
system an additional mobile conveyor and associated equipment will be
constructed at a second berth in the port and linked to the present conveyor
system so that the PUSRI ships will have two places to unload. Design and
construction supervision of these facilities, which have been agreed with the
Bank, are being undertaken by PUSRI's Engineering Department and are similar
to facilities provided at another port under the previous project. In
addition urea and TSP loading facilities are being designed at Gresik and for
the ASEAN plant at Aceh. These facilities will be able to load the project
ships PUSRI has been appointed to carry bulk fertilizer from these facilities.
(b) Railway Equipment and Works
(i) Equipment
4.09      The project includes procurement by PUSRI of 200 railway wagons, of
30-ton capacity, specially designed to carry bagged fertilizer to ISDs. These
wagons have already been designed. PUSRI now owns 175 such wagons, procured
under the First Fertilizer Distribution Project, and has ordered an additional
220 financed by Canadian bilateral aid. This total of 595 wagons, including
about 10% spares, is expected to be able to move 950,000-1,100,000 tons of
fertilizer within Java by block trains by 1985. The existing arrangements
for maintenance of these additional wagons will be continued. As the normal
PJKA wagons, which are in short supply, carry only about 12 tons of bagged
fertilizer, it is doubtful if the lower costs of railway bulk movement
compared to trucks, could be realized without acquiring these additional,
larger wagons./l Due to the shortage of modern equipment in the PJKA system
/1 With fertilizer movement on Java forecast to rise to 2.1 million tons
by 1985, additional wagons will have to be dedicated to PUSRI use in
order for long haul economies to be achieved. Recommendations relating
to future wagon requirements will be included in studies to be carried
out in the project (para. 4.21). Adequate trucking capacity is available
in Java.



- 32 -
and growing demand for bulk product movement, there is a tendency for any
available PJKA wagons to be retained within each operating region. With
additional time, acquisition of new equipment now underway, and means of
centralizing wagon dispatch, PJKA may be able to allocate wagons strictly
according to its customers' needs. In the meantime, PUSRI's control of the
dispatch origin and the destination points of fertilizer wagons, which can
only be achieved through ownership, is crucial to the timely and proper
distribution of fertilizers.
4.10      Studies made in connection with the First Fertilizer Distribution
Project (National Fertilizer and Pesticides Distribution Study) called for a
fleet of 17 locomotives to be used in the block train movement of fertilizers
in Java based on a two-day wagon turnaround time which is not likely to be
achieved prior to 1990. Four mainline and three shunting locomotives were
acquired by PJKA under the first project and additional equipment has been
acquired by PJKA from other sources. With the introduction of block train
operations moving larger volumes at slower rates than had been planned irL the
studies referred to, there is a clear need for additional locomotives. PJKA
has received funds for procurement of 62 additional locomotives for Java and
should be in a good position to assign locomotives to PUSRI use. Agreement
has been reached during negotiations that PJKA will acquire and assign an
adequate number of shunting and main-line locomotives to ensure efficient:
fertilizer distribution operations on the part of PUSRI. This would include,
in the view of the Bank, allocation or procurement by PJKA of three mainline
and five shunting locomotives for fertilizer transport bringing the total of
locomotives to be assigned to fertilizer movement to at least 7 mainline and 8
shunting locomotives. Given a reasonably efficient operating regime, these
should be sufficient for 12 block trains per day each of 510 tons or an annual
movement of about 1.7 million tons per year at an 80% efficiency factor on 350
days operations (para. 5.11). During negotiations PJKA and PUSRI have agreed
that efforts will be made to improve the operation of block trains by reaching
specific performance targets (turnaround time) by June 1983. If such efforts
are unsuccessful, the Government, PJKA, PUSRI and the Bank will review the
steps to be taken in the light of the findings and recommendations of thes
study of block train operations (para. 4.21). One objective of the efforts
will be to try to reach a monthly average turnaround time of not more than 5.8
days by December 1985.
(ii) Works
4.11      The proposed new bulk reception and bagging depot at Meneng needs
to be joined to the existing railway line at Kabat, 21 km distant from Meneng.
Due to the anticipated large volume of fertilizer to be received at the Meneng
UPP (674,000 tpy in 1984 and 750,000 in 1987 for use in East Java alone)
adequate facilities are required so that trains will not interfere unduly with
the road movement of up to 300,000 tpy of bagged rice to be shipped out of the
port of Meneng and the large quantity, perhaps as much as 200,000 tpy, of
fertilizer which will be sent to East Java by road from Meneng. PJKA has
retained local consultants (P.T. Indement Consultants, Indonesia) has surveyed
the railway alignment and has organized a Project Management Group within its



- 33 -
staff to supervise construction of the proposed extension which will have
21 km of main line and 9 km of sidings. A realistic construction schedule has
been included in the project and will be agreed in detail with PJKA (para.
4.28). A special budget has been approved by the Government in the amount of
Rp 17.345 billion (US$27.7 million) to cover part of the cost of the extension
and the related engineering and design and construction supervision. The
consultant's report on the engineering for the extension will be ready at the
end of October 1982.  Bank staff have reviewed the preliminary plans for
construction and agreement has been reached for the Bank to inspect progress,
obtain all relevant data, and to consult on a regular basis to determine what
steps, if any, should be taken to improve progress. The Government has agreed
to take the steps necessary to achieve timely completion of the railway line
extension.
(c) Ships
(i) Urea Carriers
4.12      Each of PUSRI's four bulk urea ships transports and unloads about
280,000 tons of fertilizer per year. With the increased output and domestic
distribution of fertilizers, additional ships are required. Flow diagrams
(Figures 4 to 7) of fertilizer movement have been constructed and analyzed
and, based on these and actual ship operations, it has been determined that
a further three similar ships will be needed in order to transport fertilizer
available at the end of 1984. Additional ships will be required after 1985
(para. 5.04). The ships have been designed by consultants [Marine
Consultants and Designers, USA (MCD)] who were retained by PUSRI for design
of the first four ships and who have been retained for design and construc-
tion supervision for the project ships.
4.13  .   In order to:  (a) maintain the ability of all fleet units to load
at any producing unit and unload at any port where PUSRI has a UPP;
(b) maintain the commonality of ships in order to be able to rotate crews,
simplify spare parts inventories and reduce maintenance costs; and (c) meet
the transport needs imposed by the construction schedule of new plants and
receive the ships during 1983, it has been decided to construct the three
ships from the basic designs of the existing ships. One of PUSRI's four
existing ships, all of which carry 7,400 tons of urea at 6 m draft, is
stronger structurally than the others and can carry 9,200 tons of TSP at a
draft of 7.2 m. Because the project also includes provision for loading
TSP, each of the three additional ships will have this stronger structure
and will be capable of carrying TSP as a backhaul cargo from Gresik to other
ports in Java and Sumatera after arriving at Surabaya or Meneng with a full
load. To accomplish this dual cargo carriage, special cleaning facilities
and procedures will be included in the ship (see also para. 4.16).



- 34 -
(ii) Ammonia Carriers
4.14      P.T. Pupuk Kalimantan Timur (KALTIM) is under construction near
Bontang, East Kalimantan, and some 800 km from East Java. The plant will
produce 513,000 tpy of urea and about 150,000 tpy of ammonia (NH3). The
plant is designed with a bulk and bagged urea shiploading pier and a sepa-
rate pier to load NH3 as a refrigerated liquid (-50°C). The design of these
facilities is acceptable to the Bank. The output of NH3 of about 500 tons
per day (tpd) from the first KALTIM unit will be absorbed, to the extent of
about 200 tpd, by Petrokimia to maintain output of AS at the 150,000 tpy
level. The balance will be available for export to the Philippines and to
other markets. Arrangements to secure sales contracts are under way and
KALTIM has appointed sales agents.
4.15      Studies by MCD under a first phase contract which includes all
activities from design to bid evaluation, have determined that one NH3 ship
of about 4,500 dwt (5,600 cu m) will be the optimum size of vessel to serve
both the domestic and the export market. The ship will also be able to
transport refrigerated liquid petroleum gas. A second NH3 ship will be
required for moving the output of KALTIM II, planned to commence production
in 1985. Charter of an ammonia carrier will be undertaken on an interim
basis if the plant is ready to ship product before ship construction is
completed. Appropriate charters will be made to provide for product
movement until the project ship is operational.
(iii) Improvements to Existing Ships
4.16      PUSRI's bulk urea ships have operated for about four years.  During
his time the need for and possibility of certain improvements has become
evident. These improvements are of two sorts. First, ones which will eli-
minate or reduce substantially the need for manual cleaning-up of the cargo
hold now required because urea, being hygroscopic, tends to compact and
adhere to vertical surfaces. Procurement of small "Bob-cat" type front--end
loaders to be used in each ship to loosen urea adhering to the bottom and
upper areas of the hold,/1 realignment of the paths of the scrapers which
drag urea to the discharge hopper, and provision for fresh water washing of
the hold and urea reclaim system is planned. Second, improvements to
facilitate loading aboard the main deck of bales of polyethylene bags for
fertilizer which are manufactured by PUSRI in Palembang and shipped aboard
PUSRI's ships for use at the various UPPs. Extensions to existing cranes
and the strengthening of the crane structure will be required. MCD wilL
design the shipboard alterations which will be accomplished during the
annual dry docking of the ship under PUSRI supervision.
/1 Procurement of four additional "Bob-cats" for use aboard the four
existing ships is included as part of the project.



- 35 -
(d) Spare Parts
4.17      With a fleet of seven ships and with six UPP, 595 railway cars,
and 81 ISDs, PUSRI will require a large variety of spare parts to be held in
inventory in order to maintain operations in the face of long procurement
lead times and complicated import procedures. Spares for the ships are
divided into two types; those which are retained aboard the ships (operating
spares) and those which are retained at a central depot at Palembang (insur-
ance spares) where they are available to all fleet units. Spares for UPPs
are necessarily kept at each depot as are the operating spares for UPP
equipment. Spare parts for the project railway wagons are kept under PUSRI
control in Java and drawn by PJKA as required. The project includes
appropriate additions to PUSRI spare parts stocks, based on usage records
and the advice of consultants. The list of spare parts, drawn up by
consultants and PUSRI, has been agreed (Annex 2, C 12).
(e) Consulting Services
(i) Ships and Urea Handling Facilities
4.18      PUSRI has retained consultants for preliminary design and assist-
ance in procurement and in construction supervision of the UPP at Meneng
(SWANCO) and for design and construction supervision of the four ships
(MCD). These consultants were previously retained for the same functions
during the first project and are acceptable to the Bank. Their contracts
are effective and their work is underway. A lump-sum contract for detailed
design between PUSRI and P.T. Kelsri covering the Meneng UPP is effective.
(ii) Design and Owner's Engineer
4.19      PUSRI has retained a local consultant, P.T. Inconeb, which has
designed piers in Indonesian ports to design and draw up tenders for the
piers at Meneng and Cilacap. These will be constructed according to design
criteria to be supplied by SWANCO, which will act as Owner's Engineer and
supervise their construction. Design of the piers is underway and is 90%
complete. Cost estimates, based on the cost of a similar adjacent pier at
Meneng, are complete and have been reviewed by Bank staff.
(iii) Forecast of Fertilizer Consumption, Marketing and Distribution
Requirements
4.20      The rapid expansion of production of fertilizers in Indonesia,
growing demand, and shifts in regional growth patterns create a need to
review the various estimates which have been made about fertilizer and its
distribution, including methods to increase peak storage capacity. PUSRI,
with the main responsibility for fertilizer distribution, will retain IFDC
(para. 2.21) to undertake such a review with the objective of completing it



- 36 -
by June 1983. Terms of reference for this study, estimated to cost
US$200,000 and to require about 10 man-months of expatriate and about 40
man-months of local consultant time, will be prepared by PUSRI and IDFC and
agreed to by the Bank within the next few months. The study will include,
inter alia, a review of distribution problems outside Java (paras. 3.21 and
3.22) and will be financed by the Fifth Technical Assistance Credit
(Cr. 898-IND).
(iv) Use of Block Trains in Java
4.21      It has been difficult for PUSRI and PJKA to introduce the use of
block trains for fertilizer movement (para. 3.29). The success of this
method, new to Indonesia, is necessary if PJKA is to handle the large volumes
of bulk products such as fertilizer, cement, petroleum products, rice, sugar,
etc. which will be moved by railway during the next 10 years. Success
involves not only equipment but also administrative control systems and
communications equipment. In order to estimate the need for additional
operational improvements and investment, PJKA will study the requirements for
introducing the wider use of block trains and the implications of this for
administration and control of railway operations. The findings of this study,
expected to be completed by June 1983 may require 12 man-months of foreign and
30 man-months of local consultant time, will be done in two parts as described
in para. 3.29 and will serve as a focus for any necessary review of the
operation of fertilizer block trains (para. 4.10). Terms of reference for
this study, which will be financed from the Fifth Technical Assistance Credit,
have been reviewed. PJKA and PUSRI have reached agreement on a method of
monitoring and controlling block train operations designed to improve
efficiency during the period prior to the completion of this study.
(v) Port Master Plans and Detailed Engineering
4.22      The Government has requested the Bank to assist in financing the
cost of preparing port master plans and, based on agreed plans, the detailed
engineering required for ports identified by the Integrated Sea Transport
Study. This study was financed under the Second Shipping Loan (Ln. 1250-IND).
Thirty-two ports were nominated for inclusion in an interisland liner system
(ILS). Master plans have ben completed for eight ports to be constructed with
Dutch and Japanese aid and by proposed Asian Development Bank projects. A
further 10 are to have master plans and detailed engineering undertaken by the
Directorate General of Sea Communications (para. 4.23) and construction at two
ports is complete. Master plans and detailed engineering for the balance of
12 ILS ports is expected to be carried out in two phases. Phase I, for which
US$17.5 million is included in Part B of the proposed project, includes
detailed engineering (US$6.3 million) for the second expansion of Indonesia's
main port, Tanjung Priok, which is receiving assistance under the First Port
Loan (Ln. 1337-IND), the expansion of which is likely to cost about US$ 150
million. The proposed project also includes financing for master plans and
detailed engineering (US$11.2 million) for high priority ILS ports, details of
which are included in Annex 2, B.7.

C. Cost Estimate and Financing Plan
4.23      The total cost estimate for the project is US$185.3 million
equivalent of which US$138.2 million equivalent would be foreign exchange.
The proposed loan of US$66.0 million would finance about 48% of foreign
exchange costs and 35.6% of total costs. The National Fertilizer Distribution
Project - Part A of the Project - would require US$167.8 million equivalent
of which US$126.1 million equivalent or 75% would be foreign exchange. The
proposed allocation of US$48.5 million for this part of the project would
finance 38% of its foreign exchange requirements. The balance of the pro-
posed loan, US$17.5 million equivalent, would provide 100% of the finance
required for the port master plans and detailed engineering and for consul-
tant contracts. The costs for the urea bulk carrier ships, are based on a
contract concluded in February 1982. Based on quotations made on the basis
of outline specifications, the consultants have provided estimates of the
price of the ammonia carrier. Cost estimates for equipment are based on
consultant estimates and quotations from suppliers of similar equipment.
Cost estimates for the piers are based on advanced engineering design (para.
4.19). The cost estimate for the railway extension is based on estimates
for materials (rails, sleepers, fastenings, etc.) as determined by PJKA on
the basis of the 21 km route plus 9 km of sidings. The construction costs
(cut, fill, bridges and other construction) were also prepared by PJYSA. While
these estimates are not based on detailed engineering, they were reviewed by
Bank staff at negotiations, and subsequently in Indonesia. The phasing of
work and of expenditure was considered reasonable. The land acquisition costs
are based on purchases at an average price of Rp 5,000 per sq m. PUSRI has
rented the land for the Meneng depot and has prepaid the rent.  Costs for the
railway consultants are based on information supplied by PJKA.
4.24      The average man-month cost of an expert, including the cost of
travel, subsistence, and allowances is estimated at about US$3,000 equivalent
for a local expert and ranges between US$8,500 and US$10,700 for expatriate
consultants. All these estimates are reasonable, and are in line with the
actual cost of consultant services in Indonesia over the four-year period of
project construction. Cost for design and construction supervision for the
ships is estimated at US$2.7 million if only two shipyards are selected to
build two types of ships, US$3.0 million if three shipyards are selected.
Costs for Indonesian consultants (P.T. Kelsri) have been based on a contract
for US$387,000. All of the above cost estimates have been based on contracts
for the various consultants.
4.25      An overall physical contingency of 13.2% of total of Part A project
base costs (excluding the cost of the ships which are fixed price bids) has
been arrived at by calculating reasonable physical allowances of from 5% to
35% for each item where appliccable. Details are given in Annex 7. Price
contingencies for the total Part A project excluding the cost of the ships of
17.7% have been calculated on the sum of base costs plus physical contingency
over the construction period as shown in Table 4.1. Price and physical con-
tingencies of 9% have been estimated for Part B of the project. The results,
which are in line with recent Bank assumptions on Indonesian inflation, are
given in detail in Annex 7. The above project costs are given in Table 4.2.

D.  Project Implementation
(a) Financing Plan
4.26      The financing plan includes use of export credits for procuring
ships. Based on an understanding among OECD countries most ship financing is
for a maximum of 80% of the ships value repayable over not more than 8 years
at a minimum interest rate of 8 1/2% p.a. A total of US$54.8 million cf
export credits will be utilized. This amount plus the proposed loan of
US$66 million will represent about 87% of total project foreign exchange
costs. These loans will be made to the Government which will bear the foreign
exchange risk. All funds onlent to PUSRI by the Government will be 25% equity
and 75% debt at a rate of 13.5%, the current long-term lending rate by
Indonesia's state development bank. The Government will finance PJKA through
its budget. Funds for Part B of the project will be supplied through the
budget. The financing plan is given in Table 4.3.

(b)  Implementation
4.27      The project would be implemented over a period of four years with
the majority of work being completed in two years and three months (June
1984). Only the railway line construction will extend to June 1985. The
planned order dates for equipment and the description of work to be under-
taken is given in Table 4.4 below and an implementation schedule is given in
Figure 3. A list of potential bidders covering all categories of equipment
to be procured by PUSRI includes 140 firms. The contract for three urea
ships was awarded after Government procedures to a Korean shipyard, which
will provide a supplier credit. Part B of the Project is expected to be
completed no later than December 1984, the time scheduled for the appraLsal
of the maritime project. The production of ammonia will start at KALTIM in
mid-1983 and will be transported by chartered ships until the special
ammonia carrier is delivered.

Sept 1981     Rail extension            Meneng/Banjuwangi    45       June 1985
4.28      A time-critical item is the railway extension.  30 km railway line
could be built under normal circumstances in about two and one half years,
including land acquisition, but experience in Indonesia indicates that
substantial delays are likely. This is due to problems of land acquisition
and contracting and because of growing difficulties and delays in contract
administration. A conservative schedule has therefore been projected. The
survey of the railway line alignment for the extension is complete. The
Government has decided to have the work managed by PJKA, assisted by local
consultants, and constructed by local contractors. Completion in mid-1985
will require bagged urea to be transported by truck to a temporary railway
wagon loading installation at Banjuwangi or Kabat. At volumes of over



- 41 -
100,000 tpy this transfer is more expensive than movement direct from Meneng
to final destination by the proposed railway. About 575,000 tpy will have to
be moved by road to a railway loading point until mid-1985 at up to about
US$5.18 per ton additional cost. Delay of railway line completion beyond this
date would expose PUSRI to added costs. Therefore the Government has agreed
to take all steps as may be necessary or desirable to achieve timely comple-
tion of the railway extension, based on a detailed construction schedule.
Until the railway extension is completed, the bagging plants at Jakarta,
Cilacap, Surabaya and Meneng and at all the production plants will receive
and/or bag and ship fertilizer in order to maintain factory production and
fertilizer supplies to Java.  Some of the fertilizer to be unloaded at Jakarta
or Cilacap will have to be reshipped by rail to markets in East Java at high
cost and with major organizational difficulties until the facilities at
Meneng, and the railway line, are able to operate. Because timely completion
of the railway extension to Meneng is critical to the proper and economic
movement of fertilizer PJKA and the Government have agreed during negotiations
on the need for frequent consultation on and review of progress in
constructing the extension with a view to determining the steps to be taken,
if any, to improve progress.
(c) Executing Agencies
4.29      PUSRI would be the executing agency for procuring and putting into
service the urea handling equipment, the UPP, and the ships and for procure-
munt of the railway wagons. A project implementation group has been set up
within PUSRI's Development Department to carry out the work. It is headed by
a capable and experienced manager. The marine structures would be designed
and constructed by competent local consultants and contractors selected by
PUSRI on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures approved by the
Bank. The contractors are also to be judged technically capable and, based on
previous work, approved by the local port administrators and Directorate
General of Sea Communications. Construction would be carried out under the
supervision of SWANCO. PUSRI and P.T. Kelsri are now designing the Meneng
UPP and SWANCO and P.T. Kelsri will act as Owner's Engineer for PUSRI in its
construction and will assist in procurement and evaluation of bids. As the
design is similar to the five other depots operated by PUSRI, no design or
construction problems are envisaged. MCD would undertake construction
supervision for the ships with a PUSRI engineer acting as Owner's Engineer for
document approval. The railway locomotives and equipment for the railway line
extension, and the extension itself, would be procured and executed by PJKA.
The Directorate General of Sea Communications would be the executing agency
for Part B of the Project.

E. Procurement and Disbursement
(a) Procurement
4.30      The Bank loan will finance part of the foreign exchange cost of
equipment and consultant services to be procured by PUSRI and consultant
services for Part B of the Project. Procurement by PUSRI of all equipment
(urea handling facilities, railway wagons, etc.) will be subject to
international competitive bidding (ICB) from prequalified bidders and will be
carried out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement and be
subject to Bank approval. Items not financed by the Bank will be procured on
the basis of competitive bidding locally advertised in accordance with govern-
ment procedures satisfactory to the Bank. All equipment contracts or packages
of contracts of over US$100,000 awarded by PUSRI will be subject to prior
review by the Bank and this will cover about 85% of the value of Bank-financed
contracts. The balance will be subject to a random post review by the Bank
after award. All contracts for civil works costing US$1.5 million or more
will be subject to prequalification and review by the Bank prior to award.
Consultants employed under Bank finance, except for contracts negotiated prior
to August 5, 1981, will be employed according to the Bank's Guidelines for use
of Consultants and will be acceptable to the Bank and employed under contracts
acceptable to the Bank. Procurement by PUSRI has already commenced.
4.31      Of the US$126.1 million of foreign cost for Part A of the Project,
one contract for three urea ships and spares (US$43.9 million) has been
awarded and awaits final Government approval. This contract requires 5%
of the price to be paid on contract effectiveness (likely by the end of March
1982) and the balance by the delivery of each ship. No interest is charged
during construction. This payment (US$2.2 million equivalent) plus minor
payments to consultants and for equipment or services at Meneng and Cilacap
could involve PUSRI in total payments of up to about US$3.5 million prior to
loan signing on commitments of about US$50.0 million.
4.32      PJKA will undertake civil works utilizing competent contractors
and will procure contractors on the basis of competitive bidding, locally
advertised in accordance with government procedures satisfactory to the
Bank. PJKA will construct the railway track using force account and local
contractors. It is expected that civil works will be undertaken in a number
of small contracts not of interest to foreign firms and therefore ICB is
not appropriate. Consultants employed to assist with Part B of the Project
will be retained by the Directorate General of Sea Communications under the
procedures set out in the Guidelines for Uses of Consultants and will be
employed under contracts acceptable to the Bank.



- 43 -
(b) Disbursement
4.33      Disbursement of the loan proceeds will be made over four calendar
years on the following basis for Part A of the Project:  (i) 100% of the
foreign cost of equipment or of local expenditure for equipment manufactured
locally, (ii) 75% of the local cost of imported equipment procured locally,
(iii) 100% of the cost of consultants, and (iv) 100% of the cost of civil works
(pier and bagging station at Meneng). Part B of the Project will finance
100% of the cost of consultant services. The expected loan disbursement
schedule, based on the region-wide profile and expenditures under Part B of
the project, would be as shown in Table 4.5.
F. Environmental Aspects
4.34      No environmental hazards are foreseen at the bulk storage shed
where existing pollution control systems are in use or will be utilized for
the new terminal and sheds. Bagged storage presents no environmental
hazards. Pollution controls, acceptable to the Bank and based on those
proposed by the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO),
are included in the ship specifications to control oily water, garbage and
sewage discharge.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Economic Rate of Return
5.01      The economic assessment of the project investments is made on the
same rationale as that for the first Bank-financed distribution project:
changes in the costs of transporting fertilizer throughout Indonesia under
"with-" and "without-project" scenarios. The approach accepts as common to
both, the expected overall growth, and regional distribution of agricultural
production which underlies forecasts of fertilizer demand. Economic rates
of return are estimated separately for each project component, as well as
for the project as a whole.
5.02      Cost savings and other benefits are measured net of:  (a) the
capacity of the distribution system existing in early 1981; and (b) the
overall changes in fertilizer transport costs to farmers that will follow
from the location of new urea plants at Bontang and Aceh. This latter
effect will be a significant saving for areas now remote from factory sites
and major use areas, as the following table shows:
Table 5.1:  REDUCTION IN UREA TRANSPORT

West Sumatera                        1           5
5.03      The focus of the economic analysis is therefore the efficiency of
the expanded distribution system.  Costs include assets to be provided under
the project itself, and those investments under the wider program of factory
expansion that are necessary for the operation of bulk ships at Gresik.
Overall, storage and bagging requirements are the same for any distribution
system, depending on the level of production and demand rather than the



- 46 -
transport mode. In analyzing the returns on storage and bagging investments
only those costs necessary for the efficient operation of the chosen distri-
bution system, i.e., the bulk reception and bagging plant to be provided at
Meneng and the improvements at Belawan and Cilacap, are included.
5.04      Analysis of the operation of the transport system assumes that a
further expansion of distribution assets will follow, and possibly overlap,
this project. The existing inter-island fertilizer bulkshipping fleet has
capacity to carry 1.4 million tons of urea annually, and this will be fully
utilized in 1982. The three ships to come into service in 1983 will have
capacity for an additional 1.1 million tons of urea or a total of 1.2 mil-
lion tons of fertilizer if TSP is carried on back-hauls.  Capacity for urea
with TSP back-haul will be fully utilized in 1985 and for bulk urea trans-
port in 1986, when some 30,000 tons would need to be carried by additional
new ships and/or under charter arrangements. This points to the need for
rapid preparation of a follow-on expansion of fertilizer distribution
facilities (para. 1.04).
(a) Inter-Island Bulk Fertilizer Movements
5.05      Use of the three new ships in 1983-1986 will provide economic cost
savings over the least-cost alternative shipping system /1 (using 1,500 dwt
bulk carriers) averaging Rp 5,540 per ton./2 Fertilizer handling improve-
ments at Belawan and Cilacap ports will eliminate current delays to
fertilizer ships waiting for berth space, and reduce costs for bulk
shipments through these ports by Rp 516 and Rp 147 per ton. Reductions iLn
fertilizer handling losses for the PUSRI bulk fleet are taken at 3% compared
to handling all fertilizer in small bulkships and bags. All of these
benefits, extended to the end of the 15-year life of the vessels at the 1986
capacity level, give an economic return on investments for interisland bulk
fertilizer movements of 25%. This is comparable to the return achieved on
the First Fertilizer Distribution Project. Details of the calculations are
given in Annex 2, C2 and C4.
/1 See Project Completion Report, Indonesia Loan 1139, Fertilizer Distr:Lbu-
tion Project, June 15, 1981. This report updates the comparative cost
studies for different shipping systems made during preparation of the
Fertilizer Distribution Project and reconfirms that 1,500 dwt bulk
ships are the least cost alternative to PUSRI designed bulk carriers.
/2  Financial savings from using PUSRI bulk carriers are given in Annex '3,
CIO, paras. 9 to 11. Ship operating costs and other transport costs
used in this chapter have been adjusted to economic levels to reflecit
world fuel prices of early 1981 and to exclude the 10% import tax on
ships. Shadow pricing was not applied to foreign exchange or labor
components of costs or benefits.



- 47 -
(b) Refrigerated Ammonia Shipments
5.06      Purchase of a specialized ship to transport refrigerated ammonia
between Bontang and Gresik will result in significant savings over chartered
ship costs, and export sales to the Philippines will result in additional
net shipping revenues. If a ship were not purchased, export ammonia could
be sold f.o.b. at Bontang, and the small domestic volume carried by
chartering small pressurized carriers. It is unlikely that this would
affect Indonesia's sales prospects, although storage at Bontang may be
adjusted to allow for greater uncertainty on the frequency of ship calls.
The small domestic transport need by itself would not justify purchase of a
specialized ship.
5.07      The economic case for purchasing the ship therefore rests on the
prospective earnings from shipping services to foreign purchasers of
ammonia, and some savings in payments to foreigners for domestic shipments.
5.08      Charter rates for small, pressurized shipments of ammonia exports
from Palembang in early 1981 were, per ton, US$85-120 for shipments to
Malaysia, US$93 to the Philippines and US$96 to South Korea. On this basis
the charter rate needed to attract foreign ship owners to the Bontang-
Gresik route is estimated at US$90.
5.09      It is reasonable to expect that regular refrigerated export
shipments would earn a lower freight rate than the pressurized tonnages.
Taking into account competitive vessel time charter rates and operating
costs, Philippine importers could pay some US$45 per ton for ammonia
exported f.o.b. from Bontang. This rate also provides a reasonable margin
over costs of ownerships and operation of the project ship to allow competi-
tive pricing responses to competition, and it has been assumed therefore
that charter rates of US$45 per ton could be negotiated. Net earnings from
export shipments would begin in 1984, but the capacity of the ship (186,500
tons per year) limits export shipments from 1985 on to 140,000 tons,
assuming domestic ammonia requirements will be filled. The rate of return
is estimated at 28%, and details are shown in Annex 4, Table 2.
(c) Intra-Java Fertilizer Movements
5.10      For the intra-island movements on Java, benefits are measured as
the savings for the incremental tonnages to be carried by rail compared with
costs by road transport. Unit costs for fertilizer transport in block
trains are well below those for road transport for long distance movements
but there is insufficient rolling stock to expand rail traffic. For Meneng,
the project would also provide the track, and comparison with the alternative
of trucking fertilizer to the nearest railhead at Banyuwangi shows that rail
transport connections to the UPP would have lower costs for all volumes
above 200,000 tons per year.



- 48 -
5.11      Limited locomotive availability has been a constraint on improving
block train performance, and PJKA is now in the process of acquiring 64
additional locomotives for fertilizer and other goods movements in Java.
With these, and based on the findings of the study on block trains operation
to be completed in 1983, it is expected that block train wagon turnarounds
can be improved to 5.8 days in 1985 and to the originally targetted 3.7 days
by about 1987. This would improve the capacity of the fleet to around 1.8
million tons in 1985 (see paras. 3.23 and 4.10).
5.12      Such capacity will be insufficient for the demand.  Projected urea
movements for which rail is cheaper than road transport (i.e., all tonnages
moving more than 100 kilometers inland, or about 75% on Java) is already
1.1 million tons. In 1982, with the completion of the rail link to the TSP
plant at Gresik, unit shipments of TSP, DAP and AS will begin, and the
projected potential rail tonnage will rise from 1.6 million to 2.1 million
tons by 1985. This matter was discussed during negotiations and assurances
obtained that PJKA will include in the block train study the development of a
plan for discussion with the Bank to procure, or make available, additional
railway wagons for fertilizer by 1985.
5.13      The rolling stock to be provided under this project will fill only
part of the capacity gap - about 297,000 tons at current turnarounds, rising
to 562,000 tons with operational improvements. For fertilizer transport,
benefits, measured as the difference in transport costs by road and rail,
average Rp 5,350 per ton. The rail line extension to Meneng provides similar
benefits to other traffic, principally rice, being shipped out of East Java
through the port. BULOG estimates rice shipments through Meneng could reach
300,000 tons by 1985, and cost savings on inland transport to the port have
been included from 1986 but there is likely to be substantial excess track
capacity until other traffic (e.g., lumber, plywood, rice) develops. The
proposed port master plan for Meneng will deal with this matter. Annex 4,
Table 3 shows details of the calculations. The rate of return on the railway
investments, based on the project, is 13%.
(d) Overall Return
5.14      Spread over the distribution system investments the benefits
provide a rate of return of 21%. Benefit and cost streams are summarized in
Annex 4, Table 4.
B. Project Risks
5.15      The project runs few risks from the possibilities of higher costs
or lower than expected demand. By the time of negotiations, bids will have
been received, and orders placed, for major project investments. The
transport capacity to be provided includes only those urgent and interim



- 49 -
items needed to cope with the sudden surge in production and demand over the
next few years. The expanded shipping and railway capacity will be
insufficient after 1985. Unless productivity substantially improves as a
result of the steps to be taken in the course of the next few years, railway
capacity will be less than optimal in all years and PUSRI costs will rise as
more fertilizer is shipped by truck. Should domestic demand develop more
slowly, ship capacity can be diverted to export trades and the land transport
systems will face less strain in handling fertilizer distribution. Should
the timing of the opening of new plants be delayed, bulk ships and inland
transport facilities will be needed to distribute the interim imports of
fertilizer. Should demand grow more slowly than anticipated, there is a
small risk of temporary over capacity for fertilizer transport, but the
existing system capacity is now close to demand.
5.16      Delay in completing the railway line extension to Meneng will
cause continued heavy costs to fall on PUSRI because of the need to utilize
more expensive road transport.  Continued less than optimum operation of
PUSRI ships could cause severe difficulties for the delivery of urea prior
to delivery of the project ships because alternative, more costly and less
productive ships would have to be used. Late delivery of the project ships
will also cause similar problems. The railway line construction will be
monitored by the Bank and steps have been proposed to minimize the risk of
delay (para. 4.28). PUSRI has undertaken to make appropriate changes in its
shipping department in order to improve productivity and has sought bids for
early delivery of the project ships.
5.17      The major risks are, therefore, those of inefficient operation of
the system, including existing facilities, and of the consequent development
of bottlenecks in the expanded distribution system. At negotiations,
agreements will be sought on operating performance efficiency targets for
ships, rail cars and inland storage depots. A list of performance targets
and reporting requirements is included in Annex 8.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. PUSRI, Current Financial Position
(a) General
6.01      Consolidated income accounts and balance sheets for PUSRI /1 for
the past five years, 1976-80, are given in Annex 9, Tables 9.1 and 9.2, and
are summarized below. These show that PUSRI is in a good financial position
and has consistently earned a reasonable annual return on average net fixed
assets in use, varying between 7.3% (1976) and 12.8% (1977). The
debt/equity ratio has improved, from a high of 55/45 in 1977, to 38/62 in
1980, and the current ratio has also improved, from 1.2 in 1976, to 1.6 in
1980.
6.02      The "other income" under "marketing" includes the compensation
received from the Government against losses incurred by the marketing
unit./2 Such compensation was the subject of assurances received by the
Bank on the occasion of loans for both the First Fertilizer Distribution
Project and the Third Fertilizer Expansion Project (PUSRI IV). The rationale
for including these payments in operating revenues is that, due to the
Government continuing to fix low selling prices for fertilizer, and low
margins for distribution, PUSRI's marketing unit is prevented from earning
revenues sufficient to produce a reasonable return on assets.
6.03      While the production unit has earned profits, the marketing unit
has consistently operated at a loss. The basic cause of the different
financial results for the two units lies in the margins resulting from the
prices fixed by the Government at the production and marketing levels. In
addition, as noted in para. 6.05, the production unit accounts include the
revenues and expenses related to shipping, bags, warehousing and handling at
the production sites. Thus, to this extent production unit net income is
overstated, and marketing unit net loss is overstated. Proposals to improve
the accounting are discussed in para. 6.14 and 6.15.
6.04      In an attempt to ensure that PUSRI would operate profitably, while
keeping the price to the farmers at a reasonably low level to encourage the
increased use of fertilizer, the Government adopted a two-tier pricing
formula. In effect, the Government buys urea for domestic consumption from
/1  Sources:  Audited statements for 1976-1980.
/2 Compensation received has been: 1976 - Rp 17.6 billion; 1977 -
Rp 18.5 billion; 1978 - Rp 11.2 billion; 1979 - Rp 20.3 billion; and
1980 - Rp 8.6 billion.

/a  The marketing unit sells other producers  fertilizer as well as
PUSRI:s own product.
PUSRI and other producers at a price which gives the company an adequate
profit on production and a reasonable rate of return on investment. It then
sells the fertilizer back to PUSRI, at a much lower price, for distribution
through a chain of selling agents. In theory, the price levels at which
PUSRI buys and sells fertilizer should provide an adequate margin to cover
its distribution costs. In practice, this has not been so due to rising
costs, owing to inflation, not being met by increases in sales margins, with
the result that in each year, the marketing unit's revenues have been
insufficient to cover its operating costs and overheads. The Government, in
accordance with assurances made to the Bank, compensated PUSRI for these
annual losses.
6.05      In April 1980, the Government revised the selling prices
applicable to the distribution system, and in August 1980, it revised the
prices to be paid for fertilizer production. The result of these revisions
was to provide PUSRI-s marketing and distribution unit with a margin of



- 52 -
about Rp 10,300 a ton for urea,/l to cover costs of ISDs, inland transport,
warehousing and handling (Table 6.4). In addition the price paid to
production units includes a margin of Rp 21,800 /2 to cover such
distribution costs as shipping, bags, warehousing and handling at the
production site (Table 6.5). The combined total of these margins, Rp 32,100
a ton, is, at current cost levels, adequate and PUSRI should be able to
absorb some increase in cost levels over time, and still earn a reasonable
return on its distribution assets. These revisions of margins compensate
for some added costs arising from PUSRI's wider responsibilities for
distributing all domestic and imported fertilizers.
6.06      The new price structure has helped improve PUSRI's marketing and
distribution unit's financial performance in 1980, as shown in the above
consolidated income account (Table 6.1), with a consequent reduction in
compensation needed from the Government, from Rp 20.3 billion in 1979, to
Rp 5.7 billion in 1980.
6.07      The return on average net fixed assets in use, 12% in 1978,
declined to 9.75% in 1979, and to 9.1% in 1980. The debt service coverage
in each of the three years has exceeded the minimum of 1.5 specified in the
loan agreement. These financial results have been satisfactory.
6.08      As discussed in detail in Chapter II-B, the current fertilizer
pricing policy in Indonesia implies substantial subsidies to the rice
farmers. These subsidies arise from: (a) the dual fertilizer pricing
system, under which fertilizer is sold at prices lower than production costs
plus distribution costs; (b) urea production cost itself is subsidized by
the low cost of gas; and (c) transport costs are subsidized by lower fuel
oil costs than world market levels. This arrangement, which has resulted in
farmers applying more fertilizer, thus increasing domestic production, is
simple, and much less administratively complicated than charging farmers
full prices and then trying to subsidize them directly.
6.09      With selling prices, both at the production and distribution
levels being controlled by the Government, there is no subsidy to PUSRI or
/1 The margins for other products are: TSP/DAP/NPK - Rp 18,000,
AS - Rp 16,000.
/2 This margin applies to urea, TSP/DAP/NPK and AS.



- 53 -
to other producers. However, in the past and present situation of inflation,
where costs inevitably rise, and government action in adjusting controlled
prices is tardy, occasions do arise when compensation must be paid to ensure
financial viability of the producers/distributors. The Government has agreed
so long as the price and distribution of fertilizer in Indonesia is
controlled, that PUSRI will be allowed to earn a reasonable rate of return
on its assets (para. 6.40).
6.10      Annual balance sheets, given in detail for the years ended

(b) Accounts and Audit
6.13      PUSRI has, with the assistance of consultants,/3 installed a
modern, cost-center, accounting system. Periodic income and expenditure
accounts, cash flows and balance sheets are regularly prepared for
management use and are sent to the Bank. The income accounts show
separately the results of the production unit and of the
marketing/distribution unit.
/1 Includes trade receivables of Rp 61.3 billion for the production uniit
(almost entirely due from BRI) and Rp 31.5 billion for marketing unit.
/2 Includes Rp 22.2 billion for production unit and Rp 11.4 billion for
marketing unit's fertilizer stocks. Remainder is plant spares and other
materials.
/3 Price Waterhouse Associates (International).



- 55 -
6.14      However, certain deficiencies still remain.  For instance,
although section 4.03 of the Project Agreement for the first Fertilizer
Distribution Project required PUSRI to prepare, on a proforma basis, yearly
statements of income and expenses and balance sheets, adequate to reflect
its fertilizer shipping, distribution and marketing operations, the reports
given to the Bank do not contain such detailed analytical data. Because the
price paid by the Government to PUSRI's production unit includes an element
for bags, some bagging, shipping and handling at Palembang, the periodic
income accounts show this revenue, and the relevant cost, accruing to the
production unit and not to the marketing/distribution unit. Balance sheet
assets and liabilities are not segregated under the two units. Therefore it
is not possible to easily arrive at the true financial performance of the
marketing/distribution function.
6.15      In addition, the management reports, while reporting financial
performance, do not contain the relevant physical performance figures. Thus
the unit costs of particular functions, such as shipping (bulk and RLS)
bagging, ISDs, road and rail costs, etc. are not readily available. While
the inclusion in the reported accounts of such costs as depreciation and
loan interest under the specific functional cost headings (shipping,
bagging, ISDs etc.) is needed in order to arrive at each function's cost,
the expenditure side of the income statements should also be arranged to
show total expenditure under type of cost, such as labor, fuel, other
materials, services, depreciation, interest, etc. During negotiations
agreement was reached that PUSRI will review this matter with its financial/
accounting advisors, and prepare a specific plan to improve the management
reporting, and the accounting changes needed to present more truly the
financial performance of the separate production and marketing units, for
discussion with the Bank by June 1982 and for implementation immediately
thereafter.
6.16      Auditing is currently carried out by an independent professional
accounting firm, D.L. Pamintori S. Indonesia, in association with Coopers and
Lybrand, International. Audited accounts have, in general, been received in
time, as agreed. Auditing procedures have been satisfactory. PUSRI has
installed an internal audit function.

B. Financial Projections for the Project
(a) General
6.17      The financial projections prepared by PUSRI, assisted by its
financial consultants Price Waterhouse Associates, (and revised as needed by
Bank staff) relate the incremental revenues and expenses arising from the
additional fertilizer expected to be distributed over the five years
1982-86, to the incremental investment needed to handle this fertilizer.
6.18      Forecast revenue and expenditure accounts and cash flows for the
project, covering the years 1983-86, are given in Annex 9, Tables 9.16 and
9.17. In addition, consolidated financial forecasts for PUSRI as a whole,
covering both the distribution and production aspects, are given in Tables
9.19, 9.20 and 9.21, for the same period. No forecast balance sheets are
given for the project, but forecast fixed asset values are shown in Table
9.19 and forecast long-term debt applicable to the project is given in Table
9.15. Similarly, in the forecast consolidated balance sheets, separate
figures for production and marketing unit assets and liabilities cannot be
given as PUSRI's accounting system does not, except for fixed assets,
readily permit segregation of such figures (para. 6.14).
6.19      The assumptions and detailed calculations supporting the project
financial forecasts are given in Annex 9. Basically, it is assumed that,
with inventories of urea, TSP/DAP/NPK and AS stabilizing at about 800,000
tons, PUSRI's marketing and distribution unit, aided by the additional
project facilities, will be able to handle annual fertilizer throughputs
rising from 2.6 million tons in 1980 to 5.4 million tons in 1986 (Annex 5,
Table 4)./l Finances for the project will be provided by the government in
the form of 75% debt and 25% equity. The debt is repayable over ten years,
after a three year grace period, at an interest rate of 13.5% per annum.
Interest during construction, amounting to about Rp 12,000 million, will
be borne by the government.
(b) Distribution Selling Margins
(i) General
6.20      The Government buys bulk and bagged fertilizers from producers at
prices sufficient to cover the cost of production, plus other costs
originating at production points, such as bags, bagging, handling and
shipping. It then sells the products back to PUSRI, at much lower prices,
for distribution. The final price to the farmer is Rp 70,000 per ton. The
difference between this and the price paid by PUSRI is intended to cover
PUSRI's marketing unit costs (transportation, storage, handling, overheads)
plus those relating to subdistributors and retailers.
/1 Including 600,000 tons in urea exports in 1986.



- 57 -
6.21      The profitability or otherwise of PUSRIVs marketing/distribution
system is very sensitive to the shipping element, given the existing total
distribution margin of Rp 32,000/ton. Bulk urea carried in PUSRI's own
specialized ships costs about Rp 7,130/ton, but bagged urea, carried in bulk
chartered vessels costs about Rp 20,500/ton (including handling costs) and
about Rp 24,300/ton by RLS vessels./l
6.22      The effect of these costs is illustrated by the following summary
cost table:
Using    Using
PUSRI  chartered   Using
bulk    bulk        RLS
ships    ships    vessels
------- (Rp/ton) --------
Shipping cost (including handling)        7,130   20,500   24,300

Depreciation and interest                   300       100       100
Overheads                                 1,400    1,400    1,400
Total cost per ton                 26,730   39,900   43,700
Distribution margin oer ton              32,000   32,000   32,000
6.23      This table shows that unless PUSRI has sufficient specialized
shipping, efficiently used, and if excessive dependence is placed on
chartered or RLS vessels, the profitability of the distribution system will
be substantially impaired. The forecasts assume that PUSRI's fleet will, in
fact, carry almost as much fertilizer in bulk as possible; however, in 1986
it appears evident that an additional bulk urea ship will be required.
Table 9.16 of Annex 9 shows the consequent increased domestic shipping costs
forecast for 1986./2
/1  According to PUSRI cost data; includes stevedoring into and out of the
vessels, and movement from and to bag storage.
/2  See also para. 6.37.  PUSRI has prepared a project request for a follow-
on project to involve additional ships.

(ii) Urea
a. Domestic
6.24      The breakdown of the current (April 1980)/1 urea distribution
margins is shown in Table 6.4. Certain costs (shipping and bagging in
particular) are not covered (see Table 6.5).

/a Java/Bali only. Different margins apply for other areas.
6.25      In addition, PUSRI receives the benefit of further distribution
revenues included in the price the Government pays at the production point.
The current (July 1980) margin as shown in Table 6.5 is Rp 21,765.
6.26      The  overall margin available for distribution and marketing is
thus Rp 32,091 (Rp 10,326 + Rp 21,765) and applies to urea sold in Java and
Bali. Margins for the other islands are higher, due to higher transport
costs. Where bagging is done at production points, such as Kujang, Kaltim,
Aceh/ASEAN (all for urea), and Gresik (for TSP/NPK/DAP and AS), PUSRI
receives a correspondingly lower margin (Annex 9, page 4).
/1 These margins are currently under review by the Government and are
expected to be increased to compensate for higher road and railway
tariffs announced in January 1982. The effect of these increased
costs has been taken into account in the financial projections
(Annex 2, C.13).

(iii) Export
6.27      PUSRI has been selling urea on the export market at prices ranging
from US$159/ton (Rp 99,375) to US$262/ton (Rp 163,790). For the financial
forecasts a figure of US$250/ton (Rp 156,250) has been adopted, which
compares with the Bank-s estimates of about US$270/ton by 1985. It is also
assumed that PUSRI's marketing unit will receive the margin between this
figure of US$250/ton and the price at which the Government purchases
fertilizer from the various producers,i.e., about Rp 77,000/ton.
(iv) Other Fertilizers
6.28      For TSP/DAP/NPK and AS, the price paid at the UPP is the same
(Rp 78,584/ton) as for urea, with the same margin for shipping, bagging,
etc. (Rp 21,765/ton).
(c) Income Projections
6.29      With no provision being made for inflation in the operating cost
forecasts, the projected operating revenues are based on the current (1980)



- 60 -
production and distribution margins discussed in para. 6.05. The extent to
which these margins may prove adequate over the period 1982-1986 is
discussed in paras. 6.35 and 6.37.
6.30       The forecast revenues and expenses for the project are given in
Annex 9, Table 9.16, and are summarized in Table 6.6 below:

Table 6.7.)
/b No debt service until 1985.
6.31       The annual returns on average net fixed assets shown in the above
table are high. This is largely due to the fact that the tonnages
distributed over the period 1982-86, and attributed to the project, are
utilizing some spare capacity existing at the end of 1980, in ISDs and
bagging plants, and in ships, arising from expected more efficient
utilization of PUSRI's existing fleet. In addition, considerable tonnages
of urea are expected to be exported, at a profitable selling price./l The
internal financial rate of return, 22.5% over 12 operating years, also
reflects this situation.
/1 Even excluding export sales, the return on net fixed assets would range
from 9% in 1983 to 20% in 1985 and 13% in 1986.

6.32      Table 9.16 of Annex 9 splits the forecast revenues and working
expenses (i.e., excluding depreciation and interest on debt) over export and
domestic operations, and Table 9.10 splits annual depreciation and interest
similarly. The following table (Table 6.7) summarizes the forecast income
account under exports and domestic distribution:

(d) Cash Flows
6.33      Forecast project cash flows for the years 1982-86 are given in
Annex 9, Table 9.17. With needed investment being financed by the Govern-
ment as explained in para. 6.19, the cash generated by the project has only
to pay income tax on earnings, plus debt service commencing in 1985. Thus,
there will be substantial annual cash surpluses, (Rp 20.5 billion in 1984
and Rp 11.1 billion in 1985), totalling Rp 37.5 billion over the period
1982-86.
(e) Balance Sheets
6.34      Projected balance sheets can only be given for PUSRI as a whole
(Annex 9, Table 9.21), because except for fixed assets, PUSRI has not pro-
vided balance sheet data analyzed over production and marketing functions.
Table 9.18 gives the annual changes in project fixed assets values (gross
and net) over the period 1982-86. The gross value is expected to rise from
Rp 1.6 billion in 1982 to Rp 70.7 billion in 1986, with net fixed assets
rising to Rp 61.6 billion in 1985, falling to Rp 57.1 billion by 1986.
Sensitivity Analyses
6.35      The financial forecasts have been reviewed in the light of the
following variations:
(a) increase of 10% in project investment cost;
(b) increase of 10% in project working costs;
(c) decrease in total demand of 10%; and
(d) the effect of an inflationary increase of 10% p.a. in working
costs.
Table 9.22 of Annex 9 gives the detailed results of items (a), (b) and (c)
which are summarized in Table 6.8 below.
6.36      These calculations show that even taking all three factors into
account, the return on net fixed assets would still be satisfactory, except
in 1983, and the cash surplus would still be substantial. The internal
financial rate of return /1 would also be satisfactory.
6.37      An inflationary increase of 10% p. a. in working costs would raise
total annual distribution costs by the following amounts (Table 6.9).
/1 12 % after tax, 16% before tax.

1982                        1,520
1983                        5,426

1986                       46,821
Comparing these figures with the annual net income before tax as given in
Annex 9, Table 9.17, indicates that by 1985 the project would incur losses
before tax in the absence of an increase in the distribution margins.  In
order just to break even, in these years, increases in domestic sales margin
of the order of 18% would be needed in 1985, followed by a further 44% in
1986.  However if, as is likely, PUSRI were to put in operation an additional
bulk urea ship by 1986,/l the financial results would be much better in that
year, thus requiring a lower increase in margin.
/1 Table 9.5 of Annex 9 shows that in 1986, availability of an additional
bulk urea ship would reduce considerably the need to use expensive
chartered bulk shipping in that year.

C. Consolidated Financial Forecasts for PUSRI /1
6.38       PUSRI has prepared financial forecasts in the following form:
(a)  PUSRI I - IV (Production and Marketing);
(b)  PUSRI V (Production and Marketing);
(c)  Proposed National Fertilizer Distribution Project; and
(d)  Consolidation of (a), (b) and (c) above.
The consolidated forecasts, revised as needed, are given in Tables 9.19, 9.20
and 9.21 in Annex 9. The consolidated income accounts, cash flows and
balance sheets for years 1982-86 are summarized in Table 6.10 below.
The consolidated return on net fixed assets would range between 12-20%;
working capital ratios between 1.7-2.2, and debt/equity ratios 42/58
falling to 25/75, all of which are satisfactory.
D. Conclusions
6.39       The proposed project is profitable and will benefit PUSRI's
finances. The combined production and distribution margins are currently
adequate to enable PUSRI to earn a satisfactory financial return; even
should working costs increase by 10% annually, these margins would be
adequate until the end of 1984 when they would have to be increased.
6.40       During negotiations, covenants similar to those in the first
Fertilizer Distribution Project (1139-IND) agreements were obtained for
PUSRI as a whole in respect of: (i) depreciation policy, (ii) incurring of
additional long-term debt, (iii) the earning of a reasonable rate of return
on assets in service, (iv) debt service coverage, (v) maintenance of a
current ratio of at least 1.4; (vi) dividend policy, and (vii) annual audit.
In addition, the undertaking by the Government under Loan 1139-IND, thaLt
during any period in which the sale and distribution of fertilizer in
Indonesia is controlled by the Government, no action would be taken by the
Government with respect to fertilizer sold in Indonesia which would prevent
PUSRI from earning a reasonable return on its assets, was reconfirmed.
/1 Income accounts, cash flows and balance sheets.
/2 Return on assets used in production is guaranteed under the various
loans made for urea production.

INDONESIA
NATIONAL FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
A. Summary Description of Previous Bank Assistance
in Transport Development
HIGHWAYS
1.        Bank Group lending for highways in Indonesia has evolved in line
with the needs of the highway system. The First Highway Project for US$28
million equivalent (Credit 154-IND, June 1969) helped restore communications
in Indonesia after a long period of neglect by providing equipment and mate-
rials for rehabilitation of about 3,000 km of roads. In addition, the project
included finance for workshop equipment and for consulting services to improve
maintenance. The project was coupled with a large technical assistance effort
from UNDP (with the Bank as executing agency) which covered all aspects of
highway operations. While the First Project made a significant contribution
to rehabilitation of individual roads, its most important results lay in the
help it provided in the management of the overall rehabilitation program and
in establishing the basis for sound highway institutions at the national level
(see the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR), SecM78-524, June 20, 1978).
2.        The Second and Third Highway Projects supported the next phase of
Indonesia's road program: construction of selected major links in the more
remote areas of the country. The Second Project for US$34 million (Credit
260-IND, June 1971) primarily helped rebuild a section of the Trans-Sunatera
Highway in an area which has since become a major site for transmigration, and
is being developed under the Bank's Second Transmigration Project (Loan
1707-IND - Credit 919-IND). The Third Project for US$14 million (Credit
388-IND, May 1973) helped finance reconstruction of a road to a new irrigation
area in Sulawesi. Both these projects also made significant contributions
toward planning future road works as they provided for studies on the trunk
road between Medan and Padang in Sumatera and on the regional road system in
Central and South Sumatera, and studies for road improvements on over 2,300 km
of roads in various parts of Indonesia. The Third Highway Project also
included an important training component which initiated courses and set up a
nationwide training system for highway personnel. A combined PPAR (SecM81-4)
for the Second and Third Project was issued on January 6, 1981.
3.        The Fourth Highway Project for US$130 million (Loan 1236-IND, March
1976) represented a new departure in several ways. It included a detailed
review of the overall program and (i) sponsored the establishment of
regional offices to evaluate, design and supervise the construction of better-
ment works according to uniform national criteria; (ii) supported a large-



69 -                       ANNEX 1
Page 2
scale and complex program of major construction projects; (iii) included
assistance to strengthen virtually all functions of the Directorate General of
Highways (DGH); (iv) helped initiate studies of other institutions concerned
with highways; and (v) provided for studies of highway laws, road user
charges, and vehicle weights and dimensions criteria. The Fourth Project
responded to the sudden increase in the road betterment program which was
made possible by the new funds available to Indonesia after the oil price
rise in 1973.
4.        The results of the Fourth Project have been significant.  Not
only have over 1,200 km of road improvements been put under contract, with
more than 600 km of these already completed, but positive changes have been
effected in planning, design, budgeting, and control procedures of DGH.
Studies have also been completed on major policy issues such as usercharges,
vehicle weights and dimensions, and on rural roads. The feasibility study
and detailed engineering for the Jakarta-Cikampek Corridor Project, which
will be considered by the Board in Sept. 1981, was financed under the Fourth
Highway Project. The project is about 80% completed, but because of the
early delays and because one road section had to be retendered, the Closing
Date of the loan has been postponed by two years to December 31, 1982.
5.        The scope of the Fourth Project was further broadened in the Fifth
Highway Project (Loan 1696-IND, May 1979) to cover all important programs of
DGH and of Indonesia. The Fifth Project provides finance for: (a) components
of DGH's bridge replacement program; (b) some works executed by provincial
public work departments; (c) measures to study and improve the highway insti-
tutions in some provincial governments; (d) upgrading road maintenance; and
(e) strengthening Indonesian highway consultants and contractors. The Fifth
Highways Project expands the approach adopted under the preceeding project,
i.e. elaboration of design and construction metholodogies and procedures espe-
cially adapted to Indonesian conditions to enable DGH easy and quick defini-
tion of project elements to be financed under the loan (betterment works,
bridge replacement and DPUP programs); promotion and development of the local
consulting sector; continued technical assistance to the central and regional
highway authorities, and arranging for further decentralization of highway
administration functions.
SHIPPING AND PORTS
6.        The Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation Project (Credit 318-IND; June
1972) provided $8.5 million during 1973-77 for financing rehabilitation of
ships and technical assistance to shipyards, the Indonesian ship classifica-
tion organization (under German bilateral aid) and the state bank, BAPINDO,
refinancing rehabilitation. Because of sharply increased costs, the total
tonnage rehabilitated was only about half of the original target. A Project
Completion Report (PCR) on this project was issued on April 13, 1981 which



- 70 -                         ANNEX 1
Page 3
concluded that, even though the project failed to meet its objectives in the
number and tonnage of ships repaired (due partly to stringent banking require-
ments) and in stimulating increased awareness of maritime safety within the
Government, the project assisted in establishing a specialized maritime
lending capability in Indonesia and achieved substantial economic returns on
the ships which were repaired.
7.        The Second Shipping Project (Loan 1250-IND; May 1976), initiated
in 1976, provided $54 million for the further rehabilitation and expansion
of the inter-island fleet through a National Fleet Development Corporation
which procured and leased or sold ships to shipping companies. The project
envisaged rehabilitation of about 54,000 DWT of existing ships, procurements
of about 52,000 DWT of used ships and about 50,000 DWT of new ships (to be
constructed with Norwegian aid), and scrapping of about 70,000 DWT of exist-
ing ships which could not be rehabilitated. In addition, technical assist-
ance was provided for improving interisland fleet operations and planning,
for training of marine officers and engineers, and for a study of future
shipping requirements.  Although the rate of procurement was initially much
slower than had been anticipated due to ineffective implementation of the
scrapping program and higher costs following devaluation, all funds for ship
procurement will be committed by the end of 1981, one year later than the
original closing date. Rehabilitation of ships has not proceeded according
to plan and scrapping has been slowed. The program of technical assistance
has been implemented successfully, although there has been slow progress on
the training program. The technical assistance element of the project will
be extended to the end of 1982 under an extension of the closing date in
order to complete the training program and certain other contracts for tech-
nical assistance, particularly in the field of ship design and safety
training.
8.        The Tanjung Priok Port Project (Loan 1337-IND; November 1976) pro-
vided $32 million starting in 1977 for expanding the capacity of the country's
major port in Jakarta.  It included completion of 900 m of berth and associa-
ted facilities, including those for containerized cargo, construction of 545 m
of berth in a new regional harbor, improvement of land access to the port,
and technical assistance and consultant studies. Construction of the berths
is essentially completed and construction in the Regional Harbor is progress-
ing well. However, works required to improve land access cannot be completed
on schedule and the loan closing date may be extended by one year. A revised
master plan will be completed in 1981 and engineering for the works proposed
to be included in a Maritime Loan (FY83) will be undertaken with finance
from the proposed National Fertilizer Distribution Loan.

RAILWAYS
9.        During 1975-79, the First Railways Project (Loan 1005-IND; June
1974) provided $48 million for rehabilitation and improvement of the national
railways operated by the state railway organization, PJKA. The project
included rehabilitation of track, rehabilitation and procurement of locomo-
tives and rolling stock, rehabilitation and procurement of other facilities
and equipment, and technical assistance for management, training and procure-
ment, and overseas training. Implementation of the project required two
more years than scheduled, and in retrospect it appears that the total invest-
ment program was too large for PJKA to handle even with substantial assistance
from foreign consultants (see the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR)
draft, March 5, 1981).
FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION
10.       The Fertilizer Distribution Project (Loan 1139-IND; July 1978)
initiated in 1975 and providing $68 million, helped to expand the capacity
to distribute the increasing volumes of urea produced by the national ferti-
lizer corporation PUSRI. The project, which was expanded from cost savings,
included procurement of bulk carrier ships, locomotives and rolling stock
for the railways, construction of three new bulk reception and bagging
stations and expansion of two others and of inland storage facilities.
Implementation proceeded on schedule and at anticipated costs. A Project
Completion Report (PCR) , dated June 15, 1981, stated that the project was
successful in spite of the fact that PJKA was unable to operate block trains
for fertilizer until late 1980 and that PUSRI's shipping operations were not
as efficient as the company expected.  In spite of these operational problems,
which were being dealt with successfully in early 1981, about 20% more ferti-
lizer moved through the distribution system than had been planned for at
appraisal.
B. Summary Description of Previous Bank Assistance
in the Fertilizer Sector
FERTILIZER PRODTJCTION
11.       Fertilizer is crucial to the success of the Indonesian Government's
e ffbrts to increase the production of food and cash crops. On the Inner
Islands of Java and Bali, where limited additional arable land is available,
increased production depends on raising yields which can be achieved through
application of optimum dosages of fertilizers in combination with improved and



- 72 -
ANNEX 1
Page 5
increased irrigation water supplies, use of high yielding and disease resis-
tant seeds, and proper application of pesticides.  The Government began to
produce small quantities of fertilizer in 1964 and 1965 based on fuel oil at
P.T. Petrokimia Gresik, in East Java (4,5000 tons urea and 150,000 tons of AS
per year) and on natural gas at P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja (PUSRI) at Palembang,
South Sumatera, where the first plant produced 100,000 tons of urea per year.
12.       The Bank Group assisted in organizing a consortium of international
aid agencies to finance a modern 380,000 ton per year urea plant at Palembamg
(PUSRI II) through a US$35 million equivalent credit, Fertilizer Expansion
Credit (Credit 193-IND; June 15, 1970). A National Fertilizer Study was also
financed. This study developed a program to expand fertilizer production,
marketing and consumption. A Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR), issued
on March 3, 1978, concluded that the project was highly successful even
though there were substantial cost and time overruns. In 1974, as PUSRI II
was nearing completion, the Government decided to construct PUSRI III, a
large (513,000 tons per year) plant also as Palembang utilizing additional
gas supplies available in South Sumatera. The Bank-s Second Fertilizer
Expansion Project (Loan 1089-IND; February 28, 1975) provided US$115 milLion
equivalent to cover part of the cost of this expansion.
13.       With growing demand for urea fertilizers -- during 1968-75 fertili-
zer consumption i-ncreased at an average rate of 21% annually -- the Government
decided to exnand tOe successful PUSRI complex further prior to completion
of PUSRI III. The Bank and the Saudi Fund for Development each provided
US$70 million equivalent to finance part of the cost of PUSRI IV, a duplicate
of the PUSRI III plant. A Third Fertilizer Expansion Project (Loan 1254--IND;
May 20, 1976) was made prior to completion of the second expansion project.
These plant expansions were successfully completed and operated efficiently.
A Project Completion Report (PCR) dealing with PUSRI III and IV was issued
on January 29, 1981. The PCR reviewed the Bank's experience with three
fertilizer projects in Indonesia and concluded that they had been remarkably
successful for five reasons. These were: (i) PUSRI used expatriate help
from established firms for project execution and worked harmoniously with
them; (ii) they used competent legal assistance to negotiate contracts, to
get competent help from foreign engineering firms, and to overcome promptly
any contractual problems; (iii) PUSRI had capable management with continuity,
who delegated authority and this helped project implementation; (iv) PUSRI
had full support from the Government; and (v) while using expatriates, PIJSRI
ensured that special emphasis was given to training its own people abroad
and in special training facilities constructed in connnection with PUSRI IV.

NATIONAL FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION FORECAST
Regional Forecasts of Fertilizer Consumption
Past Trends
1.         Fertilizer consumption in Indonesia grew at an average rate of
14.5% between 1970 and 1979, with growth in use by the foodcrops sector a
little faster (15% p.a.) than in the estates sector (13% p.a.).

2.        Much of the growth can be attributed to increased consumption since
1976, since when the average annual increase has been over 20%.  For food-
crops, the principal fertilizers are those domestically produced-urea, TSP,
DAP, AS and NPK compounds. For estates, there is greater reliance on
imported fertilizers including potassic fertilizers and rock phosphate. By
1979, the consumption of fertilizers for the two sectors were as follows:

3.        On foodcrops, the NPK ration was 4:1:0.1, and on estates, 3:1:3.
Use of potassic fertilizer's on foodcrops is minimal, but BIMAS has begun to
encourage higher applications by recommending its application in the ratio
of 3:1:1 in a package introduced at the beginning of the 1979/80 wet season.
4.        Consumption growth patterns have been significantly different on
Java, where fertilizer use has shown a fairly steady 13-15% annual increase
throughout the decade, from other islands, where growth leapt from 13% p.a.
in the early part of the 1970s to 36% p.a. since 1976. This acceleration of
growth affected all regions except Bali/Nusa Tenggara and Kalimantan, where
growth was particularly high early in the decade:

Changes in 1980
5.        In 1980, fertilizer consumption increased by 50%, an event that
has been associated with a much improved ratio between paddy and fertiizer
prices, and a particularly good wet season, relatively free of pest infes-
tation, which encouraged multiple crop planting and a record rice crop.
The increase was shared amongst all regions, although growth on Java pre-
dominated. Growth was faster for TSP/DAP than for Urea:

6.        Early estimates of the 1981 crop indicate another record year,
with 20.2 million tons being harvested. PUSRI's preliminary estimates
of fertilizer sales show a 19% growth. These sustained high rates since
1979 imply a continuing change in the way fertilizer is being used, and
forecasts are made by considering potential growth in agricultural acti-'
vities rather than past consumption alone.
Forecasts of Fertilizer Use
7.        Forecasts are made separately for wetland rice, upland rice and
other foodcrops, and estate crops. For all three groups, estimates are
based on estimates of crop-lands and fertilizer application rates, and
take account of major projects to improve agricultural infrastructure.
Wetland Rice
8.        Traditionally, wetland rice farmers are the largest users of
fertilizer; although data is not available on fertilizer used in different
crop sectors, fertilizer sales and average application rates are highest
in irrigated rice growing areas.

9.         Forecasts were made on two bases.  The first uses Bank projections
made in 1979/1 of areas cropped under four different farming categories,
with estimates of fertiizer use based on average application rates for each
category. In these projections, wetland rice area cropped is forecast to
increase by 1.2 million ha, or 16%, by 1985. Nearly 90% of this area
increase will be off-Java. As well, there will be significant changes in
in cropping intensities. On Java, the projections show 64% of wetlands areas
being cultivated with methods equivalent to the BIMAS Special (high dosage)
recommended packages, compared with 385 in 1980. On other islands the
balance will shift from three-quarters of wetlands cultivated with normal
or low fertilizer applications, to three-quarters under special or intensive
cultivation. With these changes, urea use on wetland rice would increase to
1.9 million tons by 1985 and TSP to 420,000, with most of the increase on
other islands:

10.       Taken together with similarly based estimates for upland rice and
secondary food crops, the 1980 base estimates of food crops fertilizer use
are consistent with sales data:

11.       The second estimate made for wetland rice fertilizer consumption
therefore concentrates on two aspects (a) the potential effect of changes
in rice cropping intensities that occurred in 1980, and not foreseen in
the 1979 analysis; and (b) a finer breakdown of future consumption patterns
in other islands, necessary for the analysis of the fertilizer distribution
system.
12.       This estimate is based largely on a review of recent changes in
rice production in Indonesia/i which estimates that:
(a)  in 1980, about 10% of irrigated rice land on Java that was
being double-cropped in 1978, was tripple cropped;
(b)  ultimately, triple cropping could spread to 375,000 ha in
Centra Java and 250,000 ha in East Java.
13.       These changes are closely related to the use of IR36 rice varieties
which have a short (90-day) growing season. In 1980 with excellent water
availability and little pest infestation, many farmers shortened the gap
normaly allowed to minimize the risk of pest carryover to a new crop, and
achieved two wet season crops. This meant a third crop in some areas, and
a second crop in areas where a dry season crop was not planted.

Page 7 of 9
14.       The second estimates for wetland rice fertilizer use, based on these
changes, are made by:
(a) estimating the potential changes in land area cropped, taking tri-
ple cropping as above and assuming that all irrigated wetlands can
eventually be double cropped;
(b) estimating changes in rice production from the changes in cropping
intensity, and the spread of IR36; and
(c) estimating resulting changes in fertilizer consumption using an
incremental yield ratio of 3.8 tons paddy per product ton of
fertilizer.   Details are given in working paper C 1.
15.,      The timing of these changes is uncertain--depending both on
uncontrollable weather and pest cycles, and on the effectiveness of extension
services and irrigation improvements, particularly off-Java. On Java, with
favorable seasons, the changes could be expected to occur fairly quickly.
If all changes are completed by 1985, and assuming the urea/TSP ratio
remaains at 4:1, fertilizer consumption for wetland rice would be:

16.       This estimate confirms that growth on Java is likely to continue
to be significantly lower than on other islands, even allowing for some
skepticism at the rate at which the expansion in some of these regions
(e.g. Kalimantan) may be achieved.  The forecasts used for the appraisal
uses the broad regional patterns of the second estimate, with growth
modified somewhat, in the context of overall foodcrops sector consumption.

Upland Rice Secondary Food Crops Projections
17.       With fairly stable production patterns in these crops, projections
of fertilizer consumption are based on the 1979 cropping areas projections,
and split by regions according to areas forecast to be harvested for the
different crops.
18.       As with wetland rice, the cropping area projections foresee changes
in both areas and cultivation intensities. Overall area increases are most
important for secondary food crops, with an expansion of 702,000 ha (12%)
foreseen. On Java, areas used for upland rice are expected to contract. A
net expansion of about 7-1/2% is foreseen. Average fertilizer application
rates for upland rice are similar to those for wetland cultivation, and
those for secondary food crops, somewhat lower.
Overall Forecasts for Foodcrops
19.       The second estimate for wetland rice leads to a somewhat highaer
forecast of foodcrops fertilizer use than the first, and about one-third
above the Ministry of Agriculture's forecast of a 12% annual fertilizer
consumption growth:

20.       Because of the substantial agreement between the first estimate
and the Ministry of Agriculture forecast, the Ministry's projection of
overall foodcrops fertilizer consumption is used. The regional patterns
of growth are based on second estimate for wetland rice, but imply a slower
rate of change in farming practices, particularly on outer islands.
Estates Crops
21.       Forecasts of fertilizer consumption for estates crops are made by
applying 1980 average application rates to planned areas of estates crops
expansion and rehabilitation under Repelita III. A check, and appropriate
adLjustments, were made for the projected fertilizer requirements for
Bank-financed projects in the estates sector, particularly those in regions
where overall fertilizer consumption levels are low (Kalimantan and eastern
Indonesia).

Notes and Sources:
1. Prices paid by the Government to the producers which covers production cost
and allows a return on plant assets for urea, based on PUSRI costs.
2.  Economic cost of domestic production, being estimated by (a) adjusting the
price of natural gas feedstock from US$0.65 per million BTU to US$1.75 per
million BTU for those plants using gas from small fields which cannot juis-
tify capital-intensive liquification plants for LNG exports; these are
PUSRIIs plant at Palembang, and the PT Pupuk Kujang plant at Cikampek, West
Java; and (b) adjusting the natural gas price to US$2.89 per million BTU
for plants drawing on fields with export potential; these are the plants
under construction for ASEAN at Aceh, and for PT Pupuk Kaltim at Bontang,
East Kalimantan.
3. Current f.o.b. prices for fertilizer from IPD; prices (a) for TSP is the
current price, price (b) is the EPD estimated long-term price.
4. Estimated ocean freight per ton of fertilizer taken at US$30.
5. Prices at which PUSRI repurchases domestically produced fertilizer for dis-
tribution.
6. Official retail price at line IV; actual prices paid vary between regions
according to variations in line IV distributor-s costs and profit margins.
7. Consumption figures for 1980, from PUSRI, include both foodcrops and estate
sectors.
8. Estimates the reduction in gas company revenues because of the low price
urea producers are permitted to pay; calculation is based on total 1980
consumption times the differences between Line (1) and the (a) and (b) eco-
nomic cost in Line (2>.
9.  Total consumption times the difference between the two governnent prices in
Lines (1) and (5).
10. Estimated on the basis of the 1980 distribution pattern and the subsidies
on transport fuels applying after the May 1980 retail price increases.
11. Total of Lines (8)-(10); measures the national cost as the difference
between the official retail price and the economic costs for domestic pro-
duction and distribution.
12. Estimated national cost of the fertilizer subsidy, calculated as the dif-
ference between the official retail prices and the distributed cost for
imported fertilizer.

NATIONAL FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
FINANCIAL TABLES
A. PUSRI Current Financial Position
Detailed consolidated income statements and balance sheets for
PUSRI covering the years 1976-80 are given in Tables 9.1 and 9.2.
B. Forecast Distribution Revenues
General
1.        The financial projections have been prepared on an incremental
sales, cost and revenue basis, with 1980 as the base year for production,
distribution and costs.
2.        Annual revenues are forecast separately for sales of urea,
TSP/DAP/NPK, Ammonium Sulphate (AS) and liquid ammonia (NH3).
3.        Sales are based on: "Fertilizer Production, Consumption and
Inventories" (Annex 5, Table 1.4 of the Staff Appraisal Report)./l
4.        After 1980, all production plus imports is assumed to be consumed
domestically, except for urea of which:
(a) 40% of P.T. Asean Aceh production is reserved for export to
Asean nations; and
(b) part will be surplus production from other plants, largely from
P.T. Pusri V/Aceh which is assumed to be exported. No exports are
expected for TSP/DAP/NPK or AS, even although supply indicates a
surplus, due to the need for a heavy government subsidy in order
to be price competitive. It has accordingly been assumed that
actual production will be restricted to equal consumption.
/1 This table also includes forecast import tonnages.



- 110 -                        ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 8
5.        Although the distribution margins, as fixed by the Government,
vary with the region, the margins relevant to Region A (Java plus Bali),
which consumes approximately 85% of total urea in the country, have been
used for the entire throughput./l
6.        The consequent revenue per ton earned by the distribution system
has been calculated as follows:
(i) Domestic Production and Consumption
Domestic production                             Urea     TSP/DAP/NPK        AS
(a)  Price at U.P.P. (Gov't Decree) /a        78,584        78,584        78,584
Less cost of production (inc.
profit margin and oil price
increase)                            (56,819)      (56,819)      (56,819)
Contribution to distribution system   21,765          21,765        21,765
(b)  Price ex I.S.D (Gov't Decree)            59,420        59,420        54,520
Less purchase price for
distribution                         (49,094)      (41,402)      (38,493)
Contribution to distribution system   10,326          18,018        16,027
(c) Total revenue for distribution
system ((a) + (b))                    32,091        39,783        37,792
Rounded off at                          32,000        40,000        38,000
/a  Includes provision for cost of warehousing, shipping, bags and handling.
Adjustments must be made where bagging and warehousing are carried out
at non-PUSRI UPPs (See item B.4.).
NH3 revenue has been considered as freight only, by ship purchased for this
purpose, as other costs and contribution are expected to be passed to the
production unit. Production is assumed to commence in the first quarter of
1984, and be maintained at the same level of 149,000 tons per year there-
/1 Margins for regions further from production points are larger, to allow
for higher transportation costs.



ANNEX 9
- 111 -                        Page 3 of 8
after.  Distribution is assumed to be:  47,000 tons to Gresik and 102,000
tons to the Philippines.  The revenue (freight only) is estimated at US$35
(Rp 21,675)/ton.
(ii) Imports
(a) Urea - imports are minimal (1981 only) and therefore the contribu-
tion is considered equivalent to domestic, as (i) above; and
(b) TSP/DAP/NPK and AS are imported and shipped directly to UPPs.
Therefore the revenue for shipping cannot be considered. Also, AS
is imported in bags, thus no revenue for bags/bagging can be
considered. The adjusted revenues for these products are as
follows (in Rupiahs/ton):
Imported
TSP/DAP/NPK           AS
Contribution to distribution
system as in (i)(a) above                         21,765           21,765
Less shipping/BBM cost                               (9,121)          (9,121)
Bags and bagging cost                                   -          (11,828)
Adjusted contribution                             12,644               816
Contribution at ISDs, as in (i)(b)                   18,018           16,027
Total contribution on imports                  30,662           16,843
Rounded off at                                                  17,000
(iii) Export Revenue (urea only)
7.        PUSRI has conservatively estimated a C&F export price of US$250
(Rp 156,250) per ton./l Deducting from this the UPP cost of Rp 78,584 /2
per ton, leaves a net contribution to distribution system of Rp 77,666,
rounded off to Rp 77,000/ton.
/ The Bank's latest estimate is for about US$270/ton by 1985.
/2 Includes production unit profit margin.

9.        PUSRI gives the following cost data (for 1980):
Rp million
(i)  Variable Costs (Total)                        6,889
Tonnage carried                         1,135,000 tons
.. Variable cost per ton                Rp 6,070/ton
say Rp 6,100/ton
(ii)  Fixed Costs                                  Rp million
General administration                         555
Allocation of H.O. expenses                    201
Insurance                                       81
Taxes                                            1
Subtotal (x)                              838
Depreciation/amortization                    1,380
Interest                                     1,813
Subtotal (y)                           4,031
Total number of ships                       4
Average fixed cost of: (x) per ship    Rp   210
(y) per ship    Rp 1,008
As depreciation and interest costs are entered separately, and in total, in
the projected income accounts, only (x) is taken into account.



ANNEX 9
-113 -                       Page 5 of 8
(b) Charter ships
10.       PUSRI has been paying an average of about Rp 16,000/ton charter
shipping charge for bulk fertilizers. Unloading cost is estimated at Rp
4,500/ton, making a total cost of Rp 20,500/ton.
11.       R.L.S. Shipping Costs (bagged fertilizer).  On the basis of actual
costs for chartering Takari ships, the average shipping cost per ton has
been about Rp 18,300. PUSRI's shipping department has estimated the
additional loading and unloading cost to be about Rp 6,000/ton making a
total cost of Rp 24,300/ton for domestic traffic. For exports, in view
of the longer distances, 50% has been added giving an estimated cost of
Rp 36,450/ton.
12.       Rail/Road Transportation Costs.  Since Java consumes almost 80% of
the fertilizers distributed by PUSRI, the rail/road transport costs are pro-
jected on the basis of costs in Java. To date, rail transport of fertilizer
has all been in Java. The average distance has been 200 km, for which the
current PJKA tariff is now Rp 32 per ton/km, i.e., Rp 6,400/ton. For road
transport the average rate is now Rp 10,500/ton. In 1980, PJKA carried 28%
of the urea moved in Java (plus only 600 tons of TSP). Due to the much
cheaper cost of rail transport PUSRI wishes to increase the overall
proportion of rail transport to 60%, leaving 40% for road transport. In
view of the difficulty expected in improving PJKA-s ability to carry such an
increased traffic, in bulk trains, it has been assumed that the rail/road
ratio would improve gradually from 30/70 in 1981 to 60/40 by 1987.
13.       Bagging Costs.  PUSRI's 1980 financial data gives the following
costs:
Total UPP costs                                     Rp   347 million
Less:  Interest                Rp 416 million
Depreciation               705 million
Insurance, etc.             68 million
H. Q. allocation           610 million        1,799 million
Net variable costs                         Rp 4,548 million
With 1,092,736 tons being handled at PUSRI's UPPs in 1980, the average
varlable cost was Rp 4,200/ton, to which must be added the cost of bags,
Rp 4,800/ton making Rp 9,000/ton in all. This financial and tonnage data
refers only to PUSRI's bagging operations, i.e. it excludes operations at
KUJANG, Gresik and at PGIP, Jakarta./l
/1 Accordingly, the revenue projections for distribution of this fertilizer
must be calculated on margins excluding the allowance for bagging at
these UPPs.

ANNEX 9
Page 6 of 8
14.       Regarding fixed charges, as depreciation and interest charges will
be shown separately in total, in the financial projections, they can be
disregarded, thus leaving Rp 678 million as the 1980 level.
Marketing Overhead Costs
15.       Total Regional and Corporate marketing costs for 1980 appear in
PUSR's accounts as follows:

16.       Item 6 includes road/rail costs of transporting fertilizer.  In
the forecasts these road/rail costs are entered separately and must be
excluded from overheads.
17.       Item 7 includes depreciation of ISD-s, offices etc. and Item 8
includes loan interest, both of which are forecast separately on Table 9.10
and must also be excluded.
18.       The remaining items include costs relating to ISDs, also forecast
separately in Table 9.9, and which must be excluded.
