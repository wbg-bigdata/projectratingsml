REPUBLIC OF CHAD
HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:           Republic of Chad
Implementing
Agency:             Agency for Household Energy and Environment (AEDE)
Beneficiaries:      Ministry of Mines, Energy and Petroleum (MMEP)
Ministry of Environment and Water Resources (MEE)
Rural and Urban Households
Amount:             SDR 4.0 million (US$5.27 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard IDA terms, with 40 year maturity, including 10 years grace
Project Objectilves. The key objective of the project is to provide an economic and
sustainable supplly of energy for households. Least cost supply and sustainability are being
achieved througlh a community based participatory approach and environmental awareness.
The specific objectives of the project are to: (i) promote the establishment of the sustainable
production of woodfuel in selected villages providing energy to the capital, N'Djamena; (ii)
strengthen the capacity of the Borrower to extend such production elsewhere; (iii) carry out
institutional reforms in the household energy sector; and (iv) improve efficiency in the use of
household energy.
Project Description: The project comprises four components that will be implemented over
four years: (a) establishing village-based natural resource management; (b) monitoring and
control of wood product flows; (c) improvement in the efficiency of household fuel use; and
(d) project management which includes capacity building and training. On the supply side,
which accounts for about 80% of project costs, simple long-term village-based land-use and
wood exploitation plans will be prepared for the N'Djamena wood fuel catchment area; these
plans are based on an assessment of wood resources, and economic activities in the
surroundings of the villages, focusing on a more rational and participatory approach to
management of wood resources. Efficient charcoal conversion techniques will also be
promoted in those areas where charcoal is produced. A system will be established to monitor
the inflow of wood products from rural production zones into N'Djamena. An effective
environmental policy instrument guiding transporters towards areas where least-cost wood is
available will be implemented. On the demand side, the commercialization of efficient
cooking stoves by private agents will account for about 20 percent of project costs; suitable
stove models will be identified through NGOs and a promotional campaign will be launched
to encourage the private sector to adopt the program. The project will also promote the
commercialization of low-cost kerosene and LPG stoves by private agents and seek ways to
increase the efficiency of their supply system.

Project Benefits: The main benefits for the project are to ensure a sustainable supply of
economic household fuels and to prevent agricultural productivity losses from the
environmental degradation caused by the unregulated clear cutting of wood. Other benefits,
include the improvement of rural incomes by charging rural communities with the
responsibility of managing and commercializing the wood resources in their areas. The
additional incomes will be particularly significant for the poorer rural households in the wood-
producing areas. The main quantifiable benefit of introducing efficient cooking equipment is
the financial savings due to a reduction of cooking fuel use. Other benefits are the decrease of
the negative health impacts of using traditional stoves and a reduction of CO2 emissions.
Risks: Three risks exist: (a) the commitment of communities to effectively implement the
wood management plans; (b) the efficiency of the system for controlling and monitoring wood
entries in N'Djamena which might be diminished by fraud and non-cooperation of certain
actors (esp. the military); and (c) the social obstacles which might arise from the wood fuel
fiscal reform required to introduce economic pricing, namely the need to levy a wood fuel
surcharge (equivalent to a user fee) to bring market price in line with the opportunity cost of
wood fuels. These risks will be minimized through: (i) the up-front commitment on the part
of Government to proceed with the proposed reforms, as has already been demonstrated by
the enactment of the forestry law; (ii) the anticipated strong commitment of local communities
to manage the available resources in their surroundings; (iii) the design of a simple and
transparent system to monitor and control wood fuels; (iv) an awareness campaign on the use
of more efficient stoves; (v) the participatory approach to project design and implementation;
and (vi) the limited role of Government in project implementation combined with the
emphasis on capacity building for public, private, communal, and NGO stakeholders.

REPUBLIC OF CHAD
HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT
1. PROJECT SETTING AND RATIONAL
PROJECT'S CONRIBUTION TO POVERTY REDUCTION, ENvIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,
AND RURAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
1.1 The proposed Household Energy Project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy and the Environmental Action Plan, and directly supports four of the CAS main
objectives: Poverty alleviation, rural and private sector development, and environmental
protection. The project will generate income in rural areas, optimize the use of local wood
resources, and protect the long-term environmental sustainability and rural livelihood. Health
benefits will be obtained, particularly for women and children, through the use of more
efficient stoves. Finally, a reduction in the deforestation rate will yield global benefits in
terms of reduced carbon dioxide emissions.
1.2 The economy of Chad is in the process of reconstruction from the deleterious effects of
both domestic and international factors which have led to an erratic economic performance.
During most of the 1980s anned conflict destroyed significant infrastructure. This
destruction, combined with ineffective public resource management and drought hindered
economic growth. Structural reforms began in 1987 to address these problems and the key
elements of these reforms were consolidated public expenditure and improved performance of
the cotton sector. This program led to some improvement of economic growth which
averaged 3.8 percent during 1987-90. However, by the end of 1990, a political coup plunged
Chad into a period of renewed political and economic uncertainty.
1.3 Since 1990, sharp increases in military spending and the declining capacity of the GOC
to collect revenues severely constrained economic performance. In addition to domestic
problems, Chad faced two major external problems: (a) the appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate which led to major losses in the cotton sector; and (b) the decline in the world
price of cotton. By 1993, Chad's economic performance had diminished substantially with
growth in GDP declining by 3.7 percent. In addition to macroeconomic imbalances, the
management of public finances was a recurrent problem for Chad: tax collection was low,
only about 6 percent of fiscal receipts; a parallel market was circumventing the taxation
system; and the country's public administration was staffed by workers paid on an irregular
basis, with very little incentive for improving their performance.
1.4 Since 1993, the Government has taken some significant actions for economic recovery.
GOC, in consultation with member countries of the CFA zone in 1994, decided to change the
fixed parity of the CFA franc from CFAF 50 to 100 per French franc. The devaluation helped
make the country's major export products more competitive on the world market and reduce
external imbalances. At the same time as the parity adjustment, GOC launched a new
economic and social program to: reestablish order in public finance; correct macroeconomic
imbalances through improved revenue collection and reduced expenditures, improve
economic incentives for the agricultural sector; improve public investment performance and

create a business environment conducive to private investment; and enhance economic
adjustment measures with special programs for poverty alleviation and human resource
development.
THE ENERGY SECTOR: DOMINANCE OF WOOD FUELS IN ENERGY BALANCE
1.5 Although petroleum was discovered in Chad over 25 years ago, it is yet to be produced
to meet Chad's own domestic needs for energy or for exports. This is likely to change,
however, if two petroleum projects, now under preparation, move forward. The first is the
development of a small oil field in the northwest part of the country at Sedigi, near Lake
Chad. The project would be majority private sector financed by a consortium of oil
companies consisting of Exxon, Shell and Elf. The oil would be transported in a pipeline to
N'Djamena, refined and sold for the domestic market only. The Sedigi project will provide
kerosene and LPG for household energy consumption and will support substitution away from
woodfuels. The other oil project is located in the southern part of Chad at Doba. This is a
large project for export being developed by the same members of the consortium. It involves:
(i) drilling of some 300 wells; (ii) construction of a 30," 1,050 km pipeline from Doba to
Cameroon's Atlantic coast at Kribi; and (iii) installation of an offshore export terminal facility
in Cameroon. The cost of the project is estimated at $3.5 billion and is expected to generate
about $2.5 billion in revenues for Chad (nearly doubling annuai fiscal revenues) and about
$500 million for Cameroon over the 25 years of production.
1.6 Chad's energy balance (Annex 1.1) reflects the country's early stage of economic
development. The economy's modem sector uses only a small portion of total net energy
supply, while households consume 92%, mostly in form of wood fuels for cooking. Wood
resources are mostly located in the south of the country where there is a heavy rainfall. The
total standing stock of wood from the country's trees has been estimated at 859 million tons,
or 344 million tons of oil equivalent (toe). Total sustainable annual wood yield from these
areas is 31 million tons or 12.4 million toe. Of this, on a yearly basis, only about 14 million
tons of wood are physically accessible to the population for use and this level of exploitation
is equivalent to about 5.6 million toe. However, the wood off-take is not evenly divided over
the available resources, resulting in over-exploitation in certain zones and under-exploitation
in others. In addition, unsustainable wood exploitation practices aggravate the impact on the
existing resources, resulting in a noticeable degradation of forested areas surrounding cities.
N'Djamena is a case in point where considerable damage has already occurred to the
surrounding wood resources, and if not acted upon soon, the sustainable supply of wood fuels
will be in danger.
ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
1.7 There are three GOC ministries that are responsible for supervising the country's energy
sector. The Ministry of Mines, Energy and Petroleum (MMEP) oversees the overall technical
aspects of the energy sector. The Ministry of Environment and Water Resources (MEE)
supervises forest and water resources and the environment. The Ministry of Commerce and
Industry (MCI) monitors the activities of the oil companies and is responsible for setting
electricity tariffs and the prices of petroleum products. There are also several other entities
operating in electricity and petroleum subsectors.



SAR - Household Energy Project                                             11
1.8 In the petroleum subsector, GOC has set up the SEERAT (Societi d'etude et
d'exploitation de la raffinerie du Tchad), which is owned 49 percent by GOC and 51 percent
by a consortium of'three international oil companies, Exxon (operator), Shell, and Elf. The
purpose of SEERA4T is to carry out the feasibility study for the proposed pipeline and oil
refinery, and be responsible for its construction and operation, if the investment project is
considered economically, financially and statistically viable. The Doba oil project, located in
Southern Chad, is currently managed by a negotiating team comprising representatives of
various institutions interested in the implementation and exploitation of this large scale
project.
1.9 The STEE (Societe tchadienne d'eau et d'dlectricite') is responsible for the production
and distribution ol' electricity and water in the country. This company is a partnership
between GOC (81.3% ownership) and the Caisse Frangaise de Developpement (18.7%
ownership).
THE BANK'S ROLE IN THE ENERGY SECTOR AND LESSONS AND PRINCIPLES
INCORPORATED IN PROJECT DESIGN
1.10 This will be the first time IDA is involved in household energy sector in Chad. IDA's
experience with comparable household energy projects in other African countries has been
favorable and several projects are underway. A Best Practice paper I on this was approved in
July 1996 by the 'World Bank's Policy Committee. This document highlights the need for
devolution of control over natural resources to local villages, in the same way as is proposed
for this project.
1.11 An IDA-supported household energy project in Niger has increased control over
fuelwood flows into Niamey (the Capital) from 10% to 60%, raising Government revenues to
over half a billion CFAF per year (about US$ I million), and led to the voluntary
establishment of over 50 rural fuelwood markets with a managed natural forest resource base
of some 160,000 ha. On the demand side, wood and kerosene stoves are being disseminated
via existing commercial channels. The response of the local population to the devolution of
control over forest resources has been extremely positive, and demand to participate in the
project outstrips the project team's capacity at this time. In Chad, the experience with
household energy has been encouraging, as witnessed by the preparation of a Detailed Action
Plan (DAP) and new legislation that allows considerable improvements to take place in this
field. DAP has mapped out the key concepts which formed the basis of this project. It has
also mapped out the next steps/strategy needed to ensure the sustainable availability of
biomass resources for energy consumption.
1.12 The project will incorporate the lessons of the Niger and other household or natural
resource management projects (i.e., in Burkina Faso and Mali), as well as from the Bank-
financed Review of Policies in the Traditional Energy Sector (RPTES) study. Lessons learnt
will be incorporated from the Bank's substantial experience with household energy demand

side management projects such as improved stoves and substitution fuels, particularly in
Africa (Burundi, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Tanzania). 2
1.13 The Agricultural Services Project (TD-PA-501) in Chad provides extension services to
farmers and establishes a better environment for agricultural research, but it is not specifically
designed to address wood issues. However, its infrastructure for extension may be an effective
vehicle to raise rural awareness about natural resource management.
1.14 Chad will require external, financial, and technical assistance to bring about the
necessary institutional and legal reforms for better resource management and efficiency. IDA
has the capability to provide this assistance because of its broad experience with household
energy issues in other countries of the Africa region. Finally, IDA's active participation in the
project is critical to mobilize needed additional financial resources from donors to replicate
similar activities around other urban areas and to facilitate coordination between the different
and potential actors active in this field in Chad.
SUSTAINABILITY
1 .15 One of the objectives of the project is to develop a durable solution for the wood fuel
supply of the Capital. Levels of income need to rise sufficiently so that urban households can
afford to switch from wood fuels to modem cooking fuels such as kerosene and LPG. The
project will ensure that until such level is reached, the wood fuel supply and demand balance
is positive. Thus improved wood fuel management is an essential component in achieving
sustainability by meeting the growing energy needs of urban population, maintaining their
standard of living and protecting the long-term reproductive capacity of woodlands while
ensuring that rural communities livelihoods are secure as well.

2. HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SECTOR
OVERVIEW
2.1 Household energy demand is driven by rural and urban consumers, though it is the later
which exerts considerable influence on wood fuel management practices. Fuelwood
availability and its sustainable management is not a problem in most rural areas of Chad as
communal based management systems have been in place and have functioned relatively well
for decades. The majority of rural people reside in areas of limited biomass cover. As long as
population densities are low, sustainable management is achievable. When wood fuel demand
increases due to increasing population densities in urban areas, sustainable wood fuel
management is threatened in areas of limited biomass cover.
2.2 Urban areas consume a relatively small percentage of the total annual fuelwood
consumption in comparison to rural areas. However, extraction methods used to meet the
growing urban demand for fuelwood are increasingly unsustainable. Illegal harvesting
activities have promoted land degradation through excessive loss of biomass cover and stand
to harm rural based economic activities such as agriculture and livestock. Many of these
illegal harvesters do not have a vested interest in the community and are part-time laborers
from other regions employed by powerful urban business interests. Continued over-
harvesting not only reduces environmental and economic sustainability but further enforces a
spiraling effect of continued and ever increasing degradation by marginalizing rural
populations, rendering land unproductive, and forcing farmers to use unsustainable
agricultural extensification (clearing of more land) to maintain household income. A case in
point is N'Djamena where the reduction of economic output for outlying areas is promoting
urban migration.
DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS
2.3 Consumption3. Households account for most of the energy consumption in Chad and
about 880 thousand toe or 89 percent of the estimated national energy consumption in 1995
(Annex 1.1). Most of this consumption is for cooking which use wood fuels as the main
energy source. Rural areas, which consume about 75 percent of total household energy, rely
entirely on fuelwood for cooking. In 1990 in N'Djamena, 80% of the population used
fuelwood as the primary cooking fuel and as a primary fuel, charcoal was used by 16 percent
of the population and by 54 percent as a secondary fuel. In 1995, fuelwood use considerably
decreased to about 54 percent of the population. Charcoal demand has risen rapidly by 1995;
46 percent of the population used it as primary fuel and 35 percent used it as a secondary fuel.
The demand for kerosene and LPG gas for cooking is limited to about I percent of the
population in N'Djamena. Table 2.1 summarizes the structure of final energy consumption
3  Most of the information on household energy demand in Chad comes from a 1991 survey of
household energy use under the Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance Program.
The information on the urban sector covers the capital city N'Djamena, which accounts for almost
half of the urban household energy demand. The ESMAP survey assumes that other urban areas
have similar demand characteristics. Household energy use in 1995 and 1997 shows
characteristics very similar to the results obtained by the 1991 survey.

for cooking by fuel for rural and urban areas. While this structure reflects 1990 data, no
significant changes have been observed in the contribution of biomass sources (fuelwood and
charcoal) to household energy consumption. Consumption of modern household fuels
(kerosene and LPG) has not increased significantly since 1990, largely because of high costs
and restricted availability.

2.4 Fuel Use Patterns. A consumption survey conducted in 1990 indicated that most
households use more than one fuel to satisfy their energy needs. Their choice of fuel depends
on two main factors: (a) the socioeconomic level of the household; and (b) the preferences of
the person in the household who does the cooking. In the low-income group, which accounts
for about 70 percent of all households, 87 percent of the households use fuelwood as the
principal fuel; 12 percent use charcoal; and less than 1 percent use LPG gas. Charcoal is used
as a major secondary fuel for about 86 percent of these households. For the middle-income
groups, about 45 percent use fuelwood as the principal fuel; 33 percent use charcoal; and 19
percent use LPG gas. For this group, charcoal is the main secondary fuel accounting for about
67 percent of secondary fuel used in those households that use multiple fuels. Most
householders find that the wood fires are better for preparing "boule" which is the basic
household meal. At the same time, there is a distinct preference in using charcoal to make
sauces and hot drinks.
2.5 According to the ESMAP survey, when fuelwood was used as a secondary energy source
instead of a primary energy source, the daily specific consumption of fuelwood declined by
about two-thirds from 0.65 kg per person to 0.21 kg per person. In contrast, a similar situation
for charcoal resulted in a specific-consumption decline of less than one third. This indicates
that households tend to use charcoal more for specific types of food. Another survey carried
out in 1995, indicated that charcoal had recently become equally important as fuelwood in
N'Djamena. Other African countries have experienced the same pattern due to urbanization.
As a result, overall wood consumption could increase dramatically, since charcoal use,
compared to fuelwood use, on a similar weight basis, embodies at least three times the amount
of wood resource use. The poorest section of the population estimated at 5 - 10 percent does
not purchase its fuel, but gathers it in the surroundings of N'Djamena.



SAR - Household Energy Project                                             15
2.6 Comparative Cost of Meal Preparation. The ESMAP study evaluated the comparative
costs of cooking a standard meal using various fuels and stoves according to market prices in
1991. The results indicated an overwhelming preference for the use of the traditional "three-
stone" open stove which has an efficiency of about 10 percent. The attachment to this type of
stove seems to have deep cultural roots since it is prevalent among middle-income groups as
well as lower income groups. At the time of the ESMAP survey, only 4 percent of households
were using "improved" stoves for fuelwood or charcoal. The average household had two or
three stoves, the principal one being the three-stone traditional stove for preparing the main
meal.
2.7 The ESMAP study produced several other relevant results: first, the use of charcoal in a
traditional stove was the least-cost cooking method, mainly because of the current low
charcoal price, which does not reflect the fuel's economic cost; second, not all stoves
designated as "improved " were necessarily more efficient than traditional stoves; and third,
among the modem fuels, only one type of kerosene stove was competitive with the traditional
"three-stone" fuelwood stove. Other stoves cost 50 percent more and the cost of meal
preparation with one type of LPG stove was more than twice of the three-stone stove.
2.8 Household Lxpenditures on Wood fuels. A typical household in N'Djamena using
fuelwood and charcoal as principal and secondary fuels, respectively, spends about CFAF
50,000 per year (1991 data) on fuel or about 4 percent of overall household expenditures and
56 percent on food. Although the level of cooking expense is an average, more than 80
percent of all households spend less than 10 percent of their budget on fuels and the poorest
percentile could spend between 10 - 19 percent.
2.9 Factors Affecting Stove Choice. When selecting a stove, consumers consider:
portability; stability; ease in lighting; rapid cooking time; efficiency; ability to accommodate a
large family; adaptability for the use of fuelwood or charcoal; and esthetic appearance. In
general, monetary factors account for 50 percent of stove choice, with greater emphasis on the
fuel price than on the price of the stove. However, in some cases, consumers do not
immediately perceive the efficiency benefits of using altemative stoves and fuels until they
receive specific information about them. Although firewood stoves can be obtained free of
cost (three stones), in urban areas households usually purchase their stove. To use charcoal a
stove is required. The type of stove used and the cook's prevailing cooking practices
determine his/her level of fuel consumption.
2.10 Improved Stoves. A good improved firewood stove can potentially save over 30 percent
of monthly expenditures compared to the traditional three-stone stove. An improved charcoal
stove can save 20 to 30 percent. Annual savings of about CFAF 10,000 or more are quite
feasible, which compares favorably with the prices for improved stoves, ranging from CFAF
1000 to CFAF 3000 for firewood stoves and CFAF 4,000 to 5,000 for charcoal stoves. This
results in a pay back period of less than six months. Improved stoves can thus effectively be
used to off-set future price increases of wood fuels. Despite this, not many households are
using improved stoves presently. The reasons for this include unfamiliarity with improved
stoves, poorly designed improved stove models, cultural practices, and/or cash flow problems.
2.1 1 Improved stoves could benefit the user and the country if good stove model(s) were
made available and accompanied by a systematic marketing effort. Even though an improved
stove may save fuel in laboratory tests, households may not wish to buy it on a large scale

even if it were commercially available. A household testing phase needs also to be
implemented before stoves are sold in the market. Experience in other countries (Burkina,
Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal) clearly suggest that once these initial steps are
taken, commercialization can reach good results.

WOOD FUELS SUPPLY
2.12 Forest Resources. The latest estimates of available wood resources are based on satellite
imagery (SPOT) data of 1995 (for the N'Djamena area only), with a comparative analysis of
past forestry records and a 1987 satellite data (Landsat Thematic Mapper). Annex 2.1
summarizes the results of this analysis. Total standing wood stock in Chad amounts to 859
million tons with an annual yield of about 31 million tons. Most of these resources are located
in the south of the country where rainfall is considerably higher than in the center or the north.
2.13 There are several factors limiting the reliability of current resource assessment: (a) the
absence of ground surveys to assess the standing volume; (b) insufficient correlation between
the forest resource data and the geographical distribution of the population and fuel-use
preferences; and (c) production estimates generally based on average regional
approximations. Furthermore, not all the estimated forest resources are accessible for wood
supply. The wood supply available to the population usually depends on the existence of
roads and trails that make it possible for woodcutters to enter and transport the wood. Taking
this into account, about 45 percent of annual forest production is available, amounting to 14
million tons of wood or 5.6 million toe. Thus further analysis is required to better estimate
wood supply in Chad.
2.14 Three distinctive zones provide wood fuels to N'Djamena: (a) the area to the north and
east, including the Reserve de Faune du Bas Chari, Massaguet, and the area north of the
N'Djamena - Dourbali - Massenya where degradation is the result of both agricultural
clearings and wood fuel supply; (b) the area south-east of N'Djamena, between the road to
Massenya and the Chari river, where forest fires are the main problem and wood fuels are not
produced on a large scale; and (c) the area south of N'Djamena, between the Chari and
Logone rivers, which has suffered most from woodland clearance. This area has the highest
population density which requires agricultural production to satisfy the daily needs. Also, the
main tarmac route to N'Djamena makes the transport of charcoal and firewood easy. Some
wood fuel is reportedly transported from as far as Sarh, 500 km upstream along the Chari
river during parts of the year.
2.15 Annex 2.1 shows the total productivity of the wood catchment area that supplies
N'Djamena with wood fuels. The total amount that can be harvested on an annual basis
without affecting the resource base is 535 thousand tons per year. Although this is more than
what is currently needed, reduction of the resource base is occurring. Not all areas are
accessible or actively harvested, making the effectively harvested area much smaller. In
reality, the wood off-take in a 10 - 20 km strip along easily accessible main roads is causing
severe deforestation as far as 100 km from N'Djamena. Fruit trees are cut with other types of
trees. The remaining trees do not give quality charcoal. As a result, plots of dry Sudanian
woodland and mnoist Acacia bush land are degraded to wooded grasslands or less.
2.16 Exploitation of Wood fuel Supplies. The informal private sector handles all wood
production and distribution in the wood fuels sector. In order to maximize profitability, illegal
fuelwood harvesters seek to exploit supplies near the capital without regard for maintaining a
sustainable supply. These actions not only occur on communal lands but also on privately
held land. These include non-timber, fruit trees, and acacias (used to produce gum arabic),



18                                                  SAR - Household Energy Project
which many rural households are dependent upon for sources of their income. The rural
population has recently become involved in wood-cutting and charcoal making on a part-time
basis, after they observed how easily charcoalers earned money from resources belonging to
the villages.
2.17 While considerable resources are "potentially" available for exploitation, they are not
utilized as harvesters have no economic incentive to access these resources. The least cost
supply is the first utilized which compares to the easiest access. Supply availability is in large
part strictly a function of profitability. New supplies are only "made" available when pre-
existing available supplies have been exhausted beyond the point of economic return as well
as sustainable production. From a country perspective, total wood production may exceed
consumption, but localized production may not.
2.18 There is evidence that wood deficits and environmental degradation is developing in the
forested areas surrounding major urban centers. This will only intensify if inefficient land-use
and fuel-use practices in the current supply system continue. These practices include: (a) the
burning of large areas of forest for land-clearing by farmers and animal breeders who do not
take sufficient precautions against the spread of fire; (b) a system of administrative regulations
that does not encourage the sustainable offtake of wood and improvements in the efficiency of
charcoal production; and (c) consumer wastage of wood by not using efficient stoves. In
addition, charcoal making has become an important business with a total annual market value
of about US$6.8 million for the N'Djamena area alone. Current charcoaling methods and
practices are such that there is no consideration for the resource base: charcoal is made by
itinerant charcoalers (outsiders), who are often financed by urban transporters. They cut as
many suitable trees as possible to quickly produce charcoal and move on when there are no
longer sufficient easily accessible trees.
2.19 Charcoal Conversion. Charcoalers in Chad use the traditional earth mound kiln for the
carbonization process that transforms wood to charcoal. The estimated efficiency of this kiln
is about 13 percent4, as tested in the field in early 1995 under the PPF financed study. More
efficient kiln designs that are more labor-intensive than current methods and that require
better monitoring of the carbonization process can improve the efficiency to about 18 - 22
percent. Such gain in conversion efficiency implies primary wood savings of almost 40
percent.
2.20 Transport and distribution. Firewood and charcoal are transported to N'Djamena (1991)
by trucks and other motorized vehicles, as well as by non-motorized transport, mostly
donkeys, and barges that travel to various sales points along inland waterways.5 The
distribution network consists of 1,000 to 2,000 sales points in market areas, and street corners.
The number of these sales outlets fluctuates greatly since some operate only on a part-time or
seasonal basis. Between December and May, many sellers from rural areas come directly to
sell wood in N'Djamena. The sales outlets are fairly specialized: a little more than half sell
4  Efficiency defined as dry weight of charcoal obtained divided by dry weight of wood input.
5  According to a survey by the Bureau inter-ministeriel d 'tudes et de projets (BIEP), half of all
charcoal transport is by means of non-motorized vehicles. These results are not conclusive since
the survey lasted only a week and did not monitor all access points to the city. The project will
develop data collection on a regular basis.



SAR - Household Energy Project                                              19
only fuelwood; one third sells only charcoal; and only 15 percent sells both fuels at the same
time. In 1995, most charcoal was transported by pickup trucks (2.5t) of which approximately
45 are required on a daily basis to satisfy N'Djamena's demand.
2.21 Wholesalers control about one third of the wood fuels distribution outlets, both wholesale
and retail. These wholesalers often supply wood to retailers with small concession stands and
also sell kerosene. Women operate about half of all small retail points and monopolize the
charcoal market. In total, the informal wood fuels sector employs about 9,000 people on a
full-time basis of whom 6,000 collect wood and produce charcoal. The rest are involved in
distribution and retail operations. Including part-time workers, total employment in the sector
may be in the order of 15,000 employees. In general, the supply and distribution is very
efficient; there are no major shortages and wood fuels are available at numerous and
convenient locations throughout the town.
2.22 Role of Agriculture. Several factors affect depletion rates in the fuelwood catchment
area surrounding N'Djamena. With the growth of urban population, increased demand for
both fuelwood and agricultural products drives current land use practices. Agriculture has
expanded to meet the growing demand for food, and now occupies 200,000 hectares
surrounding N'Djamena much of which is around the lake Chad area. Farmers have typically
expanded agricultural activities through sustainable measures. Land clearing for agriculture is
a pre-requisite that requires the harvesting of wood fuel. As studies have indicated, farmers,
while clearing land, maintain a broad management perspective to ensure that excessive
harvesting does not harm the regenerative capacity of woodlands. While they may expand
agricultural activities, they do it in a manner which does not affect woodlands: by either first,
reducing fallow periods on land already under cultivation, or secondly, by expanding
cultivation on low productivity soils which are often free of extensive biomass cover. These
activities may in the long-term harm agricultural sustainability. However, they do not
typically harm productive woodlands. Farmers are broadly speaking maintaining an optimal
rate of depletion of forestry resources.
LAND-USE PRACTICES
2.23 Forestry resources are at present considered as common property resource by illegal
harvesters but are not by the community. Rural communities have highly developed
traditional laws for regulating the use and extraction of communal resources (Annex 2.2).
The fact that state laws may not formally recognize these rights and systems is immaterial.
Villagers have been very adept at defining and managing their rights and use of resources; it is
only since "illegal" free traders have begun accessing those resources that unsustainable
management has resulted. Defining and enforcing the economic value of land rights to
facilitate management by rural communities is essential for sustainable management.
Allowing exclusive land rights, or usufruct rights, would not sufficiently enforce rights as
villagers do not have the capability to confront trespassers, many of whom could be armed.
As proposed in the project, enabling mechanisms for the rural communities will ensure that
they can exercise control.
2.24 One way is to establish a management fee system to promote sustainable management of
common property resources. At present, trees are a valued economic resource on which
villagers depend for survival. Concurrently they are undervalued by illegal harvesters, 'free-
riders', who are mining these resources. Mining of these resources is economically



20                                                 SAR - Household Energy Project
inefficient, reduces the economic benefits for rural communities, and has long-term
implications on sustainable use of resources. The introduction of a management fee system
where villagers levy an extraction fee for the harvesting of wood fuel in their communities
would discourage over harvesting.
2.25 Since production costs may be higher, wise economic management of natural resources
needs to be encouraged. Currently illegal extraction is occurring in large part because
merchants/cutters are responding to a situation of market failure where resources are
undervalued due to lax enforcement of community and state laws. Considering the
circumstances, they are reacting in an economically justified manner (no enforcement of
property rights and short time horizon).
2.26 Rate of depletion. While formal property rights do not exist, informal and traditionally
enforced systems have been in place for some time. Most studies suggest that the optimal rate
of depletion is being exceeded. Returns on capital and consumer time preferences are
distorted. Inability on the part of rural communities to exert control over forestry
management has lead indirectly to the application of inordinately high capital returns for
fuelwood extraction (no value is applied to forestry resources by harvesters), and of non-
representative consumer time preferences of individuals seeking quick, short-term rent from
forestry activities. Actual depletion rates vary considerably throughout the country. In the
N'Djamena catchment area, the current rate of extraction (depletion) of available wood fuel
supplies is unsustainable as it is well above the regeneration rate, far exceeding the optimal
depletion rate. Therefore, the rate of depletion must be assessed in the context of available
supply (from an economic perspective) to N'Djamena and not total supply.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF WOOD FUELS
2.27 In certain areas, a fragile balance exists between supply and demand of wood products.
The closer to N'Djamena, the more upset the balance. One of the main reasons is the rapidly
increasing urban demand for wood fuels. Permits are provided by a central department
without reference to the carrying capacity of the wood resource base (i.e. mining). Without
consulting villagers, wood cutters take wood which is easily accessible. As long as
responsibilities for managing the resources (including the rights for exploitation) are not given
to the villages, it seems unlikely that the negative effects on the resource can be reversed.
2.28 The urban preference for charcoal exacerbates existing environmental problems. The
charcoaling process is inefficient, implying that charcoal using households could consume at
least 3 times more wood than firewood consuming households. Even improved charcoal
stoves will not compensate for this. Nevertheless, it is important that there be
commercialization of improved charcoal stoves: the share of charcoal in the energy mix of
urban Chad will increase over time and every kg of charcoal that is not consumed will save 7
to 8 kg of wood.
2.29 Correlated to deforestation are water and wind erosion, declining soil fertility, micro
climate deterioration, and loss of species diversity. This has an impact on several aspects of
village life: wood supply, agriculture, animal husbandry, etc. However, experience in Niger
shows that the effects are reversible. Once the forest cover begins to reappear, grasses, other
plants, and animals tend to reappear as well. It is difficult to quantify these processes as there
is not much data on either declining or improving soil erosion, soil fertility, and wildlife.

WOOD FUELS PRICING AND TAXATION
2.30 Actual Retail Prices. Comparative fuel prices for the different forms of energy (Annex
2.3) show that the more convenient modern fuels are much more expensive than traditional
fuels. In fact, a household moving up the energy ladder will face a double energy unit price
each time (s)he makes such a switch. The effect is less when stove efficiencies are factored
in: the cost differences between charcoal and firewood are not so large any more but there
remains a major gap between modern fuels such as kerosene, LPG and the traditional fuels (in
combination with traditional stoves) which is shown in the last column of Annex 2.3. Modern
fuels are therefore not an option for the majority of households in N'Djamena, and the market
for such fuels will remain limited. A 1992 survey by ADER/FED/DFPE 6 indicated the retail
price of wood in N'Djamena to be in the order of 13-22 CFA per kg, depending on the
quantity purchased (Annex 2.3).
2.31 Structure of Charcoal Prices. Annex 2.3 shows the structure of the charcoal price (1996)
in N'Djamena based on motorized transport from a distance of 100 km outside the city. For a
retail price of CFAF 80 per kg, about 46 percent is the gross margin for the merchant-
distributor and the retailer. In addition, the cost of the wood to the merchants and the taxes
are extremely low, and taxes paid to GOC only amount to 3 percent of the retail price.
2.32 Taxation System. As Annex 2.3 indicates, the cost of wood and taxes are almost a
negligible portion of the current retail price and do not take into account the wood's economic
value. The basis for the current taxation of wood fuels is a Government decree of 1985 which
established five tax categories, according to the product and its packaging: CFAF 100 per sack
of charcoal; CFAF 20 per bundle of wood, 300 CFAF per stere of wood, CFAF 1,500 per ton
of wood within a 30 km radius of the capital and CFAF 1,000 per ton beyond this radius.
Inspection Forestiere 5 (IFS) is in charge of the control of wood fuel transport in the
N'Djamena supply region. It has check points in most villages from where wood is supplied
and at the entrance of the city.
2.33 There are several serious distortions in the tax system. First, there is no uniform
measuring system for the tax, which is based either on the main unit of volume, the stere, or
on the weight in lkg. Survey data indicates that the tax per kg which results from the
volumetric measurement converted to weight equivalent is CFAF 0.75, less than half the tax
based on weight, which is CFAF 1.5. In any case, the actual tax paid turns out to be lower
than both of these rates -- CFAF 0.3 per kg. Second, there is no standard definition of the
bundle which rural suppliers produce and the weight of the bundle varies considerably. Third,
the tax rate for charcoal is CFAF 2.55 per kg despite the production of a kg of charcoal which
requires almost eight kg of wood, making the tax rate of wood used in charcoal-making only
CFAF 0.3 per kg, much lower than what applies to wood used directly as fuel. In addition, the
control system is not very effective and tax collection rates are low.
2.34 In addition to the above, illicit taxes are levied and could amount for charcoal to as much
as CFAF 50 per bag, mainly to allow expedient passage. The proposed wood fuel user fee (or
"tax" as per Law 36) will replace all earlier mentioned taxes and would be paid at the rural
market at the time of purchase or at the city entrance. The estimated rate of revenue recovery
is only 10- 15 percent. Forestry staff are insufficient for the monitoring required. A better rate

22                                               SAR - Household Energy Project
of revenue collection could generate the funds necessary to finance management services or
technical support in the wood production zones. To address weaknesses in the fiscal regime,
the ESMAP study recommended that the Government establishes a new fiscal and regulatory
system based on: a fee level that reflects the cost of wood replacement; the proceeds from fee
collection to managers and owners of forest resources (i.e. villages); and incentives for
reinvesting revenues from fees in forest management activities and reforestation.
2.35 Economic Pricing of Wood. The economic price range of wood can be estimated using
different methods: border pricing of the closest substitution fuel, i.e. kerosene; marginal
environmental cost pricing; or replacement value pricing. The most conservative, border
pricing, would result in approximately $147 per ton of wood (CFAF 69 per kg) based on the
current retail price minus 45% margin. In-country transport costs are to be added. The most
broad-reaching approach, incorporating marginal environmental costs, is difficult to apply as
it depends on many elements that are unknown. The marginal environmental value of wood
should reflect its long-run marginal value, based on both its immediate environmental effects
and the needs of future generations. Thus, the opportunity cost of wood equals the direct
harvesting costs (the marginal costs as usually perceived) and the marginal external costs of
wood to different sectors, such as agriculture, livestock, etc.
2.36 Replacement value pricing can be estimated based on reforestation or on a management
system of existing resources. Industrial wood plantations do not exist in Chad and the few
small holder plantations that exist are marginally successful. Two small holder plantations are
known. One has been abandoned and the other is maintained but shows poor growth rates.
Experience in other countries suggests invariably that management systems deliver wood at
much lower costs than reforestation. Such valuation is not available for N'Djamena but
estimations for the Niamey region in Niger, which has similar conditions as those in
N'Djamena, can provide an approximate indicative value. Investment costs for management
systems range between $10 - $50 per hectare and $500 - $1000 per hectare for plantations.
An evaluation of costs in Niger shows a cost of about CFAF 5-9 per kg to establish and
implement a forest management program. Taking this additional resource cost into account,
the retail price of wood in N'Djamena would be CFAF 30 per kg or slightly above the current
retail price.
DEMAND AND SUPPLY OUTLOOK FOR WOOD FUELS
2.37 Overall, the population in Chad is growing at the average annual rate of 2.5 percent
annually and is expected to increase to 9.35 million in 2010. The urban population, about 21
percent of the population in 1993, is expected to grow at a higher rate of about 3.5 percent
annual. At this rate the urban population will double by the year 2010; if the current trends in
household energy consumption do not change, the demand for wood as an energy source will
more than double. Wood transformed in 1990 into charcoal only made up 59 percent of the
total wood exploitation in the N'Djamena area, whereas this has increased to as much as 77
percent in 1995.
2.38 Given the projected demand trends, wood production on a country-wide basis will still be
higher than demand. But for large urban areas these trends indicate possible wood shortages,
especially in N'Djamena. By 2010, the population in N'Djamena is expected to be about 1.5
million, triple the current level. Studies in other African countries have indicated rapid
growth in charcoal consumption associated with urbanization. Taking this into account, wood



SAR - Household Energy Project                                              23
offtake in the N'Djamena area will increase from 410,000 tons in 1995 to 730,000 tons in
2010. Even in 1995, the corresponding annual wood production will be only slightly higher
than the demand, about 535,000 tons. Furthermore, since other activities such as agriculture
will also require the use of forested areas, land use tensions could threaten the sustainability of
wood supply to meet demand.
SECTOR POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
Supply-Side
2.39 GOC has no concerted household energy strategy to address expected shortages in wood
supply. But a general framework for such a strategy exists in the national plan against
desertification (PNLCD) which Chad adopted in 1989. There are three parts to the PNLCD.
The first is the protection of ecological resources through efforts to realize forest potential,
such as improvemnent in crop management, soil protection, rationalization of wood cutting,
different types of afforestation, and sensitization of the population for wood use efficiency.
The second part is the design of a land-management plan to be implemented on the village
level. The third part concerns institutional strengthening, emphasizing the need to set up
structures adapted to integrated rural development programs and improving production and
pricing systems favorable to resource conservation.
2.40 In Chad, land tenure is complicated and there is ambiguity in current forest legislation
and in the fiscal Regime. (Annex 2.2). In 1989, GOC began a project to establish a new
forestry code which would provide GOC authorities with greater powers to control the use of
forest resources and give specific propriety rights to private parties that regenerate forested
areas. The proposed new forestry code is based on three principles. The first is the transfer of
responsibility for forest management from the state to the local population. This transfer,
based on the orgEnization of rural village markets, would take place within the context of an
overall wood management and supply plan for each major city. The second principle is the
reorientation of the State's role to monitor wood flows, raise money to implement the
aforementioned transfer, and supervise the execution of the overall management plans. The
third principle is to professionalize all activities which include woodcutting, charcoaling,
transport, etc. through technical assistance to improve the technology and organization of
these activities.
2.41 Projects to Enhance Wood Supply. There have hardly been any projects to improve
forest exploitation except for a reforestation program for 7,500 hectares (ha) of forest with
limited results. In addition, Chad only has limited (albeit positive) experience with improving
the efficiency of charcoal production. At the time of the ESMAP survey, there were some
ongoing pilot forest-management projects within the context of the ADER project which FED
was financing and the FAO project which the Netherlands was funding. These projects
showed some promising results but civil war prevented their completion.
2.42 As presented in the Project Evaluation Chapter (Chapter 4), expansion of the road
network would facilitate an increase in available wood fuel supplies as supply is presently a
function of road length. Though it is questionable at what cost this policy could be pursued,
investment in a road network or for improved port/river facilities to exploit fuelwood supplies
may not be an efficient allocation of economic resources. With typical construction costs as
high as US $1 million per kilometer of roadway, road investment is unlikely to generate



24                                                 SAR - Household Energy Project
sufficient economic benefits to justify such a project, particularly in a country with a low
population density and undeveloped regional trade and markets.
Demand-Side
2.43 Improved Stoves. The penetration of improved stoves in the household sector is at a
very early stage in Chad compared to other Sahelian countries: only about 4 percent of
households are using an improved stove. This low level of penetration is mainly due to
insufficient promotional activities by the related stove enterprises as well as poorly designed
improved stove models. There are about thirty informal, artisan enterprises in N'Djamena
that produce wood and charcoal stoves, both traditional and improved models. About two
thirds are individual enterprise and one third operate as private cooperatives. Most artisans
produce improved stoves by special order in the context of specific projects for their
distribution. But they produce traditional stoves continuously and most sell them to clients at
the workshop while some artisans use traveling sales persons.
2.44 Interfuel Substitution. The use of several fuels by most households in N'Djamena
indicates that household energy consumption has begun a transition. This transition in many
African countries is characterized by the progressive use of charcoal as the principal
household fuel along with the penetration of more modern fuels such as kerosene and
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The ESMAP survey asked householders about the advantages
and disadvantages to the use of the various household fuels, aside from the price
considerations. Annex 2.3 summarizes the responses, which indicate that charcoal is by far
the preferred fuel at the present time and attempts to encourage the substitution of kerosene or
LPG will require education campaigns to address some of the perceived disadvantages.
Annex 2.3 also shows that the majority of the wood fuels users are quite satisfied with their
present fuel and that half of them has no intention to switch to other fuels.
INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS
2.45 The capacity of MMEP, especially that of the Directorate of Petroleum and New and
Renewable Energy (DPENR) is not well adapted to the institutional needs for developing and
implementing a household energy strategy. The DPENR has 42 professional positions, mostly
electrical engineers. Others have a petroleum background, either in physics or chemistry.
Neither their training nor their experience is adequate to implement the different components
of the household energy strategy. To ensure the availability of professionals capable of
monitoring and evaluating the execution of the household energy strategy, considerable in-
country training and some specialized training outside Chad will be necessary. The same
holds for staff of the Directorate of Forests and Environmental Protection (DFPE) who will
have completely different objectives when village management plans become operational.
2.46 Chad's forestry staff is insufficient in number and in expertise to effectively manage its
forest resource base. There are only 283 professional staff allocated among various staff
categories, as indicated in Annex 2.2. The staff chiefly responsible for field execution of
forestry programs, the technical advisors and their agents, account for only 16 percent of total
staff which implies an average of 29,000 km2 of territory to monitor per forestry agent. The
forestry aides, contractual surveyors, and various forestry officers often have low levels of
technical skills. To develop a competent and motivated staff, GOC needs to establish several
types of training programs, local and foreign, for all levels of forestry services. In addition,



SAR - Household Energy Project                                           25
the focus of involvement should change away from control and policing to extension and
providing advise. Responsibility for maintaining wood resources should be given to rural
villages which is in their interest.



3.  THE PROJECT
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.1 The key objective of the project is to provide an economic and sustainable supply of
energy for households. Least cost supply and sustainability are being achieved through a
community based participatory approach and environmental awareness. The specific
objectives of the project are to: (i) promote the establishment of the sustainable production of
woodfuel in selected villages providing energy to the capital, N'Djamena; (ii) strengthen the
capacity of the Borrower to extend such production elsewhere; (iii) carry out institutional
reforms in the household energy sector; and (iv) improve efficiency in the use of household
energy.
PROJECT DESIGN
3.2 Four key concepts were used to design the project. Thefirst is the need for simultaneous
intervention on the demand and the supply side to avert wood shortages and environmental
degradation over the long term. The second is the involvement of the private sector and local
communities, a concept which has worked well in other countries, notably Niger. The project
will actively pursue a transfer of responsibilities to private actors and local communities and
give them an opportunity to increase revenues from their local environmental resources in a
sustainable manner. The third is limiting the project to the N'Djamena area because: (a) the
capital accounts for the bulk of the commercial consumption of wood fuels in the country; (b)
there is a need to test the concepts on a pilot basis and create the necessary institutional
capacity before extending the project to other parts of the country; and (c) GOC currently
lacks the institutional capability to manage a larger project in the sector. Thefourth key
concept is a participatory approach in implementing the proposed project, making extensive
use of non-governmental organizations and local consultants to broaden project ownership.
The project fully supports the CAS objectives and complies with all applicable Bank policies,
guidelines and best practices, in particular with respect to forestry policy, environmental
policy and rural energy and development.
3.3    Participatory Approach: Beneficiary consultations took place at several stages of
project preparation. The last one involved visits to 50 villages and discussions held with
villagers and village leaders. Discussions were also held with charcoalers, transporters, and
other people involved in charcoal and firewood commerce. Local NGOs and/or firms assisted
in the preparation of parts of the project. Since many of the activities will be implemented by
the rural population, the participatory approach is a standard approach in addressing the
problems and finding solutions. The Government prepared the Development Action Plan
(DAP), which was the starting point for project preparation.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.4 The projecit has the following four components, which were designed following
extensive consultation with stakeholders (communities, NGO's, transporters, etc.) (para. 3.17,
para. 3.25):
(a)    create capacity to develop a village-based natural resource management
system;
(b)    create capacity to monitor and control wood products flows;
(c)   improve the efficiency of household fuel use; and
(d)    project management.
Component I: Village-Based Natural Resource Management System
3.5 This component will comprise approximately 48 percent of the project's base costs will
be executed by a private agency, Agence pour I 'Energie Domestique & I 'Environnement
(AEDE). It will establish the capacity to design simple long-term village land-use and wood
exploitation plans for villages in the N'Djamena wood fuel catchment area. A master plan
will be developed using the individual village plans as building stones. These plans will be
developed by NGOs, forestry agents, and villagers, and will be assisted through technical
assistance provided under the project. These plans will be based on an assessment of local
wood resources using satellite GIS data and ground-truthing and on evaluation of economic
activities surrounding the villages. The starting point for such plans will be the traditional
management systems that have been in place before the central DFPE started issuing
exploitation permits. At the most basic level, the outcome will be to determine the maximum
allowable wood cut (or quota) for the resource base of the particular village so that the
maximum wood offtake does not exceed natural regeneration. At the most sophisticated level,
detailed plans will be available indicating where, how many, and what species of trees to cut
over time. Once completed, the plan will be submitted for approval by the DFPE, which will
propose a long-term contract between the DFPE (on behalf of the Government) and
representatives of the village. On a contract basis, the responsibility for maintaining and
managing the natural resources will be transferred to the village. With the responsibility
comes the right to refuse cutting by people from outside the village and to charge a
management fee on all wood products that are sold from the village's resources.7
Consultants, foresters, and villagers will design these land-use and wood exploitation plans on
a village by village basis. Approximately 100 villages will be targeted on a demand driven
basis.
Lessons learnt from the Niger experience show that villagers are quickly convinced about the merits
of such management systems, if not just because they are given usufruct rights to the products of the
land. Improvements in terms of biodiversity were observed even within the limited period of the
project. Particularly, grasses (used for fodder) came back and so did small animals.

3.6 Wood fuel Master Plan. The combined individual management systems will form the
basis for a comprehensive wood fuel master plan for the N'Djamena region. In this regard,
DFPE and the project team will: (a) formulate and adopt the necessary regulatory text for the
commercialization and transport of wood products as well as appropriate fiscal policies
including the level of wood fuel management fees and their periodic revision; and (b) define
procedures for the creation of rural wood markets. Annex 3.1 describes the main stages in the
creation of a rural wood fuel market. These rural markets will be set up in villages that have a
signed contract with the DFPE. Wood fuel transactions to outsiders will only be allowed at
these markets. A management fee, that is meant to be an efficient mechanism to manage
environmental damage, will be charged to transporters of wood and charcoal in addition to the
cost of wood exploitation and transformation into wood fuel (firewood or charcoal). Its level
will be zero when the wood is purchased at a rural market but CFAF 300 elsewhere. The user
fee will be levied at source (in the village) and at the city entrance where five fixed control
posts will be established and manned by IF5 (para. 3.20). In addition, mobile teams will try to
catch transporters averting fixed control posts. This reflects the long-range marginal costs of
maintaining the control system. The monitoring system is designed to become self-financing
before the end of project implementation. The project team will also: (a) improve the system
for monitoring the flows of wood used for energy purposes entering into N'Djamena; and (b)
establish an effective monitoring system for rural markets to develop common standards and
encourage adherence to official guidelines.
3.7 Natural resource user fee. Enforcement of existing property rights will facilitate sound
management of woodlands. The development of a management system is necessary to
enforce the rights of rural communities. To develop a successful management system, users
of forestry resources must recognize the economic cost of those resources and make sure that
viable and easily enforceable measures are in place. Due to limited personnel and financial
resources, rural communities and authorities will not be able to easily monitor cutting
activities. Establishing a control zone in urban areas to monitor incoming fuelwood and
charcoal resources will alleviate the need to monitor and enforce harvesting in the entire
N'Djamena catchment area. This will reduce the cost of the management system.
3.8 The introduction of a natural resource user fee, levied at the community level, will
facilitate successful adoption of this system. Furthermore, villagers will be able to better
value wood fuel resources, specifically those cut illegally. While they have some control over
the price for wood and charcoal, the true economic cost of replacement will not be reflected.
User fees collected by communities would represent a portion of the economic value of
harvested trees. Rural communities will decide the form in which the benefit of their
woodlands will accrue to them. This will either be through personal/communal consumption
or in the form of the natural resource user fees, e.g. monetary compensation. In addition, part
of the proceeds will go to higher local government structures such as the Sultan of Canton,
thereby encouraging their participation and support.
3.9 Types of Supply Zones. Under the master plan, three types of wood fuel production
zones will be distinguished: "red" where commercial wood fuel production is not allowed
(i.e., designated Parks, fragile areas, and where the resource base is too small to allow
commercial exploitation); "yellow" where wood fuel production could take place but is not
managed; and "green" where villagers are fully responsible for managing forest resources. At
the beginning of the project, there will be only yellow and red zones and towards the end of
the project, most yellow zones will have been transformed into green. Annex 3.1 provides



SAR - Household Energy Project                                                29
information about the process of creating such management systems. Several conditions
should exist before responsibility is transferred to a village: (a) land boundaries should be
established and agreed with neighboring villages and forested areas should have been
surveyed; (b) a simple land-use and wood exploitation plan for the local resource base should
be prepared by an NGO or private firm in collaboration with villagers; (c) the plan should be
approved by the DFPE, and (d) the village should have formed its own management structure,
signed a long-term contract for the implementation of the plan, and established a rural market.

3.10 Taxation System. As part of the rationalization of the wood energy sector, the
Government has decided to change the existing tax structure on wood fuels. Tax will now be
levied at source and paid by transporters, replacing all existing cutting permits and wood fuel
taxes. This is described in a forestry law, No. 36/PR194, dated December 3, 1994, and
implemented through a decree (#107/MTE/DG/97) dated 3/14/97. This tax structure is critical
to project success. If it is properly implemented, it will be an effective management tool to
provide incentives to most stakeholders to use scarce resources more efficiently. The user fee
is primarily to facilitate natural resource management, reflecting cost of control and
management of the resources. Assurances have been obtained before negotiations that the
level, recovery, and allocation of the tax (user fees) will be acceptable to IDA at all times
during project implementation. Additional revenues are secondary; although they could turn
out to be substantial.
3.11 Initially, the level of the user fee in green zones will not change from earlier; it will
remain at the previous level of CFAF 300 per stere of wood. For charcoal, the level will
increase from C]FAF 100 to CFAF 300 per bag to reflect the actual wood content of the
charcoal (one needs approximately one stere per 40 kg bag). This level is justified as the
economic analysis shows that a user fee of about CFAF 330 per stere should be levied in
respect to the resources that are being depleted (para. 4.17). Under the new tax system,
differential levels are introduced as there are different management and control costs involved
in the green or yellow zones. Environmental damage is prone to occur more in yellow than in
green zones, thus justifying lower fees in green zones and higher fees in yellow zones. Fee
levels for wood fuels from yellow zones will initially be as follows: CFAF 600 per 40 kg-bag
of charcoal and CFAF 600 per stere of wood. After a six month period, DFPE and DIT will
evaluate these levels and determine whether changes are required. For the different types of
trucks that transport wood fuels, the loading capacity will be estimated and corresponding tax
levels will be determined. In green zones, fees will be collected at source; supply from yellow
zones will be charged at city entrance (para. 3.20).
3.12 Since there will be more green zones over time, the effective user fee will gradually
reduce. A village that creates a rural market and develops plans to manage its wood resources
properly will start charging the lower fee. By allowing "green zone" villages to keep part of
the fees and by tlhe employment created in rural areas, powerful incentives are provided to
manage effectively local resources in a sustainable manner. The fees will be paid by
transporters, who will transfer the charge to the end users. The latter are thus given better
market signals about the scarcity of the resource which facilitates fuel substitution and
8 A rural market is a central place in the village where wood products are sold; transactions in other
locations will no longer be allowed.



30                                                 SAR - Household Energy Project
conservation of wood fuel consumption. Since wood fuel costs in relation with the household
budget is small, it is expected that a 10 percent increase will not cause problems.9 The fees
will also create more revenue for the government though this is not the primary objective.
However, it should allow the government to fund an extension of the program resulting in
additional green zone villages, to establish rural nurseries, etc., and reimburse the costs of the
project.
3.13 The level of the user fees will be evaluated at least once a year by DFPE and DIT, and
adjusted if warranted, in particular, for economic reasons. DFPE or DIT will collect payments
from villagers which will be transferred to the Treasury on a regular basis (paras. 3.14 - 3.16).
Wood fuel trade will take place at rural markets which are established to make monitoring
easier and more transparent. Upon payment of the user fee, a receipt is issued by a designated
village representative. The receipt has three parts: one for the transporter, one for DFPE/DIT
(for record keeping) and one which will be handed over to personnel of the IF control point
(Inspection Forestiere) at the entrance of N'Djamena. Without a receipt, IF personnel will
charge fees as if the wood came from a yellow zone. The system of receipts will allow double
checking and tracking of the origin of the wood fuel flows as the receipts make mention of the
village of origin. The Treasury portion of the tax revenue will be deposited in a designated
bank account.
3.14 In green zones, transporters can only buy wood from local managers of the rural market.
They negotiate a price for the wood and pay the relatively low wood fuel user fee. They are
no longer allowed to make charcoal or cut wood themselves in green zones unless they are
contracted by the village. Wood fuel prices will entirely be determined between villagers and
transporters. No-one will be exempted from paying these user fees. At the city gates there
will be checkpoints to verify that payments have been made and to register where the wood
fuel originated. Since the villagers are allowed to keep most of the fees, they are likely to be
very effective in its collection. The proceeds of the fees will be distributed as follows: 10
percent for Treasury, 50 percent for the village (part for replanting, maintenance and forestry
management operations), and 40 percent for the local management structures (at the Canton
and Arrondissement level, administered by the Sultan). An information campaign will inform
villagers on the importance of local resource management and will suggest reinvesting the
village budget portion back into the village (such as for building a school, a tree nursery,
water pump, etc.).
3.15 For wood harvested from yellow zones, transporters will no longer need to buy a cutting
permit since this has not worked well before, but instead will need to pay the wood fuel tax
when entering the city (at the IF control point). The level of the payment is higher than in
green zones giving an incentive to transporters to go to green villages. The tax revenue will
be deposited in a designated bank account. Transporters will receive a receipt and the IF
control point will keep a copy.
3.16 In red zones no commercial wood exploitation is allowed. Red zones are classified as
forests, reserves, and parks. Zones that are severely degraded can be classified red as well.
9 This increase can easily be offset by improved stoves, which should reduce consumption by about
20% (para. 2. 10).



SAR - Household Energy Project                                                31
The Government: needs to concentrate its efforts to protect red zones through the forestry
police.
3.17 It will take some time and effort before transporters know the system and comply. In
order to reach that point as quickly as possible, meetings will be organized to discuss the
problems and find solutions. Rural wood and charcoal markets will be established in villages
in green zones oni a demand driven basis. Every village with an approved management plan
should have a rural market. Areas closest to N'Djamena along the main roads should be
converted into green zones first. As this cannot be done overnight, a transition period will
exist for a limited time. An effort should be made to create as many green zones as quickly as
possible starting with the main production areas where wood cutting is currently concentrated.
Although it will require a substantial effort in sensitization and communications with
villagers, the rural consultations in about 50 villages showed that villagers are quite keen on
taking on those responsibilities if the Government helps them enforcing the new rules. The
control and monitoring systems are precisely developed to achieve that.
3.18 Techniques for planting, maintaining small nurseries, etc. will be demonstrated as well as
better wood cutting techniques that promote spontaneous regeneration. Efficient charcoal
conversion techniques will be promoted in green zones where charcoal is produced on a
regular basis. This will be done by training on the spot, i.e. by a charcoaler trainer who will
assist occasional charcoalers to become more professional. Improved techniques will be
demonstrated for which the only investment required is training and a chimney made of used
oil drums. It is certain that some time will be needed to make this understood by all actors in
the field. A substantial effort to increase awareness is clearly needed. As an example, the
military is currently accustomed to obtaining a free permit and harvesting the wood in villages
which have no say in the matter. Once the new system is in place, there are three options: (a)
business as usual, which will have to take place in yellow zones only (but the user fee will
need to be paid when entering N'Djamena), (b) buying the wood at a rural market in green
zones (and paying a lower user fee), or (c) starting to use alternative fuels such as kerosene.
Component II: Monitoring and Control of Wood Products Flows
3.19 Accounting for about 20 percent of project base costs, the inflow of wood products from
rural production zones into N'Djamena will be monitored by AEDE. User fees/taxes will be
collected by IF, and payment compliance will be verified by AEDE, which will also compile
statistical data. The user fee will be used as an environmental policy instrument, working on
three different levels: (a) providing an incentive to villages to manage their resources as well
as possible; (b) guiding transporters towards areas of least-cost wood locations (green:
minimal fee but have to buy the wood; yellow, intermediary fee but wood is free; and red
prohibited); and (c) giving incentives for end-users to use improved stoves and wood products
more rationally as prices increase. A mechanism will be designed to adjust the fees/taxes to
reflect varying economic costs over time and possibly by location.
3.20 Effective control at the city gate will be important. A detailed study has been carried out
to confirm its feasibility. Fixed control points will be established at the five main entry axes
into N'Djamena and will be permanently manned; some of these are already operational.
These five posts will replace the existing posts throughout the N'Djamena catchment area. In
addition, three mobile teams (two teams using cars and motorcycles and one team using boats)
will be created to fill in any gaps. Control beyond the city will be impossible due to the



32                                               SAR - Household Energy Project
vastness and accessibility of the land. In the way the project is designed, there is relatively
tight control at entrance (in the villages where wood resources are managed) and at the point
of consumption (in town). A system of triple receipts will allow verification of data. Also, it
will provide data to monitor wood flows which will be used to fine-tune the wood supply
master plan. The private agency will be fully auto-financed from proceeds of the user fee/tax
expected at the end of the project; although this may happen as early as by the second year of
the project.
3.21 AEDE will collect the user fee/tax proceeds, once a week from rural markets and every
other day from fixed control points. It will deposit the money into the appropriate accounts
(villages and Treasury). AEDE is allowed to keep 50 percent of the proceeds assigned to the
Treasury to finance its operations.
Component III: Improving the Efficiency of Household Fuel Use
3.22 On the demand side, accounting for about 19 percent of total project base costs, the two
subcomponents will also be executed by AEDE: (a) the commercialization of efficient
cooking stoves (firewood, charcoal); (b) the promotion of the use of low-cost kerosene and
LPG stoves. Suitable improved stove models will be identified and tested. Stove producers
will produce prototype stoves and receive feedback from the tests to improve the models. The
objective of this subcomponent is not to promote the use of charcoal stoves and encourage
households to switch from firewood to charcoal but to have households use less fuel and
derive greater benefits. There will be a publicity and awareness campaign to start the
development of the market for the models developed under the project. NGOs will be
involved in the implementation of this subcomponent for testing, product development,
monitoring of stove performance, and for promotional activities. If such capacity does not
exist, training will be provided under the project. A similar approach will be followed with
the kerosene and LPG stove subcomponent. However, stoves (or most components) will need
to be imported rather than manufactured locally.
3.23 A market study was carried out to determine the prospects for introducing better stoves.
About half of the population of N'Djamena is presently not satisfied with their cooking fuel.
Based on surveys, it was estimated that of the 116,000 households, 15% would ultimately
refuse any change, 28% could adopt an improved stove, 45% could start using kerosene, and
17% could start using LPG. Households that decide to use substitution fuels will continue to
use charcoal for some time. Although these numbers indicate what can be reached, the
following conservative targets will be set as project objective: to commercialize (entirely by
the private sector) some 17,000 improved woodstoves, 11,000 improved charcoal stoves,
8,000 kerosene stoves, and 4,000 LPG stoves.
Component IV. Project Management
3.24 Approximately 12 percent of project base costs are allocated for project management.
Successful implementation will require setting up a database to monitor performance and
developments in household energy markets over time, and also reach considerable effort in
capacity building. An essential part of the project will be capacity building and sensibilization
through training, technical assistance and education/information and promotional actions for
both public and private actors with systematic stakeholder consultation. An allocation for



SAR - Household Energy Project                                                33
studies will allow the preparation of the next phase (in the South and East of the country,
around secondary cities) and help villages with a management plan to further improve their
performance on a demand driven basis. Civil works will be needed for the structural
improvement of AEDE's main office and satellite offices around the N'Djamena area.
SECTOR REFORM AS PART OF PROJECT PREPARATION
3.25 Based on the DAP, the Government initiated the process to change the law dealing with
wood fuel issues. Systematic client consultations were organized at several points in time, the
last one was in early 1996, when approximately 50 villages in the project area were contacted.
Key policy changes have already been realized in this process. Law 36/PR194 (portant
organ isation de la commercialisation et du transport de bois dans les grandes agglomerations
et de laflscalite qui lui est applicable), dated December 3, 1994, specifically states, inter alia:
(a)    Ownership of forests: concessions of public forests to rural communities or
rural villages and state owned enterprises are allowed; the transfer of full
property rights to rural communities or rural villages is allowed for domanial
forests that have been regenerated or saved from disappearance; and
individuals or entities who planted trees or forests on their own terrain will
enjoy full ownership without restrictions.
(b)    Transport of wood products: only commercial transporters are allowed to
transport wood products to towns; these transporters must have a license.
(c)    Rural wood markets: wood markets can be established in rural villages where
prices of wood products are to be freely determined by the sellers; local, rural
wood cutter organizations are the sole to exploit wood for supply to the rural
markets; for exploitation of privately owned forests, an authorization can be
obtalined from the local DFPE representatives; and wood exploitation should
not exceed annual regeneration capacity of the resources that supply to the
rural wood market; quota will be established.
(d)    "Taxes": which correspond mostly to a user fee levied on the transport of
wood is called "taxeforestiere" and is paid by the transporter to a designated
person at the rural market according to the nature of the product and the
category of production zone; the user fee/tax structure will be periodically
reassessed, based on inflation, price of substitution fuels, etc.; the law also
refers to the control system to be established, penalties in case of fraud, and
remuneration for control agents.
3.26 This non-exhaustive list of issues that are addressed in the law (there are 50 articles in
total) clearly demonstrates the Government's intentions to improve the wood fuel situation.
PROJECT COSTS
3.27 The total estimaRted cost of the proposed project is US$ 6.3 million including physical and price
contingencies. Approximately 50 percent correspond to foreign exchange expenditures. A summary
of project costs by components is provided in Table 3.1. These estimates include price escalation
from World Bank estimates of local and intemational inflation for the four years of the

FINANCING PLAN
3.28 IDA will finance about 84 percent (US$ 5.27 million) of total project cost and GOC will
supply the remaining 16 percent (US$ 1.03 million). GOC will cover the: (a) salaries of
management staff of DPENR and DFPE involved in the proposed project, and (b) costs of
AEDE to a maximum of 50 percent in the second year of the project, 25 percent in the third
year and none in the last year'0. This includes the costs of monitoring the entrance of wood
energy to N'Djamena and administrative monitoring of rural markets. The governments share
will also cover certain functional charges related to the project such as electricity, water, and
telecommunication for its offices. Part of the proceeds of the user fee/tax will be used to
finance some of the expenses incurred by AEDE. GOC will be responsible for covering all
taxes, levies, and duties paid under the project (Table 3.2).
3.29 IDA will be financing 100 percent of foreign costs and a large portion of local costs (70
%). Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world (GDP $180 per capita) and needs
foreign aid to facilitate development. Since other donors are yet to provide aid especially in
the household energy sector, Chad is entirely dependent on IDA.
10   It is expected that user fee proceeds will cover at least the costs of AEDE minus the indicated
govermnent contribution.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
The Implementing Agency (AEDE)
3.31 The project will be implemented by AEDE (Agence pour I 'Energie Domestique &
I 'Environnement), an agency created in 1996 specifically for this project. The statutes of
AEDE will be modified as a condition of Credit effectiveness to realign responsibilities of the
organs of AEDE in a manner satisfactory to the Association. AEDE is authorized to operate as
a non profit autonomous entity under the authorization from MAT (Ministere de
l 'Administration Territoriale) dated April 23, 1996 comprising of representatives of the CDS,
NGOs, and the private sector (Annex 3.2). The Government has also issued a Decree granting
AEDE the status of a Public Interest association (Declaration d'Utilite Publique). To help in
the implementation of the project, a detailed Project Implementation Manual ("Manuel
d'Execution") has been prepared that sets out the objectives and institutional arrangements.
The Manuel is in project files and is outlined in Annex 3.8. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that the Project Implementation Manual be acceptable to IDA at all times during
project implementation and any modifications to the Implementation Manual ("Manuel
d'Execution") be subject to IDA's approval. The project will be implemented over a 4 year
period, with all project components implemented concurrently (Annex 3.4). The CDS
(Comite de suivi) will monitor project implementation. It will implement the proposed project
under a project agreement with IDA and a convention signed by the minister responsible for
MFEPA on behalf of the Republic of Chad. AEDE should be self-financing at the end of the
4-year project from proceeds of the user fees. AEDE also will function as a focal point for
household energy and environmental issues in Chad, and facilitate coordination between
different stakeholders in this sector. MMEPH and MET will be co-beneficiaries of the
proposed project with non-governmental institutions playing an important role in project
implementation.
3.32 A General Manager was selected in August 1997. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that AEDE General Manager, the Administration and Financial Director
(Directeur Administratif et Financier) and the two persons respectively in charge within
AEDE of rural markets and of the user-fee system, will be appointed in accordance with
procedures specified under IDA consultants guidelines and will be acceptable to IDA at all

times during project implementation. The appointment of AEDE's Administration and
Financial Director and of the persons respectively in charge of rural markets and of
monitoring the tax system will be a condition of credit effectiveness.
3.33 As a condition of effectiveness, the Government will provide a signed copy of the
convention between AEDE and the Republic of Chad.
3.34 With respect to the resource management component, AEDE, among other activities,
will: a) prepare and approve N'Djamena's master plan including resource mapping,
delimitation of wood-production production areas, supply and demand strategies, socio-
economic surveys; b) provide information to the rural areas about the new regulatory
framework with respect to forestry resource management, user fees and particularly the role
of rural markets; c) select individuals and firms including NGOs that will establish wood fuels
and charcoal markets in rural areas; (d) facilitate coordination between MMEP and MEE and
the Ministry in charge of Finance (MFEPA) about fiscal aspects; e) set up a system to follow
up payments of user fees; and f) develop new charcoaling techniques with local charcoalers.
For the demand side management component, AEDE will: a) set up a data collection and a
evaluation system to monitor use of improved and traditional cookstoves; b) assess alternative
cookstoves and marketing mechanisms; c) design pilot operations for the import, production
and sales of efficient cookstoves by local private professionals; and d) design
promotion/information campaigns.
3.35 AEDE will act as the maitre d'ouvrage delegue and be responsible for: (a) the
procurement and management of contracts for materials and services; and (b) verification of
user fee collection on wood for energy use and the management of some of the funds
collected. It may decide to subcontract part of the work out to NGOs, particularly the
monitoring and control function of wood flows. The technical assistance necessary to
establish the Project will be supplied by firms and entities selected in accordance with para
3.50 below, within the framework of an overall contract with AEDE. The selection of the
candidates will take place according to Bank's Guidelines. The technical assistance will also
provide methodological support to DPENR, DFPE and AEDE, and the training necessary for
management positions at the national level. This will also be applied to local operators who
will implement subcontracts. Studies will be conducted as needed to assist rural villages in
achieving further energy efficiency gains and to prepare for an extension of the project to the
southern and eastern regions of the country. The studies will be coordinated by DPENR and
DFPE.
Comite de Suivi (CDS)
3.36 The ad-hoc CDS (Comite de suivi) that was created as a special task force to prepare the
Detailed Action Plan (DAP) (para 1.1 1), has been formalized by a decree of the Council of
Ministers dated October 10, 1996. The CDS will be responsible for general project
supervision, if needed adjustments in the project implementation strategy and for the
identification of the necessary regulatory and fiscal measures. It has five permanent
members: the Director of DPENR (chairman) of MMEP, the Director of DFPE of MEE, the
Director of DIT of MFI, the Director of External Aid and Planning and the Director of
Regulations from the Government's General Secretary. DPENR will ensure CDS's secretariat.
The CDS will meet at least once a year; additional meetings may be required for the



SAR - Household Energy Project                                             37
preparation of regulatory framework, the revision of taxation on wood used for energy, and
the definition of administrative procedures for the creation of rural wood markets.
3.37 In their respective technical areas, the MMEP and the MEE will supervise and monitor
the four project components implemented by AEDE. Two persons from MMEP will
participate in monitoring activities regarding improved cookstoves, substitution stoves,
improved charcoal making techniques, facilitate the Project's effective functioning, and create
and maintain a database on household energy. Four persons from MEE will participate in the
design, development, fine-tuning, and tax-collection. Two personnel from the Ministry of
Mines, Energy and Petroleum (MMEP) and four personnel from the Ministry of Environment
and water (MEE) have been assigned to work closely with AEDE in monitoring and
coordinating the ministry's involvement in project matters. MEE will monitor the components
related to the development of a village-based natural resource management system and the
control of wood products flows; MMEP will monitor the component related to improving the
efficiency of household fuel use. Institutional support will be provided by the project to
DPENR and DFPE through a system of evaluation and training of its agents. Both ministries
will be responsible in establishing the regulatory and fiscal framework to support the creation
of rural wood energy markets.
AEDE: Operating Procedures
3.38 The proposed Project will take place over a period of four years and by then should
become self-financing. A provisional schedule for the execution of principal activities during
the first four years is attached as Annex 3.4. The performance indicators are provided in
Annex 3.6.
3.39 AEDE will issue contracts to consultants and NGOs, will be responsible for procurement
of equipment (see Annex 3.2) and will work with NGOs which will provide most of the
technical assistance after being trained under the project. Agreement has been reached prior to
negotiations that AEDE will use standard IDA Procurement procedures and documentation.
If technical assistance does not exist locally, it will be of short-term, decreasing over time and
preferably of regional origin (e.g. Nigerien or Burkinabe consultants). Based on the
experience of the World Bank Niger Household Energy Project and in Mali, it is important
that one long-term TA be recruited for two and a half to three years to assist in the launching
and realization of the village wood management plans and their compilation into an overall
wood fuel master plan.
3.40 Proceeds from user fees/taxes collected at the IF control points around the city entrances
as well as from rural markets will be deposited into designated bank accounts. DIT agents
will regularly visit collection points to verify compliance with procedures. AEDE can keep 50
percent of the tax proceeds that it collects on behalf of Treasury to finance its operations.
Revenues for Treasury are estimated to exceed $400,000 in year two and will gradually
increase to a level of about $800,000 per year after twenty years. The share to Treasury will
gradually decrease as the majority of wood producing areas are converted into green zones.
At that point in time, the need to levy the tax should be evaluated. In principle, there should
not be a need for a tax if all wood fuels come from managed zones. An initial deposit will
also be made to the Special Account (para. 3.48) to cover initial operating costs of AEDE.

Project Monitoring and Review
3.41 Project Monitoring and Quality Assurance: During project preparation, the
Government, AEDE and IDA discussed and agreed on quality assurance arrangements and on
the records and reports necessary to monitor the progress of the project, particularly, the
achievement of its objectives. In addition to the monitoring and supervision carried out by the
Comite de Suivi (paras. 3.36 - 3.37), by AEDE's Board (paras. 3.31 - 3.35) and as described in
AEDE's operating procedures (paras. 3.38-3.39), during the lifetime of the project there will
be a minimum of two supervision missions per year (para. 3.60) to monitor performance
indicators (described in Annex 3.6) and the compliance with the Implementation Manual
(Annex 3.8). The Government, AEDE and IDA agreed that as part of normal project
supervision there would be a mid-term review at the end of CY 2000, with the participation of
all stakeholders (para. 3.45). In addition, very close monitoring of project implementation
will be carried out by the Resident Mission.
3.42 Monitoring and Evaluation: Agreement has been reached during negotiations that AEDE
will establish and maintain a project internal accounting and financial system consistent with
the implementation manual, in accordance with sound accounting principles and practices
satisfactory to IDA at all times during project implementation. Setting up of AEDE's internal
accounting and financial system acceptable to IDA will be a condition of credit effectiveness.
Interim and annual financial statements will duly reflect the financial performance and
position of the project. A final audit will be submitted to IDA within six months of the Credit
Closing Date.
3.43 Progress status reports will be submitted to by AEDE to CDS and IDA every three
months, which will include the financial overview, main substantive results, work program,
and budget status. These reports should be submitted within one month of the end of the
period concerned. These reports will also contain the following procurement information:
revised cost estimates of contracts, including best estimates for physical and price
contingencies; revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract
award, and completion time for indicated projects; and compliance with aggregated limits on
procurement methods. Assurances have been obtained that DPENR and DFPE will prepare
semi-annual progress reports every year and issue a final report (Implementation Completion
Report) within six months of the Credit Closing Date.
3.44Annual Reviews: The Project will be implemented over a four-year period. The annual
reviews will ascertain the efficiency of AEDE's procedures and management using the
performance indicators described in annex 3.6 and will recommend appropriate changes.
3.45 Mid-Term Review: Agreement has been reached during negotiations that a mid-
term review will be carried out two years after project effectiveness. Annex 3.6 provides a
series of performance indicators that will be used to monitor progress in meeting the project's
objectives, overall project performance against performance indicators, project costs, and
compliance with legal covenants. The review will be another opportunity to evaluate, and, if
needed, to modify some major features of the project. Finally the review will create an
opportunity to; (a) thoroughly discuss issues with stakeholders and also to (b) evaluate the
need for including new activities in the project scope in order to better meet the project
objectives.

Project Sustainability
3.46 Project Sustainability: One of the objectives of the project is to obtain a durable solution
for the wood fuel supply to the capital city of N'Djamena. Income levels need to be risen
sufficiently so that urban households can afford to switch from wood fuels to modem cooking
fuels such as kerosene and LPG. The project will ensure that until such level is reached, the
wood fuel supply and demand balance is positive. Thus improved wood fuel management is
an essential component in achieving sustainability by meeting the growing energy needs of
urban populations, maintaining their standard of living and protecting the long-term
reproductive capacity of woodlands while ensuring that rural communities livelihoods are
secure as well. In addition, the project supports the setting-up of AEDE, an autonomous
agency, that will become self-financing at the end of the 4 year project from the proceeds of
its activities.

DISBURSEMENTS
3.47 The project will be implemented over a four-year period. Annex 3.4 presents the
project's implementation schedule. Table 3.3 below sets forth the categories of items which
the IDA credit will finance, the allocation of credit amounts, and the percentage of
expenditures for items to be financed in each category. The IDA credit will finance 100
percent of foreign exchange expenditures and up to 90 percent of local expenditures for
training, goods and civil works. Consulting services, expatriate and local, will be disbursed
against 100 percent of expenditures, excluding taxes.

3.48 To expedite disbursements, a Special Account in FCFA francs will be opened in a local
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. AEDE will manage this Special Account. The
authorized allocation will cover approximately 4 months of expenditures, or the equivalent of
US$ 500,000. Upon effectiveness, 50% of the authorized allocation will be deposited into the
Special Account. The remaining balance will be made available as needed. All replenishment
applications will be fully documented, except in the case of expenditures of less than
$100,000 for goods and for works, $50,000 for individual consultants, and $100,000 for
consultant firms, which may be claimed on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs).
All documents will be kept for review by IDA supervision missions and the external auditors.
3.49 Table 3.4 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit. The project is
expected to be completed by December 31, 2002, and the closing date for the credit would be
June 30, 2003.

PROCUREMENT
3.50 Table 3.5 summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs and the proposed
method of procurernent. No special exemptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in
credit documents for international competitive bidding as Chad's procurement practices allow
IDA to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. Agreement has
been reached, that AEDE will procure goods and works in accordance with the procedures
set-forth in the Guidelines for Procurement under IDRD loans and IDA credits (January 1995,
revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997) and consulting services in
accordance with Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers (January 1997, revised in September 1997).

3.51 Civil Works. Contracts for the rehabilitation and the improvement of the control points
at the city gate which will cost approximately $123,100 would be procured through NCB
procedures which are acceptable to IDA. The following procedures would be followed: (a)
tenders would be advertised locally; (b) bidders would be given a minimum of 30 days for
submitting bids; (c) evaluation criteria would be specified in precise quantitative/monetary
terms; (d) all bids would be opened in public, with bidders representatives permitted to attend;
(e) interested eligible foreign contractors would be allowed to participate in the bidding; and
(f) contract will be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.
3.52 Goods financed by IDA (totaling about US$ 1.4 million), consisting of equipment,
furniture, office supplies, laboratory, vehicles, motorcycles, and boats, would be purchased
through ICB in accordance with Bank's guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996 and
September 1997. Contracts would as far as possible be packaged for amounts of at least
$100,000 equivalent. Contracts for office equipment, supplies, furniture, and some vehicles
and motorcycles available locally for an aggregate amount not to exceed US$300,000, which
cost more than US$30,000 equivalent but less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract would
be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Small quantities of office
equipment, supplies, furniture and consumable materials, which are normally available off the
shelf at economical prices and cannot be grouped into packages of less than US$30,000
equivalent per contract, would be procured through international and national shopping, based
on quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided that the aggregate does
not exceed US $100,000.
3.53 Consulting Services, Training, and Special Studies financed by IDA would be for: (i)
supervision and monitoring, (ii) specialized studies, and (iii) training and development.
Consultants would be hired in accordance with Bank's Guidelines for the selection and
employment of Consultants (January 1997 and revised in September 1997). All consultant
selection will be carried out through competition among qualified short-listed firms in which
the selection will be based on Quality-and-Cost-Based -Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the
quality of the proposal before comparing the cost of services to be provided. Financial audits
will be carried out using the Least Cost Solution method. Individual consultants for some
specialized technical studies ($200,000) where firms would not be required would be selected
based on consultant experience and competence for the assignment.
3.54 Prior review thresholds: IDA financed contracts above the threshold of US$100,000
equivalent for works and goods receptively would be subject to IDA's prior review. All other
works and goods contracts under this threshold would be subject to post-review. Prior review
will apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost
more than $25,000 each. However for contracts with firms costing more than $50,000, the
technical evaluation report will also be required for prior review. All other contracts will be
subject to post review.
3.55 For the proposed project a number of activities are planned to establish local capacity in
the area of project coordination and implementation: (a) project coordination will be with
AEDE and personnel has been recruited for that purpose. Past experience in project
management and procurement will be taken into consideration in the selection process; (b) a
detailed processing schedule for goods and services to be procured under the project would



SAR - Household Energy Project                                             43
contribute in the timely processing of all required actions. During implementation, all bid
evaluation reports transmitted to IDA for review would contain an updated copy of the
implementation schedule.
3.56 Agreement was confirmed during negotiations on the proper monitoring of procurement,
the use of Bank standard bidding documents for ICB and standard procurement documents for
NCB, and model letter of invitation and standard form of contracts for consultants. The
Government has agreed that it would apply the procurement procedures and arrangements
outlined above.
ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND AUDITING
3.57 AEDE will establish and maintain project accounting according to sound accounting
principles and practices satisfactory to IDA. Interim and annual financial statements will duly
reflect the financial performance and status of the project. These statements will include the
Special Account and SOEs. Appointment of independent auditors acceptable to the
Association for a period of four years will be a condition of effectiveness. Agreement has also
been reached during negotiations that the annual financial audits and the final audit will be
performed by external independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, both for the Special Account
and for the Project accounts. The independent final audit will be submitted to IDA within six
months of the Credit Closing Date.
3.58 The report provided to the Government and IDA by AEDE at the end of each calendar
quarter and no later than one month after the end of the quarter regarding progress will
include a financial overview, main substantive results, work program, and indicative budget.
This report will also contain the following procurement information: revised cost estimates of
contracts, including best estimates for physical and price contingencies; revised timing of
procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for
indicated projects; and compliance with aggregated limits on procurement methods. DPENR
and DFPE will issue a final report within six months of the Credit Closing Date.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS (CATEGORY C)
3.59 The proposed project will considerably reduce soil degradation, bush fires and
deforestation, through better management of the natural forest cover. The introduction of
more efficient charcoal-making techniques will reduce the amount of wood required as
feedstock for this increasingly popular fuel and the increased use of wood originating from
forest under sustained management. Because of reduced deforestation and the use of more
efficient stoves, the project will also help reduce carbon dioxide emissions which are harmful
to the global enviromnent and to the health of the women. The total reduction of C02
emissions over a 20 year period is expected to exceed I million tons.
PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
3.60 The semi-arnual progress reports prepared by DPENR and DFPE will include an
overview of achievements, a proposed work plan, and a leaflet with price and flow trends for
household fuels, including an indication of number of rural markets established, number of
improved stoves sold, and tax compliance. There will be two supervision missions per year.
A mid-term review will need to be carried out two years into the project, or mid-2001. Annex

4. PROJECT EVALUATION
INTRODUCTION
4.1 The project supports economic development in line with IDA's country assistance
strategy, is technically, socially, financially and economically sound and promotes
environmentally sustainable rural development. The overall project economic rate of return
(ERR) is 34.4 percent. The Resource Management Component (RMP) of the project has an
ERR of 25.1 percent and is the least-expensive alternative for the provision of household
fuels. The next best alternative costs almost 3 times more to supply the same output. The
Demand Side Management component (DSMP) of the project has an ERR of 75.1 percent.
These attractive economic indicators are typical for natural resource management and
household energy conservation projects, where relatively little expenditure ensures better
management and efficient use of existing resources. The economics of the two
subcomponents are very robust to changes in key parameters. In addition, there are global
environmental benefits amounting to $2.9 million which have not been taken into account in
the economic rate of return. The project financial rate of return is 6.9 percent and the pay
back time is estimated to be around 12 years.
4.2 The distributional impact of the project is positive. The distributional coefficient of the
project (net benefits over a 20-year period to rural and urban poor households as a proportion
of project net benefits) amounts to 70.4 percent. In addition, 28 percent of net project benefits
will remain in rural areas, through proceeds of user fees and increased agricultural
productivity.
4.3 Public investment in the RMP component is estimated at $3.9 million (net present value
at 12% discount rate) and at $1.1 million in the DSMP component. In addition to public
investment, private investments by villagers for the creation of the rural markets are estimated
at $0.62 million, and by households to purchase improved stoves are estimated at $1.2 million.
Support to CAS Objectives
4.4 The project will provide an economic and sustainable supply of energy for households
living mainly in N'Djamena. It is an operational instrument of the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) adopted in February 1996 and supports four of the CAS's objectives: poverty
alleviation, rural and private sector development and environmental protection. The key
objective of the resource management component is to ensure an economic and sustainable
supply of energy for households living in N'Djamena. This is accomplished through an
approach that encourages the development of ownership and usufruct rights of natural
resources through voluntary community based management, while promoting environmental
awareness. The main objective of the DSMP component is to improve the efficiency of
cooking fuels through the introduction of improved energy efficient stoves which reduce
energy consumption.
4.5 Project evaluation assesses: (a) the cost-effectiveness of the RMP, as the least cost

of natural resource user fees, distributional impact assessment on rural and urban households
and the fiscal impact of the proposed project have been carried out.
Project as the least-cost alternative
4.6 Project Altematives. The following four alternatives to the project for supplying energy
to households in N'Djamena were assessed. The relevant assumptions and the detailed cost
comparison of supply alternatives are presented in Annex 4.1 and Annex 4.2.
4.7 Alternative 1: harvesting wood from more productive resource areas (particularly
around Sahr in Southern Chad, about 500 km from N'Djamena) and transporting it to
N'Djamena through fluvial transport. Under this scenario, wood will be exploited as a non-
renewable resource, starting from 2007 when the capital stock of wood is noticeably reduced
in the N'Djamena area.
4.8 Alternative 2: continuing to harvest wood from the main roadways leading to
N'Djamena and progressively moving further away as accessible supplies diminish. All wood
fuel is transported by road which by 2003 will result in an increased price of wood fuels of
more than 10%. UJnder this scenario, no change in conversion techniques is foreseen and
natural resources are mined until they are exhausted. This is the usual scenario that would
occur without such a project. There are no incentives for villagers to manage woodlands
properly. Simply granting them property rights will not automatically imply change for the
better. One of the reasons is that a system to enforce property rights does not currently exist.
4.9 Alternative 3: planting of trees andlor establishing plantations to compensate for
harvested trees now, to replenish reduced stocks after eight to ten years. A combination of
village plantations and forestry department plantations is implemented, using local tree
species, such as Prosopis Juliflora, or any other species that has a successful track record in
Chad. Full demand for wood energy would be satisfied from plantations by 2007. Plantations
will be established immediately under a project and managed by villagers. This is a
hypothetical case, as World Bank forestry policy does not support investments in wood
plantations in this part of the world due to climatic reasons.
4.10 Alternative 4: substituting commercial fuels (kerosene) when fuelwood stocks are drawn
down-i.e., when the least costly supply of wood fuels in areas near demand centers are
exhausted, around 2007.
4.1 1 As indicated in table 4. 1, the proposed RMP is the least cost alternative for supplying
wood fuel and charcoal to N'Djamena. The best alternative to the proposed project would be
to transport wood fuel by truck and continue to mine it further along the roads until the
resource base has disappeared: this is the situation without the project. Table 4.1 only
provides cost elements of the alternative scenarios. The alternatives other than the proposed
project and the plantations do not offer additional economic benefits and do not address wider
issues such as achieving sustainable natural resource management and supporting livelihood
of rural communities.

ECONOMIC EVALUATION
4.12 Cost Benefit Analysis: Detailed analysis was carried out based on satellite data and a
model to project the state of the resource base in the with and the without case I I was
developed. As presented in Annexes 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, both the RMP and DSMP project
components are economically very sound, with ERRs' of 25.1 percent and 75.1 percent,
respectively. These ERRs' are quite favorable even though conservative assumptions were
used for analysis. Using a discount rate of 12 percent and an evaluation period of 20 years,
the RMP has a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$ 5.3 million and the DSMP has a NPV of $6.1
million. The ERR for the project as a whole amounts to 34.4 percent.
4.13 Resource Management Benefits. The RMP will support activities to slow down the rate
of forest degradation through the introduction of land-use management systems with
improved transformation techniques (woodcutting, charcoaling). This will be done by making
rural communities responsible for the village forest land, while assisting them to get organized
and by changing the regulatory framework for the subsector so that it fully supports them in
carrying out their responsibilities (paras. 3.5 to 3.18). Benefits will accrue due to transport
savings and avoided agricultural productivity losses such as from fruit trees, agricultural
produce, and livestock. 12 The main benefits from the project, accounting for about two-thirds
of the benefits, will be savings in transport costs as the project will allow a sustainable supply
of wood fuels in areas closer to N'Djamena. Without the project, there would be continued
unsustainable harvesting of wood fuel, and production of charcoal, in a collection radius of 15
kilometers along easily accessible roads at even larger distance from N'Djamena.
See "An economic analysis of the resource management component of the Chad household energy
project", K. Chomitz, C. Griffiths, July 1996.
12 Conservative assumptions were selected: transport benefits are counted for only 80% of expected
transport savings and agricultural productivity benefits for only 50% of expected benefits.



SAR - Household Energy Project                                             49
4.14 The present value (PV, at 12% discount rate) of the benefits of the RMP component is
estimated at $10. 1 million of which $7.6 million are related to transport savings and about
$2.6 million to avoid productivity losses, are the principal benefits. Improvements on soil
fertility/crop production and reduced harvesting of fruit trees have a PV of $1.6 million and
$3.0 million, respectively for each, with an additional $0.50 million from benefits from
increased fodder production on livestock. Through the promotion of appropriate natural
resource managernent, continued harvesting along main roads will be supplanted by forestry
resources nearer urban demand centers which are developed and managed by rural
communities. There are also additional benefits which are not as tangible or quantifiable as
the above benefits due to impacts on microclimates, soil, wind, and water erosion and their
impact on sylviculture, agriculture and livestock. These benefits have not been estimated.
The RMP ERR is estimated at 25.1%. The sensitivity analysis shows that this ERR is very
robust (Figure 4. 1).
4.15 Demand Side Management Benefits. The quantifiable benefits of the DSM component
are reduced use of cooking fuels, wood fuel and charcoal, through the introduction of more
efficient cooking equipment. Rational use of wood and charcoal will be encouraged through
the introduction of improved stoves, or by increased use of substitute fuels, such as kerosene
and LPG. Improved stoves will also emit less smoke, particulates, and carbon monoxide than
existing models. This will have a positive effect on the lives of women and children as they
will have a reduced burden for fuel collection and as well experience a healthier cooking
environment. Reductions in negative health impacts were not estimated. The NPV of the
DSM benefits is conservatively estimated at $6.1 million, resulting in an ERR of about 75.1
percent. The sensitivity analysis shows that this ERR is also very robust (Figure 4.2).
4.16 Environmental Benefits. The project produces global environmental benefits beyond
savings in agricultural productivity through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as a
result of reduced household fuel consumption. Estimates of avoided CO2 emissions due to a
reduction of wood fuel use amount to about 1.2 million ton over a 20-year period. Global
environmental benefits or avoided C02 emissions, valued at about 10 US$ per ton13, give an
NPV of $2.9 million. This estimate is rather conservative as it is based on fuel savings alone,
and does not include savings from more efficient charcoaling techniques, reduced
deforestation, or a reduction in transport needs. Annex 4.4 provides more details about C02
abatement.
USER FEE
4.17 The price of wood should provide consumers with an incentive to use it efficiently and
avoid non-economic uses, and should induce producers to supply it and maintain the existing
natural resources. The current price is below the economic cost of wood which should
include the marginal costs of cutting, preparation, transformation, transport and distribution,
and, the user value of wood. Without the project, wood fuels will be supplied through clear
cutting and mining of resources at ever increasing distance from N'Djamena. This method of
supply entails productivity losses, and, when there is no longer sufficient wood, users will
need to use substitute fuels, such as kerosene, LPG, or biomass derived alternatives such as
briquettes made from agricultural residues. The present value of these effects is a measure of

the scarcity value of wood now, also known as the depletion premium or user fee, which was
estimated at about $3.35 per ton of wood (574 CFAF per stere).
4.18 The user fee depends on the: (a) remaining wood reserves; (b) level and growth of
demand for wood; (c) volume of the deficit; (d) end-user prices of substitutes in the future;
and (e) productivity losses. The nearer the date the deficit occurs, the higher the depletion
allowance. In the context of the appraisal of renewable projects, the principle of the depletion
allowance dictates that the cost of wood should include a premium that, when spread across
the wood saved by the project (avoided deficit) over its lifetime, would promote an optimal
supply and use of the natural resource.
4.19 The project will promote a differentiated userfee based on the damage done to the
natural resource base. In unmanaged zones (without a rural market, yellow zones), the user
fee will be CFAF 600 per stere of wood, or per bag of charcoal (which uses about one stere of
wood to produce) or CFAF 1.5 per kg (Annex 4.5). In managed zones (with a rural market,
green zones), the user fee will be CFAF 300 or CFAF 7.5 per kg (Annex 4.5), reflecting only
costs of control, monitoring and creation of more rural markets, and more efficient use and
transformation of resources. This level of fees should be sufficient to obtain the desired
benefits, and the average user fee (over all wood consumed, from green and yellow zones)
will be about CFAF 318, taking into account collection efficiencies and geographical
distribution of supply. This level of proposed fees corresponds to the actual tax level. The
forestry law provides the possibility to change the level of fees at least once a year, or when
required for economic reasons (para. 3.11).
4.20 The user fee will in principle be collected at source, starting with rural markets that
begin to operate. As not all zones are immediately converted into managed areas and have
established a rural market, collection will also be done at entry into N'Djamena, at a higher
rate that reflects additional costs for its collection as well as costs for converting areas into
green zones. Over time, the rationale for applying the user fee will disappear (as more areas
become under management), and its level will automatically be lowered. The user fee will
cause average retail prices to increase about 10 percent by 2010, which is much less than what
would happen in the "business as usual" scenario where the price increase would be greater
than 16 percent. The 10 percent price increase can easily be offset by the use of improved
stoves which should reduce fuel consumption by at least twenty percent. The actual retail
price will be an average of the three supply alternatives (green zones, yellow zones, and
entering the city by circumventing the control system). Table 4.2 presents the economic costs
of charcoal in N'Djamena, according to the supply mode. The revenue generated from the
introduction of user fees is sufficient to cover project costs and pay back in about a twelve
year period. It gives a boost in rural revenue generation (which in itself is a good incentive to
pursue the resource management).

FINANCIAL AND FISCAL ANALYSIS
4.21 Under conservative assumptions, the project will generate revenue sufficient to
reimburse project public financing in about twelve years. The financial internal rate of return
is about 6.9% (Annex 4.6). Initially user fees will be collected at city entrance as wood fuel
and charcoal will come from unoccupied zones, but gradually in the rural markets where
resources are managed. The collection efficiency in rural markets will be much higher than at
the city entrance due to involvement of the local people. It is estimated that over 24% of the
wood flow at the end of the second year will be controlled (subject to user fee collection),
increasing to 46% at the end of the project which amounts to a total fee collected of $568,000
in 2001 to $856,000 four years later. The rate of increase in the total user fee collected rises
rapidly thereafter. Costs of control will be self-finance early on, possibly starting in year two.
Participating rural villages will generate approximately $265,000 over the four year life of the
project (discounted at 12%); this is over and above the money they will receive from the sale
of wood and charcoal. Although these financial transactions are not important for the
economic evaluation of the project, they are extremely important for the population in the
project area.
DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACT
4.22 Of total net project benefits, an estimated 42.0% go to the urban poor and 28.4% remains
in rural areas as a result of increased productivity, higher efficiencies, and proceeds of user
fees. Table 4.3 provides for the distribution of costs and benefits. Almost 10 percent of the
net benefits go to the poorest urban households. Firewood and charcoal prices are expected to
increase by about 4.4% and 10.3% respectively, which can easily be offset by using an
improved stove. Even the investments in improved stoves will be recovered within a two-
month period through reduced fuel consumption. Although the user fee is netted out from the
economic evaluation, it is quite important as a net transfer from the rich to the poor occurs,
giving incentives for all economic actors to behave more rationally.

4.23 Rural Communities. Substantial financial benefits will accrue to poor households in
rural communities with a natural resource management plan, through the collection of user
fees and the participation in natural resource income generating activities. Under the
proposed project, services from wood cutters, wood transporters (from harvesting place to the
rural market site), wood stackers, rural market managers, etc. will be required which translates
into economic opportunities for many villagers. The total value of the 1995 wood fuel market
in N'Djamena was estimated at approximately US$ 11 million of which a maximum of 20%
accruing to the producers (who are not necessarily rural villagers). In fact, a large portion of
this value is for distribution margins by urban commerce. The project seeks to increase the
allocation for rural stakeholders to about 25 to 35 percent of the economic value of wood
fuels. Gains are achieved through avoided productivity losses as well though higher income
groups tend to benefit to a greater extent than poorer income groups.
4.24 For urban households, distributional effects are relatively minor as all income groups
benefit through efficiency gains and lower priced energy than what would have been the case
under the business as usual scenario. While operational costs increase, as a result of applied
management techniques for natural resources, benefits from fuel and transport savings
outweigh these increased operational costs through lower priced wood fuel and charcoal.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
4.25 Figure 4.1 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis for the RMP and figure 4.2 for the
DSMP. Both components thus appear very robust against the risks and uncertainties that may
affect their economic performance. The figures display the changes (shown in the Y axis) in
each of the cost and benefit streams for the component to yield a given ERR (the X axis). The

point where the curves intersect along the X axis corresponds to the component base case
ERR.
4.26 The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that significant changes must result before the ERR
of either project component would drop below the 12 percent benchmark. For the RMP
component, the ERR would not drop below the 12 percent benchmark unless either
investment costs increased by more than 150 percent, operational and control costs increased
by more than 900 percent, transport costs declined by more than 70 percent, or the agricultural
productivity gains declined by more than 200 percent. For the DSMP component, the 12
percent benchmark would not be reached until investment costs rose above 600 percent, the
cost of the improved stoves increased by more than 500 percent, or fuel savings declined by
more than 70 percent (figures are approximations).

PROJECT RISKS
4.27 The principal risks surrounding the implementation of the proposed project includes the:
limited capability of the GOC; non-cooperative villages and conflicting land tenure systems
which limit the access to wood-producing areas; possibility that fraudulent practices (by the
army or police forces) might limit the efficiency of the wood fuel monitoring system into
N'Djamena; and social obstacles that may arise in implementing fiscal reform, which could
result in higher wood prices to the consumer.
4.28 The up-front commitment of GOC to proceed with reforms is a good indicator of the
political will to support this operation. During preparation of the project, these risks were
addressed by: conducting several participatory studies to verify and maximize villagers'
willingness to cooperate; designing a simple and transparent system to monitor the origin and
flows of wood fuels; providing financial incentives for most actors in the sector; developing a
participatory approach to project design; and limiting the role of GOC in project
implementation, complemented with the increased participation of non-governmental
organizations, local communities, and the private sector.
4.29 The user fee system has been designed to limit fraudulent practices and obtain higher
benefits for all involved. Legitimate transporters will now have proof that they should not pay
any "informal" taxes along the way and may have recourse if the old system persists. Sultans
have an incentive to get as many rural markets in operation in their Canton, as the derived
benefits will rapidly exceed what he would have received otherwise.

Forest Resources and Woodfuel Productivity
Forest Resources
Detailed resource data are now available for the N'Djamena area, based on satellite
imagery (7 scenes, using SPOT 3 with recordings in September 1995 and November 1994).
In addition a two-week ground truthing period in November 1995 was carried out to assess
provisional forest classes, measure sample sites to provide estimates of biomass yield by
forest type, and assess the value of different wood species to calibrate the satellite data. These
data are sufficient for a first order estimate of the availability of resources in the N'Djamena
wood catchment area. This recent study confirms previous observation: degradation and
deforestation are increasing, but there is still enough resource left to maintain woodfuel as
N'Djamena's primary energy source, on condition that current trends are reversed quickly.

REPUBLIC OF CHAD
HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT
Forests - Institutional Framework
1.     Land tenure. In Chad as in many other Sub-Saharan countries, land tenure is
complicated as the official law, Islamic law, and traditional laws prevail simultaneously.
Official laws are the published laws, approved by the government; Islamic law dictates that a
person is free to harvest natural resources for his own use, free of charge, as natural resources
are shared by all living in the society. Traditional laws are more like traditions practiced by
local sultans, village chiefs, etc., small rents are paid by villagers for the use of natural
resources. In many cases these laws are applied without problems, but problems arise where
laws from the different systems compete. A good example is the wood fuel exploitation:
central authorities provide transporters with a permit to cut wood in certain villages, without
consent of (without even discussing with) the villagers who claim it to be their own resource.
2.     Forest Legislation. A major factor constraining improved land management is the
ambiguity of rights to land use and ownership. While current legislation stipulates that the
land belongs to the state, it also recognizes certain land-use and property rights of traditional
groups or individuals. Two main problems have resulted from this ambiguity: (a) private
groups that harvest forest resources for commercial purposes are not concerned about
sustaining the resource base because they feel no sense of ownership; (b) forest agents place
no restrictions on the wood harvesting by private parties; and (c) villagers can not deny
woodcutters access to the forest resources within their territory. In essence, forest
administration reflects current practice more than the legislation and much of commercial
wood activity escapes taxation since the monitoring of forest offtake and transport is
sporadic.
3.     Institutional Framework. Chad's forestry staff is insufficient in number and in
expertise to effectively manage its forest resource base. There are only 283 professional staff
allocated among various staff categories (Table below). The staff chiefly responsible for field
execution of forestry programs, the technical advisors and their agents, account for only 16
percent of total staff, which implies on average 29,000 km2 of territory to monitor per
forestry agent. The forestry aides, contractual surveyors, and various forestry officers often
have a low level of technical skills. To develop a competent, motivated staff, GOC needs to
establish several types of training programs, local and foreign, for all levels of forestry
services. In addition, the focus of involvement should change away from control and
policing, to extension and providing advise. Responsibility for maintaining wood resources
should be given to rural villages, which is in their daily interest. Forestry staff should assist
villagers to develop management systems that allow them to do this efficiently.

4.     Fiscal Regime. The current fiscal regime in the forestry sector is neither sufficient
for resource management nor for revenue collection. Anyone may engage in wood commerce
by paying related forestry fees and purchasing a cutting permit. GOC's Department of
Forestry grants permits on a monthly basis and determines the forestry fee based on the
estimated number of trips to the forested area and the quantities taken; these estimates are
usually far from reality. After obtaining the permit it is possible to cut wood in any rural area
within a given zone. The field monitoring of forest exploitation is practically nonexistent and
it is easy to circumvent permit control.
5.     The estimated rate of revenue recovery is only about 10-15 percent. Forestry staff are
insufficient for the monitoring required. A better rate of revenue collection could generate the
funds necessary to finance management services or technical support in the wood production
zones. To address weaknesses in the fiscal regime, the ESMAP study recommended that the
Government establish a new fiscal and regulatory system based on: a fee level that reflects the
cost of wood replacement; the channeling of the proceeds from fee collection to managers and
owners of forest resources (i.e. villages); and incentives for reinvesting revenues from fees in
forest management activities and reforestation.

HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT
Energy Prices and Household Use of Fuels
Energy Prices
1.    Woodfuels. The woodfuels market, which amounts to over US$ 20 million per year,
operates through numerous private operators who set prices based on laws of demand and
supply. The main pricing issue for woodfuels is that the producer price of wood does not
reflect the economic cost of producing wood, resulting in overexploitation of resources.
Taxes levied on firewood and charcoal do not correct this deficiency. Illegal and
unsustainable harvesting of woodfuel resources is in large part the cause of this problem as
woodfuel is mined as a common property resource and thus in large part goes unvalued.
Furthermore, it is difficult to estimate the true wood value at the present time given omissions
in the existing data base.
2.    Petroleum Products. The Government fixes the prices petroleum products based on
the cost structure of the operations of the GPP, which purchases the products from the various
refineries in the West Africa region, Nigeria, or on the international market. Prices in the
parallel market are about 15-30 percent below official prices, partly because some operators
bypass import duties and taxes. Petroleum product taxes are high and vary according to
product: CFAF 112 per liter for gasoline; CFAF 62 per liter for diesel oil; and no taxes on
kerosene. The price of kerosene is CFAF 270 per liter, and LPG CFAF 600 per kg. LPG
doubled in price since 1994, where as the price of kerosene remained relatively stable: it was
CFAF 225 in 1993, and CFAF 240 in 1991.
3.     Electricity Tariffs. Chad's electricity tariffs are very high: the average price of
electricity for low-voltage consumers is CFAF 170 (US$ 0.34) per kWh (for a consumption of
about 150 kWh/month), and respectively CFAF 108, CFAF 200, and CFAF 84 for medium
voltage customers during normal, peak, and low hours. The reasons for this high price are the
low demand on the system, the use of expensive high speed diesel generators, the poor
condition of the distribution network, high losses, and the weak institutional structure of the
subsector. The tariff includes a social safety net for the energy charges (the first 30 kWh @
CFAF 83/kWh, the next 60 kWh @ CFAF 197/kWh, the following 60 kWh @ CFAF
177/kWh, and above that @ CFAF 201 /kWh. Added to these energy charges are 11 % tax, I %
surcharge, and maintenance costs and rent for the meter.
4.    Charcoal Prices. Charcoal prices are around 40-50 CFAF per kg. These prices are
comparable to those of other West African countries in the Sahelian region. According to the
1992 survey, there is a significant correlation in the price per bundle for woodfuels and the
distance of the sales point from the capital. For example, the average price per bundle of
wood is CFAF 10.6 per kg at a distance of 20 km but at a distance of 100 km, it declines by 30
percent to CFAF 7.6 per kg. For charcoal, which sells by the sack, the price 100 km from the
N'Djamena is 20 CFAF per kg, 40 percent lower than the price at 20 km from the capital, 32.3
CFAF per kg. The prices that the wood merchants pay from the village supply sources varies
as well, with the price of a truckload of wood ranging between CFAF 15,000 and 20,000,
averaging CFAF 1.9 per kg. In 1995, the retail price of wood is slightly higher than in 1992,



Annex 2.3                                          SAR - Household Energy Project

at around CFAF 20 - 24 per kg. The devaluation of the CFAF did have a major impact on the
retail price of charcoal, which increased sharply to about CFAF 80 per kg in 1995.

Process To Create Resource Management Systems
Box 1: The Main Stages in the Creation of a Rural Woodfuel Market
I) Information Campaign
national: tv, radio, brochure
at village level: visit by a project agent
"Presentation of the new legalframework enabling villages to
manage their own woodland areas (brush management)"
result: candidate villages
II) Selection of Candidate Villages
further information about rural markets and the management structure
rough assessment of resources, sociological survey
result: initial choice of village
III) Final Selection of Initial Villages
detailed studies: woodcutter/woodharvester/charcoaler/tenures/
pasture surveys, negotiation between and within villages on
forest boundaries, inventory of resources and productivity
result: choice of priority regions
IV) Support for the Development of a Rural market Structure
help villages set up management structure, preparation of statutes and regulations
election of members of the management structure and
training of managers, general manager, treasurer, chairman
negotiation of annual harvesting sales-quota
result: creation of local management structure and
appllication for official approval by DFPE and launching of activities
V) Official Approval
approval of the rural market, signature of long-terrn contract with DFPE
setting of legal forest boundaries
promulgation of the act of rural concessions
information to local and national professionals in the fuel wood commodity chain
distribution of coupons (tax receipts to be handed out to transporters) to
the local management structure
VI) Support and Supervision
market should run independently as soon as possible, initially assistance may be required
organizat:ionaVadministrative/technical/commercial/accounting/fmancial support
a posteriori supervision, levying of taxes by the administration
annual quota reassessment
(possible operational modifications)

Performance Indicators
Key performance indicators of the project agreed upon during appraisal include the following:
Progress in the Creation of Rural Wood Markets and Management Plans: evolution of
the retail prices of fuelwood and charcoal in the N'Djamena market; number of rural markets
set up within the supply basin for wood energy in N'Djamena; rate that rural markets
sufficiently cover forested areas within the priority zones identified by the wood management
plan for N'Djamena; producer price of wood and charcoal in green zones compared to yellow
& red zones; and of woodfuels supplied from green zones compared to the other zones,
including how much of urban demand these sales represent.
Monitor of Wood Products Flow: monthly change in the rate GOC recovers taxes on wood
for energy, based on the data of various monitoring stations to be set up in N'Djamena; and
amount of tax revenues collected annually in the rural markets, benefiting local communities.
Effectiveness of increasing the Efficacy of Household Fuel Use Program: monthly sales
of improved firewood, charcoal, kerosene, and LPG stoves in N'Djamena; increase in the
share of households actually using improved stoves in N'Djamena; estimated real savings that
accrue to households from the use of improved stoves; and increased supply and use of
modem fuels.
Project Management: extent to which AEDE will be able to autofinance; implementation
according to project documents.
A table with more fully developed indicators on a year-by-year basis is presented on the next

HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT
Basic Assumptions and Demand Scenario
(i) All tables range from year 1998 through 2017, although some of the middle columns are
not printed for space limitations.
(ii) The border price oe kerosene is taken as the economic value. The border price is CFAF
166, which is of the same order of magnitude of other landlocked Sahelian countries.
However, the official price structure in Chad allows for a retail price of CFAF 260, based on
imports from Yaounde, Cameroon. Even allowing for a higher purchase price due to low
quantities, and allowing for high transport cost provisions, the official price structure is too
high. Prices are projected according to World Bank commodity forecast figures.
(iii) All costs and benefits are discounted at 12%.

HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT
Avoided C02 Emissions
Avoided C02 emissions have not been incorporated in the analysis, although they are a real,
though global benefit, that can be obtained by implementing the project. A total of some 1.05
million tons of carbon will be avoided over a 20 year period, mainly from a reduction of
woodfuel consurnption, and of better wood management and carbonization techniques. As a
first order estimate, emissions related to the fuel consumption of the with/without situation
are calculated, assuming that there is no difference in deforestation (this is a very
conservative estimate, as the "with" situation will be characterized by a reduced
deforestation, and thus reduced emissions.
Current GEF guidelines prescribe a willingness to invest in C02 mitigation activities to the
tune of about US$10 per avoided ton of C02. Applying this value to the flow of avoided
emissions gives a net benefit of about 2.9 million (NPV). Alternatively, an equivalent
avoided cost of about $6.2 per ton of C02 would be applied to the project if GEF were
willing to finance the total project costs.
The following table shows this in more details:
