Project Appraisal Document
A: Program Purpose and Project Development Objective
1. Program purpose and program phasing: (see Annex 1)
The Second National Environmental Program (NEP II) seeks to improve environmental quality in priority
areas by increasing the effectiveness of environmental institutions at local, state and national levels in
Brazil. The proposed project would be the First Phase of the Program. The goals of the Program include
institutional strengthening through improvements in environmental regulation, environmental monitoring,
coastal zone management and decentralization aimed at improved management and conservation of
priority environmental assets. The Program would assist in the identification of key environmental
problems in Brazil's 26 States and the Federal District, and help to build the capacity to manage them
effectively. In the First Phase, the focus would be primarily on institutional strengthening; as the
Program evolves, the focus would shift to improvements in environmental quality. The mechanism for
inducing policy improvements would be the fulfillment of Eligibility Criteria by the States (summarized
as a Policy Matrix in Annex 11). The program follows the successful implementation of the National
Environmental Project (NEP I) supported by a World Bank Loan (3173-BR) that focused on capacity
building and strengthening key endangered ecosystems.
To reach its goal of improving management capacity of priority environmental assets, the Program would
implement, over a ten-year period, a phased approach to institutional strengthening and State investment
projects in environmental management. The Program consists of three Phases:
P Phase I (the Project) would focus primarily on institutional strengthening (Monitoring, Licensing and
Coastal Zone Management (CZM)) and the identification and prioritization of environmental
problems as specifically described in this PAD (Estimated Duration: 3 years). Under the Monitoring
subcomponent, Phase I would focus specifically on the monitoring of water quality.! During this first
phase, States would set environmental priorities, provide evidence of achieving policy advances and
be evaluated and categorized into three Eligibility Classes using the Environmental Policy Matrix as
Eligibility Criteria (Annex 11). Investments in environmental subprojects in a limited number of
states could occur in this phase.
* Phase II would focus primarily on investments in the management of selected environmental assets2
at the State level (4 years). States would become eligible for matching grants for subprojects based
on the Eligibility Class they have achieved (the higher the Class, the larger the grant). Institutional
strengthening activities would also occur in Phase II and a Mid-Term Review would be conducted to
assess the efficacy of the Program and the possibility of creating a fourth Class to encourage States to
continue improving environmental performance.
* Phase III would focus primarily on investments in priority environmental assets (3 years). As States
continue to adopt more advanced policies, improving their capacity to manage environmental
resources, they would become eligible to receive larger grants. Institutional strengthening activities
would not occur in this Phase.
2. Project Development Objective: (see Annex 1)
Phase I of the Program (the Project) would strengthen decentralized environmental management at a State
and municipal level through two components implemented in parallel fashion: (A) Institutional
Strengthening and (B) Environmental Assets. Component A would consist of licensing, monitoring of
' In view of the limited time of Phase I and the highest demand for Monitoring services relates to water resources, it
was agreed that Phase I Monitoring activities would focus on water quality.
2 Environmental Assets are defined as natural resources, or the built environment, that provide important services to
human communities.

water quality, and coastal zone management, three primary instruments for environmental management.
Component B would consist of: (i) States' adoption of more advanced policies, measured by their
fulfillment of Eligibility Criteria; and (ii) technical assistance for State priority setting, identification and
preparation of specific subprojects designed to enhance or protect the services provided by specific
environmental assets through the establishment of integrated, participatory management systems based on
stakeholder coalitions. Investment in environmental subprojects could occur under the Environmental
Assets component.
3. Key Project (Phase I) Performance Indicators: (see Annex 1)
The first phase of the program would support the adoption of policy improvements and the enhancement
of performance through thie strengthening of decentralized environmental management. These policy
improvements would create the basis for the implementation of environmental assets subprojects i-I the
subsequent phases of the program. The indicators for the project would be measured in terms of:
*  Adoption of policy improvements through the fulfillment of eligibility criteria (See Annex I1);
* Establishment of consensus on environmental priorities and development of strategies for addressing
them in twelve states;
* Implementation of subprojects under the Environmental Assets component in at least three Stales;
* Qualification of at least twelve States for matching grants in Phase II;
* Modemize and update environmental licensing systems in at least ten States;
*  Increased transparency and accountability of environmental institutions through improved licensing
procedures (including the use of new instruments such as compliance agreements, self-regulation,
tradable permits and other innovative environmental management instruments) in at least ten states;
* Implementation of improved and decentralized water quality monitoring systems and dissemination
mechanisms of relevant data to decision makers and the general public in a timely fashion in at least
five States;
* Improved and rationalized enforcement capacity tlhrough monitoring and licensing activities;
* Development of coastal zone baseline studies and improved coastal zone management capacity in
eight States.
4. Key Program Performkance Indicators: (see Annex 1)
Subsequent phases of the P'rogram would build on the activities and results of Phase I, strengthenin:.;, in
particular, the States' capacity to identify priority problems, implement environmental subprojects ;nd
achieve improvements in environmental quality. A point system based on the number of States tha
qualify in each Eligibility Class would serve as the triggers between Phases I and II and between Ph ases I1
and III (see section B.5. for a detailed description of these triggers). In addition to the point system that
would trigger subsequent phases, Program performance would be measured in terms of:
* Implementation of policy improvements through fulfillment of eligibility criteria by States;
* Identification and ranking of key environmental priorities in each participating State and the
formulation of cost-effective plans to effectively manage these assets;
* Design and implementation of environmental asselts subprojects having measurable environmen :al
quality impacts under the agreed guidelines;
* Achievement of environmental quality targets in thie participating states (as part of the targeted
outputs3);
* Implementation of improved licensing systems in at least 20 States (through the reduction of
bureaucratic bottlenecks, and the use of new instruments such as compliance agreements, self-
3"Outputs" refers to improvernents in environmental quality as a result of successful subproject implementaticol,
such as reduction in pollution levels in streams or airsheds, reduction in rates of deforestation in threatened
ecosystems, successful implementation of a conservation management plan for a conservation unit, etc.

regulation, tradable permits and other innovative environmental management instruments) as part of
the targeted inputs4;
* Implementation of improved environmental monitoring systems and dissemination mechanisms of
key environmental data to decision makers and the general public in at least 20 States.
* Attainment of the highest level of capacity for Coastal Zone Management as defined in the
Operational Manual in thirteen States.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
CAS document number: 16582-BR   Date of latest CAS discussion: June 12, 1997
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Since 1994, the GOB has focused on economic stabilization, including control of inflation, control of
public expenditures, debt reduction, improved efficiency in public sector services, and privatization of
state-owned enterprises in key sectors. As part of its reform program, the Federal Government has
stressed decentralization of government services in the areas of health, education, public sanitation, and
others. The Ministry of Environment has also adopted a policy of decentralization of environmental
management. The 1988 Federal Constitution, mandated Federal-State and Federal-Municipal revenue
transfers but in some sectors did not create specific responsibilities for service delivery by States and
Municipalities. In the environmental area, the Constitution created "concurrent responsibility" for
environmental protection by States and Federal Government creating some ambiguities regarding
institutional responsibilities. Environment has been an important priority because of: (a) growing public
awareness of environmental issues and the need for improved environmental management; (b) increasing
government sensitivity to domestic and external criticism of poor natural resource management; and (c)
growing recognition in both the public and private sectors that better environmental management provides
a competitive edge to Brazilian business.
Environmental problems in Brazil have nevertheless continued to increase in severity. Many rivers and
streams, including important sources of urban water supply, have become severely polluted by municipal
waste, industrial pollution and non-point-sources. Many coastal areas suffer environmental degradation
from poorly regulated industrial and residential expansion. Some beaches have become unusable for
bathers. Many natural areas have been degraded by extensive cropping and grazing practices, predatory
logging, and destruction of riparian vegetation. Many species of plant and animal are threatened with
extinction. Airsheds around major urban and industrial areas, such as Greater Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro, have become seriously polluted from industrial and transportation sources. After a decade of
relatively slow growth, Brazil began a period of growth in the 1990s, supported in part by foreign
investment. These developments did not, however, lead to a commensurate modernization in how public
agencies deal with environmental issues.
Until about 1994 Federal environmental strategies focused largely on green issues and were largely
reactive to external pressures, at which time they began to become increasingly more oriented to
domestic, especially urban pollution, issues. The GOB has now officially adopted a policy of sustainable
natural resource development and decentralization of environmental management. Brazil is taking
measures to implement the recommendations of Agenda 21 of the 1992 UNCED Conference. Progress
has been achieved in managing pollution in selected watersheds, strengthening the management of
conservation units, sharing of responsibility with State environmental agencies, improving dialogue with
the private sector on environmental management, 'green' revenue sharing schemes, and stimulating
greater interest in the use of economic instruments for environmental protection.
4 Performance indicators will be divided among Inputs, Outputs and Impact. "Inputs" refers to successfully
completed investments such as equipment acquired, training carried out, studies concluded, preparation of plans, etc.

Project Appraisal Document
On the less positive side, Brazil has not been able to collect and disseminate reliable environmental
information in a timely and comprehensive fashion. Environmental licensing procedures are often
onerous to private enterprise, causing delays and possibly discouraging public and private investment.
Environmental enforcement is spotty and relies excessively on command-and-control; and environ rnental
institutions have not become measurably more efficient in their environmental protection activitie . The
kinds of public-private alliances needed for better environmental management have not emerged ir most
places.
The financial crisis that struck Brazil in late 1998 had an impact on the environment because the
government made deep budgetary cuts on a number of proposed and existing environmental projec.ts in
MMA. Since then, the economy has gradually stabilized and the environment has again surfaced a.s a
priority for GOB. In addition, the crisis accentuated GOB's need for fiscal discipline, exhorting pressure
on ministries and agencies to deliver concrete result.s.
Perhaps the single most imrportant tool for environmental management in Brazil today is the licens. ng
process. This process, applying to industrial, agricultural and public-sector activities, is mandated y
Federal regulations but imiplemented primarily by the States. It has, however, by common admission
developed serious flaws which, if left uncorrected, will blunt its usefulness as an instrument for
environmental management. Among them are (i) the reliance on license fees as a source of revenues by
environmental agencies; (ii) its degeneration into a "paper process" in which vast amounts of information
are produced, but the key environmental objectives are not addressed squarely; (iii) the centralization of
all licensing activities in a single state agency and their consequent inability to focus on high-impalt
activities; and (iv) the lack of post-licensing monitoring and enforcement of agreements.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposed project would address a number of the issues mentioned above by: (i) helping to clarify the
respective roles of the Federal, State and local governments in environmental protection by shifting
accountability to local level; (ii) strengthening environmental institutions, particularly at the State End
municipal levels; (iii) supporting new initiatives such as public-private partnerships in environmenral
management and economic instruments; (iv) improving the quality and reliability of relevant
environmental information to strengthen enforcement efforts; (v) improving effectiveness of the ex sting
regulatory system, particullarly environmental licensing; and (vi) supporting specific subprojects to
improve environmental quality in selected areas involving both "brown" (pollution) and "green" (natural
resource) issues. Since most environmental problems are local in scope, it is appropriate to strength en
State and municipal capac ity to deal with them.
There is evidence of a strong desire by local officials and the general public for stronger environmecital
protection and sustainable use of natural resources. The strategy, developed in a series of meetings with
State environmental officials, requires strengthening of certain key tools. Broadly speaking these are
improvements in environmental information, strengthening of the regulatory system, and continuato r of
the decentralized program of Coastal Zone Management begun under NEP I. The latter activity in ol ves
training of states, production of baseline data and training in basic techniques for participatory
environmental management in coastal areas. These activities together form a basis for states to an,lyze
and rank their primary environmental problems based on systematic analysis of environmental risks and
cost-benefit analysis. However, other pressing problems such as health, security, education and
infrastructure often crowd out environment in public decision making. Strengthening the tools
mentioned, with a strong results orientation, will help environmental issues to gain ground against cther
competing demands on public and private resources, and will also help strengthen the public constil .lency
for environmental reform.
MMA has adopted a broad strategy for improved environmental protection in Brazil which, in turn, is
consistent with the recently promulgated multi-year National Plan which incorporates improved



Brazil: Second National Environmental Project                                      Page 7
Project Appraisal Document
environmental management as one of 12 macro objectives. NEP II would be an integral part of the
Ministry of Environment's overall strategic plan, complementing other programs in the same Ministry
(see Annex 13 for a Letter of Development Program from MMA).
4. Program description:
NEP II would be implemented in the Adaptable Program Lending (APL) mode in order to provide phased
and sustained support for a long-term program reflecting the States' demands and priorities, and
contributing to improvements in environmental quality. The APL format would enhance NEP II by
providing a long-term perspective and flexibility, together with clear incentives to the States to
continuously improve their environmental capacity and performance in priority areas. Furthermore, the
APL would allow for a quicker response in channeling additional resources to States that achieve
institutional and environmental improvements in accordance with their short, medium and long-term
objectives and targets.
Brazil's States are at markedly different stages of environmental management capacity in terms of
legislation, monitoring and enforcement capabilities. The Program would set graded Eligibility Classes
as an incentive for both more and less advanced States to make policy improvements and enhance their
capacity for environmental management and, thereby, environmental quality. Achievement of higher
Eligibility Classes would provide access to greater amounts of resources (see Box 1). Thus, the system
would function as a graded series of incentives for States to improve their institutional capacity and
ability to manage key environmental assets. Actual environmental quality improvements would accrue
both from this increased capacity and from the environmental subprojects.
The Program would be implemented in three Phases over a period of ten years. The overarching goal of
the Program is for States to increase their capacity to effectively manage their natural resources and
control pollution, which would bring about improvements in environmental quality. The role of the
Federal Government would be standard-setting, technical assistance, and coordination. States would
participate on a voluntary basis, pursuing the goals set by themselves in accordance with their own
priorities, under a rigorous but flexible set of eligibility requirements.
Participation in the Environmental Assets Component would be conditional on a State's adoption of key
policy improvements, measured by the fulfillment of Eligibility Criteria (see Annex 11). These
Eligibility Criteria would be serve as mileposts on the road to more effective environmental management.
States would be provided with technical assistance throughout the life of the Program to attain these
benchmarks and would become eligible for increasing amounts of financial support as they attain higher
levels of environmental management capacity. This financing would be provided in the form of matching
grants, available from Phase I onward (if States have met the eligibility criteria for policy improvements,
and if the subproject proposals have been approved by the Supervisory Commission), for State-proposed
environmental assets subprojects that match the priorities set by the States during Phase I. Fulfillment of
these requirements would serve as indicators of the growth in enviromnental management capacity by the
states and as the "trigger" indicators for advancement from Phase I to II and II to III (see Chart 1).
A review of project performance would take place eighteen months after effectiveness of Phase I, or
before fifty percent of project resources have been committed, whichever occurs first. This review would
focus on, inter alia, the following issues: i) cost-sharing arrangements; ii) effectiveness and transparency
of priority-setting processes; iii) coherence of State priorities; iv) impact of any new federal legislation;
and v) appropriateness of the point system. This Review would enable the Bank and MMA to make
necessary corrections and take required steps for preparation of Phase II of the Program. A Mid-Term
Review would occur during Phase II to re-assess the appropriateness of the Environmental Policy Matrix
and the Program Triggers (discussed below).

5. Performance Triggers for subsequent loans:
A point system would be used to evaluate Program progress and trigger subsequent phases of the
Program. States qualifying for Class I would represent one point; States qualifying for Class 2 would
represent two points; and States qualifying for Class 3 would represent three pointg. The total nurmiber of
points possible would be 81 (27 States x 3 points).
The numbers given below are illustrative of the targets, but the actual trigger would be the Trigger Score.
This would provide greater flexibility in that different combinations of states in different Eligibility
Classes could fulfill the trigger score. The incentive for the States to adopt more rigorous policies would
be the availability of larger matching grants for Environmental Assets subprojects. Benchmarks frar
triggering subsequent phases are shown below:
Phase I: The first Phase, the Project, would focus primarily on strengthening the capacity of federaLl and
state environmental institutions to monitor water quality, develop effective licensing schemes, and
determine environmental priorities. By the end of this first Phase, lasting approximately three years,
States would be categorized into one of three Eligibility Classes. Investment in environmental
subprojects could occur in this phase. A Mid-Term Review would be conducted and agreed chang;l s in
the Program could then be incorporated.
)    Trigger 1: The trigger for moving into Phase II would be that a total of 40 points (Trigger Score)
is reached.6 Once this benchmark has been attained, Phase II of the Program could begin.'
Phase II: Phase II of the Program would focus primarily on the implementation of subprojects und:er the
Environmental Assets conmponent. Institutional Strengthening activities, particularly Monitoring and
Licensing, would occur in this Phase as well. Participating States would be eligible for grants based on
what Class it has attained (the higher the Class, the larger the grant). The States would then direct the
matching grants to finance the best evaluated proposal that best corresponds to the needs of the State, as
identified in Phase I of the Program. Phase II would be expected to last approximately four years, . nd
States would be eligible for more than one grant during this period provided that the State has adva&icad to
the next eligibility Class. In the middle of Phase II, a Mid-Term Review would be conducted and agreed
changes in the Program could then be incorporated. If needed, a fourth Class could be added at this time
in addition to other adjustrnents. Phase II is expected to last approximately four years.
*    Trigger 2: The trigger for moving into Phase III would be that a total of 54 points (Trigger Score)
is reached.8 Once this benchmark has been attained, Phase III of the Program would be appriised.
Phase III: Phase III of the Program would allow for the States to implement additional subprojects
assuming advancement to the next highest Eligibility Class, and the consolidation of the lessons lea -ned
from all the subprojects. This Phase, expected to last approximately three years, would allow States to
complete all subprojects and derive valuable lessons from other State subprojects in order to plan fui ure
environmental quality projects and programs.
The table below provides a graphic illustration of the progression of the Program by showing the nu nbers
of States that would qualify for each Class at the end of each Phase, beginning with the current stath 3.
5 States would not automatically qualify, but would be required to submit specific evidence of eligibility.
6 For example, 6 States do not qualify (Class 0); 5 States in Class 1; 13 in Class 2; 3 in Class 3 = 5 + 26 + 9 = 4).
Any combination totaling 40 or more points would trigger Phase Two of the Program.
7 Actual appraisal of this Phase would occur 3-4 months before the predicted attainment of the Trigger Score.
s For example, 6 States at Class 1; 15 at Class 2; 6 at Class 3 = 6 + 30 + 18 = 54. Any combination totaling 5i. or
more points would trigger Phase III of the Program.

Under the simulation shown in the table above, over the life of the Program, 27 States (including the
Federal District) would meet the eligibility requirements for least at Class 1. The eligibility requirements
refer mainly to the institutional means and legal framework for environmental improvements. Investment
subprojects supported under the project would stipulate measurable improvements in environmental
quality as goals. Table 2 shows the size of the grants available for each Class and the cost implications of
these grants.

9 A contingency of US$15-20 Million per Phase would be allocated for the following purposes: (i) States can
become eligible for a second grant at a higher Class within the same Phase of the Program; and (ii) in the event that
the trigger score is surpassed, resources would be available to all eligible States.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
No specific conditionalitAy would be written into the project agreement, but the fulfillment of the
Eligibility Criteria under the Environmental Assets component would require significant reforms in most
States. Some indicative reforms would be:
-  adoption of a new role for the MMA, stressing monitoring, coordination, decentralization, anc
technical assistance;
*  streamlining of State environmental licensing procedures and strengthening of enforcement arid post-
license monitoring;
* strengthening of water quality monitoring and public information procedures;
e establishing or reinforcing a comprehensive plan for the management of forest resources;
* strengthening of State water resource legislation and management;
* strengthening of enforcement capacity and procedures;
*  developing innovative financing arrangements for conservation and pollution control through evenue
sharing, cost recovery, polluter/user pays principles, etc.;
* facilitating private-sector participation in environmental management through environmental
auditing, self-regulation, and basin- or airshed-level controls;
* increasing the area under effective environmental protection;
* improving management of conservation units, including better integration with buffer zone
communities in surrounding areas;
* strengthening of State environmental councils;
* strengthening of States' capacity to set priorities and select the most cost-effective solutions tc
pollution/degradation problems.
In addition, the project would enhance coordination among environmental agencies by clarifying r( les in
licensing, monitoring and project implementation at all levels of government. For instance, it is ex 3ected
that the licensing and monitoring subcomponents would strengthen and rationalize the enforcemen:
efforts in the states. Also, the setting of environmental priorities in the States would help guide an

Project Appraisal Document
coordinate the efforts of municipal, state and federal agencies, and establish the grounds for dialogue on
the policies and actions needed to address the identified issues.
3. Benefits and target population:
The project aims at achieving measurable improvements in environmental quality in specific regions to be
identified through priority-setting process implemented at a State level. The beneficiaries of such
improvements would be the populations adversely affected by pollution or other forms of natural resource
and environmental degradation. The consequences of environmental degradation and depletion of natural
resources have a disproportionally large effect on the poor. Thus, it is anticipated that improved
environmental protection resulting from the project would be especially beneficial to the poor, especially
as regards improved water and air quality. The participatory nature of the Environmental Assets
subprojects will assure that the poor have a voice in their design and a role in their implementation. The
project would: (i) benefit local communities through targeted investments to improve critical
environmental assets and resources; (ii) strengthen the capacity of States, municipalities and other entities
(e.g. river basin committees) to conduct environmental monitoring, licensing and management that will
allow decision-makers to make informed choices that promote sustainable development; (iii) improve the
planning capacity of affected local governments by strengthening their capacity to mitigate water, air, and
land-based pollution and to actively manage coastal areas; and (iv) strengthen MMA's role as a
coordinator of environmental policy, technical advisor, and disseminator of methods to improve
environmental quality. Each subproject financed under NEP II would be based on the identification,
quantification, and measurement of environmental quality improvements, benefiting target populations
through pre-defined and agreed performance indicators. The participating institutions would include
municipal and state government agencies responsible for environmental protection and public health."'
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would be located in the Executive Secretariat (SECEX) in MMA.
MMA currently administers a wide range of projects supported by local funds, the World Bank, the IDB,
and other multilateral and bilateral agencies. Synergy among various externally funded programs will be
assured by a newly formed Department of Institutional Relations and Agenda 21, attached to the Office of
the Executive Secretary. This Department will ensure that all Programs under the Ministry are consistent
with the Ministry's policy goals, and act to prevent duplication of effort and conflicts among programs.
MMA has demonstrated a capacity to manage and coordinate environmental funds with differing
objectives. The Ministry has a relatively small core staff, but it has shown that it can make good use of
expert consultants and other institutions to achieve the level of expertise and quality required to
implement projects. MMA also has acquired considerable expertise in budgeting, project accounting,
procurement and coordination of external executing agencies, at all levels of government and private
sector. Under the National Environment Project (NEP I), the Ministry acquired considerable experience
in administering a decentralized program of investments similar in form to the Environmental Assets
subprojects. NEP I required coordination of more than 100 different implementing agencies. Likewise,
many States and municipalities gained considerable experience through implementation of PED projects.
This knowledge will help in setting up and managing the subprojects contemplated under the
Environmental Assets Component.
The Ministry would directly contract all consultants providing technical assistance to the States under the
Institutional Strengthening component and for the prioritization exercise for the Environmental Assets
Component. For the implementation of subprojects, the Ministry would enter into operating agreements
" Once the recently passed legislation (Law 9,790/99) is fully implemented with enabling regulations, it will be
possible to include NGOs as proponents and implementing agencies of subproject activities.



Brazil: Second National Environmental Project                                         Page 14
Project Appraisal Document
with the implementing agencies, which may include States, Municipalities, and eventually NGOs (see
footnote I 1) in order to transfer project resources directly to the implementing unit.
Each year, the Project Coordination Unit would prepare an annual operating plan, outlining the
investments to be made under the project. A Supervisory Commissioni2 would be established in tle
Ministry and would ratify decisions concerning fulfillment of eligibility criteria and subproject proposals.
The components of NEP II would be reviewed at. least annually by the Supervisory Commission. The
Commission would also review the Annual Operating Plan.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
(a) Institutional Strengthening of the National Environmental Agency (IBAMA) and the Ministory of
Environment - The National Environmental Project iNEP I), predecessor to the proposed project, -nade
considerable investments to strengthen IBAMA and the Ministry, including extensive training programs,
the acquisition of equipment, and the development and application of new planning instruments for
Federal Conservation Units. NEP I also supported an Institutional Analysis and Reorganization of
IBAMA but this was not successful during the period of project implementation.13 This approach was
rejected for NEP II because (a) the goals of NEP I have already been partially achieved; and (b) it is not
compatible with the GOB's decentralization policy., IBAMA would continue to play an important role in
environmental licensing and enforcement. The proposed project design conserves and strengthens the
Federal role in setting standards, providing technical assistance, and stimulating States to fulfill th( ir
responsibilities, but does not support expansion of direct intervention by the Federal environmenta;
agency.
(b) Strengthening of Environmental Protection in Specif c States - A number of States have benefited
from specific projects supiported by the World Bank, IDB and bilateral agencies that seek to strengthen
environmental management. While these targeted projects have brought some benefits, they have no1'
taken advantage of the cornpetitive approach proposed under the present project, nor have they genorally
succeeded in catalyzing institutional or legislative reforms in the States. Finally, while these projec:ts
have benefited some States, other States, particularly some of the smaller and weaker ones, have not lhad
access to support for improved environmental management despite the presence of severe environn ental
problems. The proposed project would provide investment support to any State meeting the eligibi: ity
requirements and would provide technical assistance to all States willing to attempt to meet these
requirements.
(c) Directing more support to poorer states- It would seem desirable to direct more funding to the s tates
with less-developed environmental management capacity, especially under the Environmental Asse :s
Component of the Program. This objective is partially achieved in that stronger states would be rec uired
to contribute higher levels of counterpart funding than weaker states.'4 Directing greater support to
12 The Supervisory Commission would be composed of three representatives from the MMA (Executive Secrc ary,
SQA, and SRH); and one representative each from ABEMA, the NGO community, and the private sector, for IL total
of six members.
13 Among the reasons for the lack of success of the IBANA reorganization were (a) lack of full management
support; (b) resistance from employees; (c) management instability; (d) unwillingness of IBAMA to relinquisi
direct interventionist role even where manifestly ineffective.
14 The minimum and maximum limits for counterpart funding are as follows:
*  10%-20%: Acre, Amazonas, Rond&nia, Roraima, AmapA, Para, Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do N )rte,
Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia, Tocantins, Goias, Distrito Federal, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso
do Sul.
*  20%-40%: Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul.

weaker States was not adopted because: (i) most of the technically "weaker" states are also financially
weaker and they lack the capacity to absorb large investments; (ii) environmental problems are often
more severe in more advanced states and require greater investments to correct; and, most importantly,
(iii) under the NEP II design, financially weaker States would be equally able to receive technical
assistance to address their priority environmental issues and fulfill the eligibility requirements on the
policy matrix.
(d) Similar to proposed project but with open-ended reform program - Under this scenario, the project
incentives and reward structure would be similar to the proposed design, except that, rather than a
uniform set of benchmarks, each State would develop its own reform plan, the achievement of which
would fulfil the eligibility requirement. This altemative was discussed with MMA and rejected on the
grounds that it would be administratively and politically nearly impossible to hold States to
individualized, self-defined reform plans.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The National Environmental Project (NEP i) was the Bank's first stand-alone, national-level project
designed to strengthen environmental institutions. It has achieved many successes and yielded valuable
lessons on how best to help borrowers improve environmental management. Lessons have been taken
from a number of other projects financed by the Bank and other institutions designed to strengthen
environmental institutions and improve environmental quality. Among the most important of these
lessons are the following:
*  Stand-alone investments in Institutional Strengthenidg are less effective than an approach which
focuses on specific improvements in institutional performance and in environmental quality;
m Local ownership and initiatives are essential for stand-alone subprojects;
*  The incentive structure for agencies and stakeholder alike must be carefully analyzed to provide an
adequate framework for improvements in environmental quality;
*  Sustainable improvements in environmental quality require partnerships between federal/local
governments and public/private sectors;
*  Planning and studies (e.g. zoning and databases) must be complemented with implementation;
p Widespread public information, transparency and clear rules enhance the policy leverage of the
matching grants program;
*  The encouragement of environmental constituencies are key to Institutional Strengthening;
*  Relatively small matching grants can provide sufficient incentives to States to adopt significant
environmental reforms;
*  The Information System for Coastal Management (SIGERCO) created under NEP I improved the
participating states' capacity to develop and use systematic information using a GIS previously not
available to most of them. These activities also laid the basis for preparation of local management
plans and monitoring which are underway in many states using advanced tools of environmental
analysis including benefit-cost analysis of alternative investments.

Project Appraisal Document
* After the midterm review of NEP I, the Matching Grant component (PED) was implemented v ith
great success.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
NEP II is an important goal of the Ministry of Environment and of the States of the Republic. The current
Minister and high officials of the Ministry and other branches of the GOB have declared their
commitment to decentralized environmental protection, and to sustainable development along the ] nes
indicated in Agenda 21 of the United Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).
Indications of the GOB and MMA's commitment to environmental reform include following:
*  Improvement of Environmental Management is one of the twelve Macro objectives of the Latest
Brazilian Five-Year Plan;
*  Statement from the Mi nister of Environment dated May 1999 (See Annex 13) endorsing the AlL
format and committing the Ministry to support the first phase of NEP II;
*  In spite of financial instability during 1998-1999, funding for NEP II was assured by GOB;
*  The rich experience and success of the Decentralized Matching Grants (PED) component of NEP I;
*  Four preliminary meetings with State environmental representatives have led to open endorsemi nt
and support for NEP II;
*  Passage of a comprehensive Water Resources Law (Law 9.433) in January 1997, establishing tlhe
river basin as the basic unit of monitoring and control, recognizing water as an economic good, mnd
allowing for rationalized management of water resources;
e  Expansion of the minimum size of the "legal reserve" to be preserved under natural vegetation ifor the
Amazon Region (Presidential Decree 1997);
-  Revision of Federally-mandated environmental licensing regulations through CONAMA Resoh.tion
237, December 1997 strengthening and streamlining licensing requirements and extending licensing
authority to the municipalities;
-  Creation of 8 new National Forests in the Amazon Region (Presidential Decree 2.480) of February
1998;
-  Renewal and strengthening of the National Environmental Fund to strengthen actioans by Civil S ciety
for environmental protection;
e  MMA has held meetings with State Secretaries of the Environment in October 1998 and June 1U 99
where the State represe-ntatives have expressed strong support for the Program.
*  At a meeting held in August 1999, in which representatives elected by the NGOs participated, tl arr
was a strong endorsement of the project design.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank has considerable experience in the design and implementation of projects involving
enviromnental institutional capacity building in Latin America and elsewhere, of which the National
Environmental Project (NEP I) in Brazil was the first. To date, 29 such projects have been complete I or
are under supervision, including operations in Brazil (NEP I), Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Honduras, TrnLildad
and Tobago, Ecuador, Colomnbia, and Venezuela. This experience has recently been assessed in a pa per
by the Environment Department'5 whose major conclusions have been incorporated into the present
project.
The Bank also possesses considerable experience in Brazil and elsewhere in the design of decentrali2 d,
demand-driven municipal development and natural resource management project components, incluc ing
the highly successful matching grants (PED) component of NEP I, which was introduced in 1994
following the mid-term review of that project. The Bank has also accumulated considerable experience in
the design and implementation of social funds for rural poverty alleviation in Northeast Brazil and
15 "Environmental Capacity Building - A Review of the World Bank's Portfolio." 1997.

elsewhere in the world. While aiming primarily at the strengthening of municipal governments or poverty
alleviation rather than environmental protection, such projects share many characteristics with NEP II by
combining Institutional Strengthening goals and components with the financing of priority investments
identified by local stakeholders.
E: Summary Project Analysis: (detailed assessments are in the project file, see
Annex 8)
1. Economic: (supported by Annex 4)
I Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$     million;
[X] Cost Effectiveness Analysis"6
[X] Other (see Annex 4)
Economic evaluation methodology:
The outputs of the first phase of the program would not be subjected to benefit-cost analysis because
these would be mainly related to institutional strengthening. During the subsequent phases and through
the implementation of environmental subprojects, however, the program will promote the use of
economic analysis methods in the manuals and through technical assistance programs, in order to ensure
that the subprojects proposals lead the Municipal and State participants to use least-cost methodologies as
they weigh environmental investment options and decide on specific solutions. The data to be generated
through the monitoring subcomponent, in particular, will be used as inputs to the analysis of cost-
effective investment solutions for water resource quality.
Specific actions to improve environmental conditions would have effects that can be described in terms of
costs and benefits. For the purpose of efficient allocation of resources, these benefits and costs should be
compared so that those showing greatest benefit to cost ratios would be financed first. Since the proposed
Project would finance actions (sub-projects) from a broad range of sectors, it is desirable to monetize the
benefits and costs of each proposed sub-project. Applicants shall identify beneficiaries of projects
estimate the value of improvements in environmental quality, human health, productivity, amenity values,
and/or ecological functions. They would also identify total costs involved (including negative costs on
other economic agents). This is aimed at broadening the "simple" traditional analysis of the financial
costs of projects. If monetary values cannot be defined, a clear description of the (likely) benefits and
costs, as well as clear indicators for monitoring achievements, must be made.
2. Financial: (see Annex 5)
The financial management system implemented by MMA before project effectiveness is structured to
provide financial, monitoring and procurement control. The financial system has demonstrated its
capacity to maintain adequate accounting, financial reporting, and auditing systems to ensure the
provision of accurate and timely information regarding project resources and expenditures to auditors and
the Bank.
An evaluation of the transition from the financial management system currently in place at MMA to the
LACI system was carried out by a FMS from OPR. MMA has completed nearly all the steps agreed upon
in an action plan for the system to generate PMRs and will have completed all such steps by March 31,
2000. Not later than one year after effectiveness, MMA will be enabled to prepare quarterly PMRs in a
form consistent with LACI.
16 Analysis of cost-effectiveness is one of the selection criteria for Environmental Assets subprojects. The project as
a whole has not been subjected to this analysis, because the specific subprojects that will be proposed are not yet
known.

Project Appraisal Document
The financial impact of the subprojects implemented under the Environmental Assets component would
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Specifically, the analysis would include the following:
* Evaluation of process by which resources can be transferred from the federal government to the
States; and
* Evaluation of any cost-recovery mechanisms implemented under the subproject.
Fiscal impact:
The fiscal impact of the subprojects implementecl under the Environmental Assets component woul Id be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Specifically, the analysis would include the following:
* Review of States' capacity to finance counterpart contributions (Matching Grants); and
* Evaluation of beneficiaries' capacity to support operation and maintenance of any capital
investments.
3. Technical:
Subprojects financed under the Environmental Assets component would be subject to rigorous screening
and analysis on technical, financial and economic criteria to be set out in a detailed Operational Manual
(see Annexes 12 and 12-A. for subproject screening procedures). Among the factors to be assessed are the
alternatives considered and implications of the proposed technologies in terms of operation and
maintenance requirements and costs. The component would encourage the use of simple, approprihite and
environmentally-friendly technologies. Where technologies are unproven, proponents would be askzed to
implement subprojects first on a pilot scale, then move to a larger scale if successful. The APL forinat
would make it possible to take the time needed to proceed in this fashion.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies: The Ministry of Environment (MMA) would be the primary implementing El 3ency
for the Project and the Program. State Environmental Agencies (OEMAs) would implement speci:[ic
Monitoring and Licensing subprojects during Phase I and implementing agencies, including States Md
municipalities, and eventually NGOs (see footnote 11) would implement Environmental Assets
Subprojects during Phases I, II and III. The Coastal Zone Management subcomponent would requii-e -,he
establishment of a specialized unit in States where one does not already exist. Other agencieW7,
municipalities, NGOs and local associations would be involved as stakeholders and/or providers of
technical assistance to specific subprojects.
b. Project management: Project Management issues are dealt with under Section C.4. An Operatior al
Manual has been drafted and was reviewed during appraisal. This Manual sets out the eligibility cr leria
for States and sub-state entities (municipalities, river basin committees, etc.) to participate in the
Monitoring, Licensing, Coastal Zone Monitoring, and Environmental Assets components. A specia ized
unit would be established (at State expense) to manage the Coastal Zone Management component it, each
coastal state where such units do not already exist. The Ministry of Environment has established a
subproject monitoring and evaluation capacity developed with Bank assistance under NEP I. Each
specific subproject supported under the Environmental Assets component would also be required to
include Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities in its design, including clear environmental
performance indicators. Subproject appraisal criteria for the Environmental Assets component incht de a
viable institutional framework built around existing institutions, avoiding, to the extent possible, the
17 Among the agencies that might provide technical assistance and otherwise participate in specific subprojects are
EMBRAPA; State Agricultural Research and Extension Agencies; OEMAs; Universities and Research InstitutK s;
and Public Utilities involved in the production and transmission of energy, water supply, and telecommunicaticns.

creation of new structures that may present sustainability problems (see Annex 12).
5. Social:
Social issues are likely to arise in the context of specific subprojects under the Environmental Assets
Component. MMA would establish a screening procedure to identify such issues in subproject proposals
and would ensure that appropriate expertise is applied to problems that may arise. As part of the appraisal
of each proposed subproject, social issues such as risks and benefits to vulnerable populations would be
identified and addressed in a manner consistent with Bank policy.!' Since the poor are most often the
primary victims of pollution and other forms of environmental degradation, MMA would ensure their
interests are considered and that legitimate representatives of the poor participate in subproject design and
implementation.
Environmental problems often involve conflicts over resource use, for example between manufacturers
and the victims of pollution, or commercial and artisanal fishermen. The Program would help provide
reliable environmental information to all parties to environmental disputes to assist in their resolution.
The licensing component would develop and pilot new approaches to public consultation as part of the
EIA exercise. More importantly, the EA Component would seek to promote negotiated solutions to
environmental conflicts that conciliate between the need for production and society's demand for a clean
environment. The EA Component would require the formation of local stakeholder coalitions that will
develop and implement management plans for the assets to be protected. During Phases I and II,
workshops and seminars would be held to disseminate best practice in participatory environmental
decision-making. A study was carried out of a number of similar programs to provide guidelines for the
social participatory dimensions. '9 Some of the lessons learned include: (i) the risk of subproject
discontinuity could be minimized by the inclusion of additional stakeholders during implementation; (ii)
environmental subprojects tend to produce results over a long period which needs to be taken into
account; and (iii) the role of the Federal government as a mediator can be crucial in resolving local
disputes.
6. Environmental assessment:       Environmental Category  []A    [X] B      []C
This project would be beneficial in environmental terms both directly and indirectly. The subprojects to
be supported under the environmental assets component, which would be closely monitored and assessed,
are expected to result in measurable improvements in environmental quality. The project would also
improve the management capacity and effectiveness of federal, state, and (selected) local environmental
institutions.
For purposes of OP/BP 4.01, this project is assigned to environmental Category B since some of the
subprojects under the Environmental Assets component may have limited adverse environmental impacts,
such as the construction of a visitor center or a small water monitoring station. All potential subprojects
would be screened by MMA and the Bank for potential environmental impacts and, where appropriate,
environmental analysis and mitigation planning would be carried out as required under Brazilian
environmental law20 and Bank Guidelines (see Annex 12-A for Subproject Environmental Screening
procedures). These screening, analysis, and mitigation procedures are set out in detail in the draft
Operational Manual reviewed during appraisal. MMA's capacity to screen and monitor subprojects for
possible adverse environmental impacts and to ensure the design and implementation of adequate
mitigation measures, if necessary, was reviewed at appraisal.

Environmental Assets Subprojects would include clear identification of stakeholders and the form ratlon of
a stakeholder coalition to design and organize a subproject that fairly represents all major stakehol ders
directly affected by, or concerned with, the Enviroinmental Assets that are the object of the subpro ect.
During Phase 1, courses wvould be held to train future proponents in Stakeholder Analysis, Particir itory
Management, and Conflict Resolution. Proponents would be required to demonstrate that the desi gn and
implementation of the subproject would be carried out in a participatory fashion. The managemenit of the
subproject would be expected to reflect the legitimate interests of all stakeholders.
A Subproject Selection Committee in each State would include representatives from state environmental
agencies, civil society, the private sector, academia and others. These Committees would ensure that
subproject proposals are evaluated fairly and in a transparent manner. In addition, the Supervisorv
Commission would resolve disputes within States with regard to the Subproject selection process ;rnd to
serve as an informnation bank so States would be able to learn from other States' experiences (see Section
C.4).

b. Other key stakeholders:
During preparation, consultations have been held with major project stakeholders including state
environment Secretaries and heads of State Environmental Protection Agencies (OEMAs), and fut&ire
consultations would be conducted with selected local government officials and representatives of tlhe
private productive sector and NGOs. An initial workshop was held with representatives of 17 state
environmental agencies in February 1998, at which time the basic project concept proposed by the
Ministry of Environment was strongly endorsed. In addition, a World Bank-organized workshop o0
priority setting attended by the Secretaries of Environment of many States was held in July 1998 in
Recife, Pernambuco. Two additional meetings with State Secretaries were held in October 1998 an,i June
1999, the latter enabling recently-elected Secretaries to learn about and discuss project design. In A ugust,
1999, a meeting was held wvith representatives from NGOs, who expressed strong support for projec t
design.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Sustainability is a major focus of the project design. Every feature of the project would be analyzed for
financial, institutional and political sustainability both at the overall Program level and at the level of
individual Environmental Assets Subprojects. Sustainability is one of the criteria that would be used
during the State subproject selection process (see Annex 12).
Financial sustainability would be assured by building in cost-recovery wherever possible through user
fees, application of polluter/user-pays principles, revenue sharing arrangements, etc . Revenue flows
would be analyzed and measured to direct such flows to critical cost centers necessary to sustain project
or subproject activities. Similarly, monitoring and enforcement activities would be designed so as to
ensure adequate revenues to cover operation, maintenance and depreciation of equipment.
Political sustainability would be based on: (i) decentralized and participatory priority-setting; (ii)
enhanced public awareness of environmental issues through improved dissemination of environmental
quality data; and (iii) local stakeholder participation in the design and implementation of environmental
assets subprojects.
Institutional sustainability would be supported through the benefits of a streamlined licensing system for
actual and potential licensees.
21 Four States (PR, SP, MG, and RO) have implemented a revenue-sharing scheme known as "ICMS Ecol6gico" in
which a portion of the State VAT is allocated to municipalities that encompass conservation units, watersheds, and
other important environmental assets. NEP II would encourage the extension of such schemes to other states.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Some of the environmental assets subprojects could involve issues that have regulatory bottlenecks or
competition for scarce resources such as water. However, the project design calls for participatory
management of environmental assets involving the collaboration of all relevant stakeholders throu!-;h a
process of negotiation. Through this process, controversies are expected to be minimized or avertl :d,

Annex 2: Project Description
Brazil: Second National Environmental Project
Environmental Assets Component - US$10.0 million
The project would provide technical assistance to States through the Ministry of Environment to support a participatory
process of priority-setting and the adoption of improved policies and other measures to achieve the priorities identified.
As an incentive to improve their environmental protection and management capacity, States would be eligible for
matching grants for environmental subprojects designed to produce measurable environmental benefits within a definite
time frame. Eligibility would be ascertained at three levels, each corresponding to a larger grant size. In this project,
Phase I, the federal government would make resources available to States for the purposes of: (i) setting state
environmental priorities (US$0.84 million total); ii) fulfilling Policy improvements on the Policy Matrix shown in Annex
11 (US$1.6 million total); and iii) a limited amount of investment in subprojects for the first qualifying states ($7.5
million).
Like the States, IBAMA would be required to meet a set of specific Eligibility Criteria in order to access funds to
strengthen their capacity to manage Conservation Units. Technical assistance could be provided to IBAMA for this
purpose under this project.
Subprojects would be defined by their proponents, which may include municipalities, but should be selected from among
each State's priority environmental problems. The subproject could support the public-good component of such activities
as minor works, rural extension, reforestation, ecotourism, infrastructure for conservation units, and treatment of solid and
liquid wastes, provided such subprojects are defined around measurable improvements in environmental quality, and
designed and implemented in a participatory fashion (see Annex 12 for Subproject selection criteria and procedures).
Section C.4 includes detailed information on the institutional arrangements in regard to the subproject selection process.
Institutional Strengthening Component - US$14.6 million
This component would help strengthen the institutional capacity of both federal and state environmental agencies,
focusing primarily on the following key instruments of environmental management:
Environmental Licensing Sub-component - US$7.8 million
The licensing subcomponent would support innovative activities to strengthen and improve licensing procedures at a State
level. This subcomponent would complement the Environmental Policy Matrix and would also strengthen enforcement
and post-license monitoring capabilities. The activities supported under this subcomponent could include: assessment of
the current status and future needs of state licensing systems, priority setting, development of streamlined procedures,
production of technical manuals, staff training, and development of improved post-license monitoring and enforcement
techniques. The subcomponent would also provide support for the development of innovative instruments such as
compliance agreements, self-regulation, voluntary compliance and tradable permits. The project could also support
limited devolution of licensing capacity to qualified municipalities.
Water Quality Monitoring Sub-component - US$3.9 million
The monitoring subcomponent would support improvements in State-level water quality monitoring systems by financing
the upgrading of existing monitoring systems or installing new monitoring systems in water basins where there are actual
or potential conflicts in water use. The subcomponent would not support creation of new institutions for water-quality
monitoring, but would seek to strengthen existing institutions that collect and analyze water quality by improving their
techniques, integrating their efforts, and ensuring that the results are made available in a timely fashion to decision
makers. The financing could be used to assess needs, model water quality, design and build monitoring systems, analyze
and disseminate water quality data to decision-makers, and to disseminate approaches to water-quality management using
monitoring data. The subcomponent would also serve to develop information management systems with a high level of
access (e.g. use of intemet) for interested parties and easy retrieval for dissemination.

Project Appraisal Document
Coastal Zone Management Sub-component- US$2.9million
The coastal zone management component would provide support to up to 15 coastal States (excluding Sao Paulo and Rio
Grande do Norte which have already developed adequate capacity levels) for developing environmental zoning activities
and management plans. Specifically, resources would be made available to coastal States to build technical capacity and
acquire necessary equipment, train personnel, carry out baseline studies in selected coastal zones, and prepare
management and monitoring plans for selected coastal areas.
The project would also support the strengthening of a national shoreline management system. Activities that could be
financed under this project include a classification of shoreline types; the identification of the most sensitive coastal
habitats; and socio-economic analyses of coastal and on-shore marine biodiveristy.
Project Coordination Component - US$3.0 million
This component would finance Project Coordination (PCU) within the Executive Secretariat in MMA, providing support
for project management, institutional articulation, project monitoring and evaluation, financial management, procurementll
and other necessary functions.

Annex 4: Other
Brazil: Second National Environmental Project
Summary of benefits and costs:
The project is expected to generate major benefits accruing from more effective monitoring and licensing
processes in the States. These benefits would be captured by all persons benefiting from environmu antal services
provided by project activities, such as cleaner water, cleaner air, less forest degradation, etc. A Bank study (Von
Amsberg 1997) quantifies some of the benefits that can be expected, for example, for pure water su pplies.
The costs of improved monitoring and licensing procedure can only be estimated once specific proposals are put
forward by the States and municipalities that would adopt such systems. MMA will require that such proposals
be linked to estimates of the potential benefits that such activities can be expected to produce so as to produce a
crude benefit-cost analysis and to stimulate the proponent to consider the lowest cost alternative that will prodaice
the greatest social benefit. The conditions in which such activities will be carried out, however, are so varied that
it is impossible to present specific benefit/cost estimates in this PAD.
The same comments apply to the Environmental Assets subprojects. These subprojects would be appraised in
regard to their capacity to produce social benefits and a benefit-cost analysis is a required component of the
selection criteria.
Main Assumptions:
The primary assumption behind the above paragraphs is that more effective environmental protectio)n provides
benefits in the form of lower exposure to disease vectors, a more pleasant and livable environment, reduced costs
from environmental "clean-ups," more efficient production methods, and lower public-sector costs per unit
benefit produced.

Annex 12
Environmental Assets: Sub-project Selection Criteria and Procedures
The following is a suggested procedure for selecting among proposals for support under the Environmental Assets
component. Before any of these criteria can be applied, several requirements should be met:
(1) Transparency: the procedures and criteria to be employed in evaluating and selecting subprojects should be fully
divulged to all potential candidates and a timetable for submission and evaluation announced;
(2) Legitimacy: each participating State would appoint a Subproject Selection Committee to call for proposals and
evaluate those that meet the basic eligibility requirements; this committee should be composed of persons who command
respect in their respective areas of work but who are not necessarily representatives of any stakeholder group; the
committee should include state officials, academics, representatives of professional associations (e.g. sanitary engineers),
and civil society; clear rules should be established to excuse individuals from discussions where they may have a conflict
of interest or the appearance of conflict;
(3) Adherence to procedures: the timetable should be organized to provide ample time for local groups across the State
to become aware of the program, to prepare proposals, and to review the proposals; it is important that the selection
procedure take place such that competing proposals can be compared in the same time frame;
(4) Technical Assistance: during the preparation stage, the State Coordination Unit can legitimately play the role of
"honest broker," especially by attempting to match up community groups, NGOs, Government agencies, professional
specialists, and other stakeholders in order to encourage partnerships and integrated solutions while, at the same time
providing access to information.
Stage I - Pre-qualification: Basic Requirements
The first stage in the selection process would be to screen proposals that do not meet the basic requirements and,
therefore, are not able to be evaluated objectively. Proposals that do not include the following information would not be
considered for funding:
*  Evidence that a priority problem previously established by State officials or identified during priority-setting process
would be addressed by the subproject;
* The environmental assets to be protected or enhanced are significant and clearly defined;
* Detailed budget and budget justification broken down by activity;
* Timetable of activities indicating who is responsible for each activity;
* Specific performance benchmarks over the life of the project;
* Time-bound, measurable environmental quality goals;
* Sufficient technical data to justify proposed activities;
* Full information on other financial support currently available or being sought by any of the coalition members;
* Members of the management coalition clearly identified with evidence of intention to participate;
* Provision for Monitoring and Evaluation of proposed activities.
The proposals that provide all the information required in Stage 1 above would be evaluated during Stage 2 of the
selection process. Any proposal not meeting the above pre-qualification criteria would be excluded from competition
(alternatively, the State could provide an opportunity for communities to revise and resubmit proposals after a preliminary
review, provided that the same opportunity is open to all proponents).

Stage 2: Selection Among Eligible Proposals
A ranking system would be applied to the proposals that successfully meet all basic requirements in Stage 1. Each
member of the Subproject Selection Committee would be given a copy of each qualifying proposal, as well as a list of
criteria and instructions on how to assign points to each proposal for each criteria (provided below). It is important to
note that all subprojects should help the State attain the next level of Eligibility as defined in the NEP II Program.

Annex 12-A
Subproject Selection: Environmental Screening Procedures
Procedures for Prior Characterization of the Environmental Impact of Integrated Environmental Asset Management
Subprojects
The aim of state subprojects to be submitted under the Integrated Environmental Asset Management (EA)
Component would be the improvement of environmental quality and the conservation and rational use of natural
resources. It is expected that, in general, these subprojects would not cause negative environmental impacts and
consequently would not require mitigating actions. However, if there is a need to carry out actions that might cause
environmental or social impacts on the subprojects, the proponents would follow the procedures described in this manual.
Thus, all state subprojects submitted under the Component would be subject to an environmental screening that would
seek to identify possible negative environmental and social impacts in subprojects to be executed.
The procedures for this classification are divided into 3 stages detailed below and summarized in the attached flow chart
(Annex A):
i)    Analysis and Evaluation Stage : state subprojects, containing a description of the potential negative impacts
of proposed activities, would be classified by the PCU in Categories A, B or C (according to the likely degree of
environmental impact). The Supervisory Commission would issue prior approval for the next stages;
ii)    Licensing and Preparation Stage for Indigenous Resettlement or Development Plans * subprojects classified
as A or B proceed to prepare licensing and necessary plans; and
iii)   Implementation Stage * subprojects in Categories A and B, approved by the Commission and suitable for
implementation (having fulfilled necessary requirements), and subprojects in Category C (without significant
environmental impact) begin implementation and carry out environmental monitoring of implemented actions.
Stage I - Analysis and Evaluation
EA subprojects proposals, prepared by states, would contain a description of their potential environmental
impacts, in a specific section. Thus, proponents may have a preliminary judgment on their respective subprojects, and
consider measures needed to minimize these impacts in subproject design.
After being sent to MMA for evaluation, subprojects would be reviewed by the PNMA II Technical Group which
would classify subprojects into Categories A, B or C, according to the degree and scale of potential impact:
Category A - Subprojects with high environmental impact or social impact
A proposed subproject would be classified in Category A if it incurs any othe followng siuaion -r

species or their habitats, causing damage or degradation to a large area, increasing the risk of diseases (such as
schistosomosis), or destabilizing an ecosystem;
*  Causing the removal of populations (and consequently, the need for resettlement); and/or
e ng a population of; its meas of making a living (provided this is legally supported); or
*  Affecting indigenous areas. .----- ----          
It would be taken into consideration that the impacts of Category A subprojects    affect a wideraa than theJocations-
to be, physically modified.

Category B - Subprojects with moderate environmental impact
This environmental classification would be sunmmtarized by the Technical Group in an environientl summary
sheet, with an opinion on each subproject (annex B), to be sent to the Program's Supervisory Commission -iDr review.
The technical opinion would flag possible issues to be settled, such as the need for environmental l i zensing, a
Resettlement Plan (when the subproject causes involuntary removal of the population), or an Indigenous Development
Plan (when the subproject affects indigenous groups). Final approval of the subproject is therefore subject lo the
settlement of such issues.
Stage 2 - Licensing and Preparation of Indigenous Development or Resettlement Plans (Categories A and Bj9
Category A
A subproject classified in Category A would use the following procedures, as the situation warrants:
  If the subproject is expected to interfere with indigenous populations v~ prepare an Indigenous Peoples Development
Plan (see item 2.1 and annex C);
*  If the subproject causes involuntary removal of populations, making resettlement necessary - prepare a Resettlement
Plan (see item 2.2 and annex C);
*  If the subproject causes major negative environmental impact z proceed with environmental licensing, vhich woul:l
result in an environmental licenrse (see item 2.3).
Category B
A subproject classified in Category B would proceed with environmental licensing. (see item 2.3).
2.1 - Indigenous Peoples Development Plan
The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan acceptable to the Bank would include specific guidelines ain ecl at
ensuring that indigenous populations are not harmed by the subproject and can share in its benefits.30
To deal with the request for the preparation of an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, the state would:
a) Formulate a timetable for the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan;
29 A subproject classified in Category C (without significant environmental impact) would not need to undergo this sta. e and is ready
for implementation if approved by the Supervisory Commission.
30 The state project may include in its budget several specific actions (only those directly related to project execution) fc - the
implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. However, such actions would be subject to analysis by the Program's
Technical Group, prior to approval.

Project Appraisal Document
b) Prepare the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, including consultation with affected populations;
c) Send the prepared Plan for review and approval by the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI);
d) Incorporate recommendations of the Plan (approved by FUNAI) into the state subproject;
e) Send the reformulated subproject to MMA together with the Indigenous Development Plan.
General guidelines for the preparation of the Indigenous Development Plan are listed in Annex C.
2.2 - Resettlement Plan
Preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan acceptable to the Bank is required if implementation of a state subproject
requires involuntary resettlement of populations, greater than 200 people3'.
In this case, the proponent would:
a) Formulate a timetable for the Resettlement Plan;
b) Prepare the Resettlement Plan, contemplating consultations with affected populations;
c) Incorporate the Plan's recommendations into the state subproject;
d) Send the reformulated subproject to MMA, together with the Resettlement Plan.
General guidelines for the preparation of the Resettlement Plan are listed in Annex C.
2.3 - Environmental licensing
When a subproject requires environmental protection measures, the Borrower would submit to the Bank an Environmental
Impact Report and Environmental Management Plan acceptable to the Bank. In addition, when an Environmental License
is required, the proponent would follow the procedures below:
a) Prepare a timetable for environmental licensing,
b) Proceed with environmental licensing, including consultation with affected populations;
c) Incorporate the mitigating action of environmental licensing into the proposal, as appropriate;
d) Send the proposal to MMA, together with the environmental license.
Subprojects which have actions that demand environmental licensing shall be subject to applicable legislation,
specifically CONAMA Resolution no. 001/86 (of 1/23/86) and CONAMA Resolution no. 237/97 (of 12/19//97), as well
as applicable state and municipal legislation.
Environmental licensing would be required when subprojects have provisions for the implementation of activities
related to:
*  Mineral extraction and treatment;
*  Industries and activities associated with non-metallic products, wood, paper and cellulose, rubber, leather and skins,
chemical products, processing of textile, plant and animal-origin fibers;
*  Food and beverage production activities such as processing, milling and roasting and manufacturing of foodstuffs,
cold storage, manufacturing of canned goods, preparation of fish and manufacturing of fish products, preparation,
31 When the resettlement affects less than 200 people, submission of a formal resettlement plan is not required. However, the principal
guidelines for resettling such groups are the same as for larger populations.

processing and industrialization of milk and by-products, refining/preparation of plant oils and fats, production of
butter, cocoa, lard, and manufacturing of balanced rations and prepared feed for animals;
*  Construction of civil works such as highways, dams and dikes, drainage canals, rectification of water courses, opening
of sandbanks, mouths of rivers, and canals;
*  Treatment and disposal of industrial and chemical waste and solid urban waste; recovery of contaminatid or degraded
areas;
*  Development of tourism activities;
*  Use of natural resources, such as forestry, economic development of timber and firewood and forestry s ibproducts,
management of non-native animal and wildlife breeding, use of natural genetic patrimony, managemenit of living
aquatic resources, introduction of non-native and/or genetically modified species, use of biological dive -sity by
biotechnology;
*  Other applicable situations.
Stage 3 - Implementation
Category A
Subprojects classified in Category A would meet applicable requirements (environmental licensing, indigenous
development or resettlement plans) to be approved by the PNMA II Supervisory Commission and be ready lo begin the
implementation stage.
During implementation, Category A subprojects would implement the plans' recommendations and the mitigating
actions of licensing, as required.
Category B
Category B Subprojects would have proceeded to environmental licensing in order to be approved b i the PNMA
II Supervisory Commission and begin the implementation stage, at which time mitigating actions and envir ninental
monitoring of actions would be puit into practice.
Category C
The implementation of a subproject classified in Category C may begin, following approval by the PNIU, II
Supervisory Commission.
According to the design of the Integrated Environmental Asset Management Component, during the imp)lementation
stage all subprojects would carry out an environmental baseline study of the priority area's status at subproject start-up
("ground zero") and a monitoring of the environmental impact of implemented activities. This monitoring vs ould take
place throughout the entire subproject cycle, until its conclusion, so that its impact can be properly measurec, especially
with regard to environmental quality.
4 - General Processing Procedures for Prior Environmental Description
The processing procedures to be followed, with actions by states and MMA, are:
1. The states send subproject proposals to MMA; these would contain a description of probable impacts;
2. Subprojects would be analyzed by the Program's Technical Group and classified as A, B or C. An environrnental
summary sheet (see annex B), with a technical opinion on subproject recommendation, is sent to the Pro ramn's

Project Appraisal Document
Supervisory Commission;
3. The Supervisory Commission analyzes and judges subprojects, approving them so that they can proceed to the next
stages, differentiated for each Category:
Category A
* A Resettlement Plan would be prepared (in the case of involuntary removal of over 200 people) or an Indigenous
Development Plan (if subprojects interfere with these populations) and would incorporate into subprojects the
recommendations of these plans.
* The next step is to proceed with licensing, if there is environmental impact, and incorporate mitigating actions into
subprojects, as needed.
* Indigenous Peoples Development Plans would be sent by the state to FUNAI, for analysis and approval.
* Reformulated subprojects, prepared plans and environmental licenses would be sent to MMA, which would
contract ad hoc consultants to issue opinions on Resettlement Plans. If the opinions are favorable, plans would be
sent (together with these opinions) to the World Bank, with a request for its no objection.
* Once the Bank has given its no objection, it would be sent to the Supervisory Commission, together with a new
opinion on the subprojects by the Technical Group (stressing the need to settle previously identified disputes), for
final approval.
* Once these requirements are met, the subproject would be ready for implementation, including the implementation
of the plans' recommendations and of mitigation measures for licensing, as needed.
Category B
* Environmental licensing would proceed and appropriate mitigating actions would be incorporated into the
subproject proposal.
* The state proposal would be sent to MMA along with environmental licenses. The Supervisory Commission
would give its final approval so that the state can begin subproject implementation, which would include the
implementation of recommended mitigation measures.
Category C
* Once recommended by the Supervisory Commission, the implementation of these subprojects can begin
immediately, since compliance with prerequisites is not required.

ANNEX C - General Guidelines for Preparing Indigenous Development and Resettlement Plans
C I - Guidelines for Preparation of Indigenous Development Plan
Article 3 of Law no. 6.001, dated 12/19/73, dealing with the Indian Statute, establishes the following definitions
*  Indian - is any individual of pre-Colombian origin and descent who identifies himself and is identified as belonging
to an ethnic group whose cultural characteristics distinguish it from those of the national society;
*  Indigenous Community or Tribal Group - is a set of Indian families or communities, either living in complete
isolation in relation to other sectors of the national community, or in intermittent or permanent contact therewith,
without being integrated into it.
Preparation Guidelines
In the preparation of the Indigenous Development Plan, the following would be considered as guidelines:
*  The preferences of indigenous populations affected by the subproject would be prioritized - thus, they would be
consulted through appropriate means (for example, public hearings or community meetings);
  The subproject's likely adverse effects would be foreseen and means developed to impede or mitigate them;
*  The institutions responsible for government dealings with indigenous populations would present the legal, social and
technical instruments necessary to carry out activities; the arrangements implemented would be as simple as possible -
arrangements may involve existing institutions, local and non-governmental institutions with experience in matters
related to indigenous populations;
* Local patterns of social organization, religious beliefs and use of resources by indigenous populations would be
integrated into the Plan;
*  Activities carried out would support production systems adapted to the needs and environment of indigenous
populations and help existing production systems to reach sustainable levels;
I The creation or worsening of indigenous populations' dependence on government and/or subproject agencies would
be avoided;
*  Consideration would be given to successful prior experience with, or knowledge of, the indigenous area to be the
subject of subproject interaction.
Content of Indigenous Development Plan
Plans may include activities related to health and nutrition, productive infrastructure, linguistic and cultural
preservation, land tenure and education.
Plans would contain:
* Legal framework
*  Description of current status
  Land tenure status
*  Strategy for local involvement and participation

Project Appraisal Document
  Technical identification ofl development or mitigation activities
  Institutional capacity
  Implementation timetable
*  Evaluation and monitoring
  Cost estimate and financial plan
The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan would be subject to approval by the National Indian Foundation -
FUNAI and by the World Bank.
C2 - Guidelines for the Preparation of the Resettlement Plan
Content of Resettlement Plan
The content and level of detail of the Resettlement Plan may vary according to the circumstances and magnitude
of resettlement. The Plan woulld, however, include the establishment of objectives and policies, an executive summary
and the following topics:
-  Organizational responsibilities
*  Community participation and integration with receiving population - thus, they would be consulted through
appropriate means (for examnple, public hearings or community meetings);
=  Socioeconomic analysis
*  Legal framework
  Selection of location and alternative sites for resettlement
*  Appraisal and compensation for lost assets
  Land ownership, purchase and transfers
  Access to training, jobs and credit
  Shelters, infrastructure and social services
  Environmental protection and management
*  Implementation, monitoring and evaluation timetable
*  Estimated costs
The adjustment of the Resettlement Plan would be checked by ad hoc reviewers (social, technical and legal
specialists) and would be subject to World Bank approval.

Annex 13: Letter of Development Program
from the Government of Brazil
Brasilia, May 24, 1999
Mr. Gobind T. Nankani
Director
The World Bank
Brasilia Field Office
SCN Q2, Bloco A, Conj. 303/304 -Ed. Corporate F'inancial Center
Brasilia-DF
Dear Mr. Nankani:
The Government of Brazil has requested Financial Assistance from the World Bank for the Second
National Environrmental Program which is expected to be implemented over a period of ten years in the form of
a phased Adaptable Program Loan. The objective of the proposed Program is to promote the integration of
actions to conserve the environment and natural resources and to reinforce the institutional structure and
regulations for environmental management in Brazil, with the ultimate goal of improving environmental qualily
in Brazil.
The proposed is composed of three Components which are aimed at developing integrated activities
involving conservation, protection and sustainable use of environmental assets in priority areas, and activities
for the development and operation of effective systems of monitoring, environmental licensing and coastal zone
management.
T'he Program is designed to be implemented in three phases, the first of which woulc take plao.
approximately between 1999 and 2001. In order to gauge progress in the implementation of this First Phase
and evaluate the readiness for the Second Phase, it was agreed that the States would be evaluated ini relation tco
the aggregate increase in their capacity for environmental management, according to pre-established criteria.
relating to environmental regulation; the management of environmental resources; the app:lication of'
environmental management instruments; all based on principles of participation and decentralizatior..
The Government of Brazil, through this Ministry, understands that acceptance of support J'or the First
Phase of the Second National Environmental Program does not necessarily represent a commitrne:at by the
Government of Brazil or by the World Bank to contract additional loans in support of the afox mientione6
Prograrn.
Sincerely,
Minister of Environment
