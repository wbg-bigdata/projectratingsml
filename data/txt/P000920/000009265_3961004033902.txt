MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Ghana (GOG) for SDR 29.6 million, the equivalent of US$41
million, to help finance the Private Enterprise and Export Development Project (PEEDP).
The credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. GOG would make
available $34 million equivalent to the Bank of Ghana (BOG) for an export credit program.
In addition, US$7 million equivalent would be passed on to beneficiary agencies for technical
assistance.
2.    Badcgroud. The Economic Recovery Program (ERP) launched by the Government
in April 1983 was a dramatic break with Ghana's previous policies and is one of the most
sustained reform efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa. The economic consequences of the reform
program have been positive: economic growth has averaged about 5 percent a year, and the
Government has allowed the exchange rate to ove in line with market forces, dismanted
most price and distribution controls, elimnated many subsidies, broadened the tax base,
improved tax collections, and provided more adequately for maitenance and capital
expenditre. Ihe current emphasis on ensuring macroeconomic stability to continue economic
progress includes development of the foreign exchange market to maintain a free and flexible
excchange rate, fiscal policies designed to increase public savings, and monetary policies to
reduce inflation. While these liberalization measures have been important, a robust supply
response has yet to develop in the private sector, particularly the non-traditional sector, which
would be strong enough to sustain even current economic growth levels.
3.   Ghana' focus has begun to si from economic recovery to policies and investmens
needed to stimulate accelerated growth from a more dynamic supply response, especially the
private sector. A major increase in domestic private savings and investment is required to
support this strategy over the next few years, supplemented by direct foreign investment and a
reurn of the accumulated surpluses of overseas Ghanaian capital. With these objectives, the
Government, in conjunction with IDA, has progressively developed a comprehensive enabling
framework wihin which the proposed investment credit will be used to further broaden the
base of private sector exports and exporters. A more dynamic private sector will thereby be
promoted and the foundations for sustained development furither strengthened.
4.   After several years of improved macroeconomic performance, the Govenment is
strongly committed to supporting a range of inititives that will increase and accelerate the
future growth of the economy. Notwithstanding the successes achieved, however, the
financial and private sectors in Ghana remain very fragile for the following reasons: (a) the
contiued overang of a large public sector contnes to crowd out private sector financing
and activities; (b) the restructuring of the banks and a tighter supervisory climate have yet to
create the necessary degree of self confidence within the financial sector to respond forcefully
and creatively enough to anticipate and meet the emerging needs of the private sector
especially the export sector; and (c) the inability of companies to plan or communicate their
needs to their banks and the reciprocal inflexibility of banks in dealing with the needs and
problems of such companies. lhere is thus a need in this environnent to create certain
catalydc forces to spark the necesary initiatives in export finance and develop thereby an
ongoing and sustainable capacity amongst both banks and their corporate clients.



- 2 -
5.   In 1991, IDA, USAID and GO  identified a number of issues aising fom the above
constrants cononting Ghanaian           and exporters. Recognizing a need to
establish a complamena  of efforts, it was proposed to develop two projects in parlel.
the USAID project focuses on the mau ng and export sectors, coammitting grant
funding to the development of production capacity, techical improvement, design, export
systems and foreign twing arrangements for manufcturers. The IDA project focuses on
the financal requirements of the eport sector, by developing improved export finance
conpetenies in both lenders and exporters and by conButin a financial base that wil
catalyze on a revolving basis additional short-term export financial liquidity. For the longer
term, the project has taken accowunt of the need to examine whether the absence of forward
exchange markets or credit information systems are also constraints that can be addressed to
deepe the responsiveness of the financial system. With respect to the private sector in
general, the project addresses the need to develop a framework that would support makiet-
bas Ad corporate restructuring through systematic evaluation of the enabling legal framework
and through developing capacity in the institutional debt markets.
6.    Ihe project is fully supportive of Ghana's accelerated growth sWegy vhich
emphasizes the importance of promoting non-traditional areas of agro-processed products and
light industry. While the country's trade ratios (18% ratio of exports to GDP and 25% ratio
of imports to GDP) have risen in recent years, for a sml couny and one which has the
potential to become a major West African trade hub, these ratios could increase substanaly.
The export ratio unfortuately remains low because Ghana's exports, outside of cocoa and
gold, remain relatively small. For years Ghana relied mainly on those traditonal exports of
cocoa, gold, and to a lesser extent on diamonds, timber and electricity. In recent years,
however, its other exports including manganese, bauxite, and the fudl range of non-tradional
products have been increasing. In part this can be atributed to a range of export incenives
that have been implicidy included in policies and procedures that have been implemented
since the ERP was intoduced. Until 1990 the majority of non-tradional e s consisted of
agricultura products such as pineapples, cocoa waste, tuna, lobsters, shrimp, prawns and
other fish. Now Ghana is developing exports of processed and semi-processed goods
including wood products, aluminum, and processed food. Exports of processed and semi-
processed goods first exceeded those of the non-traditonal primay agricltural exports in
1990, indicating a positive trend towards higher value-added exports. To promote further
non-traditional exports Ghana should provide non-discrnatig export incdves and must
focus on liberaizing fnance and developing infrastructure for exporting firms. It must also
consider adoping more aggressive and creative measures to attract foreign direct investment
especialy geared towards exports. GOG is committed to a wide range of actions to support
many of these initiatives.
7.   Project Objectives. The overall objectives of the proposed project are to foster the
growth of priate Ghanaian exporters by (a) promoting a sustainable export finance system;
(b) providing technical assistance to the banking and commercial export sectors to increse
their efficiency and competitiveness; and (c) supporting in addition, the development of a
business action plan to assess the legal and business requirements that will be a prrequisite to
addressing a market-driven corporate restructuring program for potentally viable enterprises
presendy located in the Non-Performing Assets Recovery Trust (NPART).
8.   Project Descripdon. The proposed project includes two principal coments: (i) a
revolving ewxport credit refinance and guarantee facility (US$34 million equivent) to assit
private eporters except for cocoa, gold, diamonds, electricity, and raw timber in obaning



short-term pr  and post-shipment finance from banks; and (ii) a comprehesive technial
assistance component (US$7 million equivalent) to finance, frsly, management and technical
training, consultant services, equipment and materials for strengthening the export finance
infastructure, and secondly, appropriate expertfrv to develop the legal and finacial issues
involved In preaing a business and action plan for dealing with restructdng viable
companies under NPART.
9. Project Flmndng. IThe total cost of the proposed project is esdmated at US$51
million eqpivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$33 million equivalent and a local
cost component of approximately US$18 million. IDA financing would cover 81 percent of
total project costs excluding duties or taxes for 100 percent of the foreign exchange
requirements and about 46 percent of the local costs excluding duties and taxes. Schedule A
provides a breakdown of costs and financing for the Project. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events are in Schedule C and the map of Ghana is attached
at the back of this report. The Staff Appraisal Report (Report No. 11607-OH) is being
distributed separately.
10.  Funds for the finance component of the  rpQ  redit faciliV will be passed to the
BOG through an apex arrangement and on-lent to participating financial institutions (PF;s) by
the refinancing of trade credits. The function and responsibilities of the BOG apex unit,
housed within an Export Finance Office (EFO), and the PFIs will be defined in subsidiary
fmancing agreements between the Government and BOG and BOG and the PFIs. PFls will be
subject to a range of eligibility criteria which wiUl specifically include that by December 31,
1994, each PFI will have achieved at least 51 percent private ownership. Approved loans for
refinancng wfll carry rates of interest that will be calculated on the following basis: (a)
Domestic Currency: cedi denominat-2d loans will be refinanced at a rate equivalent to the
average 180-day commercial bank deposit rate as published by the BOG. (b) Foreign
Currency: dollar denominat  loans will be refinanced at the equivalent Eurodollar London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) prevailing at time of loan approval plus 2.625 percent per
annum equivalent for the borrowing term. The EFO will retain a service charge of 2%
incorporated in the onlending rate to the PFI, to cover expenses. This rate structre will be
reviewed with IDA and the BOG semi-annually, to ensure that rates remain positive and
reflective of market conditions. The onlending rate from PFIs to the exporters will be market
determined. The EFO will operate within a free limit per application of $200,000 equivalent
and will not expose more than $500,000 equivalent to any one underlying borrower at any
one time. The maximum subloan will be for 85 percent of the export order. Maturities on
these loans will not exceed 360 days.
11.  The associated guarantee prora  will be an integral part of the credit facility and is
estimated to require fumding of approximately US$5 million equivalent. The purpose of the
facility would be to provide the PFI and the exporter a credit enhancement facility to incent
the PFIs to broaden their export financing. Twenty percent of the guarantee fund wiUl be
initially funded by the Government into a special Export Guarantee Fund (EGF). The
remaining 80 percent for the EGF will be funded from the first repayment installments under
the refinance facility. The guarantee will be offered either in US dollars or cedis, depending
on the underlying liability. The guarantee will be limited as follows: (a) it will only cover
the risk of default on pre-shipment credit and so will not cover receivables risk to the
exporter; and (b) access to the guarantee will be denied to any borrower who uas claimed
twice under the guarantee. Cover will be offered for 65 percent of the face amount of the



loan wihi the PFI retning 35 percent of the risk. In order to ensurc credibilit of the
guaranee, BOO will undertake to make prompt setdement of PFI claims.
12.  1he proposed IDA lebWga assisance component will provide US$7 million
equivalent to assist in financing a program aimed at overcoming deficiencies of the financial
export system. Assistance will be provided to: (a) set up the EFO at the BOO and provide
the requisite training to implement the export refiance and the credit guante fcility; (b)
train and develop both bankers and exporters on an interactive basis in the financial methods
and practices of export finance and provide onsite training prograns abroad for Ghanaian
bankers in documenary credit departments and foreign exchange departments of major
commercial banks. Banks and exporters are expected to share the trairing costs.
Approximately 420 bankers and 1,000 exporters are expected to be trained over 5 years; (c)
develop an action plan which will begin the process of identifying the legal and business
3ssues involved in developing a market driven corporate restructuring effbrt for a pilot sample
of potendally viable enterprises within NPART; (d) develop and implement the introduction of
an interational payments setlement system; (e) investigate and advise on the establishment of
a forward foreign exchange market; (t) in conjunction with the Ghana Stock Exchange,
institute a study and training program for the development of an institutionalized short and
long term debt market; (g) find an in-country study of commerca Inrance products to
support commercial companies, establish recommendations and implement appropriate
advisory programs; and (h) determine the feasibility of esti'91ishing a credit reference agency.
13.  Project Implementation. The EFO will be responsible for implementing the export
credit refinance and guaranee facility. It would be formed in the BOG and would operae
under policies that would clearly define its objectives, scope and method of operation. It
would have its own operational procedures developed to provide an acceptable degree of
autonomy to avoid undue delay in the processing of subprojects submitted for financing by
PFs. The credit components are expected to be committed over a period of about four years
from effectiveness. The EFO will also be responsible for implementing technical assistance
components which bear direcdy on the bankdng system. The Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) in the Ministry of Finance will be responsible for implementation of the corporate
restructuring program, (which will involve close liaison with NPART); the institutional debt
market study and training program, and the commercial insurance development study. The
overall responsibilities and reporting requirements of the two implementing units (EFO and
PIU) were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations with the two designated managers.
14.  Project Sustainabiilty. The project would enhance and increase the capacity of the
export sector to respond to ongoing reforms in investment, trade and banking policies, export
promotion and expansion supported by IDA financed operations as well as through close
cooperation with USAID and its Trade and Investment Project (TIP). In addition, the project
design supports initiatives to increase the provision of export credit and technical assistance to
develop the financial and other supporting infrastructure for private exporters. The credit and
technical assistance components will both enable the financial sector to provide assistance to
exporters on a revolving basis. Sustainability is reinforced by (i) market-determined on-
lending rates for the credit; (ii) the prudential guidelines that PFIs must meet; and (iii) the
building of technical capacity in the BOG and the PFIs to handle the provision of credit to
exporters on an ongoing basis.
15.  Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. The lessons that emerged from experience
in past and current operations in Ghana were applied in project preparation and design



- 5 -
including: (a) instituting simple procedures to facilitate the application of the trade credit
component of the project; (b) close consuvltation with officials of beneficiary agencies in the
design of programs and determination of terms of reference of the technical assistance experts
to ensure ownership of program goals; (c) provision of overseas attachment and on-site
training programs to strengthen institutions and upgrade skldls; (d) setting monitorable
Indicators to evaluate the extent and impact of training programs; and (e) close dialogue with
other donors at the identification and design stages of the project cycle to take advantage of
savings from implementation of related projects.
16.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project has been designed in the light of IDA's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was first discussed with the Board in December
1991 and which has been updated for discussion with tLe Board in June 1993. The CAS
emphasizes the importance of a private sector led supply response. The project will
complement the continuing role of IFC which is aiding the private sector through support for
small and medium scale enterprises and the development of the private financial sector. Ihe
project specifically addresses the overall strategic objectives by: (i) strengthening of the
financial sector by building on the progress made in earlier IDA projects; (ii) developing a
broader base of private sector exports and exporters by working in close paraUlel with the
USAID TIP; and (iii) deepening the private sector by addressing many infrastructure, legal
and other constraints holding back the development of this sector. The project will
complement and build on gains made by previous structural and sectoral adjustment loans and
will provide parallel support to the ongoing USAID TIP to reinforce private export growth.
17. Agreed Actions. The Government has appointed the managers of the EFO and the
PIU and has signed and delivered a Letter of Strategic Development Policy on the framework
for private sector development. During negotiations the following significant assurances were
obtained: (a) a shift from an ex-ante approval process to an ex-post review on all investment
no later than December 31, 1993 and that by January 1, 1995 the GIC will no longer have
any regulatory functions; 0b) detailed eligibility criteria were agreed for the PFI's including
the limitation that by December 31, 1994 eligibility would be restricted to the financial
institions having 51 percent or more private ownership; (c) recognizing the importance of
continUing support for the export sector, the Government agreed to continme to recycle the
credit funds for the purpose of providing export credit for the life of the project; (d) it was
agreed that the Government would include in the 1994 budget, for funding no later than
Februay 1, 1994, US$1 million equivalent for the Export Guarantee Fund; (e) to ensure
responsiveness to market conditions, interest rates will be reviewed on a quarterly basis; (fl it
was agreed that there would be a mid-term review of the project in 1995 to review progress
on the credit program, the corporate restructuring program, the adequacy of the institutional
arrangements, the execution and impact of the various training components and a review of
the status of he modifications to the regulation of investments and other reforms set out in the
Letter of Strategic Development Policy.
18.   Conditions for credit effectiveness include: (a) submission to IDA of detailed
proposals for implementig ff) ex-post review rather than ex-ante approval of all investments;
(U) how fiscal investment incentives will be incorporated with the filing of tax returns; and
(iii) the elimination of the regulatory function of the Ghana Investment Center (GIC); 0)
receipt by IDA of signed BOG subsidiary administration agreements; (c) designation of at
least five banks as PFls by BOG; (d) EFO and PIU will be fully staffd with personnel with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA; and (e) submission of draft bidding



- 6 -
documents/letters of invitation for the technical assistance components except for the
nternatlonal payments setement system.
19. lie preparation of the EFO's operational policies and procedures, approved by the
BOG and accptable to IDA and the issuance by BOG of a circular to the banking system
satisfactory to IDA, outlining the conditions and procedures for the utilization of export
finance and credit guarantee program by the PFIs, and the signing of a participation
agreement between BOG and at least two PFIs on terms and conditions satiscory to IDA
will be conditions for disbursemnt for the export credit and guarantee fility.
20.  Environmental Aspects. The BOG and the PFIs will review all sub-loans to be made
under the credit to satisfy themselves they ale consistent with existing environmental policies
and are emvironmentally sound.
21. Program Objective Categories. The project will clearly support the development of
the private sector. In addition, through the Impact on growth and employment, the project
should have an indwrect impact on poverty reduction.
22.   Project Benefits. The proposed project, in parallel with the USAID TIP, will assist
Ghana's accelerated growth strategy by stimulating the growth of present pnvate exporters
and expanding that number, and by helping to foster an environment in which it can flourish.
The growth of this segment of the economy is expected to contrbute to strengthening the
culture of exporting through providing the catalytic benefits of continuing export credit
support and export credit enhancement, stimulating competition and related improvements in
productivity and generating the much needed supply response and growth. Finally, the
project will promote economic development by broadening direct and indirect employment
potential, thus contributing to poverty alleviation. The tangible objectives that should be
anticipated over the five years of the project (giving due account to the parallel efforts
occurig under the USAID project) are to see: (a) private sector exports double again as
they did in the past five years; (b) the share of manufa     GDP to total GDP condinue to
mcrease; and (c) all Ghanalan banks operating as competitive prvately controlled entities and
offering the export sector viable financial infrastructure support.
23. Risks. lhe main risks are institutional. While the Government has indicated its
commitment to the proposed project, there are a nmnber of complex legal and procedural
arrangements to be overcome before it can fully deliver its objectives. Nevertheless, the
Bank's on-going economic and sector dialogues, as well as previous adjustment credits,
should assist in identifying and correcting institutional and regulatory obstacles that might
negatively impact the project. Additionally, the strong commitment of the private sector in
general, and the manufaurers' and exporters' associations in particular, helps to minimize
this risk. Further risks are related to the limked experience of banks and non-bank financial
insttons supporting private enterprises and the limited managerial and marketing experience
of the entrepreneurs themselves. The technical assistance to be provided under the project is
designed to correct and lessen these risks.



24.   _da tion. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Aticles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

GHANA - lVZrVX&    ISSUES
While Ghana's overall disbursement performace continues to compare favorably with other countries
in the Region, disbursements on investment lending have been declining since FY89. An increased focus on
implementation, complemented with actions to address generic as well as project issues, resulted in a reversal
of the trend in FY91. Key actions taken to improve performance included a Country Implementation Reiew
in May 1991, which led to a breakough in the simplification of procurement procedures and the approvl
process, and follow-on sector implementation reviews. The Resident Mission's suprvision capacity was
strengthened, and its portfolio montoring activities increased. Intensive supervision and mid-term reviews
were used to redesign slow-moving projects in accordance with Bank policy. Anticipated political changes,
along with uncertainty over possible shifts in personnel, led to a slow-down in actions to address
implementions problems, as reflected in lower disbursements in FY92. Nonetheless, continuing efforts to
improve perfonmance, including another CIR planned for 1993, are expected to bring acies back on track
after the settling-in period of the new government. The status of projects which are particularly slow-
disbursing is discussed below.
Cocoa Rehabilitation (FY88). To address the administrative problems that had led to slow
implementation, project administration has been tightened, clear working relationships between implementing
agencies have been established, and mechanisms have been put in place to monitor progress. However,
difficulties with procurement procedures and cost increases in the roads component have caused continued
delays in implementation. Following a mid-term review in March 1992, various components of the project
have been redesigned and action taken to re-allocate credit fimds.
Mining Sector Rehablitaion (FY88). The SGMC rehablitation component has been lagging
substantially, owing to slow decision making on joint venturing and rebabilitation of the min. A
cofinanciers' meeting was held in October 1992. This downsizing of SGMC represents significant progess
which will now allow the appropriate preparation of plans to close the remaining mines. In November 1992,
an agreement was reached on the divesdture of SGMC's two major mines.
Forestry Resources Management (FY89). Implementtion problems included weak project
management, shortage of professional staff, and government uncertainty about the likely effectiveness of the
technical assistance program. Actions have been taken to enhance staff training, seek appwval for an increase
in incentive packages, and restructure the technical assistance program. Project management has now
improved, implementation procedures have been simplified and action taken to reallocate proceeds.
Rural Finance (FY89). Disbursements have improved during the last twelve months. Recent changes
id the cost of funds to participating banks and the removal of of subloan ceilings are expected to increase
disbursements.
Water Sector Rehabilitation (FY90). There has been significantprogress in resolvingfinancial issues
(tariff rates were increased in February 1992), and steps have been taken to address institutional problems.
The key issue of shortage of qualified senior management staff, however, remains unresolved; it will be taken
up with the new Government after the settling-in period. After long delays, physical implementation of the
project is now on track and disbursements are expected to pick up at the end of the engineering design stage
in May 1993 when the rehabilitation process begins.
