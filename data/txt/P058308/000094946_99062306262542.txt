A: Project Development Objective
1. Project Development Objectives:
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to reform its pension system through: (i) the
formulation of a sustainable funding strategy, and (ii) the improvement of pension systems in a pilot
province and a pilot city, in order to obtain experience and develop a template for the establishment of a
national unified pension system. To achieve these objectives, the project would: (a) develop an actuarial
model and use the model to assess the financial viability of the Qingdao municipal pension system and
the Heilongjiang provincial pension system according to existing parameters; (b) utilize the model to
assess pension reform options in the pilots; (c) review regulations and other issues connected with funded
schemes in the two pilots; (d) review pension administrative procedures including funds transfers, data
collection, processing and management in order to develop a procedural template; and (e) provide inputs
to national policymakers on key parameters of policy and implementation.
2. Key Performance Indicators:
A set of key performance indicators is presented in Annex 1. Key performance indicators would be: (i)
development of policy papers and draft implementing regulations on key pension reform issues; (ii)
developing sustainable funding strategies for Heilongjiang and Qingdao, respectively; (iii) installation of
automated and networked information systems and demonstrated efficiency gains emanating from such
systems; (iv) well-trained personnel capable of exercising oversight and implementing policy regulations
on unified pension system programs.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Goal Supported by the Project (Annex 1):
CAS document number: 1632 1-CHA   Date of latest CAS discussion: March 18, 1997;
Progress Note: May 28, 1998
The Bank Group's strategy and objectives of 1995 and 1997 were grouped around five major themes, one
of which was human development, comprising poverty alleviation, health, education and social
protection. This project contributes to the CAS objective of social protection by assisting Government in
developing financially sustainable parameters for pension policies based on the experiences in two pilots.
2. Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy:
China has enacted pension reforms dating back to more widespread economic policy changes in 1978. In
1986, state-owned enterprise (SOE) pensions which had operated since the cultural revolution at the
enterprise level, began to be pooled on a limited basis across enterprises at the municipal level.
Contributions began to be pooled but enterprises retained responsibility for distributing pension benefits.
In the late 1980s, pooling was extended to workers in collectively-owned enterprises (COEs) in many
cities. Since then, some joint ventures, joint stock companies and foreign enterprises have been brought
into these municipal pension pools. In 1991, a State Council decision required individual contributions
by all workers, in addition to enterprise contributions. The 1991 decision also called for an expansion of
pooling and the establishment of three tiers in the pension system: a basic benefit; a supplementary
benefit provided by enterprises in sound financial condition; and a benefit based on individual savings. In
1993, the central Government introduced individual accounts as part of pension reforms.
The most recent framework for China's pension reform was established in a July 1997 State Council
Decision adopting a unified, publicly managed system covering all urban workers. In August of 1998, a
State Council circular mandated provincial pooling to be applied nationwide. Eleven sector funds
organized at a national level (and pertaining to sectoral ministries) would also be decentralized.

Project Appraisal Document                                                             June 4, 1999
Enterprises and workers covered under separate plans or not at all would be brought into a single system,
with multiple funding channels. Key elements of the Government's current policy strategy are to: (i)
establish a nationally unified pension system; (ii) establish a system of individual accounts; (iii) separate a
basic pension which aims to set a floor of benefits, from a supplementary pension which links to
accumulated contributions; (iv) segregate pension administration from investment management; (v)
gradually pool individual pension funds first at a municipal level and eventually at a provincial level; and
(vi) establish transition mechanisms for funds in deficit to maintain sufficient benefit payments while
achieving financial solvency. A key feature of the Government's institutional strategy is to establish and
strengthen oversight institutions both at a provincial and national level.
Although considerable progress has been made in realizing these parameters, a number of important
issues are not resolved. Contribution rates continue to vary both by province as well as by municipality
within most provinces; individual pension accounts established in many communities remain essentially
notional because contributions are still largely used to fund current pensions; contribution rates for non-
state enterprises and some industrial sectors vary from SOEs and COEs and those with relatively young
work forces may have conflicting opinions on participation/unification; and individual accounts yield
neither a market nor a positive real return so that the accumulations in these accounts may or may not be
sufficient to offer an effective means of income smoothing.
In 1999, a number of pension reforms are underway as part of Government's strategy: (i) at the end of
1998, eleven sector funds previously operating on a national level apart from the SOE system had shifted
over to administration and oversight at a provincial level and such administration is in the process of
consolidation; (ii) coverage of private sector, joint ventures and foreign enterprises is being significantly
increased towards a target of over 90% during the first half of 1999; (iii) establishment of provincial
adjustment funds is just being implemented in many provinces in 1999, with the simultaneous
establishment of funding mechanisms and distribution formulae for such funds; (iv) administration is
being consolidated at a provincial level for public institutions (to date unfunded); and (v) special
programs to control early retirements are being implemented.
3. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
This project focuses on the achievement of financial sustainability in a pilot province and pilot city. A
LIL was chosen as an appropriate instrument to test policy and implementation parameters identified with
the assistance of an actuarial modeling exercise. The LIL is a means of learning from modeling and
experimentation in pilot communities then providing input to policymakers from the results as well as
from similar modeling exercises supported by other donors. The project is focused as follows: (i)
geographically on just two communities; (ii) on retirement pensions and not on health insurance,
unemployment and disability insurance which are also social security benefits provided; and (iii) on the
pension systems of urban enterprise workers and public institution employees (See section D. 1 below).

2. Key Policy and Institutional Reforms Supported by the Project:
Policy Reforms. The project would support policy studies at the central, provincial (Heilongjiang) and
municipal (Qingdao) levels. Long-term financial projections would be carried out at the provincial and
municipal levels of expected receipts from contributions and other accrued income (interest income on
assets held) as well as payouts for benefits. This would include projected cashflows for all pension
benefit systems and sensitivity analysis. These iterations would provide policymakers with a sense of
what modifications or clarifications of policy would be necessary so as to achieve such viability and
sustainability.
Parallel to the above sustainability analysis, studies would be undertaken with support of project funds to
evaluate, inter alia: (i) funding strategies for public institutions and private enterprise pensions; (ii) the
design and incentives of readjustment funds for provincial pooling; (iii) voluntary supplementary pension
accounts; and (iv) sequencing of reform measures for state-owned, collective-owned, private, foreign and
joint venture enterprises, the self-employed and public institutions, respectively.
Institutional Reforms. The project would support the development of administrative systems for the
MOLSS, Heilongjiang and Qingdao urban retirement pension programs, through: (i) carrying out of a
users needs assessment for the development of management information systems; (ii) provision of
equipment and software for pension administration and oversight; and (iii) strengthening and
implementation of procedures for pension management and oversight in the project entities. The project
would also support the identification by MOLSS of personnel skills requirements and, thereafter,
development and implementation of training programs to improve the skills of its personnel, including in:
(a) pension management and oversight; (b) pension reform policy; (c) financial projections and modeling;
and (d) pension asset management.
3. Benefits and Target Population:
Benefits. The most important benefit would be a learning process which reviews and tests policy
parameters and administrative systems for wider applicability. The learning process can have four very
important benefits: (i) policy solutions could be developed which enable state and collectively-owned
enterprises to be more competitive against enterprises in other municipalities or provinces because
contribution, benefit and investment policies are optimized so as to minimize contribution levels; (ii)
similarly, policy solutions could be developed which enable workers to receive a reasonable replacement
of their pre-retirement income while not materially penalizing new workers or newly-covered enterprises;
(iii) as unfunded liabilities are better understood at a municipal level, enterprise restructuring could
potentially be accelerated with a clearer view of the potential costs; and (iv) efficiency gains in
administration could materially reduce the costs of pension administration and increase the service
provision to contributors and retirees.
Target Population. The target populations can be viewed at three levels: (i) national level policymakers;
(ii) contributors, retirees and beneficiaries of existing pension funds in Qingdao and Heilongjiang,
respectively; and (iii) pension system members in other cities and provinces who could potentially benefit
from the wider adoption of the reforms found to be applicable in the pilots.
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Implementation Period:  Three years, October 1999 to September 2003
Executing Agencies:    Ministry of Labour and Social Security, Heilongjiang Labour Bureau,
Qingdao Labour Bureau
Project Implementation. Overall responsibility for the implementation and coordination of the Project
would be entrusted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MOLSS). A Project Implementation

Unit (PIU) has been established to oversee the project and maintain policy consistency across project
entities involved in the project, coordinating implementation and ensuring adequate financial management
(procurement, disbursement, accounting and audit) and general administration (monitoring
implementation and reporting). A Project Manager has been appointed to head up the PIU and would be
responsible for the overall execution of project activities and timely delivery of outputs. Bi-annual
progress reports would be provided by Heilongjiang and Qingdao (Project Entities) to IDA under the
guidance of the PIU and based upon a template agreed-to by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). IDA would
carry out regular supervision missions and a mid-term review at mutually agreed dates. Finally,
Government would transmit a completion report to IDA six months prior to the project closing date.
The PIU would provide procurement support to each project entity in the two pilots and liaise closely
with the designated counterpart of each. The Project Manager would: (i) prepare and update the
procurement plan for the Project; (ii) assist the project entities in the preparation of bidding documents
and advertisements for goods contracts, requests for proposals for consulting assignments, bid opening
and evaluation; (iii) monitor procurement, disbursement and audit; (iv) take responsibility for record-
keeping and financial reporting; and (iv) submit Terms of Reference, training plans and procurement
documentation to IDA as required. A Project Management Office (PMO), headed by an Implementation
Manager has been established in each of the two project entities. These managers have responsibilities
similar to that of the Project Manager for the project, albeit for their respective entities.
Consultants, contractors and suppliers would be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines, on the basis
of proven experience. Local consultants would be used wherever possible. Where foreign consultants are
used for lack of requisite local skills, special attention will be given to promoting and strengthening local
capacity through skills transfer. Each beneficiary would, therefore, appoint counterparts who would work
closely with the outside consultants and make adequate preparations before the arrival of each to ensure
the effective utilization of his/her services.
The Government will make Credit proceeds available to Heilongjiang and Qingdao, respectively on IDA
terms with each bearing the foreign exchange risk. The Government would also provide a detailed budget
for counterpart funds prior to the end of each year (cash contributions as well as in-kind contributions) as
well as evidence of actual contributions for the previous year. Such project accounts would be subject to
the same audit requirements as the other project accounts.
Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements.  Responsibility for accounts
management would be assigned to the Project Manager in collaboration with the implementation
managers. The Project Manager would maintain accounting records (project activities, resources,
expenditures and net position) in accordance with appropriate accounting standards and practices.
Financial management guidelines and a computerized accounting template will be prepared and put in
use. The Project Manager, in conjunction with each implementing agency, would update procurement
schedules and provide reports on related activities to ensure compliance with IDA requirements. During
Negotiations, agreement was reached on the following points:
All project accounts, the Special Account, and Statements of Expenditure would be audited at the end
of each fiscal year by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA. The audit report would include an
auditors' opinion;
* The audit report, certified by auditors would be provided to IDA no later than six months following
each fiscal year; and
IDA would be provided with any other information regarding the Project's accounts and audits it may
request from time to time.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements. Semi-annual progress reports, prepared on the basis of
formats agreed with MOF would be provided by each project entity through the PIU and by MOLSS to
IDA no later than March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2000. Semi-annual

supervision missions would jointly review with each implementing agency the performance of each
component, including the status of procurement and disbursement. A joint IDA-Governmient mid-term
review would monitor the achievement of project objectives, overall project execution, key project
activities, project implementation schedule, and supervision plans. it would also identiify any obstacles to
the achievement of project objectives and recommend remedial measures. An Implementation
Completion Report (I]CR) would be prepared jointly by IDA and the Government six months prior to the
closing date.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection:
The Rationale behind a Learning and Innovation Credit (LIL). Although many reforms have been
mandated and implemented, a number of important policy issues remain unclear or implementation
parameters still are being tested. Utilizing the broad approach developed in the Bank's 1996 sector study,
a LIL is an instrument which can facilitate the testing of specific policy measures and implementation
parameters, learn frorn modeling and experimentation in specific pilot communities, then review lessons
from such experience as well as the analysis supported by other donors. Based on what is learned, the
Government may support a wider program of follow-on interventions.
The Decision to Support Pilots. The key strategic choice made by Governm-ent was not to undertake
project support on a national basis but, rather, to use this project for one provincial and one municipal
pilot as a basis for learning and innovation. Government's view is that it could then learn from these
experiences to guide more comprehensive policy and institutional choices. This is consistent with the
policy making process in China whereby policy reforms are often piloted on a trial basis before being
fully adopted in national legislation.
Choice of Pilots.  The provincial and municipal pilots were chosen because of their distinct
circumstances. Heilongjiang was chosen because it is a province whose demographic and economic
circumstances makes it particularly difficult to find policy parameters resulting in financial sustainability.
Heilongjiang's economy has a proportionately large percentage of SOEs and such enterprises are
virtually entirely covered in the existing pension system. Moreover, Heilongjiang has limited automation
and identified weaknesses in administrative systems at both municipal and provincial levels. Qingdao
however, as a municipality, has achieved full unification of contribution rates, and has fully automated
information systems. It enjoys considerable economic and population growth and aims to fully integrate
itself into a provincial system (Shandong). Qingdao also has a large SOE presence with relatively high
dependency rates but also has had rapid economic growth including a large growth in joint ventures and
private companies not covered under the pension system. One criteria which the Government also used in
the choice of pilots was the ability of such pilots to repay the funds provided.
2. Major Related Projects Financed by the Bank and/or Other Development Agencies:
Background. The World Bank's role in pension reform in China was initiated by a national level
assessment which led to the 1997 publication, "Old Age Security, Pension Reform  in China."
Discussions were held with Government officials as to possible measures to follow-up upon the report's
recommendations. Two pension reform seminars were then organized in 1998 by the Economic
Development Institute, both of which were well received, later resulting in a Government request for the
proposed project. This project was also viewed as a means of testing and learning from IDA assistance in
specific communities.
World Bank and Other Donor Assistance. Given the decentralized nature of pensions in China, there
are multiple completed, ongoing and planned intervention by donors, be they multilateral, bilateral, NGOs
or corporate assistance. Although a comprehensive list is not available, projec.s identified are as follows:

* The World Bank Enterprise Housing and Social Security Project (1994) has aimed to support technical
assistance and studies in four pilot cities (Beijing, Chengdu, Ningbo and Yantai) as well as provide
support to the MOLSS and MOF. Studies have been delayed considerably since project initiation and
are expected to begin in June 1999. Analysis will be conducted of the computerized operations systems
in the four cities, financial sustainability modeling, and program evaluation/ management systems.
Technical assistance will also be provided to the MOF and MOLSS including: (i) a review of national
level policy on retirement issues; (ii) development of a management and computerized information
system to effect a nationally unified pension system; and (iii) assistance in developing a system and
strategy for retirement funds management. The project will evaluate other areas of social security
besides retirement pensions, including health, work injury and unemployment insurance. The total
amount allocated from the project for the combined social security support is US$13.5 million;
A project sponsored by seven private companies had been under development since 1997, becoming
operational in January, 1999. This project would provide US$2.1 million of financing for national
policy studies, undertaking a modeling exercise in two pilot communities (Hubei and Shanghai);
evaluating central administrative systems (MOLSS) including its MIS system and links to the
provinces; providing external and internal training for Government officials; and supporting an advisory
committee and other conferences;
* A project was recently approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This project aims to support
the formulation and implementation of administrative, legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks for
a new pension system, and facilitate the development of financial and insurance markets in support of
pension reform. The project would provide US$3.0 million of which ADB would finance US$2.4
million and the remainder would be financed by the Government. Most of the support would be in the
form of consultant assistance, both international and domestic.
* Bilateral support has been provided by the Government of the Netherlands to Chongqing municipality,
including extensive analysis of administrative and data processing needs as well as training of
municipal government staff; and
* Bilateral support has been provided by the Government of Australia to the MOLSS.

3. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design:
The project draws on the results of technical assistance projects undertaken, notably the need for: (i)
simplicity of design, based on well targeted objectives; (ii) well-defined actions with timetables for
implementation; and clear evaluation criteria with monitorable indicators; (iii) compatibility with the
institutional absorptive capacity of Government agencies and project beneficiaries; and (iv) stakeholder
involvement in the design and execution of the project. The project also aims to draw upon related

experience in the China Enterprise Housing and Social Security Project which experienced delays due to
the governance structure and weaknesses in central level coordination which made implementation
cumbersome. This project proposes a more simplified project management structure and will engage
counterparts in the pilots directly (in addition to via the PIU) in an effort to facilitate coordination.
4. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership:
The Government has requested IDA support of its ongoing efforts in pension reform. This project has
been carefully considered and is supported by the MOLSS, MOF and State Development Planning
Commission. Project preparation has been strongly supported by representatives of the Heilongjiang and
Qingdao labour bureaus as well as other senior provincial and municipal government officials. A detailed
Project Implementation Proposal was prepared by counterparts in January, 1999. The 1997 State Council
Decision #26 indicates Borrower commitment to the pension reform process. A further measure of
commitment to pension reform would be the passage of a national pension law.
5. Value Added of Bank Support in this Project:
IDA offers considerable experience in pension reform worldwide and has country-specific knowledge
based on the analytical work undertaken on China's pension system in 1996. During project supervision,
IDA would utilize experienced staff with cross-country experience in pension policy and administrative
reform issues in order to provide guidance to decision-makers.
E: Summary Project Analysis
1. Economic:
It is difficult to quantify the expected economic returns to a technical assistance operation of this nature.
Increasing the efficiency of the intermediation of pension funds (partly through economies of scale) can
result in considerable administrative cost savings. Moreover, creating a viable program for financial
sustainability can increase the credibility of a mandatory pension system and thus reduce the level of non-
compliance and increase the utility of such a system for consumption smoothing.
Project costs are expected to be: (i) direct costs of US$5.0 million to be repaid to IDA (plus service
charges over the life of the loan); (ii) direct costs by Government of US$1.3 million; and (iii) indirect
costs associated with further pension restructuring.
Project benefits are expected to be: (i) a reduction in the cost of intermediating pension assets; and (ii)
policy solutions at a municipal and provincial level which are able to minimize contribution rates and
strengthen pension planning.
2. Financial:
The fiscal impact of the pension reform program cannot be quantified at this time. However, the short,
medium and long-term fiscal impact will be quantified for the pilots through the financial sustainability
modeling exercise supported in project preparation as well as executed under the project itself. Utilizing
the output from this exercise as well as the data generated from similar exercises with other project
support, improved estimates of the potential fiscal costs of transition can be developed.
3. Technical:
The Project is technically sound and consistent with the CAS agenda. The Project has been designed in
such a way as to balance breadth and focus. Support to multiple activities has been grouped into four
project components.

4. Institutional:
a. Executing Agencies: Ministry of Labour and Social Security
b. Project Management: Ministry of Labour and Social Security, Heilongjiang Labour Bureau,
Qingdao Labour Bureau
Executing Agency: The MOLSS will have overall responsibility for implementing the Project. The
Project will be executed by a PIU located in the MOLSS, staffed with qualified personnel, including a
designated Project Manager. Each provincial and municipal project entity will also be expected to have
strong ownership for its program and has established a PMO headed by an Implementation Manager.
Project Management: The PIU and pilot implementing agencies will have staff with accounting and
financial reporting skills and some familiarity with IDA procedures. This capacity will be reviewed
throughout the tenure of the Project.
Financial Management: The project's implementation capacity has been reviewed by the Financial
Management Specialist to determine if the system and accompanying staff are capable of producing
timely and accurate information required in the production of financial reports to satisfy the requirements
under BP 10.02. The Financial Management Specialist has indicated his certification of the ability of the
PIU and PMOs to comply with this standard.
5. Social:
Pension system coverage in China is most concentrated in SOEs in urban areas. Workers, retirees and
beneficiaries from such enterprises generally tend to have higher incomes than non-urban workers
(although often not as high as employees of private companies). As such, pension reform for SOEs will
likely not disproportionately impact the lowest income groups in China nor will this project have such an
impact. The project will however, evaluate the basic benefit pension which aims to provide subsistence
income support for retirees of urban enterprises.
6. Environmental Assessment:
Environmental Category     []A   [] B    [xl C
The project is not expected to present any environmental risks and thus an environmental rating of "C"
has been agreed to. This is a technical assistance project for the pensions sector which will not have any
direct or indirect environmental impact. Neither an indigenous peoples plan nor resettlement plan has
been developed.
7. Participatory Approach:
a. Primary Beneficiaries and Other Affected Groups:
The primary beneficiaries receiving direct support from the Project are the provincial pension
management and oversight authorities in Qingdao and Heilongjiang, respectively, as well as authorities in
the MOLSS and other national policy makers in the pensions area. These organizations have been
actively consulted and involved in project preparation. They have, and will continue, to actively
participate in the development of work programs, including project objectives, assistance requirements,
budgets, timetables and performance indicators. The other most affected groups are the contributors and
retirees of the pension systems in these two pilot communities.

b. Other Key Stakeholders:
Other stakeholders are the Ministry of Finance and local finance bureaus who are responsible for fund
management.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The focal point of this project is to develop strategies (including policies and implementation parameters)
which achieve medium-term financial sustainability (pension funds that sustain themselves in terms of
cash flow sufficiency and actuarial solvency in Qingdao and Heilongjiang, respectively). The project also
seeks to assist in the development of national, provincial and municipal pension management and
oversight institutions that are able to demonstrate capacity and have the management systems to maintain
that capacity. Recognizing that strong institutions require years to develop, the project aims to initiate a
process that will maintain itself well beyond the period of the credit. Performance indicators are indicated
in Annex 1.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects.
Many aspects of pension reform invite controversy. Four are worth highlighting: (i) national unification
of the contribution rate would result in significant net benefits for some as well as significant costs for
others. This reflects the diversity of the Chinese economy and demographic distribution of workers and
retirees across different provinces and municipalities. The potential opposition of those communities
adversely affected is in addition to the technological difficulties posed. This project will assist in

reviewing the implications of contribution unification; (ii) the nature, design and sequencing of financial
market reforms is also controversial. Achieving market-based returns on individual accounts will prove
critical to system solvency and public confidence. Bearing in mind the resistance to market liberalization,
reform measures which could ensure the real value of pension assets could be implemented on a gradual
basis mitigating the short-term financial market impact. Such an approach will be explored in the policy
reviews under the project; (iii) the intention of the current strategy to extend coverage to private
companies and, more important, to eventually unify the contribution rates with those of SOEs and COEs
results in considerable controversy amongst new participants. Employees of such companies have not to-
date had the benefits of pension participation yet these companies are faced with absorbing the costs of
supporting existing retirees from SOEs and COEs. This involves issues of fairness between old and new
participant companies as well as promoting and maintaining enterprise competitiveness with the large
increase in contributions; and (iv) potential measures to link the collection and reporting of taxes with
pension contributions is controversial because of an inability to reach agreement between different
authorities on a unified strategy.

Annex 2
Pension Reform Project
Project Description
Project Component 1 - Policy Development - US$ 0.7 million. This component would support policy
studies at the central, provincial and municipal levels. Long-term financial projections would be carried
out at the central, provincial (Heilongjiang) and municipal (Qingdao) levels of expected receipts from
contributions and other accrued income (interest income on assets held) as well as payouts for benefits.
This would include projected cashflows for all four pension benefit systems - basic, transitional,
mandatory individual accounts and voluntary supplementary accounts. Sensitivity analysis would test
modifications to, inter alia: (i) effective contribution rates; (ii) coverage rates and labor force growth; (iii)
compliance rates; (iv) rates of real wage growth; (v) rates of real returns accrued to pension accounts
(interest rate assumption); (vi) adjustments to retirement ages; (vii) adjustments to the transition formula
applied; (viii) changes to the period of distribution of individual account accumulations to more closely
approximate municipal or provincial life expectancies; and (ix) modification of the basis of indexation of
pension benefits (wages to prices). Multiple iterations of such projections should be able to indicate the
feasibility of achieving a sustainable, albeit partially-funded position over a 70 year period. These
iterations would provide policymakers with a sense of what modifications or clarifications of policy would
be necessary so as to achieve such viability and sustainability.
Parallel to the above sustainability analysis, the following studies would be undertaken with support of
project funds:
* Carrying out by Heilongjiang of a study of the sustainability of its existing urban enterprise employee
pension systems, and by Qingdao of a study of the sustainability of its enterprise employee pension
systems, said studies to include: (i) the development of long-term financial projections of the
cashflows of said systems; and (ii) sensitivity analysis of said systems;
. Carrying out by Heilongjiang and Qingdao of a study, using modeling techniques, to design funded
pension systems for government agencies within its jurisdiction whose employees are not covered by
the civil service regime (Public Institutions);
* Carrying out by Heilongjiang and Qingdao of a study to develop policies and procedures to enhance the
participation in its pension systems by non-state-owned enterprises operating within its jurisdiction
(private enterprises, joint ventures and foreign enterprises);
* Carrying out by Heilongjiang of a study of the coherence of various pension systems with its
readjustment funds;
* Carrying out by Heilongjiang of a study to develop policies and procedures for the pooling of
retirement pension funds and rate unification among its various existing retirement pension systems;
* Carrying out by Heilongjiang of a study to design voluntary supplementary retirement savings
accounts;
* Carrying out by MOLSS, of a study, using modeling techniques, to design funded pension systems for
national government agencies whose employees are not covered by the civil service regime;
* Assessment by MOLSS, on the basis of recommendations from the studies carried out by Heilongjiang
and Qingdao, of the suitability of adopting policies and procedures to enhance the participation in its
pension systems by non-state-owned enterprises on a nationwide basis;
* Development by MOLSS, on the basis of recommendations from the studies carried out by
Heilongjiang, of national guidelines for pooling of funds on a provincial level;
* Canying out by MOLSS of studies to design voluntary supplementary retirement savings accounts; and
. Formulation by MOLSS of a policy paper for pension reform, including sequencing of measures for
state-owned, collective-owned, private, foreign and joint venture enterprises, the self-employed and
public institutions, respectively.

Project Component 2 - Information Systems Development - US$ 4.2 million. This component would
support the development of updated and revised information and related administrative systems in the
MOLSS, as well as in the Heilongjiang and Qingdao labour bureaus, respectively. The aim of such
administrative reform and automation is to create greater capacity, increase processing efficiency,
strengthen control provisions and establish record-keeping and processing capabilities. The following
would be supported:
*  Undertaking a needs assessment to determine the precise specifications for the systems in the three
project locations, including support for drafting bidding documents;
+  Undertaking an administrative systems review and development of an administrative development
plan consistent with the personnel requirements and implications of the equipment purchased;
+  Design, development, installation and testing of a networked system to integrate the automated
accounts of the branch offices of Qingdao Municipality;
*  Design, development installation and testing of a networked system to integrate Jiamusi city in
Heilongjiang Province with the Provincial Social Insurance Agency;
+ Design, development, installation and testing of internal computer system for the pensions area of the
MOLSS;
*  Development (adaptation) of data management software in Qingdao and Heilongjiang to meet the
needs of both existing and projected system members;
+  Design and carrying out of Users' training programs on work process and equipment use; and
*  Development of a procedures manual consistent with the staff and administrative development plan
above.
Project Component 3 - Training - US$ 0.9 million. This component would support the identification
by MOLSS and of the Heilongjiang and Qingdao labour bureaus of personnel skills requirements and,
thereafter, development and implementation of training programs to improve the skills of its personnel,
including in: (i) pension management and oversight; (ii) pension reform policy; (iii) financial projections
and modeling; and (iv) pension asset management. Training will only be permitted when part of staff
development plans at the Heilongjiang and Qingdao Labour Bureaus and MOLSS, respectively.
Project Component 4 - Project Administration - US$ 0.5 million. This component would provide
assistance in project administration at the level of the MOLSS PIU and the PMOs in Heilongjiang and
Qingdao, respectively. Financing would include support for: (i) personnel costs associated with the PIU
and PMOs; (ii) costs associated with counterpart meetings; (iii) printing, communications, postage and
translation costs; (iv) internal travel costs for coordination between PIU and PMOs; (v) office operating
costs (electricity, miscellaneous office supplies); and (vi) costs of special hired assistants.

Annex 4
Pension Reform Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
I. Procurement
1.    All goods and services under the IDA credit would be procured in accordance with IDA
guidelines for goods and services - Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA Credits, January
1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999 (procurement
guidelines) and Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by
World Bank as Executing Agency, September 1997, revised in January 1999. The China Model Bidding
Documents for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procedures will be used. All consultant assignments will follow the Standard Request for Proposals-
Selection of Consultants, dated July 1997 and revised in April, 1998.
2.    The management of the procurement of goods and equipment and consultant services under the
Project would be the responsibility of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), who will be supported by
administrative, procurement and other required staff on an on-going or as-needed basis.
3.    Procurement Capacity of the Project Implementation Unit (PIIJ) and Project Management
Offices (PMOs). A review of the procurement capacity of the PIU was completed during pre-appraisal.
In an effort to ensure procurement quality both at the level of the PIU and the PMOs, the following
measures would be taken: (i) a training program for PIU and PMO staff will be completed prior to
December 31, 1999; (ii) technical support will be contracted as needed, including a procurement specialist
to advise the PIU on procurement procedures; and (iii) tendering companies will provide assistance for all
ICB and NCB contracting. Although much of project implementation will take place at the level of the
labour bureaus in Heilongjiang province and Qingdao, respectively, the PIU would be responsible for
quality control for all procurement processing. The PIU would also provide procurement support to each
of the implementing agencies. The PIU would be expected to: (i) prepare and update the procurement
plan pertaining to itself and the implementing agencies under the Project; (ii) monitor the progress of
procurement; and (iii) assist the implementing agencies in (a) the preparation of bidding documents and
advertisements for goods procurement and requests for proposals for consultant assignments, and (b) bid
opening and evaluation.
4.    Procurement Plan. A draft General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be prepared for the Project
and would be finalized and published in Development Business after Board approval. The GPN would be
updated every six months and submitted to IDA. It would show all outstanding ICB for goods contracts;
and international consultant assignments. A procurement plan has been prepared by the Borrower and
includes relevant information on goods and services contracts under the Project as well as the timing of
each milestone in the procurement process. The procurement plan and implementation schedule would be
updated every six months and submitted to IDA.
5.    Training. Training within the country and abroad, including twinning arrangements will be
carried out on the basis of IDA approved programs which would identify the nature of training, the
specific objectives of the training programs undertaken, personnel to be trained, the duration of training,
institutions where training would be conducted and detailed cost estimates for the training. Such
programs would be submitted to IDA for review and clearance annually and, as needed, updated and
cleared every six months.

* Figures in parenthesis are the amounts to be financed by the IDA credit.
 N.B.F.= Not Bank financed. All financing in this column would be from Government (central and pilots) funds. Financing
would include: (i) costs associated with procurement which cannot be financed under the project; (ii) marginal operating costs
for infonnation systems; (iii) very select goods associated with site preparation; and (iv) operating costs for project
implementation units; and (v) select development costs for training programs.
* IDA financing will only fund goods and consultants' services which will both be procured under Bank guidelines.
* "Goods" include purchase of equipment and related supplies.
6.     Goods and Equipment. To the extent possible and practicable, the procurement of goods would
be combined into packages estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 equivalent or more and would
be procured under ICB procedures. Based on the review conducted during project pre-appraisal, it is
expected that most computer goods, including installation, software development, testing and training
supported under the project will be grouped into three single contracts for MOLSS, Heilongjiang and
Qingdao, respectively. A preference of 15% of the CIF price, or the actual customs duty, whichever is
lower, will be applied to domestically manufactured goods procured through ICB. Contracts costing
between US$75,000 and US$200,000 each up to an aggregate amount of US$450,000 would be procured
through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) using procedures acceptable to IDA. All ICB and NCB
contracts will use China Model Bidding documents prepared by MOF and approved by IDA and all such
contracts will be tendered with the support of a tendering company.
7.     Procurement for readily available off-the-shelf goods that cannot be grouped or standard
specifications commodities for individual contracts less than US$75,000 not exceeding an aggregate
amount of US$250,000 for the life of the Project, would be procured on the basis of comparison of
quotations from at least three eligible national suppliers. If these goods are not available in the country,
international shopping procedures would be followed.
8.     Consultant Services. As a rule, consultant services would be procured through Quality and Cost
Based Selection (QCBS) methodology. All consultancy assignments estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$200,000 or more would be advertised in a national newspaper and in Development Business. In
addition, the contracts may be advertised in an international newspaper or a technical magazine seeking
"expressions of interest". In the case of assignments estimated at US$100,000 or less, the assignment
may be advertised nationally.  Consulting services estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
US$50,000 may be contracted by comparing the qualifications of consultants who have expressed an

interest in the job or who have been identified if the assignments conform to the requirements of the
Guidelines.
9.     The Bank's Standard Requestfor Proposals dated July 1997, revised April 1998 will be used for
hiring consultants. Consultant services for conferences and seminars or for small studies, which are less
than US$50,000 each, or a total amount of US$200,000, and which may be provided by individual
consultants, will be contracted by comparing the qualifications of the candidates who expressed an
interest in the job or who have been identified. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term jobs, that
is, jobs not exceeding six months performed by individual consultants.

10.    Review by IDA. All goods contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or more would be subject to
IDA prior review of bidding documents including draft contracts and technical specifications prior to
inviting bids and IDA review of bid evaluation prior to contract award. The first NCB and National
Shopping contract, regardless of cost will be subject to prior review.
11.    The terms of reference for all consultant assignments irrespective of value would be subject to
IDA prior review. With respect to each contract for the employment of the consulting firms estimated to
cost the equivalent of US$ 100,000 or more, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 1, 2 (other than the
third subparagraph of paragraph 2(a)) and 5 of Appendix I to the Consultants Guidelines shall apply.
With respect to each contract for employment of individual consultants estimated to cost US$50,000
equivalent or more, the qualifications and experience, Terms of Reference and Terms of Employment will
be subject to prior review by IDA.

12.    Contracts which are not subject to prior review would be selectively reviewed by the Bank during
project implementation and would be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph 4 of Appendix I
to the Guidelines. Ex-post reviews would be conducted through sampling of one in five goods (local and
international shopping) contracts as well as one in five consulting service contracts (contracts not subject
to prior review).
II. Disbursement
13.    Use of Statements of Expenses. Disbursements for all expenditures would be against full
documentation except for contracts below the equivalent of US$100,000 equivalent each for goods, US$
100,000 for consulting firms and US$50,000 for consultant services (individuals), and training, for which
disbursements would be based on Statements of Expenditures. Supporting documentation for Statements
of Expenditure would be retained by the borrower for review by IDA missions and external auditors. All
expenditures above the threshold indicated above will be eligible for direct payment.
14.    Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursements, three special accounts would be established and
operated at a commercial Bank under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. These special accounts
would correspond to the respective parts of the project pertaining to MOLSS, Heilongjiang and Qingdao,
respectively. Upon credit effectiveness, a sum aggregating to approximately US$500,000 to cover about
four months' expenditures would be deposited by IDA into these accounts. The authorized allocation for
each account would be as follows: (i) the Borrower's special account (MOLSS) - US$100,000; (ii)
Heilongjiang's special account - US$220,000; and (iii) Qingdao's special account - US$180,000. Further
deposits by IDA would be made into the accounts against withdrawal applications supported by
appropriate documents. The Borrower should replenish the special accounts on a monthly basis or when
any account has been drawn down by about 50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever occurs first.
Disbursement categories and the percentage financed are shown in Table IV-C below.
