EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction and background
This report represents the summary on environment impact assessment of forest road
construction, within Forestry project in BiH financed by World Bank. Funds for road construction
should be taken from remaining funds under IDA.
Roads and locations, for which projects are elaborated, are as follows:
1. "Brankusa - section 115" in SFE "Ostrelj - Drinic" - Drinic
2. "Maksimovica potok" in SFE "telinac" - Celinac
3. "Mala Inova" in SFE "Borja" - Teslic
4. "Livade - Bad" in SFE "Maglic" - Srbinje
5. "Sipasno - Zlatac - Lokve" in SFE "Botin" - Nevesinje
EIA studies are elaborated for all roads. These studies are about justification of road
construction from aspect of positive, but also negative applications on the environment.
Studies and executive summary have been elaborated by:
1. Mr Zoran Govedar and
2. Dipi. Ing. Ljubo Maric
The Government of Republic of Srpska, by construction of new forest roads in mentioned
SFEs, intends to influence on increasing of road infrastructure and openness of the forests. In
that way the costs will be reduced and working efficiency increased in the most expensive phase
of forest exploitation, which is skidding of wood assortments (transportation phase). Besides that
road construction would increase other operational capacities in SFEs regarding protection,
regeneration and nursering of forests, as well as other common useful forest functions (tourism,
recreation, hunting, collection of secondary forest products and others). In selection of SFEs and
locations for road construction it was considered that SFEs, after construction, have significant
benefits for local residents and workers in SFE, and inspite of that to have minor negative impacts
on the environment.
Beneficial effects of the road construction on the environment, which can reflect directly or
indirectly, are the following:
- Road construction will provide access - approach to forest complexes because of
exploitation of forests, rehabilitation or regeneration and raising of new forests, collection
of special forest products, hunting, preservation and protection of forests and game,
- Easier and more economically justified work in forest management is enabled, during
carrying out of silvicultural works, and works on protection and arrangement of forests,
- Inluence on increasement and preservation of vegetation and animal diversities,
- Preventive influence in cases of so called unexpected enjoyement (damages that can
occur because of negative impacts of different biotic and abiotic factors),
- Facilitation of works in prevention of forest fires,
- Larger possibilities are opened for easier, more efficient and various work of workers in
SFEs and local residents,
- Positive impacts of roads on values of passive utilization and non-commercial values,
and others.



Possible negative effects, which are not equally emphasized in all SFEs, are the follewing:
-  Increasing possibility for illegal fellings, illegal hunting and setting fires,
-  On parts, which are gravitating on brooks, on inclined terrain and places where the route
intersects water currents and similar, there is a possibility for rockfalls and appearance of
erosion processes,
-  In settlements, through which the roads are passing, local residents can have negative
impacts because of carelessness in causing fires,
-  Roads have impact on habitat fragmentation,
-  Decreasement and loss of productive forest soil on the route and tree felling on the route
are inevitable,
-  Increased danger of so called biological invasion, especially in the area of "marginal
habitats".
However, all these potential negative impacts on the environment will not have great effect
because the areas are poorly inhabited. These impacts will be reduced to a minimum with placing
of warning signs and if contractors follows the guidelines of the project and EIA Studies.
Scope of EIA Studies
On the basis of environment impact assessment on terrain and with detailed analysis it
can be concluded the environment benefits, after road construction, are multilateral (many-sided).
Damages that reflect on soil, appearance of erosion and tree felling, during road construction, are
minimal in relation to benefits provided by roads. EIA Studies are identifying mitigation and
monitoring measures for potential impacts related to construction, maintenance and utilization of
proposed roads. They also include details about carried out consultations with stakeholders, more
exactly data about agreement of stakeholders regarding environment impact assessment.
Besides that EIA Studies include remedies of EMP mitigation, which are related to:
-  Road construction
-  Utilization of roads
-  Maintenance of roads
-  Inspection
-  Monitoring, preservation and protection of the environment
Approach and methodology in elaboration of EIA Studies
Terms of reference for EIA Studies describe environment impacts of road construction in
SFEs, on five different locations. These impacts are analyzed from several different aspects:
a) Ecological feature of the area (broader-FEA and smaller-management units) as well as
locations for construction of planned roads.
b) Impact of road on:
-  Usage of biotope
-  Habitat fragmentation
-  Terrain geomorphology
-  Habitat productivity
-  Biological invasions
-  Fito-pathological and entomological diseases
-  Biodiversity



c) Direct socio-economic impacts
-  Felling plan
-  Collection of secondary forest products
d) Indirect socio-economic impacts
-  Occurrences of forest fires
-  Values of passive utilization and non-commercial values
e) Other impacts (less or insignificantly expressed impacts)
-  Background of forest network development
-  Impact on landscape
-  Impact on aquatic habitat
-  Impact on water and air quality
-  Impact on pasture and others.
Key tasks undertaken for elaboration of Studies can be summarized as follows:
-  EIA Studies are to recognize specificness of forest road construction impacts on the
environment, so that construction is not only economically assessed,
-  Planning and construction of roads not only to be formally - legally ecologically justified,
but to point, with EIA Studies, to possible application of Studies as means for overcoming
the conflict between forest ecosystems and development obligations
-  Studies should provide clear connection between administrative development process in
area, as well as identification of environment impact assessment
-  Define more precisely different socio-economic impacts with studies
-  Recognize possibilities for overcoming and decreasing negative impacts of road
construction, with help of the Studies
In order to achieve goals of the Studies following activities have been carried out:
-  Analysis of submitted projects with special emphasis on environment impacts of the road
-  Collection of necessary literature
-  Consultations with experts from different fields (forestry, planners in forestry and civil
engineering, ecology and tourism, zoology, fitocenology, botanic, geology, pedology,
hunting, and others)
-  Visits to routes with engineers from SFEs, and finding of ground center line and chainage
-  Data collecting in field about orographic factors, fitocenosis, geological base and soil,
game, water currents, property, critical parts of the road and others
-  Consultations with local residents, which are gravitating on the road, and after that
consultations with potential contractors and SFE directors, and technical planning staff
from SFEs
-  Analysis and comparison of collected field data with project data, performance projects
for management of forests and forest management plans
-  Consultations with supervision officials, inspection services and forest rangers, about
unwanted effects of road construction
-  Analysis of law regulations
-  Processing of collected data and writing of EIA Studies
Summary of conclusions and recommendations
Main conclusions and recommendations in the Studies are very similar. Drawing of
conclusions and recommendations was based on comprehensive analysis.
Main conclusion is that construction of all roads is economically justified. Positive effects
achieved from different aspects (efficiency in forest exploitation, protection of forests,
biodiversities, dividing of habitats, protection of game and others) are far more significant,



observed on long-term basis, than negative effects caused by road construction and utilization
(illegal utilization of forest reserves by felling, game hunting, fires and others).
The most significant benefit of the road construction is providing of access to inaccessible
terrains, which were neglected and were not properly assessed, and their natural potential was
unused. In positive sense (if used properly), roads have special significance for local residents
and SFE workers, because they will facilitate their work in field.
Recommendations, regarding road construction, include decreasement to a minimum of
unnecessary use of machinery and explosives in road construction. Also depositing of harmful
materials, oil, fuel should be reduced to a minimum. It is necessary to avoid unnecessary felling,
and especially take care about possibility of fire occurrence.
During maintenance of constructed roads it is necessary to carry out inspection and
covering, especially on terrain susceptible to pluvial erosion. Also, on places with built in objects
(culverts) it is necessary to clean them and remove branches, stones, sand and other waste
material in order to enable flow of water.
During utilization of roads works related to proper placing of signs next to the road have
special significance. Those signs should warn people, which are moving next to the road, about
potential danger of fires, garbage disposal, migration and game hunting, tourism and recreation
possibilities of using forest ecosystems and other.
Participation of public and private sector
Consultations with SFEs have been carried out:
1. SFE "Ostrelj - Drinic" - Drini6
2.  SFE "Celinac" - Celinac
3.  SFE "Borja" - Teslic
4.  SFE "Maglic" - Srbinje
5. SFE "Botin" - Nevesinje
Beside that following institutions were also consulted: General Directorate of PFE ,,Srpske Sume",
Forestry faculty from Banjaluka, as well as Road Directorate from Banja Luka, and others.
Because of lack of time broader discussion was not carried out and it is planned for the following
period. Mainly NGOs will be included.

C. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
1. Procurement (purchasing) of equipment
During road construction works, as well as during maintenance no special (additional) equipment will be
purchased, so the monitoring contractor will not carry out such activities. Construction contract signatory, must
provide evidence about possession, proper functioning of necessary equipment for works. Maintenance contract
signatory also has to have evidences about necessary maintenance equipment.
Beside that both Contractors must submit evidences about previous experience in such and similar
works.
2. Trainings and study tours
Study tours, trainings and special studies are not foreseen.
Technical staff from Ministry of agriculture, forestry and water management, Ministry of urbanism, spatial
arrangement and ecology, as well as staff from PFE "Srpske Sume" RS will be engaged for consulting services.
This staff will consulted prior and during road construction and maintenance.
D. SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES
Schedule of construction and monitoring activities is hard to determine. Detailed monitoring plan and
schedule of construction activities mainly depend on tender requirements (terms), and after it is carried out
schedule of construction and monitoring activities can be determined more precisely. Precise beginning and
date for starting and completion of construction and monitoring works are not precise even in projects.
Generally, it can be concluded that these dates depend on many factors, and with great certainty it can be
emphasized that these activities, considering weather conditions, can be barely finished until the end of this
year.



E INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Within institutional arrangements connection and cooperation of all involved institutions during project
realization is needed. Mutual responsibilities during realization must be stated precisely. Unit for Environment
Protection should have special role in this. Beside local experts it should include technical staff from Ministry of
agriculture, forestry and water management of RS, Ministry of civil engineering, spatial arrangement and
ecology of RS and representatives of PFE "Srpske Sume" RS. Their task, during construction, is to follow the
changes on the environment and to submit reports to General Directorate of PFE "Srpske Sume", more exactly
to authorized Ministries in RS Government.
Inspection service for protection of the environment should submit data about conditions of the environment
during construction, utilization and maintenance of roads to authorized Ministries and PFE "Srpske Sume".
Supervision contractor has to submit periodic (if possible on daily basis) reports about degree of closing
down of construction works. These reports should be submitted to SFEs, in which roads are constructed, more
exactly to Unit responsible for environment protection during construction and maintenance of roads.
Responsible institutions for management of constructed roads are SFEs, in which the roads are
constructed, more exactly PFE "Srpske Sume", because constructed roads represent their main means for
work. These SFEs, beside Supervision contractor and Inspection for environment conditions, are carrying out
construction and maintenance control.
Within PFE "Srpske gume" it is necessary to form interactive unit composed of technical staff from field
Ministries of Forestry and Ecology, local experts and PFE "Srpske Sume" RS, which would be collecting
periodic reports elaborated by construction contractor, Institution for maintenance, supervision contractor and
environment Inspection. After that it would submit those reports to Ministry of agriculture, forestry and water
management and Ministry for urbanism, spatial arrangement and ecology in RS Government.
Above mentioned obligations and activities, within institutional arrangement, should be performed according
to the following model (scheme):

INTRODUCTION
Construction of forest roads is certainly among very important forest activities in SFE. Accesibilty to forests
and forestland in SFE, as well as succesfulness of correct management of such forests is in direct dependence
with openness of forests with forest roads.
Most of the forest roads are adapted for transportation of wood assortments with trucks and tractors. These
roads are adapted for transportation to road network of public traffic. It is a fact that most of these roads,
especially forest truck roads, were constructed with basic goal which is economicaly justified forest
management, because it is well known that the phase of transportation of wood asortments is one of the most
expensive phases in production process. However, ecological aspects and justification of road construction, until
now, have not been taken into consideration, and considering that these are big and significant infrastrucural
objects in forest complexes which have influence on number of effects, more attention should be payed to
environment impact of forest road construction in the future. Therefore, in number of cases until now, regarding
impact on environment, construction of forest roads were not optimal.
From that comes the main activity, and that is to enlarge the analysis and recognition of specific environment
impacts of forest road construction, and significance of the construction should not be only economically
assessed. Procedures of planning and construction, among other things, should not be only formally -
ecologically and lawfully justified, but they should really be the instrument of profession and science for
overcoming the conflict between the characteristics of forest eco-systems and development obligations.
Because of that, the goal of this Study is to establish and assess the significant positive and negative effects
of forest road construction on environment in the area of SFE Celinac, in economic unit <(Starcevica - Bjeljevine".
Therefore, the goal is to elaborate the EIA (environment impact assessment) study for cited object that
represents the generic concept, with which we indicate the administrative process in realisation of development
project on site, and series of analysis procedures for identification and assessrnent of environment impacts.
However, in Republic of Srpska and in the areas of SFE's, significant basis for this problem should be
provided by the Environment protection law, which is currently in elaboration phase and is not adopted.
EIA study represents the system of procedures in two levels(stages), with which we, in accordance with multi
discipline of public and completnes, analyze alternatives for least damages on the environment and
preservation of greatest values of it.
First level (stage) represents the strategic level which means socio-economic impacts and consequences of
the project on site, and as a rule they separate on regional and national level and are determined and expressed
with methods based on quantitative indexes.
Second level means planning level. EIA study means that on the planning level, according to character of
the investor, it should be separated if it is physical or law person with purpose of permission for work.
Previous examinations and main examinations were worked out in the study, which is in fact basically given
in Terms of Reference.



1.0.   BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AREA GRAVITATING ON PLANNED ROAD
1.1. Climate conditions
Climate conditions of FEA, when we observe them as macro-climate, can be classified in pre-mountain
climate type up to 700m above sea level, and mountain type above 700m up to 1200m.
Climate factors have great significance for development of vegetation and animal world. Forest is the
factor of stability of climate elements. This influence especially reflects on micro-climate of certain habitat or
area, through decreased extreme values of climate elements, exchange of warmth and moisture in atmosphere.
According to scientific knowledge, forest areas have smaller temperature swayings , and with that decreased
possibility of frost occurence and more favourable climate in total.
Forest reduces wind speed, by which it influences micro-climate conditions in the area. Raising of forests
and windshield areas provides protection of agricultural land, settlements and roads. By construction of the
forest road with clear cuts, large quantities of trees are removed, if width of the road is 6m and lenght 1000m,
clear cuts include areas of 6000 m2 or 200-300 m3 of timber mass. If during constructon of finished road levels
endangerment of forests with winds is not considered, severe damages can appear.
1.2. Geological and pedological characteristics
Geoliogical Institutes and organizations have done many scientific editions and geological maps for area
of Celinac in proportions 1:200 000 and 1:50 000, and hydrological maps in proportion 1:200 000. Mentioned
maps are valuable documents because areas of forest complexes scientifically studied according to geological-
hydrological composition, gravitating to municipalitiy Celinac are drawn in.
Latest scientific research in FEA Celinacko were carried out in 1979 by Forestry faculty ans Forestry
Institute from Sarajevo. According to scientific methodology, pedological-typological maping of FEA has been
done and the area has been classified in the area of inner Dinaric mountains, more exactly >)Zone of Paleozoic
shales and Mesozoic limestones(, )>Central ofiolit zone(< ans ))internal Dinaric zone<(. In the following table
geological chronology in the management units is shown.
Management unit        Sections     Home substratum               Type of soil

Table 1
Flysch stratum are including large complexes around area Celinac , on these home substratums, soils
with high productive possibilities were created, in most cases next to planned route of forest truck road luvisol,
distric kambisol and partialy pseudoglejev are exchanging mozaically.
Distric kambisol which are formed on sandy soil, marl and sandy limestones in the route zone, are suitable for
road construction that is undisturbing and safe for the environment.

On the places where home substratum is dilapidated, mining during construction is not required. Route planning
can be done with usage of feeder. However, on places with more limestone where massive rocks break
out on the surface, mining will be done and it can have negative consequences o the environment (trees, low
flora, game, etc).
Forest areas included in geological surface with flysch on steep slopes and crests are susceptible to high degree
of erosion and denudation processes, which represents great danger during road construction because of far-
reaching negative processes on forest surfaces.
Dilapidated material, during usage of heavy machinery, is making ditches on moist soil, which is especially
expressed on deep soil with unstable geological base like sandstones, marl and phyllite, which is creating
conditions for hydro erosion.
Harmful consequences, during construction of forest roads, are especially expressed on geological base whose
crossfall is large, so the route is constructed in cuts. It especilly negativelly reflects on vegetation, since the route
is 6,0 m wide and it intersects soil and water currents, with consequence of drying the plant cover in the zone of
the route. Crests and valleys are requiring from the contractor maximum caution during construction, in order to
avoid unwanted slides and rockslidesof unstable geological base.
Occurence of slides during and after construction of forest roads are frequent on deep luvisol and kalkokambisol.
Inpermeable layers of clay and loam on wet terrain because of intersection and digging out of the surface soil
during construction of the road, became unstable even on terrain with slope over 40%, which is often on the
entire route. These terrains are exposed to potential slides of larger soil complexes. Unstable parts of soil, above
the route, together with vegetation and especially trees, are falling and doing severe damege to forest road, and
in most cases in lower parts of constructed road.
Part of the road that passes through surface whose home substratum mostly represents glacial deposits,
phyllite and other sediment and ultra alkaline rocks, are oftenly potential danger on truck roads. In rainy period
small and large stone fractions are falling in large quantities on the road and disable the passability of the road
surface and endanger the participants in the traffic.
In ordere of preventive protection it is necessary, on critical places, to place protective wire net, which is
foreseen in the project.
1.3.   Orographic factors and passability of terrain
Planned road is intersected with crests and mild hollows, which are located vertically on the road axis.
With goal of technological categorization and standardization of forest areas opened with constructed road, from
clear topographic map in proportion 1:10.000, presence of areas according to degree of terrain slope, coning of
terrain and passability is recorded. Arial presence of terrain, according to degree of coning and slope of terrain,
is done according to adopted scientific method and shown in numbers (table 2). They are relativelly informing us
about accessibility and passability of forest terrain and complexes, which would be openned with the road.
Mainly areas with slope of 41-50% are present, which shows us that the route will be mainly constructed
in cuts (see the project of the road).

methodology, technological categorization and standardization is determined in the following table:

Note:     I - Areas suitable for road construction
11 - Areas with acute deformity and requiring high construction costs
IlIl - Soil planed for forest ropeway.
Table 3
Numerical data in table 3 are informing us that forest stands are located on 187,86 ha or 80,6% of the
area, with terrain slopes over 51 % and with expressed occurence of acute deformities, which requires big costs
during construction of the road. But, since the course of the route is on the lower third of the slope, which
includes area of 45,14 ha or 19,4 %, costs for the road are much more favourable, which is financialy justifiable.
1.4.   Hydrological conditions and protection of water potentials
According to carried out pedological-typological maping and insight in topographic maps and scientific
literature we realized following, regarding hydrological potentil of forest complex openned with planned road.
FEA Celinacko has involved hydrological network, whose water order equal. Main water currents of
basin of river Vrbas are composed of river Vrbanja with numerous springs and brooks.
Forest complex throgh which planned road "Maksimovi6a potok" is passing, is intersected with
number of small and big brooks, among the most significant are:
1. Maksimovica potok
2. Mali6a potok
3. Borski potok
4. Sovotina potok
Mentioned brooks are gravitating towards inhabited places and supply the residents with drinking and
healthy water.
Terrain relief, which is located near the planned road, is very distinct. Terrain is intersected with
numerous and long crests, and depresions rich with water.
Rich vegetation, high forests of beech and oak with different evolution stages, bushes and low flora, are
providing protection from erosion and denudation processes.
Infiltration of soil by water is very often on terrain near inhabited places. Unreasonible felling of low scion
forests by residents and other anthropogenic factors, causes danudation and infiltration of soil with harmful
consequences. In order to prevent this harmful phenomena, priority cultivation tasks are set for foresters, which
include prompt prevention of illegal felling and raising of new plantation where necessary. Illegal felling is
violating hydrological order, by which torrent areas are created and water is temporary withdrawing from shallow
springs.
Large masses, which are moving through brooks like branches, trees and large rocks, are destroying
evrything in their way. It especially reflects through undermining and damege to forest roads.

With qualitative construction of the road and placing of foreseen objects, which are: culverts, drainage ditches
next to the route, proper construction of shoulders and their planting with grass, erosion processes will be
decreased to minimum.
Great significance of water potential in this FEA is reflected through succesful supplying of residents with
drinking water and supplying of vegetation and animal world in the area with drinking and healthy water.
1.5 Plant communities
On the territory of management unit "Starcevica Bjeljevina" specific and resistant forest vegetation is
growing, which is characteristic for ecosystem of internal Dinaric mountains. Depending on bio-ecological
requirements of trees on 150-700m above sea level, different diversible elements and vegetation stages are
exchanging.
On lower, oftenly flooded terrain, next to brooks and river Vrbanja, forests of Salix allba L. And Alnus
glutinose are growing. Although natural species of these forests were cleared in past few years, still there
areeas with natural forests.
Considering the productivity of these types of trees, researches have shown that they are acquiring
satisfactory values already in 15th year, when their volume can be 200 m3/ha.
Since these species are resistant to diseases and damage made by air and water pollution, we
should try to keep these species alive (preserve).
Warmer habitats above this area are occupied with oak (Quercus petraea M. Liebi), hornbeam
(Carpinus betulus L.), European ash (Fraxinus ornus L.) and Q. pubescens. Considering bio-ecological
characteristics of oak, in mixed stands of this spiece in higher layer, there is oak and in subtenant is beech
(Fagus moesiaca), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus). Colder habitats in hills are mainly are populated with pure
beech stands oftenly with one spiece of trees, or is included in composition of some ecologicaly similar
phytocenosis like maple (Acer preudoplatanoides) and oak ( Q. petraea L.). Special environment of hill area of
beech is creating vegetation zone with hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna lacq.), elder(Sambucus nigra L.), sallow
(Salix caprcae L.).
High vegetation zone from 700 to 1.300 m mainly include beech (Fagus silavtica), fir (Abies alba
Mill.), and maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). These are high productive stands. In this area fir has very good
productivity. Research results in mixed stands have shown that they have large volume per ha (350 to 400 m3
per ha).
Species, which are giving special landscape, are white-beam tree (Sarbus aucuparia Mill.), service tree
(Sarbus torminalis) and elder (Sambucus racemosa L.). Low vegetation includes bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus
L.), heather (Erica carnea L.) and (Vaccinium vitis idaea L.), and (Oxalis acetosella L.).
According to previous priority purpose, most of the forests in this management unit served for production
of timber mass, more exactly priority was utilization of productive forest functions. Other functions, protective
and touristic-recreative, have provided with improvement of existing economic (productive) forests.
1.6.   Productivity of forests and ways of management
According to forest inventory data base has ben formed about conditions of high natural forests, which
are gravitating on the planned road in management unit "Starcevica - Bjeljevina." Data clearly point to
unsufficient utilization of productive potential in high natural forests. Main reason is unsufficient openness of
stands with primary and secondary network of roads. Potential possibility and actual productivity of forest , which
are gravitating on the road is shown in the table:

Table 4
According to average values for certain stands and estimation of optimal values for volume and volume
increment, we see that volume and volume increment are 85% from estimated optimal value.
By openning the stands with truck roads, prompt and systematic carrying out of raising measures in all
development phases is enabled, with reduced costs.
Basic management system for forests in this FEA is based on the principle of group-selection and
selection management, whose esence is combined method of natural regeneration of forests, which has great
impact on preservation of natural gene fund of the forests in the area. Guarantee of success in natural
regeneration of forests is in the fact that with utilization of natural potential and knowledge about environment
conditions (ecological features), stand conditions with emphasis on structure, as well as knowledge about bio-
ecological features of trees , which are included in these forests, are providing satisfactory number and
qualitative structure of young crop.
Usage of mentioned management systems and success of natural regeneration is depending on
openness of forest complexes in the area of sections 10/1,10/2,11/1 and 11/2 in management unit >)Stardevica
Bjeljevinec
1.7.   Conditions of game
Within the FEA"Celinacko" -hunting area has been formed, and it is managed on the basis of hunting
plans.
The most important species of game in this hunting area are:
a)  Permanently protected species of game
-  Weasel (Mustela pp),
-  Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris),
-  Hazel hen (Tetrastes bonasia L.),
-  Falcon (Falcondae),
-  Hawks (Accipitriade),
-  Raven (Corax corax),
-  Owl (Strigidae) and others
b)  Game protected with hunting closed season
- Brown bear (Ursus arctos 1.),
- Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus),
- Hare (Lepus europaeus),



- Gray partridge (Perdix perdix),
6
- Rock dove (Columbia livia),
- Turtledove
c)  Unprotected game
-  Wild boar (Sus.scropha L.),
-  Wolf (Canis lupus),
-   Weasel (Vulpes vulpes),
-  Wildcat (Felis silvestris),
-  Polecat (Putoris putoris) and others.
This hunting area belongs into the category of economic sport hunting areas, so it fulfills the needs of
economic hunting and hunting as sport -recreative character of members of hunting organizations.
For satisfaction of hunting area functions, from viewpoint of mobility of hunters and hunting service,
existing network of forest communications is satisfactory and it is used in the periods of intensive hunting.
For construction of hunting objects (observation posts, lodging objects, places for weapon testing and
others) it is necessary to construct new infrastructural objects, forest roads and hunting trails, which should
enable greater mobility, and to facilitate the work first of all to game warden service, technical staff and hunters in
the hunting area.
Therefore, in the existing hunting plans, it is foreseen that i the following period, new hunting paths
should be built, which would increase the intensity of management and facilitate carrying out of all activities
foreseen in the plan.
The road will have of greater significance because in the area of management unit "Starcevica-
Bjeljevine", after the road is constructed, game warden service will have easier access to sections, through
which road is passing.
1.8. Openness of forests with forest roads
FEA "Celinacj" - Celinac is opened with three main categories of roads:
-  Public roads
-  Regional rods
-  Forest truck roads
Precise data about length of these roads in the SFE do not exist. However, it can be emphasized that
total openness of forests and forest land in the area is in average 8 km/1000ha, which is certainly not
satisfactory especially if you take into consideration that for this area optimal openness of forests is considered
to be 15-20 km/1 000ha. That points to the necessity for construction of new roads, especially forest truck roads
that should enable the access to unopened forest complexes due to satisfaction of all positive sides of forest
road construction, with all precautions and preventive measures with goal of prevention of negative
consequences, which follows the construction of a road.
Approaching to the optimal openness with construction of new roads, perspectives of the area
development in new conditions of the economy and development of private initiative would be greater.
Forest ecosystems of this area represent natural resources in area of :elinac. Management with these
restorable resources is based on law regulations, forest management plans, projects and hunting management
plans, and with low openness like this it is significantly difficult. Because of affirmation of all positive sides
provided with road construcion, more successful economy and especially help to local residents, it is very
important to increase openness of forests and forest land with roads.

2.0.   DESCRIPTION OF THE ROUTE
2.1.   Location of the road
Road "Maksimovi6a potok" is planned in management unit "Starcevica - Bjeljevine". Length of
the route is 1 841 m. The route is set out with apex and center-line pegs, and marked with cross-section and
apex numbers. The route passes through sections 10/1 and 10/2. Location of the road is given in the map.
2.2.   Purpose (reasons) of road construction
Road construction should facilitate the usage of numerous resources form natural and changed forest
eco-systems. Their significance is greater for local residents, who are living in economically undeveloped areas,
where life and work are based on work in SFE "Celinac" - Celinac, as the most significant economic subject of
the place.
It is well known that construction of the road can have positive (useful) and negative (harmful)
consequences. Special significance road construction has form the viewpoint of enabling the access to the forest
complex. For the workers in SFE, especially those doing felling, construction, skidding and exporting of wood
assortments in sections 10/1, 10/2, 11/1, 11/2, in management unit oStardevica - Bjeljevine>>, as well as in
surrounding sections of the same management unit, the work will be facilitated.
Besides that, the road should enable the easier arrival of other workers to the objects, and to local
residents greater and easier activities of collection of mushrooms and medicinal herbs (special forest products),
as well as easier movement of cattle from one pasture to another. Special significance road should have in
faciliation of work to protection services (foresters and game wardens), which is from great importance today.
The road should also have the preventive role for prevention of forest fires expansion. Considering that
the road route is passing through complex of high forests with high degree of preservation, with all the
specificness of autochthonous and undisturbed vegetation in certain conditions, visitors, tourists, citizens,
scientists, local residents and others will be in opportunity to get introduced with gifts of the nature in the area.
Accomplishment of more significant economic effects, especially for the SFE, will be enabled by road
construction, because the costs for the most expensive phase of transportation of wood assortments will be
reduced. Another reason for road construction is that pure beech and oak, as well as mixed stands of oak and
beech in development phase of ripe stand are dominant in the forest complex. Because of that, in this complex,
it is necessary to carry out the silviculture activities due to renovation of beech, and helping the development of
beech and oak young crop. From the other aspect, by keeping too ripe and ripe beech trees, the stands in
mezzofile habitat conditions beech trees are susceptible to diseases of central rottness and decay, which
significantly reduces market value of current high-quality beech trees. It is impossible to overcome this problem
without constructed road.
Greater economic effects are expected after construction of the road, because local residents will use
this road for providing fire-wood and collection of mushrooms, medicinal herbs and forest fruits
Construction of forest road "Maksimovica potok" has the following goals:
a) Spatial opening of stands and assuring of economic and safe collection of wood, and operations with wood
b) Facilitation of spatial and temporal organization of regeneration and raising of stands, and protection of the
stand environment
a) Facilitation of works for local residents, easy access to forest complexes in order to utilize secondary forest
products, etc.
2.3.    Usage of biota during the road construction
Freight vehicles traffic, which should be carried out on this forest road, after the construction is finished,
would not be intensive, because of the several reasons and the following are the most important:



- Intensive felling and transportation of wood assortments, according to working cycle and
8
lenght of fecundation, will be carried out after 10 years as it is regulated bz FMP
- Area, which will be openned with this road is poorly inhabited and does not connect
inhabited places
Because of that the most significant negative impacts on biota are expected exactly during road
construction. Most significant impacts and far-reaching consequences are on forest land as integral part of biota
and especially in the part next to the road. Within preparatory works, significant negative impacts, which are
unavoidable, are related to felling of trees (mainly beech and oak), shrubs (Dafne mezereum, Sambucus nigra,
Cerasus avium, hlex aquifolium, Corilus avelana and others) and low flora. Besides that, extraction of roots of
mature trees is carried and habitat of pedo-fauna, which is very active here, is endangered. Holes which remain
after extraction of roots will be filled and compacted with soil material because of stability of roadbed, which
negatively reflects on water and air order and endangers the habitat of pedo-fauna.
Considering that thare is no dense young crop on the route, damage to current young crop are not
intensive. Surely that by road construction large quantity of this area is lost for occurence not only of young crop
but also other vegetation on the road. However, by opening the stand structure above the route, favourable
conditions appear for occurence, growth and development of heliofits next to the road (usually Rubus, Sorbus,
Populus tremula occur, as well as helifits of low flora), by which biodiversity of plant species is increasing next to
the road.
Yet, most intensive and severe consequences are done to soil, which is permanently lost. Major part
remaines disposed in embankments, which is important but from productive viewpoint it is lost.
2.4.  Geomorphologic impacts of road construction, sedimentation and
rockslides
Location and course of the planned route brings to a conclusion that expressive geomorphologic
impacts, in sense of negative consequences, will be displayed in two ways and on two different parts of the
route:
1. On the part of the route that passes through forest complex, slope is bigger and more intensive earth
works are expected, which would have negative impacts on habitat and negative geomorphologic
processes will be more expressive here.
2. On the part of the route that passes through base of the section which will be openned, negative
impacts will be raduced to minimum. Reason for that is slope of terrain and route, and because of
that intensive earth works will not be carried out, which is very important for construction of these
roads with special emphasis on protection of the habitat.
It is known that roads have impacts on geomorphologic processes through 5 primary mechanisms:
a) Direct impacts on structure and geometry of soil cuts, embankments, ditches and similar.
b) Changes in usual surface water currents and creation of new courses to water currents
c) Direct influence on structure and geometry of water currents
d) Speed up of erosion from the road surface
e) Causing the impact on water, especially on places where the road crosses the brooks
If possibilities of negative impacts of the road through mentioned mechanisms are reviewed, than it should
be emphasized that on the route there is no terrain where occurence of slides is possible. Possible more
intensive erosions can be expected during road construction under influence of pluvial erosion. Mass of moved
soil can be minor, because those are brown soils, which are averagely susceptible to pluvial erosion. Most of
moved material would be undissolved dead forest cover in the zone of small ditches created by water. Cover is
here present in thick layers, and is not completely humidified because of the stand structure. Accordingly
possibilities of negative impacts can appear next to culverts, sediments and wood during torrents, which would
not be expressed here. Impact of the road on this terrain, regarding movements of large soil mass, are almost
impossible.



9
Clear cuts are not foreseen in this area, and depots will be constructed on flat terrain, so these dangers of
pluvial erosion are reduced to minimum.
It can be concluded that road construction would not cause appearance of larger geomorphologic
disturbances and erosion processes on the road or in the surroundings, because of relatively small earthworks,
small cuts and embankments and favourable course of the route wtih small fall of finished road levels. In favour
to this there is a fact there brown limestone is dominant, which are averagelly susceptible to pluvial erosion, and
more intensive pluvial erosion could be expected on parts where kalkokambisol is dominant. In depressions and
flat terrain there are soils least susceptible to this type of erosion processes.
In order to reduce unwanted consequences of pluvial erosin processes, which are possible for this area in
periods of heavy rainfalls, qualitative compaction of subgrade should be done during construction, and later
continually maintain the road with special attention to most endangered parts of the road.
However, considering that there are no water currents near the road, and revitalization and renovation of low
heliofit vegetation next to the road is very intensive, danger of thios character will be minor.
2.5.    Hydrological impacts of road construction
Mutual complex impact of forest roads on hydrological order and reverse represents several key things,
regarding impact of forest roads on the environment. Essential problem in planning and designing, and selection
of alternative solutions and decision about appropriate variant of the road, represents defining of relation
between certain segments of the road on one side, and temporary and permanent reasons for failure on the
other. That can reflect on the hydrology of certain slope. Often main reasons of failure during construction are
caused with poor drainage of the road, especially in torrent period. Consequences, from ecological and
economic viewpoint, can be disastrous.
In concrete case, danger of occurence of torrents are reduced to minimum, for several reasons:
a) Specificness of geologica base
b) Presence of limestone soil
c) Non-existing waterproof layers in soil
d) Sufficient number of pipe culverts and ditches for drainage foreseen
e) Small slopes of terrain next to the road and near it
For preventive performance and prevention of unwanted consequences of possible smaller torrents, it is
necessary to pay attention to cleaning of waste materials in collecting pit, culverts and drainage ditches, during
maintenance of road. This problem is well planned within project documents, and 5 pipe culverts with diameter
1000 mm are foreseen, for transverse drainage, which is sufficient for prevention of damage on places with
severe torrents.
2.6.   Impact of the road on productivity of the habitats
Road construcion directly changes features of soil resources, because roads, by passing through forest
complex, are occupying productive soil and have impact on reducing of total productive potential of certain
habitat.
Considering that there is no dense young crop next to the road, damage to present young crop is not
significant. With road construction this area is lost for occurence of young crop and other vegetation on the road.
However, by opening of stand structure above the road, apropriate conditions appear for occurence, growth and
development of heliofits next to the road (usually species from family Rubus, Sorbus, Populus tremula appears,
as well as heliofit low flora), by which biodiversity of vegetation next to the road is increased.
Yet, largest and most severe consequences are done to soil, which is permanently lost. By road
construction 2 520 m3 of humus will be removed. Major part remaines disposed in the embankments and that is
important benefit, but from productive viewpoint it is lost.



However, road construction should not be observed from viewpoint of productivity lost, but also on long
term basis through indirect impacts, significance of the road can be positive. Namely, with construction, easier
and economicaly justified carrying out of growing activities, activities of collection of special forest products,
10
game warden activities and other will be enabled in stands, and improvement of qualitve and quantitative
structure of forests will be directly influenced. In that way, more intensively, productive potential of habitat will be
used, from viewpoint of production of higher quantity of timber mass, as well as providing the continuity of
management and satisfaction of cammon useful forest functions. Of course long term and indirect analyzing of
these impacts should be kept in mind.
2.7.  Impact of road construction on fragmentation of the habitats
It is unavoidably that with construction of the road habitat of naturel populations is divided in two or more
parts. In the area of road construction these impacts can be viewed from two aspects:
-  Classification of habitat for plant species related to biodiversity
-  Classification of habitat for animal species
Existing habitat, in sections through wich the route is planned, is characterized with all features of
preserved habitat of domestic vegetation, of plant community of potential vegetation Querco - Fagetum illyricum,
Querco carpinetum illyricum and fagetum submontanum.
When the road is constructed three habitats will be formed, from which two would have same
conditions. Special micro - habitat, wtih all new micro ecological features, will be formed on the road, as the
marginal habitat.
The most significant feature of that micro - habitat is increasing of thermophility and illumination, which
will directly reflect on occurence of heliofit species of trees, bushes and low flora next to the route. Conclusion on
that can be drawn on the basis of terrain observation on certain places with damages made by wind and snow,
and different breakings. Species that would probably appear are: Acer pseudoplatanus, Acer platanoides,
Sorbus sp., Fraxinus excelsior, Fragaria vesca, Asarum europaeum, Rubus sp, Galium silvaticum, different fern
and crop of autochthonous tree species and others. That shows the increasement of plant biodiversities next to
the route, which significantly differs from biodiversities in other two macro habitats on one side, and on the other
road on longer distance from the route where existing flora will remain dominant (Fagus silvatica, Quercus
pewtraea, Carpinus betulus, Acer pseudoplatanus, Fraxinus exelsior and other).
Specificness of the occurence of somewhat changed habitat conditions after road construction should be
expected in stands, after carrying out of silvicultural and utilization works in habitats far from the road.
Those changes will be caused by felling, which will be carried out in sections, after opening of this forest
complex. Main goal of these actions, besides utilization of timber volume, is to improve natural regeneration of
domestic vegetation.
Negative consequences and creation of unwanted micro-habitats after road construction can be
expected in forest complex, on places of irrational and irregular felling, and excessive felling on quality and
volume in stands.
Consequences of these phenomena are growing of weed in habitat and loss, in productive sense,
because of weed growing mainly of species Rubus and Vaccinium. That can be prevented with adequate
supervision during realization of performance projects and organizing of forest ranger service.
Dividing of habitat for animals will reflect especially on game. Namely, road construction will reflect
positively and negatively. Positive because with the creation of marginal habitat birds and animals, which
usualy inhabit the forest edge, are getting new coridor by which they can move deeper in the forest. That will
increase the diversities of animal species in forest and area of habitat for these species of birds and animals.
Negative impacts would affect some species o mammals, for which is known to avoid moving on the
roads. Their only habitat, by road construction (especially by usage of existing roads which are connected to
planned one), will be divided with long route, which represents significant obstacle for mammals' movement.
Problems can be solved by arranging the accessory objects equally in both conditional macro-habitats.



Road impact will also have influence on terrestrial Vertabrata in the following ways:
Type of impact                Assessment of impact intensity
a) Loss of habitat and fragmentation    Medium impacts
b) Negative impacts of road utilization,  Strong impact during construction and
noise and running over on the road    utilization of forests (felling, export and
transportation), which is relatively short
if you know that exploitation in these
sections can be finished in 1 month/sect.
c) Excessive hunting and traping        Small impacts
Solving of these problems is possible with organization of appropriate supervision during construction by
engaging only necessary machines, more intensive engagement of labour, organization and greater mobility of
geme warden service, and placing of warnings and appropriate signs next to the road, as well as avoiding of
excessive mining on the borrows and on the route.
2.7.1. Impact of the road on biological invasions
Most oftenly, idea of biological invasion is observed through biological disturbance. By road construction,
impact of antrophogenic factor during utilization and maintenance, disturbances appear that are creating
marginal habitat. These marginal habitats are under more intensive human impacts (moving with vehicles,
throwing garbage), and can cause appearance of outer vegetation species on habitat not typical for them.
Beside human impacts different agents (water, wind, etc) can also have similar impacts, in sense of expansion
and mixing of new plant species. That is why the road is oftenly considered as new coridor for expansion of outer
species (Greenberg, Othors, 1977).
By construction of the road ((Maksimovica potok>> these impacts on biological invasion will not be intensive.
The resaon is, because movement of vehicles and people will not be intensive like on public roads. On unwanted
effects of these impacts can be pointed during and after construction with adequate warnnings next to the road.
Good example of biological invasion of outer species is expansion of Robinia pseudoacacia, which represents
weed on cultivable agricultural soil in lower route, on flat terrain that gravitates to inhabited part of the area.
It is also necessary, in performance projects, to point to danger of biological invasion of unwanted
species because they can represent serious problem during realization of arrangement of forest, since they
disrupt the structure, composition and function of forest ecosystem.
2.8.   Impact of the road on diseases of trees
Existance and construction of roads, roughly observed, have no major impact on forest diseases.
However, the fact is that areas opened by forest roads have larger possibility of prevention of herbal diseases
appearance.
Significance of the planned road is greater if you look in context of silvicultural work. With correct
carrying out of these works, occurrence of tree diseases is decreased. Carrying out of silvicultural works, quality
and scope depend on openness of forest complex.



Way of natural regeneration and raising of forests represent essence of management system for forest,
through which the road is planned. Considering that this complex of beech forests is in different development
phases, following diseases are present: Nectria cinnabarina, Melanopus squamosus, Orchestes fagi, Miciola
12
fagi, Fomes sp. and other. Entomological diseases are mostly occurring as a consequence of disturbed habitat
conditions and violations in forest ecosystems. It appears mostly as a consequence of violated ecological
conditions of the habitat and disturbances in forest ecosystems. Appearance of barkbeetle is expressive (Ips.sp),
not on this location, but in other areas of RS, where openness firstly had negative impacts (because of
accessibility and irrational felling), and later positive (because of easier manipulation with means and mobility of
workers)) effects for appearance of severe damages.
These dangers (entomological diseases), for complex, which is opened with this road, are not big, even
minor.
However, more severe danger are phytopatological ones and they occur on beech trees that are weak.
By road construction and removal of ill trees from the stand and carrying out of sanitary felling, these dangers
will be neutralized.
Road construction will enable carrying out of appropriate cultivation raising measures in middleaged
stands, which would be more stable and resistant to abiotic negative impacts after those measures. In mature
stands, especially of oak, dry trees would be moved (well known drying as a consequence of common
phenomenon of oak forest drying in this and broader area).
Special attention, during construction, should be payed on places where mining will be carried out.
Places damaged with mining can be susceptible to phyto-phatogenic agents and disease spreading. Because of
that, it is necessary to decrease the intensity of these works on lowest level.
2.9.   Impact of the road on blo-diversity
Bio-diversity means diversity of life and its processes on certain area. For its proper recognition it is
necessary to know relation between genetic diversity, diversity of species on one side, and impacts and
functions of ecosystem on the other. Most complex ecosystem on land is forest one, which are characterized
with specific diversity of species. That diversity of species enables forest ecosystems the possibility of adaptation
to changes, but if it is healthy and preserved it enables functioning and life for other species, which are not
typical for that habitat.
In concrete ecosystem, through which road is planned, to some species of trees, bushes, low flora and
animals, attributes of main species, which are more important for normal functioning of the ecosystem then the
others, can be given. It is a fact that forests of this complex, according to ecological-vegetation regional
clasification of BiH, are classified in the category Pre-Pannonian area and northwest Bosnian area. Potentialy
these are pure beech forests, pure oak forests, as well as mixed forests of beech and oak, and mixed forests of
oak and hornbeam.
Regulation of composition of these forests, in order to change effective vegetation in potential, can be
done faster with management measures, which are directly dependent on openness with forest roads.
Qualitative structure of these forests and their productive possibilities with carrying out of appropriate
cultivation works, are also limited with opennes of the area. Main species of trees, besides beech, are oak and
horhbeam, and these species are defining main structural elements of this ecosystem and influence on
preservation of diversity.
Help in its development, with carrying out of cultivation measures, is hindered because of small
openness of the area. On the other side species of purebred deciduous tress are creating source of potential
adapting, according to possible changes in the ecosystem.
Construction of the road opens the possibilities of increasement and decreasement of diversity.
Unwanted consequences on diversity, which is of esential significance for long term functioning of ecosystem, is
possible to decrease with preventive activities according to following:
-  Strict control and supervision of realization of management plans and hunting plans
-  Help in development of conifer forests
-  Purebred deciduous forests should be marked for felling only from the aspect of sanitary-
hygienic function of tree marking
-  Prevention of distruction of young crop during felling and extraction of assortments.



13
3.0.   DIRECT SOCIO - ECONOMIC IMPACTS
3.1.    Impact of the road on felling plan
Road construction is significantly determined with need for felling and production of wood assortments in
compex of sections, which belong to economic forests. Basic taxation indexes in sections and departments,
which are included in openning with this road, are given in table 4. Data have been taken from current forest
management plan and given in table 5.
Average current increment, on the level of management classes, is 6.46 m3 for allsections and departments.
Considering that amplitude, according to principle of management sustainability on the level of management
class, is determined on the basis of quantity of increment on one side, and on the basis of sample marking of
trees for felling on the other, quantity of cut volume in sections can be estimated on the basis of increment for
ten years expressed in total timber volume according to the following:
SECTION                   ESTIMATED FELLING VOLUME m3
(1 FELLING CYCLE)
10/1                              3 447.40
10/2                              1 971.70
11/1                              3 556.80
11/2                              3 064.30
TOTAL                             12 040.2
Table 5
It can be seen from the data that in sections, through which the road is passing, it is necessary to exploit
large quantity of timber mass, for which it is neccessary to have firm forest road. Significance of the road for
felling and transportation of wood is enormous, because access and approach to sections is provided,
transportation and mobility of workers and working means, as well as control of carrying out of works is
facilitated.
This road has great significance because it enables easier and more optimal construction of secondary
network of tractor roads, and damages created by tractor work are reduced because transportation distance for
assortment skidding is smaller.
Negative consequnce of the road construction can occur because of forming of depot on the road.
Namely, it was foreseen to use turnoff, on the end of the road, as depot for wood assortments.
If there is a need for smaller depots next to the road, after completion of wood transportation from the
depot to processing facillities, places of interrupted structure susceptible to weed growing can remain.
There are two ways of solving the problems:
-  Placing the depots on eralier, during construction, determined places where there is no young
crop and where soil is covered with weed
-  If there is no possibility of artificial prevention, it should be intervened with afforestation or
preparation of soil for natural regeneration in order to stop growing of weed.



In order to preserve the road, big forest tractors during exploitation should move as less as possible over
the road, and with that maintenance costs are reduced.
14
3.2.   Impact of the road on collection of secondary forest products
Forest products, which are collected (mushrooms, medicinal herbs, fruits, etc), have great significabce in
medical and food industry. In this area following species of medicinal herbs are significant:
-  Vaccinium myrtilus
-  Hipericum umbelatum
-  Anemone hepatica
-  Fragaria vesca
-  Oxalis acetosela
-  Rubus sp.
-  Sambucus recemos
-  Sambucus nigra
-  Sanicula europaea
-  Tusilago farfara and others
Present mushrooms:
- Boletus edulus
- Morchella elata
- Cyromitra esculenta
- Tricholoma georgii
- Ramaria flava
- Lepiota cristata
- Lycoperdon gemhatum
- Lycoperdon pyriforme and others
All these resources are restorable. They are very significant for existence of local communities, and
especially with their proper collection and construction of accessory infrastructure (places for drying) survival of
residents in the area, which are poorely inhabited, are enabled and established. Collection of these special forest
products is mainly done on the level of local communities and groups, and existance of roads represents critical
cost factor for those which are collecting and have low incomes.
New micro habitat conditions are created by roads, which provide increasement of vegetation
biodiversity in which significant part have medicinal herbs and mushrooms, especially in so called marginal
habitat.
Construction of the road <Maksimovi6a potoko would have impact on initiation and increasement of
interest of local residents for collecting of special forest products. In order to achieve more complete success, it
is necessary to act educationally on local residents, which mainly have low living standard. Because of the fact
that in many developed countries activity and standard of many people depends on medicinal herbs, lichens,
moss, algas and microorganisms and forest fruits, by road construction and access to forest complex, interest of
local residents will be increased, especially in undeveloped environment.
4.0.   INDIRECT SOCIO - ECONOMIC IMPACTS
4.1.   Impact of the road on forest fire occurence
Increasement of forest roads density increases the possibility of appearance of forest fires, but also
possibility for their extinguishing and prompt interventions in case of appearance. Roads provide access, and
efficiency in fighting against fires.



Special significance roads have in ocurrence of so called low fires. However, unwanted effects of the road,
during occurence of fires, are usually caused by negligence of human factor. Because of that it is necessary to
pay special attention during construction of the particular road and to warn the workers on danger that can be
caused by careless handling with inflammable means (oil and gasoline cans, cigarettes, lighting of fire, etc). Also
15
after road construction, it is necessary, with appropriate warnning signs, to preventively influence on people,
which are moving in forest and on the forest road.
It can be emphasized that caution and preventive actions, because of possibility of occurence of fires in
forest complex which is openned with planned road, are necessary for several reasons:
- More intensive xerothermic conditions, especially in oak stands
- Composition of forest vegetation with dominance of deciduous forests (mainly oak nad beech)
- Thinned structure of stands
- Facilitated possibilities for movement of residents through forest
Therefore the conclusion is that, in the zone next to the road, it is necessary to place appropriate warnning
signs and observation posts, and forest ranger service should be engaged in field, in order to protect against
possible fires.
4.2.  Impact of the road on inventory and observance
Road construction will have special significance for forest inventory works and reduction of costs for field
data collecting. Quality of collected data and their quantity will be greater. It will enable collecton of data, which
are avoided on inaccessable terrain and also subjectivity in assessment will be avoided. In that way knowledge
about conditions of forest reserves will increase, and directives of future forest management will be determined
more precisely.
Posibilities of observation and informing of game warden and forest ranger services are increased with
the road construction. Also access to belvederes on highest cotes of terrain openned with this road, will increase,
so it can be concluded that these effects of the road are mainly positive.
4.3.   Impact of the road on values of passive utilization and non-commercial values
Most often road impacts are observed through relation of road construction costs on one side, and
economic value of utilized wood in forest which would be openned on the other. That comparison is relatively
simple.
Optimal openness of forest complex or individual section is the one, which at particular time, is giving
lowest total costs related to transportation of wood and investments in construction and maintenance of roads.
For examining of optimal openness of forests with roads in above mentioned context, following data are
necessary:
F = surface of the forest sections, which are openned (in meters),
e = average space between forest roads,
M = net mass of ood for felling on that area, expressed in tons,
Vo = Costs of drive on the road depending on distance (KM/t per 1 m of the road),
g = costs of road construction,
o = annual costs for maintenance of road, in KM/km per year.
Good indicator for exmining of road construction costs is relation towards utilized timber mass. That
relation, for 1 km of the road, is 527 m3 of timber mass, with average price of realization of assortments.
According to current production of forests and timber mass, which is gravitating on truck road in amount of 47
555 m3 or 204,10 m3/ha, construction of new road is certainly financialy justified.
However, effects and road significance for the following, are oftenly neglected or irregulary economicaly
(financialy) evaluated:
- Access for hunting



- Observation of birds
- Experience in wilderness and other.
16
In concrete case these impacts of the road for mentioned values are significant. Main reason is that area
of openning is really rich with wild animals and domestic birds. It is especially specific that forset vegetation is
preserved and not violated, because there were no felling and work-up for a long period of time.
These so called passive values are hard and irregular for assessment and financial expressing, althogh
there are some efforts. Regarding actively utilized values (fishing, skiing and camping), they can barely be
provided by road construction and it is hard to believe that they will be present.
However, passive utilized values, which are unabled by construction, more exactly objects and areas
which are accepted and appriciated by local residents, and are not utilized, essentialy are existential values and
they cannot be financialy expressed and are of great significance for local residents and entire area of gravitating
villages.
On the other side, forest which are openned with road <Maksimovica potok>> have great significance for
future generations because they will inherit great natural resources of preserved nature. Also this inheritance
cannot be expressed monetary.
5.0.   OTHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
In category of other impacts we classified impacts, which in concrete conditions, have no practical need
to be perceived in details, and those are:
-   History of road development
-   Impact of the road on landscape
-   Impact of the road on aquatic habitat and fish
-   Impact of the road on water and air quality
-   Impact on pasture
-   Impact of the road on energy and mineral resources
-   Impact of the road on private property and enclave
-   Impact of the road on inheritance and cultural values
Impact of the road on landscape is positive, because it enables the visitors to visit preserved forest
complexes. Intensive changes on landscape, after construction, will not be expressive, because the route is in
forest complex and its course can be hardly noticed from long distances.
All other impacts, wheather positive or negative, which are mentioned above, are not sognificant in this
particular case because of poor presence of impact objects; non-presence of cattle raising, mineral resources
and others.

6.0.  CONCLUSION
Construction of this road belongs into construction of road network of small proportions. By reviewing all positive
and negative socio-economic, direct and indirect impacts, and economic justification of the road it can be
concluded that positive effects of road "Maksimovica potok" construction are more significant than negative
effects. Positive effects are following:
-  Access is provided - to forest complex for utilization, collecting of special forest products,
hunting protection of forests and game
-   Easier and economically justified work is enabled on forest management by carrying out of
silvicultural works and arrangement of forests (inventory)
-   Influence on increasement and preservation of vegetation and animal bio-diversities
-   Preventive works in cases of so called accidental enjoyment
-   Prevention is facilitated in case of occurrence of forest fires.
Because of this it is considered that positive effects justify the road construction, especially from viewpoint of
impacts on the environment, so it is necessary to carry out the construction on terrain.

INTRODUCTION
Construction of forest roads is certainly among very important forest activities in SFE.
Accesibilty to forests and forest land in SFE, as well as succesfulness of correct management of
such forests is in direct dependence with openness of forests with forest roads. In forest
economic area (FEA) "Ostrelj - Drinic" mainly two types of forest roads are present:
1. Permanent and
2. Temporary forest roads
Most of the forest roads are adapted for transportation of wood assortments with trucks and
tractors. These roads are adapted for transportation to road network of public traffic. It is a fact
that most of these roads, especially forest truck roads, were constructed with basic goal which is
economicaly justified forest management, because it is well known that the phase of
transportation of wood asortments is one of the most expensive phases in production process.
However, ecological aspects and justification of road construction, until now, have not been taken
into consideration, and considering that these are big and significant infrastrucural objects in
forest complexes which have influence on number of effects, more attention should be payed to
environment impact of forest road construction in the future. Therefore, in number of cases until
now, regarding impact on environment, construction of forest roads were not optimal.
From that comes the main activity, and that is to enlarge the analysis and recognition of
specific environment impacts of forest road construction, and significance of the construction
should not be only economically assessed. Procedures of planning and construction, among
other things, should not be only formally - ecologically and lawfully justified, but they should really
be the instrument of profession and science for overcoming the conflict between the
characteristics of forest eco-systems and development obligations.
Because of that, the goal of this Study is to establish and assess the significant positive and
negative effects of forest road construction on environment and eco-system in area of SFE Drinic,
economic unit "Bobija - Ribnik".
Therefore, the goal is to elaborate the EIA (environment impact assessment) study for cited
object that represents the generic concept, with which we indicate the administrative process in
realisation of development project on site, and series of analysis procedures for identification and
assessment of environment impacts.
However, in Republic of Srpska and in the areas of SFE's, significant basis for this problem
should be provided by the Environment protection law, which is currently in elaboration phase
and is not adopted.
EIA study represents the system of procedures in two levels(stages), with which we, in
accordance with multi discipline of public and completnes, analyze alternatives for least damages
on the environment and preservation of greatest values of it.
First level (stage) represents the strategic level which means socio-economic impacts and
consequences of the project on site, and as a rule they separate on regional and national level
and are determined and expressed with methods based on quantitative indexes.
Second level means planning level. EIA study means that on the planning level, according to
character of the investor, it should be separated if it is physical or law person with purpose of
permission for work.
In accordance to previously mentioned and to the proposal (initiative) of PFE"Srpske Sume"
of Republic of Srpska and the World Bank, it is necessary to elaborate the Environment Impact
Assessment Study of Forest Road( "Brankusa - section 15" in economic unit "Bobija - Ribnik" in
FEA "Ostrelj - Drinic) Construction in order to allow the utilization of remained IDA funds for
construction of forest truck roads.

1.0. BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF FOREST ECONOMIC AREA (FEA)
1.1.  Geographic location, orographic and hydrographic characteristic of
forest economic area
FEA "Ostrelj - Drinic" is located in western part of Republic of Srpska, 150 km southwest
from Banjaluka. Geographic coordinates are following: IGD 16020", SGS 44010".
This FEA includes the area of typical young mountains of inner Dinaric mountains, with
dominant mountain massif Klekovaca. Highest point is Klekovaca point with height of 1962m
above see level, and lowest point is in Bunara with 679 m above see level.
The most significant part of the area represents the massif Klekovaca, which possesses all
characteristics of karst area with hollows, depressions... Expressive orography like this is the
result of presence and domination of solid mesozoic limestone in the surface of this area.
Because of that in the area of permanent running water, rivers and brooks are insignificant. Only
periodically when the rainfall are abundant, so called mountain brooks occur here and there.
There are few smaller surface streams, which are strongest in spring, but in the summer they dry
up.
1.2.   Climatic conditions
For recognition and analysis of climatic conditions of the area we have used the
Thornthweite climate analysis method. Results on the basis of average indexes about quantity
(level) of percipitations and temperature for observance period from 1963 to 1991, that we have
taken from meteorological (weather forecast) station Drinic, located on 730m above sea level, are
shown in table 1 and graph 1.
According to data from the table 1 and graph 1 it can be noticed that the area of Drinic is
rich with percipitations, especially in autumn and winter. However very large quantitiy of
percipitations is in vegetative period and is around 47% from total percipitations, which is very
convenient for growth of vegetation in the area.
Negative impacts of outstanding percipitations during the winter months
(December, January and February ) which amounts around 30%, are very significant for forestry
works, because these are mostly snow that hinders the works of the SFE since the access, to
forest complexes and sections in which particular works are foreseen, is hindered. Because of
that, construction of forest roads and greater opennes of forest complexes is necessary, in order
to facilitate the works during winter and hindered passing.

Area of Drinic, according to the classification of the climate by Milosavljevi6, M.(1 973),
can be characterized to have mountain climate.
It is known that abundant rainfall can cause severe damage, because so called pluvial
erosion, which is particulary important for forest roads. Pluvial erosion appears as a result of
great kinetic energy of rain drops. We expressed the possibility of appearance of pluvial erosion
with Furnije coefficient by formula:
C = p2/ p
C - Furnije coefficient
p - Average quantity of precipitations in the rainest month (mm)
P - Average annual quantity of precipitations (mm)
According to value of this coefficient, which is 13.91 for October and 19.69 for December,
it can be concluded that the area is from average and up to very endangered with pluvial erosion.
On lower heights of the area precipitations are mostly rain, and on higher are snow. It means that
5



area of Bunara (lowest point), where it is necessary to construct the planed road, is more
endangered with pluvial erosion, especially in autumn and it should be considered.
However, certain reducing of pluvial erosion danger in the area is possible, because the
geological surface is composed of limestone which is exceptionally water permeable and so-
called depth or karst erosion, which somewhat lessens the negative consequences of pluvial
erosion, is expressive.
1.3.   Geological - pedological characteristics
Dominant geological surface in the area is consisted of crypto-crystal limestone. Those are
mainly marine sediments from Mesozoic. They are mostly of layer structure and rarely are
massive and intensively cracked. They are characterized with uneven and intensive karstification,
and great water permeability, by which danger from pluvial erosion is decreased.
One smaller group of rocks is composed of crypto-crystal dolomites, which mainly represent
marine sediments from Mesozoic. They are mostly massive and cracked, and classified locally.
By their decaying they create sand, which is susceptible to erosion. These dolomite rocks are
located in southeast parts of FEA.
Depending on the intensity of impacts of pedo-genetic factors, first of all geological
surface and climatic influences, in most of the FEA, humus-cumulative soil with A-C profile type is
formed. Those are mainly limestone fertile soil and limestone-dolomite fertile soil, and brown
limestone soil.
All these soils are very rich with pedo-fauna, which is micro-fauna, mezzo-fauna and
macro-fauna ( Anelidae, Enchytraeidae, lsopodae, ants and others). Their work is very intensive,
especially because the great resources of humus and undissolved dead forest cover.
1.4.   Plant communities
SFE "Drinic" from Drinic is located on 13 288ha of forestland. From that amount on 12
703ha are high forests with natural regeneration, raisings 87ha, bare land 406ha and non-
productive surfaces 92ha.
Biggest areas in the FEA are covered with fir, spruce and beech, which are mainly
classified in high forests of fir, spruce and beech on limestone dolomite soil with. Average total
volume of this management class is around 392m3/ha, from which 254 m3/ha or 64.8% are
conifers and 138 m3/ha or 35% are deciduous forests.
Regarding the size of intensity next community is beech and fir ( Abieti-fagetum) whose
stands bvelong to management class of high forests of beech and fir on limestone dolomite soil
with variable depth, with total volume around 406 m3/ha, from which 252 m3/ha or 62.06% are
conifers and 154 m3/ha or 37.94% are deciduous forests.
Particular significance, especially from the aspect of the terms of reference ( since the
planned route is passing through sectons which are classified in this type of forests (management
class) represent communities of high forests of second class beech in mixed zone of beech, fir
and spruce on limestone dolomite soil with variable depth. Total average volume of these forests
on FEA level is 309 m3/ha, from which 289 m3/ha or 93.52% are deciduous forests (mainly beech
and thoroughbred deciduous forests) and 20 m3/ha or 6.48% are confers.
Forests of white pine in succession towards mixed forests of beech, fir and spruce on
dolomite soil have average total volume of 358 m3/ha, from which 336 m3 or 93.58% are conifers
and 22 m3/ha or 6.15% are deciduous forests.
Exceptional value in the FEA managed by this SFE has the virgin forest Lom, which
represents the rarity not only in RS but also in Europe. It is distinguished in the category of forests
6



with special purpose. It includes 5 sections (297.75 ha). Basic characteristic is that stands
in the virgin forest are left to spontaneous growth and are isolated from any influence, first of all
from anthropogenic factors. Consequently, they are not classified in so called economic forests
but in forests that serve for needs of scientific research in forestry, biology, ecology, zoology and
other, as well as for needs of tourism and recreative function of forests. The stands mainly belong
to communities of mixed forests of beech, fir and spruce on limestone soil. Average total volume
in virgin forest is 729 m3/ha, from which 510 m3/ha or 70% are conifers and 219 m3/ha or 30% are
deciduous forests.
Uniqueness of this FEA also represents the seed stand of white pine in section 109 (so
called "Ravna Glavica") located on the area of 15.70 ha. This stand is belongs in the high -
quality class of seed objects in RS, and is distinguished and registered during the activities of
distinguishing and registration of seed stands on State level. Significance of this object is great,
because with seed collection from this stand preservation of qualitative gene fond is provided
throughout new generations of nursery material from the nursery production.
1.5.   Basic taxation indexes, structure of stands and way of management
Situation of wood supplies in the period of arrangement in FEA"Drinicko" is 5 671 800 m3
on the entire FEA. From the total volume 3 197 400 m3 or 56% are conifers and 2 474 400 m3 or
44% are deciduous forests. Average total volume of conifers on the level of entire FEA is 251
m3/ha and 195 m3/ha of deciduous forests. It is important to emphasize that share of conifers with
breast-height diameter above 30cm, in total volume on the FEA level, is 80%.
In the period of arrangement, the situation of current volume growth increase of high forest
class, on the FEA level is 9.19 m3/ha or around 116 740 m3 in average.
According to indexes of forest management plans and analyses of structural development
of stands in the area, it can be concluded that stands of different age with approximate
characteristic structure for selection forests are dominant. That can be especially applied for
mixed stands of beech, fir and spruce. Smaller complexes of second-class pure beech forests
have the uniqueness of same age stands. This structural development of forests is a result mainly
of management ways, environment conditions and bio-ecological features of native species.
Annual cut (etat) in this FEA, according to data of current FMP, is 146 283 m3, from which
69 169 m3 are conifers and 77 114 m3are deciduous forests.
Application of selection management system of natural renovation depends a lot on openness of
forest complexes by roads. Namely, for successful realization of the project and adequate spatial
arrangement of the section, with goal of successful natural renovation, protection of second
growth, reduction of damage on second growth and mature trees, especially during the
application of logging tractors in the process of pulling and skidding of wood assortments to
timber yard, appropriate network of forest truck roads is necessary.
1.6.   Conditions of game
Within the FEA "Ostrelj" - Drinic - after the war (1995), hunting area "Drinic - Potoci" has
been formed, and it is managed on the basis of hunting plans with validity from 01.04.1999 to

- Pine marten(Martes Martes),
- Stone marten(Martes Fiona)
The most important species of this hunting area, which represent the main grown game,
are native species of this climate:
-   Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus),
-  Bear (Ursus arctos),
-  Big grouse (Tatrao urogalus L.),
-   Hazel hen (Tetrastes bonasia)
This hunting area belongs into the category of economic sport hunting areas, so it fulfills
the needs of economic hunting and hunting as sport -recreative character of members of hunting
organizations.
For fulfillment of hunting area functions, from aspects of mobility of hunters and hunting
service in the area, existing network of forest communications is satisfactory and they are used in
the period of intensive hunting. However, for construction of hunting objects (observation posts,
lodging objects, places for weapon testing and others) it is necessary to construct new
infrastructural objects, forest roads and hunting trails, which should enable greater mobility, and
to facilitate the work first of all to game warden service, technical staff and hunters in the hunting
area.

Advantage of the construction of the road "Brankusa - section 115" in management unit
"Bobija - Ribnik" is related to hunting areas, because the road is attached to the existing road that
passes through sections 122, 123 and 126 in management unit "Bobija - Ribnik" and new road is
passing through sections 115, 116 and 121 of the same management unit. Taking in
consideration that these sections are not included in area for intensive game management, this
road will not be an obstacle for migration of mammals, which escape from anthropogenic
influenced roads and are passing by them. The road will have of greater significance because it
will enable an easier access to the area of intensive management for hunters, employees and
others, and will not directly endanger and disturb the natural totality of the area for intensive
management. The access will be easier from the direction of Bravska from the road Kljuc - Drinic.
Starting point of the area boundary is from altitude 1191 over the boundaries of the sections
131/2 and 138 in management unit "Bobija - Ribnik" up to altitude 1229, and then boundaries of
sections 99 and 96 up to 101 etc.
1.7.   Openness of forests with forest roads
FEA "Ostrelj" - Drinic is opened with three main categories of roads:
-  Public roads
-  Regional rods
-  Forest truck roads
Precise data about length of these roads in the SFE do not exist. However, it can be
emphasized that total openness of forests and forest land in the area is in average 9.2
km/1000ha, which is certainly not satisfactory especially if you take into consideration that for this
area optimal openness of forests is considered to be 20km/i 000ha. That points to the necessity
for construction of new roads, especially forest truck roads that should enable the access to
unopened forest complexes due to satisfaction of all positive sides of forest road construction,
with all precautions and preventive measures with goal of prevention of negative consequences,
which follows the construction of a road.
Approaching to the optimal openness with construction of new roads, perspectives of the
area development in new conditions of the economy and development of private initiative would
be greater.
In favor of that fact it should be emphasized that economic conditions in the area, after
the war in BiH was finished, were very difficult. But thanks to efforts of the SFE, as the most
developed economic subject, the area has developed into firm community, which has the
tendency of further successful development.
2.0. DESCRIPTION OF THE ROUTE
2.1.   Location of the road
Road "Brankusa - section 115" is planned in management unit Bobija - Ribnik. Actual
length of the route is 3202m. The route is set out with apex and center-line pegs, and marked
with cross-section and apex numbers. The route passes through sections 120, 121, 116 and
ends in section i1 5.
Starting point of the route is attached to the existing forest road from Bravska to
Brankusa in section 120.
9



Planned road extends between 800 and 900m above see level. The route extends in
east-west direction, beginning from centerline chainage on 900m above see level in forest Malic
(Brankusa in section 120), and ends on chainage (cross section) no. 247 on 807.07m above see
level in section 115, near the boundary of FEA "Kljuc" and border of FBiH. The road, with its main
center line, is located south from Bravsko field, on average distance of about 2km from FBiH
border.
2.2.   Purpose (reasons) of road construction
Road construction should facilitate the usage of numerous resources form natural and
changed forest eco-systems. Forest as a property with public interest, besides production
function, has other useful functions, which are necessary for people.
Possibilities of utilization of common useful functions of forests are significantly decreased if there
are no constructed forest roads in forest complexes. Their significance is greater for local
residents (returnees to Drini6), who are living in economically undeveloped areas, where life and
work are based on work in SFE "Ostrelj" - Drinic, as the most significant economic subject of the
place.
It is well known that construction of the road can have positive (useful) and negative
(harmful) consequences. Special significance road construction has form the viewpoint of
enabling the access to the forest complex. For the workers in SFE, especially those doing felling,
construction, skidding and exporting of wood assortments in sections 115, 116, 120 and 121, in
management unit ((Bobija - Ribnik)>, as well as in surrounding sections of the same management
unit, the work will be facilitated.
Besides that, the road should enable the easier arrival of other workers to the objects,
and to local residents greater and easier activities of collection of mushrooms and medicinal
herbs (special forest products), as well as easier movement of cattle from one pasture to another.
Special significance road should have in faciliation of work to protection services (foresters and
game wardens), which is from great importance today.
The road should also have the preventive role for prevention of forest fires expansion.
Considering that the road route is passing through complex of high forests with high degree of
preservation, with all the specificness of autochthonous and undisturbed vegetation in certain
conditions, visitors, tourists, citizens, scientists, local residents and others will be in opportunity to
get introduced with gifts of the nature in the area. The raod will enable development of hunting
tourism and economy of the area, because it passes through the parts with protected and
undisturbed forest complexes. It should be emphasized that tree felling in this complex has not
been done in the last 20 years.
Accomplishment of more significant economic effects, especially for the SFE, will be
enabled by road construction, because the costs for the most expensive phase of transportation
of wood assortments will be reduced. Another reason for road construction is that pure beech
stand in the forest complex, in development phase of mature stands, are dominant. Considering
the total structure of the stands, expressive mezzofility of habitat of the natural site and bio-
ecological features of beech and fir, renewing of beech is hindered and of fir is overaged.
Because of that, in this complex, it is necessary to carry out the silviculture activities due to
renovation of beech, and helping the development of fir and spruce progeny. From the other
aspect, by keeping too ripe and ripe beech trees, the stands are acquiring the features of virgin
forest, and on limestone surface in mezzofile conditions of the natural site the beech trees are
susceptible to diseases of central rottness and decay, which significantly reduces market value of
current high-quality beech trees. It is impossible to overcome this problem without constructed
road.
10



Greater economic effects are expected after construction of the road, because even local
residents (returnees) will use this road for providing fire-wood and collection of mushrooms,
medicinal herbs and forest fruits.
2.3.   Project and road size
Main project for construction of the road <<Brankusa - section 1 15O, 3.180km long, is
elaborated by RO <(Sipad - IRC)) OOUR <(Silva)), in Sarajevo - 1984. Within the technical report,
it is emphasized that the route is elaborated according to valid guidelines for forest road planning.
It is ecpecially significant that the terrain configuration enabled for the horizontal extension of the
route to be on satisfactory level, which is exceptional in limestone terrain. The favourable
horizontal extension of the route, with small gradients, enables the minimum earth works,
decreased excavations and embankments, decreased cuts, which positively influences on
preservation of the environment. Width of the road surface should be 3.Om and of the shoulders
2X0.5m. Inclination of the cut slopes (mitre bank) are varying from 1:1 to 3:1. and inclination of
embankment slopes (mitre bank) are 1:1.3. Passing places are foreseen on 400m. Wtih goal of
decreasing the possible damage on the plant cover next to the road, passing places should be
placed on shorter distance cca 300m.
Considering that it is water permeable home substratum no water flowing trails, from the
slopes and next to the route, are noticed, but it is planned in the project to place the pipe culverts
with 60cm diameter in the side ditches in order to reduce the danger of heavy rainfalls, and to use
natural drainage. It is necessary, especaially in the period of heavy precipitation and snow
melting (table 1), to clean the pipe culverts from the deposits of dead forest cover in order to
make culverts functional. Side drainage is foreseen with trapeze ditches 15cm deep and 30cm
wide in the base.
Road structure will be constructed wih 20cm of macadam in rolled state. Main material
will be used from the quarry in Bunara, near the route. Main construction works on the route are:
-  Excavation 8141.7 m3 and
-   Embankment 3186.5 m3
2.4. Usage of biota during the road construction
Freight vehicles traffic, which should be carried out on this forest road, after the
construction is finished, would not be intensive, because of the several reasons and the following
are the most important:
- Intensive felling and transportation of wood assortments, according to working cycle and
lenght of fecundation, will be carried out after 10 years as it is regulated bz FMP
- Area, which will be openned with this road is poorly inhabited, does not connect
inhabited places, and near (section 115) it is the boundary of FEA ((KIjucko)).
Because of that the most significant negative impacts on biota are expected exactly
during road construction. Most significant impacts and far-reaching consequences are on forest
land as integral part of biota and especially in the part next to the road. Within preparatory works,
significant negative impacts, which are unavoidable, are related to felling of trees (mainly beech),
shrubs (Dafne mezereum, Sambucus nigra, Cerasus avium, Ilex aquifolium, Corilus avelana and
others) and low flora. Besides that, extraction of roots of mature trees is carried and habitat of
pedo-fauna, which is very active here, is endangered. Holes which remain after extraction of
roots will be filled and compacted with soil material because of stability of roadbed, which
negatively reflects on water and air order and endangers the habitat of pedo-fauna.
11



2.5.   Geomorphologic impacts of road construction, sedimentation and
Rockslides
Impact of road construction on geomorphologic features of terrain can be perceived
through chronic and long term changes and consequences. Location and course of the planned
road is leading to a conclusion that significant geomorphologic impacts, regerding negative
consequences, will be reduced to a lowest intensity. Reason for that is, that considering the slope
of terrain and route, intensive earth works will not be carried out, which is very important
regarding preservation of habitat. It is known that roads have impacts on geomorphologic
processes through 5 primary mechanisms:
a) Direct impacts on structure and geometry of soil cuts, embankments, ditches and similar.
b) Changes in usual surface water currents and creation of new road on water currents
c) Direct influence on structure and geometry of water currents
d) Speed up of erosion from the road surface
e) Causing the impact on water, especially on places where the road crosses the brooks
If possibilities of negative impacts of the road through mentioned mechanisms are reviewed,
than it should be emphasized that on the route there is no terrain where occurence of slides is
possible. Possible more intensive erosions can be expected during road construction under
influence of pluvial erosion. Mass of moved soil can be minor, because those are shallow or
medium deep limestone soil (kalkomelanosol and kalkokambisol). Limestone fertile soil, brown
soil awill be mostly seized. Most of moved material will represent undissolved dead forest cover,
which is here represented in thick layers and is not completely with humus because of total
structure of stands. According to that, possibilities of negative impacts can occur on culverts with
60cm diameter through which water flows, sediment and wood in the period of torrents, which will
not be expressed here.
Near the planned route there are no permanent water currents, so the surface erosion from
the roads, cuts and ditches will not cause increasement of presence and source of sediments in
water currents.
It can be concluded that road construction, will not cause occurence of significant
geomorphologic disturbances and erosion proceses on the road and surroundings, because of
relatively small earth works, small cuts and embankments and favourable course of the road with
relatively small side fall of finished road levels. Fact that brown limestone soils are dominant,
which are averagelly susceptible to pluvial erosion, goes in favour to this, and more intensive
pluvial erosion can be expected on soils where kalkomelanosol is dominant. In depressions and
flat terrain there is soil less susceptible to this type of erosion processes.
2.6.   Hydrological impacts of road construction
In concrete case, danger of occurence of torrents are reduced to minimum, for several
reasons:
a) Specificness of geologica base
b) Presence of limestone soil
c) Non-existing waterproof layers in soil
d) Sufficient number of pipe culverts foreseen (5 pieces woth total lenght of 33m),
collecting pits and places for natural drainage
e) Non-existing permanent water currents next to the route and in surroundings
f) Small slopes of terrain next to the road and near it
12



For preventive performance and prevention of unwanted consequences of possible
smaller torrents, it is necessary to pay attention to cleaning of waste materials in collecting pit,
culverts and drainage ditches, during maintenance of road.
2.7.   Impact of the road on productivity of the habitats
By construction of the road, conditions of soil resource is changed, because by pasing
through forest complex roads occupy productive soil and have influence on total produtction
potential of certain habitat.
Considering that there is no dense young crop next to the road, damage to present
young crop is not significant. With road construction this area (1 .3ha) is lost for occurence of
young crop and other vegetation on the road. However, by opening of stand structure above the
road, apropriate conditions appear for occurence, growth and development of heliofits next to the
road (usually species from family Rubus, Sorbus, Populus tremula appears, as well as heliofit low
flora), by which biodiversity of vegetation next to the road is increased.
Yet, largest and most severe consequences are done to soil, which is permanently lost.
Major part remaines disposed in the embankments and that is important benefit, but from
productive viewpoint it is lost. Total quantityof soil mass, which will be violated is around 1000m3.
However, road construction should not be observed from viewpoint of productivity lost,
but also on long term basis htrough indirect impacts, significance of the road can be positive.
Namely, with construction, easier and economicaly justified carrying out of growing activities,
activities of collection of special forest products, game warden activities and other will be enabled
in stands, and improvement of qualitve and quantitative structure of forests will be directly
influenced. In that way, more intensively, productive potential of habitat will be used, from
viewpoint of production of higher quantity of timber mass, as well as providing the continuity of
management and satisfaction of cammon useful forest functions. Of course long term and indirect
analyzing of these impacts should be kept in mind.
2.8.   Impact of road construction on fragmentation of the habitats
It is unavoidably that with construction of the road habitat of naturel popuilations is
divided in two or more parts. In the are of road construction these impacts can be viewed from
two aspects:
- Classification of habitat for plant species related to biodiversity
- Classification of habitat for animal species
In both cases populations can be classified in smaller sub-populations and habitats split,
which can negatively reflect on genetic variability.
Existing habitat, in sections through wich the route is planned, is characterized with all
features of preserved habitat of domestic vegetation, of plant community of potential vegetation
Abieto - fagetum illyricum. When the road is constructed three habitats will be formed, from which
two would have same conditions. Special micro habitat, wtih all new micro ecological features,
will be formed on the road, as the marginal habitat. The most significant feature of that micro
habitat is increasing of thermophility and illumination, which will directly reflect on occurence of
heliofit species of trees, bushes and low flora next to the route. Species that would probably occur
are: Acer pseudoplatanus, Acer platanoides, Picea abies, Sorbus sp., Fraxinus exelsior, Fragaria
vesca, Asarum europaeum, Rubus sp, Galium silvaticum, different fern and young crop of
domestic species od trees and other. That shows the increasement of plant biodiversities next to
the route, which significantly differs from biodiversities in other two macro habitats on one side,
and on the other road on longer distance from the route where existing flora will remain dominant
(Fagus silvatica, Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus, Fraxinus exelsior and other).
13



Specificness of the occurence of somewhat changed habitat conditions after road
construction should be expected in stands, after carrying out of silvicultural and utilization works
in habitats far from the road. Those changes will be caused by felling, which will be carried out in
sections, after opening of this forest complex. Main goal of these actions, besides utilization of
timber volume, is to improve natural regeneration of domestic vegetation.
Dividing of habitat for animals will especially effect on game. Namely, road construction
will have positive and negative effects. Positive because with the creation of marginal habitat
birds and animals, which usualy inhabit the forest edge, are getting new coridor by which they
can move deeper in the forest. That will increase the diversities of animal species in forest and
area of habitat for these species of birds and animals.
Negative impacts will especially reflect on certain species of mammals, for which is
known that they aviod movement over the roads. Their only existing habitat for now, by road
construction (especially utilization of existing one, which will be connected to the planned one),
will be divided with 8km long route, which represents significant obstacle for movement of
mammals. Problem can be solved wirh accessory objects for food supply, which will be placed
equaly in both macro habitats.
Road impact will also have influence on terrestrial Vertabrata in the following ways:
Type of impact               Assessment of impact intensity
a) Loss of habitat and fragmentation    Small impacts
b) Negative impacts of road utilization,  Strong impact during construction and
noise and running over on the road    utilization of forests (felling, export and
transportation)
c) Excessive hunting and traping        Medium impacts
Solving of these problems is possible with organization of appropriate supervision during
construction by engaging only necessary machines, more intensive engagement of labour,
organization and greater mobility of geme warden service, and placing of warnings and
appropriate signs next to the road.
2.8.1. Impact of the road on biological invasions
Most oftenly, idea of biological invasion is observed through biological disturbance. By
road construction, by impact of anthropogenic factor because of utilization and works on
maintenance (cleaning of ditches, culverts, road leveling, etc), disturbances occur, which are
creating and maintaining the marginal habitat.
By road ((Brankusa-section 115>) construction these impacts on biological invasion will
not be intensive. The resaon is, because movement of vehicles and people will not be intensive
like on public roads. On unwanted effects of these impacts can be pointed during and after
construction with adequate warnnings next to the road. Good example of biological invasion of
outer species is expansion of Robinia pseudoacacia, which represents weed on cultivable
agricultural soil.
It is also necessary, in performance projects, to point to danger of biological invasion of
unwanted species because they can represent serious problem during realization of arrangement
of forest, since they disrupt the structure, composition and function of forest ecosystem.
14



2.9.   Impact of the road on diseases of trees
Existence and construction of roads, superficially observed, do not have major impacts
on forest diseases. However, it is a fact that areas opened with forest roads have greater
possibility of prevention of occurence of plant diseases. This significance is greater if you
consider it in context of silvicultural works.
Way of natural regeneration and raising of forests represent esence of prescribed system
of forest management through which road construction is planned. Considering that this complex
of beech forests is in development phase of ripe and over ripe trees for felling of ill bech trees and
purebred decidious trees are evident and present, and mostly rottness and other diseases:
Nectria cinnabarina, Melanopus squamosus, Orchstes fagi, Miciola fagi, Rhitisma acerinum,
Fomes sp., and others. Occurence of entomological diseases is possible because of unstability of
ecosystem and physiological weakening of plants, which is especially expressed in last 5 years. It
occurs mostly as a consequence of violated ecological conditions of the habitat and disturbances
in forest ecosystems. Impact and occurence of barkbeetle is intensive (Ips sp.). Danger of this
type (entomological diseases) for forest complex, hich is openee with this road, is not significant.
However, greater dangers have phyto-pathological character on beech trees, which are
physiologically weak because of over ripe. By road construction and removing of ill trees from the
stands and carrying out of cultivation-sanitary felling, these dangers will be neutralized.
2.10.   Impact of the road on bio-diversity
Bio-diversity means diversity of life and its processes on certain area.
In concrete ecosystem, through which road is planned, to some species of trees, bushes, low
flora and animals, attributes of main species, which are more important for normal functioning of
the ecosystem then the others, can be given. It is a fact that forests of this complex are classified
in the category of secondary beech forests, which according to ecological-vegetation arial
classification in BiH, belong to potentially mixed forests of beech and fir.
Regulation of composition of these forests, in order to change effective vegetation in
potential, can be done faster with management measures, which are directly dependent on
openness with forest roads. Fir (Abies alba), as the domestic specie of this area, is less present
in composition of these forests, considering the scope of presence it should have according to
potential of this habitat. This specie of tree, besides beech, represents main specie of trees,
which is defining main structural elements of this ecosystem and influences o the sustainability of
diversity. Help in its development, with carrying out of cultivation measures, is hindered because
of small openness of the area. On the other side species of purebred deciduous tress are
creating source of potential adapting, according to possible changes in the ecosystem.
Construction of the road opens the possibilities of increasement and decreasement of
diversity. Unwanted consequences on diversity, which is of esential significance for long term
functioning of ecosystem, is possible to decrease with preventive activities according to following:
-  Strict control and supervision of realization of management plans and hunting
plans
-  Help in development of conifer forests
-  Purebred deciduous forests should be marked for felling only from the aspect of
sanitary-hygienic function of tree marking
-  Prevention of distruction of young crop during felling and extraction of
assortments.
15



3.0. DIRECT SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
3.1.   Impact of the road on felling plan
Road construction is significantly determined with need for felling and production of wood
assortments in compex of sections, which belong to economic forests.
Average current increment on the level of management classes, for all sections and
departments (except section 120 of department b) is 7.60 m3/ha, while for section 120/b is 10.43
m3/ha. Considering that amplitude, according to principles of continuity (sustainability) of
management on the level of management class, is determined on one side according to quantity
of increment, and on the other according to sample (test, experimental) marking of trees for
felling, felling volume in section can be estimated on the basis of increment for period of ten
years, expressed in total timber volume according to following:
SECTION                  ESTIMATED FELLING VOLUME m3
115                                 3669
116                                 3998
120                                 5876
121/1                               3592
121/2                               3506
TOTAL                                20 631
It can be seen from the data that in sections, through which the road is passing, it is
necessary to exploit large quantity of timber mass, for which it is neccessary to have firm forest
road. Significance of the road for felling and transportation of wood is enormous, because access
and approach to sections is provided, transportation and mobility of workers and working means,
as well as control of carrying out of works is facilitated. This road has great significance because
it enables easier and more optimal construction of secondary network of tractor roads, and
damage occuring during works with tractors are decreased, because transportation distance of
skidding of assortments is smaller.
Negative consequnce of the road construction can occur because of forming of depot on
the road. After transportation of wood from depot to processing facilities is finished, usually places
of interrupted structure remain, which are susceptible to weed.
There are two ways of solving the problems:
- Placing the depots on eralier, during construction, determined places where there
is no young crop and where soil is covered with weed
- If there is no possibility of artificial prevention, it should be intervened with
afforestation or preparation of soil for natural regeneration in order to stop
growing of weed.
16



In order to preserve the road, big forest tractors during exploitation should move as less as
possible over the road, and with that maintenance costs are reduced.
3.2.   Impact of the road on collection of secondary forest products
Forest products, which are collected (mushrooms, medicinal herbs, fruits, etc), have
great significabce in medical and food industry. In this area following species of medicinal herbs
are significant:
-  Vaccinium myrtilus
-  Hipericum umbelatum
-  Anemone hepatica
-  Fragaria vesca
-  Oxalis acetosela
-  Rubus sp.
-  Sambucus recemosa
-  Sambucus nigra
-  Sanicula europaea
-  Tusilago farfara
-  Allinum ursinum and other
Present mushrooms:
-   Morchella elata
-  Cyromitra esculenta
-  Tricholoma georgi
-   Ramaria flava
-   Lepiota cristata
-   Lycoperdon gemhatum
-  Lycoperdon pyriforme
All these resources are restorable. They are very significant for preservation of local
communities, especially with their corect collection and construction of accessory
infrastrucrure (shed), return of people on these areas is enabled and affirmed. Usually collecting
is done on the level of local communitiea and groups, and existence of roads represents critical
cost factor for collectors with usually low income.
New micro habitat conditions are created by roads, which provide increasement of
vegetation biodiversity in which significant part have medicinal herbs and mushrooms, especially
in so called marginal habitat.
Construction of the road (<Brankusa-section I1 5,, would have impact on initiation and
increasement of interest of local residents for collecting of special forest products. In order to
achieve more complete success, it is necessary to act educationally on local residents
(returnees), which mainly have low living standard.
17



4.0. INDIRECT SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
4.1.   Impact of the road on forest fire occurence
Special significance roads have in ocurrence of so called low fires. However, unwanted
effects of the road, during occurence of fires, are usually caused by negligence of human factor.
Because of that it is necessary to pay special attention during construction of the particular road
and to warn the workers on danger that can be caused by careless handling with inflammable
means (oil and gasoline cans, cigarettes, lighting of fire, etc). Also after road construction, it is
necessary, with appropriate warnning signs, to preventively influence on people, which are
moving in forest and on the forest road.
However, it can be emphasized that possibility of forest fire occurence of great
proportions, in forest complex openned with the planned road, is far more smaller for few
reasons:
-  Mezzofilc habitat conditions
-  Composition of forest vegetation with dominance of deciduous forests (mainly
beech)
-  Relatively small movements of residents through forests, because of small
inhabitence of areas Bravska poija and Bunare
-  Small presence of conifer species especially susceptible to fires
-  Relatively high quantity of precipitation (table 1) in periods of the year when fores
are occuring
According to that, the conclusion is that there will be no significant danger of fires and the
road only can have greater significance in increasement of possibilities of preventive acting and
prevention of possible fires.
4.2.   Impact of the road on inventory and observance
Road construction will have special significance for forest inventory works, reduction of
costs for field data collecting. Quality of collected data and their quantity will be greater. It will
enable collecton of data, which are avoided on inaccessable terrain and also subjectivity in
assessment will be avoided.
Posibilities of observation and informing of game warden and forest ranger services are
increased with the road construction. This is especially significant if you look in context of
facilitated possibilities for construction of observation posts, whose construction is determined by
road construction. Also access to belvederes on highest cotes of terrain openned with this road,
will increase, so it can be concluded that these effects of the road are mainly positive.
4.3.   Impact of the road on values of passive utilization and non-commercial
values
Most often road impacts are observed through relation of road construction costs on one
side, and economic value of utilized wood in forest which would be openned on the other. That
comparison is relatively simple. However, effects and road significance for the following, are
oftenly neglected or irregulary economicaly (financialy) evaluated:
-  Access for hunting
-  Observation of birds
18



- Experience in wilderness
In concrete case these impacts of the road for mentioned values are significant. Main
reason is that area of openning is really rich with wild animals and domestic birds. It is especially
specific that forset vegetation is preserved and not violated, because there were no felling and
work-up for a long period of time, so the forests have some characteristics of virgin forest type
beech stands.
These so called passive values are difficult and irregular to assess, and financialy
express, although there are attempts. Within active utilized values (recreative fishing, skiing and
camping), by road construction, they can be poorly provided and it is difficult to believe that they
will be present.
However, passive utilized values, which are unabled by construction, more exactly
objects and areas which are accepted and appriciated by local residents, and are not utilized,
essentialy are existential values and they cannot be financialy expressed and are of great
significance for local residents and entire area of Drini6.
5.0. OTHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
In category of other impacts we classified impacts, which in concrete conditions, have no
practical need to be perceived in details, and those are:
-  History of road development
-  Impact of the road on landscape
-  Impact of the road on aquatic habitat and fish
-  Impact of the road on water and air quality
-  Impact on pasture
-  Impact of the road on energy and mineral resources
-  Impact of the road on private property and enclave
-  Impact of the road on inheritance and cultural values
Impact of the road on landscape is positive, because it enables the visitors to visit
preserved forest complexes. Intensive changes on landscape, after construction, will not be
expressive, because the route is in forest complex and its course can be hardly noticed from long
distances, for example from road Kljuc-Drinic.
Also all other impacts of the road, whether positive or negative, which are mentioned
above, are not significant in concrete case because of main reason of weak presence of impact
objects; unpresent developed cattle raising, permanent water currents and fish, mineral resources
and thers.

6.0.    CONCLUSION
Construction of this road belongs into construction of road network of small proportions. By
reviewing all positive and negative socio-economic, direct and indirect impacts, and economic
justification of the road it can be concluded that positive effects of road "Brankusa - section 11 5"
construction are more significant than negative effects. Positive effects are following:
-  Access is provided - to forest complex for utilization, collecting of special forest
products, hunting protection of forests and game
-  Easier and economically justified work is enabled on forest management by
carrying out of silvicultural works and arrangement of forests (inventory)
-   Influence on increasement and preservation of vegetation and animal bio-
diversities
-  Preventive works in cases of so called accidental enjoyment
-  Solved property relations
-  More significant economic effects for local residents, because more possibilities
are opened for activities provided by forest as a natural resource and other.
Because of this it is considered that positive effects justify the road construction,
especially from viewpoint of impacts on the environment, so it is necessary to carry out
the construction on terrain.

INTRODUCTION
Opennes of forests in Republic of Srpska, before the war, has been very low (about 7 km/1000 ha), and
up to last ten years, because of the war and very difficult financial conditions after the war, new roads were not
constructed, so the current openness remained as it was ten years ago. Previously constructed roads, because
they were not maintenanced during and after the war, are exposed to further collapse, and one part became
hardly passable or impassable for heavy trucks with big loads.
Insufficient openness not only influences the forest exploitation economy but also negatively reflects on
the environment. Namely, because of the insufficient openness of forest areas annual cut cannot be equally
realized on the entire area, but very often, during the silvicultural rotation, the same area is entered several times
or ---------- are carried out on the open area. That negatively reflects on the sustainability of forest management
and endangers particular forest ecosystems. In the unopened area prompt carrying out of protection measures
against fires, herbal diseases and natural catastrophes are disabled.
PFE of Republic of Srpska "Srpske Sume" proposed that, among others, construction of forest truck road
"Sipasno - Zlatac - Lokve" , 5 758m long, in the area of SFE "Botin" - Nevesinje should also be included.
Data for Study elaboration were acquired by visiting the route, and during that we have used the project.
After that we have collected data from the SFE, from forest management plan, as well as from forest cadastre for
FEA "Nevesinje".
Goal of the Study is to point to all relevant facts, which could have negative impact on the environment
during construction and utilization of the road, as well as to suggest the measures for possible elimination of
negative effects.
It is necessary to emphasize that these studies are the first of this kind, which are elaborated for forest
truck roads, and that authors had problems with lack of necessary data, as well as lack of any research in this
field (branch) in the previous period in the area.
Second problem was lack of law scale of norms for the field of forest road construction, especially
regarding protection of the environment.



1.0.   CONDITIONS OF FORESTS AND FOREST LAND IN SFE "BTIN" - NEVESINJE
SFE "Botin" - Nevesinje works within PFE "Srpske 8ume" and manages FEA "Nevesinjsko". This area
includes forests and forest land in the area of municipality Nevesinje (97.2 %), and smaller part of the area
belongs to municipality of Srpski Mostar (2.8 %).
1.1.   Basic survey indexes
According to tables review given in the Study it can be seen that FEA "Nevesinjsko" includes forests and
forest land in the area of 57 372 ha. That includes:
-  High forests with natural regeneration                8 645 ha
-  High degraded forests                                   328 ha
-  High forest unsuitable for management                 1 604 ha
-  Forest raisings                                       2 042 ha
-  Scion forests                                        16 455 ha
-  Areas for afforestation                              16 579 ha
-  Areas not suitable for afforestation                 11 819 ha
TOTAL                                         57 372 ha
Timber volume for all forests in the arrangement period (overall mass) is:
- conifer forests 18 m3/ha or totaly  538 300 m3
- deciduous forests 91 m3/ha or totaly 2 636 500 m3
Total:       109 m3/ha or totaly  3 174 800 _M
Anual volume growth increase for all forests is:
- conifer forests 0.60 m3/ha or totaly  17 800 m3
- deciduous forests 3.20 m3/ha or totaly 92 200 m3
Total:        3.80 m3/ha or totaly  110 000 m3
Anual cut plan (etat) for all forests ( overall timber mass) is:
- conifer forests 0,40 m3/ha or totaly  12 953 m3
- deciduous forests 2.20 m3/ha or totaly 62 371 m3
Total:        2.60 m3/ha or totaly  75 324 m
Wood reserves in high forests with natural regeneration are in average 245m3/ha and are relatively low
and beloww normal. That was kept in mind during determination of anual cut volume, so it was foreseen to cut
less in regard to growth increase (with conifers 33% and with deciduous forests 32% less than growth increase.).
That means that with decreased cuts and increased silvicutural works, in FEA, it is planned to
significantly decrease further degradation and improve the conditions of forest ecosystems.
1.2.   Openness of the FEA
In the FEA there are 108 km of constructed forest truck roads, from which 65 km through high forests,
17.0 km through scion forests and 26 km through bare land. Beside that, according to to data from forests
cadastre, there are 80 km of asphalt roads and 100 km of public macadam roads in the area. Openness of high
forest is 7.2 km/1000 ha, and low forests is 6.5 km/1000 ha. Data have been taken form forests cadastre with
situation on 31.12.2000. This openness is very low and does not guaranty successful management neither from
economic or ecological viewpoint.



2
2.0.   IMPACT OF OPENNING OF FORESTS, WITH FOREST TRUCK ROADS,
ON THE ENVIRONMENT
Construction of forest truck roads can have positive and negative impacts on the environment.
Positive impacts are reflected through the following:
-  Utilization of forests can be done equally in the entire area and there is no need for ------ on particular
areas, by which degradation of ecosystems is avoided,
- Protection measures against fires, diseases and natural catastrophes can be promptly and efficiently
carried out,
- Sustainability of management is not endangered,
- Access and realization of all silvicultural works are enabled,
- Access to rural areas and better utilization of agricultural land are enabled,
- Better and more efficient utilization of all natural resources in the area is enabled,
- Access to many landscapes is enabled, in order to use them for recreative, health and sport purposes,
- If there are any historical, natural, archeological or other objects it enables the access to them, as well
as other various scientific, educational, research and other activities.
Opening of forests also has some unwanted consequences, from viewpoint of protection of forests, soil and
water, biodiversities of vegetable and animal world, and others.
During the forest truck road construction and its utilization, greater or smaller damages are done to the
environment. Unprompted and incomplete maintenance of constructed roads can also cause greater or smaller
damages in economic and ecological sense. Intensive damages are especially done on soil, springs and water
currents. The consequence of that is endangerment of the environment.
2.1.   Impact of the road construction on soil
Road construction can have negative impacts on geo-morphological processes, as well as on the
environment, in several ways:
- Productive soil is permanently lost by construction of the road and objects on the road,
- Road construction often brings to increased and speed up soil erosion, and in that way it degrades the
soil with deposits and makes great damage to agricultural soil, water currents, reservoirs, inhabited
places and others,
- On places where the soil is formed on the impermeable surface, and is on the slope, because of the
cutting the road through, land slides can appear especially where underground waters appear,
- Also, large slides appear during rockslides on road cuts and embankments in heavy rain weather,
- Large quantity of water pours on the road, and the damage made by water on the road and on soil under
the road or on water currents etc., depends on the quality of constructed drains and road permeability.
Unfortunately, nowadays we have no concrete data about damages on soil made by forest truck road
construction, and no research has been done regarding that. Also we do not have data about damage on roads
done by bad weather, although we know that they are severe.
2.2.   Impact of the road on geomorphologic processes
Impacts of the road on geomorphologic processes reflects through the following:
- Speeds up the erosion from the road surface,
- Directly influences on to the structure and shape of the furrows,
- Changes the direction of surface flow of water, and changes or lengthens the erosion furrows on
previously untouched part of the area,
- Causes the mutual influence on water, sediments and timber waste, on the place where the road
crosses the brook.



3
2.3.   Impact of the road construction on hydrological processes
Interaction between forest roads and water represents the essence of several key things, which includes the
impact of roads on the environment.
Roads have three primary impacts on hydrological processes:
-  They directly hold (keep) raindrops on the road surface and road cuts, and divert water bellow the
surface, which pours down the slope,
-  They concentrate the flow across the surface or in the near by canals and ditches and
-  They change the water current from the natural direction, by which the water would flow if there was no
road.
Construction of forest truck roads can have negative impacts on springs and water quality. Namely, the
roads enable the increased movement and possibility of usage of different chemicals for protection of forests and
fertilization, in forests. During the road construction heavy machines are used, which spill oil and petroleum, and
later the rain rinse it out to the springs and water currents next to the road. Other materials and waste, that can
be found on the road and around it, can be added to that.
2.4.   Impact of the road construction on biodiversity
Many species, which are forming the biodiversity in certain habitat, have very significant role for ecosystem
and its stability. For stability of an ecosystem, in order to function, it is necessary to be healthy, in order to enable
all species to live and preserve in most optimal conditions.
In the previous chapter we have seen that forest roads with construction and maintenance can endanger
and divide certain habitat. Since there are big disturbances on soil, water and air, there are also changes in
micro climate in the habitat. All those factors can endanger the species that, in the habitat, have optimal
conditions for growth and can cause the occurence of unwanted outer species, and violation and endangerment
of the ecosystem.
2.5.   Impact of the road construction on air
During the construction and utilization of forest roads air becomes polluted, which can affect the narrower
part next to the road. Since the roads are mostly not asphalted, but macadam roads, negative impacts can be
reflected in production of dust, noise and exhaust gases, as well as mining in the construction phase on the
route and in quarries, where the construction material is used from.
2.6.   Impact of the road construction on habitat
Construction and presence of the roads in the productive habitat can have impacts on the productivity.
Construction of the road leads to creation of new marginal habitat in the forest.
The roads are creating a corridor for birds and animals from the forest edge, so that they can go deeper into
the part of the forest, which were previously closed with continuous forest cover. Diversity can expand on that
location with species inhabiting the edge of the forest. Road construction and maintenance inside the forest
represent disturbances, which create new marginal habitat. Roads can be first entrance places for outer species
in new area and it can serve as a corridor further expansion of outer plants. Settling of new species can
endanger the existing biological ecosystems and their structure.
2.7.  Socio-economic impacts of the road construction
These impacts can be direct and indirect. Direct socio-economic impacts include employment of the
population on felling and production of wood assortments, export of wood assortments, employment on growing
and protection of forests, collection of secondary forest products (medicinal herbs, aromatic herbs, different
forest seeds and fruits, mushrooms, snails and other). These are restorable natural resources. This can be
significant source of income for local residents. Construction of roads has direct influence on reduction of export
costs for these assortments and enables faster movement.



4
Indirect socio-economic factors include the role of roads in prevention of forest fires. Constructed roads
enable faster approach (access) and prompt intervention in case of forest fires. Roads also act as the obstacle to
fire expansion and as the line for free and successful intervention of firemen.
Among benefits of the roads we can include researches, inventory and observation in forest. Roads also
provide access to private property and in that way provide better economic utilization of those areas.
Roads also have many non-commercial values, which cannot be measured. Those are access to
landscapes, access to hunting, observation of vegetation and animal world, visits and observation of different
architectural, cultural and historical values.

3.2.   Purpose of the road construction
Main purpose of construction of this road is opening of management unit "Bjelasica Ded", section which
belongs to SFE "Botin" - Nevesinje, due to utilization of existing timber mass and other forest products.
Residents of local villages will use the road for better access to mountain pastures.
The road will enable easier carrying out of silvicultural works and protection of forests especially against
fires, which are very certain taking in consideration ecological conditions.



5
3.3.  Usage of soil
Access to the first part of the route is from village road, which is partly asphalted on the town exit. This road
starts from village Sipasno (150m above school) and goes over sections 136 (bare land and scion forests),
section 137 (bare land and scion forests), section 131 (bare land and forest of beech and fir), section 130 (bare
land and forest of beech and fir) and comes to the boundary of sections 129/130.
Entire length of the road goes over state owned land and there are no problems regarding property.
3.4.  Review (summary) of alternatives
Entire terrain of this management unit is stony with karst depressions, so the planner has taken care of in
order to come to high forests of beech and fir with lowest construction costs, guided by allowed gradient.
He especially tried to surmount karst depressions, steep slopes and hollows, with shortest distance and
lower construction costs.
From ecological viewpoint, considering rough karst terrain, disregarding the alternative variants, they are
similar if we analyze them from aspect of hindering of road construction.
4.0. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EXISTING SITUATION OF MANAGEMENT UNIT
"BJELASICA- BED" AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Forest truck road "Sipasno - Zlatac - Lokve" section I should open management unit "Bjelasica - Ded",
part that belongs to SFE "Botin" - Nevesinje. This part should open following sections: 125, 128 to 143.
4.1.   Climatic conditions
Average annual temperature is 8.9 C. Average temperature for vegetative period is 14.5 C. Total
quantity of precipitation, in average per year is 1771 mm, from which in vegetative period is 621 or 35%.
Vegetative period lasts 173 days. In this area climate is temperate - continental and Mediterranean. Because of
that influence of continental climate is stronger in northern expositions of higher terrain, and Mediterranean on
southern expositions and in areas closer to Adriatc Sea.
4.2.   Location and relief of terrain
Area of management unit "Bjelasica - Eed" is located 30 km east form Nevesinje, between fields Gatcko
and Nevesinjsko. Hight above see level is between 1200 and 1867m (peak of Velika Bjelasica).
This area, in orographic sense, represents clear mountain area. It is a karst area where karst cracks are
distinct. On lower terrain there is a small number of depressions, and larger number on higher terrain.
4.3.   Geological and pedological characteristics
Dominant geological base in the area, through which the planned route is passing, is made of solid
limestone. Solid limestone is characterized with small insoluble remainders, high karstification, with all kart
elements, depressions, stones, slopes, large rocks and holes.
In this area, depending from relief and influence of erosion of soils mostly on solid limestone, following
are formed: limestone stones or litosol, organic-mineral fertile soil (kalkomelanosol), brown soil (kalkokambisol),
as well as luvisol. More shallow soil are disposed on slopes, while on flat surfaces and depressions deeper soil
is formed. Those are mostly mosaically formed soils, on which their mechanical, chemical conditions and
productive possibilities depend. Most un-productive ones are litosol and kalkomelanocol while, kalkokambisol
and luvisol because of their depth and better water order have increased productive value. Shaloow and poor
soils are rich with humus and have neutral reactions, while deeper soils are more sour and poor with humus.
First and second ones are poorly supplied with nitrogen and phosphorus, while medially with potassium.

4.4.   Vegetation characteristics and biodiversity
Planned route passes through karst areas. On the starting point orf the route there are scion and
degraded forests of beech and complexes of mixed forests of bech and fir (Abieti - Fagetum illyrum, Horv.), and
several sub-associations apper there. Main species in these forest are: Beech, fir, maple, elm, European ash
and others. Most ffien shrubs are: Rhamnus fallax, Sambucus nigra, Lonicera xylosteum, and lower flora:
Elymus europaeus, Asperula odorata, Asarum europaeum, Nephrodium filix mas, Euphorbia amygdaloides,
Melica nutans, Peris quadrifolia, Galeobdolon luteum and others.
According to acquired data, following game can be found on this and broader area:
a) Basic game
Roedeer (Capreolus capreolus), bear (Ursus arctus), hare (Lepus europaeus), gray partridge (Perdix perdix).
b) Permanently protected game
Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), weasel (Mustela sp), otter (Lutra lutra), hawk (Accipitridae), falcon (Falconaceae),
raven (Corvus corax) and owls (Strigidae).
c) Game protected with closed season
Mallard (Anas sp.) and hazel hen (Tetrastes bonasia).
4.5.   Hydrological characteristics
Mountains in this area including Bjelasica, because of intensive presence of limestone, are mostly
waterless. However, in fields of Nevesinjsko and Gatacko
4.6.   Air pollution
There are no data about air pollution on mountain Bjelasica and broader area. Only possible polluter
could be steam power plant Gacko, which is located east of this area, but there are also no data about that.
4.7.   Conditions of forests gravitating on the road
Following sections of the management unit "Bjelasica - Ded" are gravitating on the road "Sipasno -
Zlatac - Lokve": 125, 128 to 143.
-  High forests with natural regeneration                438.7 ha or 22.3 %
-  Scion forests                                          143.3 ha or 7.3 %
-  Surfaces incapable for afforestation                  1 388.8 ha or 70.4 %
TOTAL                                    1 970.8 ha or 100%
Timber volume for all forests in arrangement period (overall mass) is:
- conifers    93 m3/ha or totaly  54 144 m3
- deciduous  147.6 m3/ha or totaly  85 853 m3
Total:       240.6 m3/ha or totaly  139 977 m3
Annual growth increase volume for all forests is:



7
- conifers    2.18 m3/ha or totaly  1 268 m3
- deciduous   2.60 m3/ha or totaly  1 517 m3
Total:        4.78 m3/ha or totaly  2 785 m3
Annual cut plan (etat) for all forests is (overall timber mass):
- conifers    1.71 m3/ha or totaly  996 m3
- deciduous   2.87 m3/ha or totaly  1 674 m3
Total:        4.58 m3/ha or totaly  2 670 m3
Total timber reserves per ha is satisfactory taking the terrain conditions into consideration (large part of
the area is karst, which has low productive possibilities. With terrain inspection it can be concluded that the
timber mass is too old and the t it has poor qualita, especially beech. Low reserves of timber mass of scion
forests are the result of very bad terrain conditions and anthropogenic influence, because below these forests
there are villages whose residents are using these forests for pasture and providing the wood.
Bare land is not suitable for afforestation, since it is distinctive karts created by erosion and man. Growth
increase is low because of terrain conditions. Planned cut volume is somewhat lower than growth increase. This
is the result of stan conditions, because the stands of beech are to old and have poor quality, and were still not
utilized.
4.8.   Opennes of the management unit
Management unit "Bjelasica - Ded"- part that belongs to Nevesinje, has not been open with truck roads,
so this is the first road to be constructed in this area.
5.0.  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT EFFECTS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
Planned road in the area of "Bjelasica - Ded" has a great significance for forest management in the
area. Positive effects are expected in ecological and economic sense, taking into consideration that no
silvicultural and protection measures could not been carried out because of unopenness, and the area and
forests were left to spontaneous development for a long period of time.
5.1.   Positive effects
The most important effect of the road construction is reflected through the fact that the area gravitating to
the road will open and enable carrying out of exploitation works, silvicultural and protection works in the area.
Construction of the road opens the possibility of employment of local residents on construction and
maintenance of roads, silvicultural works, protection and exploitation of forests, and utilization of secondary
forest products and other. Residents would be able to use the road for better access to mountain pastures.
Mountain landscapes would be more accessible to visitors.
By opening this area, the exploitation surface will increase, so the pressure on the opened part of the
area will decrease, and with that more equal management of forests and other resources in broader area will be
enabled.
5.2.   Negative effects
Considering that this is the karst area, significant negative impacts on the environment are not expected
during construction. The soil in lower part of the route is almost completely un-productive. In the entire area there
are no permanent springs except few periodical ones, and there are no water currents. Occurrence of slides is
not expected during and after construction. Only negative possibility is change of water flows in big cuts and side
cuts in the period of heavy rainfalls, and occurrence of erosion, which would contribute the rinsing out of small
quantities of poor soil. Considering the great permeability of karst terrain great negative consequences are also
not expected.



8
During construction and utilization soil can be partly polluted with oil and petroleum spilling. During
construction and later utilization noise can appear because of machine works and mining, which can have
negative impacts on game.
Construction of the road in the area of high forests can increase the intensity of light next to the route, as
well as the expansion of heliofits and some outer species. It changes the ecosystem in narrower area.
Often occurrence of strong and hurricane winds in the area can cause damages on trees next to the
road, as well as during exploitation of forests if felling is intense.
Road will enable more intensive movement of people and that means increased danger of fires, which
would have far more intensive negative consequences. Poor vegetation would be destroyed and also possibility
of its regeneration. With opening of the area there is a possibility of illegal hunting, illegal felling and utilization of
other resources.
There is not going to be any significant air pollution except exhaust gases in the construction phase and
utilization of the road, because of mining and dust on the road. There are no recreative, health or sports objects,
cultural and historical heritage in the area, so in that sense road construction will not have any major impacts.
6.0.  ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (ACTIVITIES)
Taking in consideration all above mentioned impacts of construction of forest truck road "Sipasno -
Zlatac - Lokve" on the environment, it is necessary to undertake certain protection measures in order to, if not
avoid, than reduce to acceptable the negative consequences. Protection measures should include not only road
construction but also everything that precedes it and comes after it (utilization of the road).
Taking the previous remarks into consideration, as well as acquired data, protection measures can be
systematized in several groups:
-  Protection measures in preparatory phase of construction
-  Protection measures during road construction
-  Protection measures during utilization of the road
6.1.   Protection measures in preparatory phase of construction
In order to achieve better effects on protection of the environment during road construction, more exactly
opening of forest complexes, it is necessary that from the beginning and selection of the most appropriate
variant of the road, the most appropriate variant is determined during construction, from the aspect of negative
and positive effects on the environment. After that the best variant would be selected, which would have lowest
negative impacts on the environment. The following should be undertaken:
-  All proposed measures have to be applied during construction and utilization of the road
-  Since this is the project elaborated before the war it is necessary to renovate the route
6.2.   Protection measures during road construction
During construction it is necessary to:
-  Remove all stumps, trees, humus in order to avoid their covering on the road
-  During excavation of soil form side cuts and cuts, use the part of material for embankments and slopes,
and surplus should be deposited on certain places and protect it from moving in the brook during heavy
rainfalls
-  All operations with petroleum and oil exchange, during construction, should be done on places specified
for that with maximum protection measures
-  Oil and petroleum packages need to be collected and taken to controlled deposits. That applies for old
tires and broken parts of the machines and other waste on the site
-  During mining, take care of reducing the damage on trees and soil to minimum



9
- Machines should be parked on particular places determined for that, with maximum protection measures
against pollution of soil with oil, petroleum and products
- Since borrows for material were not defined in the project, the investor needs, before the works start, to
determine the places and way of arrangement after the works are completed
- During embankment construction, bearing capacity of the ground should be priory defined. Material
which is built in the embankment need to have appropriate geo-mechanical quality. Compaction should
be done in 20 to 30 cm layers, and crossfall for subgrade must be foreseen, so the water does not retain
- If it is estimated during construction, that additional culvert should be built in the investor would give
order through the supervisor to do so.
6.3.   Protection measures during utilization of the road
Considering the consequences on the environment and damages that can appear during the utilization
of the road, it is necessary to:
-  To equip the constructed road with vertical and horizontal signs, which should include all kind of
necessary information and prohibitory signs
-  Regarding protection of game it is necessary to set the appropriate warning signs for caution
-  It is necessary to place signs which forbid setting of fires, with additional information
-  On noticeable places, information boards which forbid depositing of garbage, should be placed
-  Carry out regular maintenance, especially of culverts and drainage ditches, in order to prevent blockage
and damages to road, soil and water currents
-  In case of rockslide in cuts, side cuts and embankments, it is necessary to intervene promptly in order to
decrease the possibility of severe
-  SFE should introduce monitoring of all kind of damages on the road, and ecological and economic
consequences caused by construction
7.0.  CONCLUSION
Openness of FEA "Nevesinjsko" with roads is very low and for high forests is 7.2 km / 1000 ha, and in
low forests is 6.5km/l1000ha, including public roads. Low openness has negative impacts on sustainable
management, and also on business economy and environment.
Road "Sipasno - Zlatac - Likve" is the first road that opens the area of management unit "Bjelasica -
Ded", and that makes it more significant. The construction will contribute to more sustainable management and
better business economy.
Taking into consideration the terrain conditions, significant negative impacts on the environment are not
expected. Negative impacts can be expected in smaller scope on soil and biodiversity. Those are minor impacts
in regard to benefits obtained with construction in ecological and economic sense.

INTRODUCTION
Opennes of forests in Republic of Srpska, before the war, has been very low (about 7 km/I000 ha), and
up to last ten years, because of the war and very difficult financial conditions after the war new roads were not
constructed, so the current openness remained as it was ten years ago. Previously constructed roads, because
they were not maintained during and after the war, are exposed to further collapse, and one part became hardly
passable or impassable for heavy trucks with big loads.
Insufficient openness not only influences the forest exploitation economy but also negatively reflects on
the environment. Namely, because of the insufficient openness of forest areas annual cut cannot be equally
realized on the entire area, but very often, during the silvicultural rotation, the same area is entered several times
or over exaggerated felling is carried out on the open area. That negatively reflects on the sustainability of forest
management and endangers particular forest ecosystems. In the unopened area prompt carrying out of
protection measures against fires, herbal diseases and natural catastrophes are disabled.
PFE of Republic of Srpska 'Srpske Sume" proposed that, among others, construction of forest truck road
"Livade - Bad" section 11, 6 315 m long, in the area of SFE "Maglic" - Srbinje should also be included. "Silva" -
Insitute for research and planning in forestry, Sarajevo elaborated a project for this road in 1988.
Data for Study elaboration were acquired by visiting the route, and during that we have used the project.
After that we have collected data from the SFE, from forest management plan, as well as from forest cadastre for
FEA "Teslicko".
Goal of the Study is to point to all relevant facts, which could have negative impact on the environment
during construction and utilization of the road, as well as to suggest the measures for possible elimination of
negative effects.
It is necessary to emphasize that these studies are the first of this kind, which are elaborated for forest
truck roads, and that authors had problems with lack of necessary data, as well as lack of any research in this
field (branch) in the previous period in the area. Second problem was lack of law scale of norms for the field of
forest road construction, especially regarding protection of the environment.



2
1.0.   CONDITIONS OF FORESTS AND FOREST LAND IN SFE "BORJA" - TESLIC
SFE "Maglic" - Srbinje works within PFE "Srpske Sume" and manages FEA "Srbinjsko". This area
includes forests and forestland in the area of municipality Srbinje (97.8 %), and smaller part of the area belongs
to municipality Cajnice (2.2 %).
Forest management plan for this area was valid from 01.01.1990 to 31.12.1999. Now new management
plan is in the elaboration phase.
1.1.   Basic survey indexes
According to tables review given in the Study it can be seen that FEA "Srbinjsko" includes forests and
forestland in the area of 55 200 ha. That includes:
-  High forests with natural regeneration                21 565 ha
-  High degraded forests                                  7 210 ha
-  High forests not suitable for management               2 333 ha
-  Forest raisings                                        3 654 ha
-  Scion forests for management                          10 738 ha
-  Scion forests not suitable for management              2 702 ha
-  Areas for afforestation                                2 304 ha
-  Areas not suitable for afforestation                   4 694 ha
TOTAL                                          55 200 ha
Timber volume for all forests in the arrangement period (overall mass) is:
- conifer      96 m3/ha or totaly  4 315 500 m3 38%
- deciduous    156 m3/ha or totalv  7 045 000 m3 62%
Total:        252 m 3/ha or totaly  11 360 500 m3 100%
Anual volume growth increase for all forests is:
- conifer     3.2 m3/ha or totaly  138 500 m3 43%
- deciduous   4.2 m3/ha or totalv  180 900 m3  57%
Total:        7.4 m3/ha or totaly  319 400 m3 1 00%
Anual cut plan (etat) for all forests ( overall timber mass) is:
- conifer    2.3 m3/ha or totaly  93 560 m3 45%
- deciduous  2.8 m3/ha or totaly  113 710 m3 55%
Total:       5.1 m3/ha or totaly  207 270 m3 100%
Annual cut volume is determined realistically considering ecological factors and growth increase. So the
annual cut volume in high forests with natural regeneration is 83% from growth increse (for conifer 72% and for
deciduous 103%), and in high degraded forests under 50% of growth increase. In scion forests for management
only 26%, etc.
That means that with decreased cuts and increased silvicutural works, in FEA, it is planned to
significantly decrease further degradation in all categories and improve the conditions of forest ecosystems.
1.2.   Openness of the FEA
In the FEA there are 312.3 km of constructed forest truck roads, as well as 35.5 km of asphalt roads and
19 km of public macadam roads, which directly open high and scion forests.



3
Openness of high forest is 8.9 km/1000 ha, and of scion forests is 4.3 km/1000 ha. That is somewhat
better then with other SFE's, but far under optimal openness. Because of that, costs for exploitation of forest are
high, which significantly decreases business economy.
2.0.   IMPACT OF OPENNING OF FORESTS, WITH FOREST TRUCK ROADS,
ON THE ENVIRONMENT
Construction of forest truck roads can have positive and negative impacts on the environment.
Positive impacts are reflected through the following:
-  Utilization of forests can be done equally in the entire area and there is no need for over exaggerated
felling on particular areas, by which degradation of ecosystems is avoided,
-  Protection measures against fires, diseases and natural catastrophes can be promptly and efficiently
carried out,
-  Sustainability of management is not endangered,
-  Access and realization of all silvicultural works are enabled,
-  Access to rural areas and better utilization of agricultural land are enabled,
-  Better and more efficient utilization of all natural resources in the area is enabled,
-  Access to many landscapes is enabled, in order to use them for recreative, health and sport purposes,
-  If there are any historical, natural, archeological or other objects it enables the access to them, as well
as other various scientific, educational, research and other activities.
Opening of forests also has some unwanted consequences, from viewpoint of protection of forests, soil and
water, biodiversities of vegetative and animal world, and others.
During the forest truck road construction and its utilization, greater or smaller damages are done to the
environment. Unprompted and incomplete maintenance of constructed roads can also cause greater or smaller
damages in economic and ecological sense. Intensive damages are especially done on soil, springs and water
currents. The consequence of that is endangerment of the environment.
2.1.   Impact of the road construction on soil
Road construction can have negative impacts on geo-morphological processes, as well as on the
environment, in several ways:
-  Productive soil is permanently lost by construction of the road and objects on the road,
-  Road construction often brings to increased and speed up soil erosion, and in that way it degrades the
soil with deposits and makes great damage to agricultural soil, water currents, reservoirs, inhabited
places and others,
-  On places where the soil is formed on the impermeable surface, and is on the slope, because of the
cutting the road through, land slides can appear especially where underground waters appear,
-  Also, large slides appear during rockslides on road cuts and embankments in heavy rainfalls,
-  Large quantity of water pours on the road, and the damage made by water on the road and on soil under
the road or on water currents etc., depends on the quality of constructed drains and road permeability.
Unfortunately, nowadays we have no concrete data about damages on soil made by forest truck road
construction, and no research has been done regarding that. Also we do not have data about damage on roads
done by bad weather, although we know that they are severe.
2.2.   Impact of the road on geomorphologic processes
Impacts of the road on geomorphologic processes reflects through the following:
-  Speeds up the erosion from the road surface,
-  Directly influences on to the structure and shape of the furrows,



4
- Changes the direction of surface flow of water, and changes or lengthens the erosion furrows on
previously untouched part of the area,
- Causes the mutual influence on water, sediments and timber waste, on the place where the road
crosses the brook.
2.3.   Impact of the road construction on hydrological processes
Interaction between forest roads and water represents the essence of several key things, which includes the
impact of roads on the environment.
Roads have three primary impacts on hydrological processes:
-  They directly hold (keep) raindrops on the road surface and road cuts, and divert water bellow the
surface, which pours down the slope,
-  They concentrate the flow across the surface or in the near by canals and ditches and
-  They change the water current from the natural direction, by which the water would flow if there were no
road.
Construction of forest truck roads can have negative impacts on springs and water quality. Namely, the
roads enable the increased movement and possibility of usage of different chemicals for protection of forests and
fertilization, in forests.
During the road construction heavy machines are used, which spill oil and petroleum, and later the rain rinse
it out to the springs and water currents next to the road. Other materials and waste, that can be found on the
road and around it, can be added to that.
2.4.   Impact of the road construction on biodiversity
Many species, which are forming the biodiversity in certain habitat, have very significant role for ecosystem
and its stability. For stability of an ecosystem, in order to function, it is necessary to be healthy, in order to enable
all species to live and preserve in most optimal conditions.
In the previous chapter we have seen that forest roads with construction and maintenance can endanger
and divide certain habitat. Since there are big disturbances on soil, water and air, there are also changes in
micro climate in the habitat.
All those factors can endanger the species that, in the habitat, have optimal conditions for growth and can
cause the occurence of unwanted outer species, and violation and endangerment of the ecosystem.
2.5.   Impact of the road construction on air
During the construction and utilization of forest roads air becomes polluted, which can affect the narrower
part next to the road. Since the roads are mostly not asphalted, but macadam roads, negative impacts can be
reflected in production of dust, noise and exhaust gases, as well as mining in the construction phase on the
route and in quarries, where the construction material is used from.
2.6.   Impact of the road construction on habitat
Construction and presence of the roads in the productive habitat can have impacts on the productivity.
Construction of the road leads to creation of new marginal habitat in the forest.
The roads are creating a corridor for birds and animals from the forest edge, so that they can go deeper into
the part of the forest, which were previously closed with continuous forest cover. Diversity can expand on that
location with species inhabiting the edge of the forest. Road construction and maintenance inside the forest
represent disturbances, which create new marginal habitat. Roads can be first entrance places for outer species
in new area and it can serve as a corridor further expansion of outer plants. Settling of new species can
endanger the existing biological ecosystems and their structure.

2.7.  Socio-economic impacts of the road construction
These impacts can be direct and indirect. Direct socio-economic impacts include employment of the
population on felling and production of wood assortments, export of wood assortments, employment on growing
and protection of forests, collection of secondary forest products (medicinal herbs, aromatic herbs, different
forest seeds and fruits, mushrooms, snails and other). These are restorable natural resources. This can be
significant source of income for local residents. Construction of roads has direct influence on reduction of export
costs for these assortments and enables faster movement.
Indirect socio-economic factors include the role of roads in prevention of forest fires. Constructed roads
enable faster approach (access) and prompt intervention in case of forest fires. Roads also act as the obstacle to
fire expansion and as the line for free and successful intervention of firemen.
Among benefits of the roads we can include researches, inventory and observation in forest. Roads also
provide access to private property and in that way provide better economic utilization of those areas.
Roads also have many non-commercial values, which cannot be measured. Those are access to
landscapes, access to hunting, observation of vegetation and animal world, visits and observation of different
architectural, cultural and historical values.

3.2.   Purpose of the road construction
Main purpose for road "Livade - Bac"-section II construction is opening of basin of "Prevlacki potok" to
which sections 6 to 10 are gravitating, in management unit "Slatina". Opening of this basin would enable
exploitation of forests in gravitating sections and protection of foreseen forests in these sections, according to
forest management plan. Also utilization of other resources from the area is enabled.
3.3.  Usage of soil
The route is planned to go over state owned land, only small part of it goes over private property. For part
that goes over private property, property status has been solved earlier.
Part of the route has been done, with the fact that it deviates from the project in the starting point of the
route. One large slope occurred there, and technical solution must be found for that in order to be repaired, or
the route should deviate and would be constructed below the slope. Height level would be attained with
serpentine so that the route can fit into already cut through route in the extension. Since the project has been
elaborated earlier, marks of the route have been destroyed, so it should be renovated before the works start.
3.4.   Review (summary) of alternatives
For opening of management units "Josanica" and "Slatina" firm "Silva" from Sarajevo has elaborated the
Study for opening of this area in 1988. According to decision from the Study, this road has been planned in basin
of "Prevrtacki potok".
4.0. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EXISTING SITUATION OF BASIN "MALA INOVA"
AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Road "Livade - Bac" - section 11 opens the area of basin "Prevrtacki potok", that is sections 6 to 10 in
management unit "Slatina", more exactly left side of this basin. Right side of the basin is inhabited and mainly
private property with small areas of state owned forests are on the right side. There are already built village
roads on the right side of the basin.
4.1.   Climatic conditions
In broader area of Srbinje we can see two climate zones or types of climate:
-  Valley climate
-  Mountain climate
Valley climate includes riverbeds of Drina with tributaries Sutjeska, Cehotina, Bistrica and Kolomska.
Mountain type includes higher areas up to 1 500m above sea level. Basin of "Prevracki potok", which
empties into Cehotina on the entrance into Srbinje, belongs to valley climate type and data from
meteorological station in Srbinje are the most authoritative for it. The station is located on 395m above sea
level and on latitude of 43 30".
Average annual temperature is 10.8 C and annual quantity of precipitation is 975 mm.



7
Vegetation period lasts for 191 days, and average relative air humidity (moisture) is 83%. This area is under
influence of moderate - continental climate, with the fact that in the valleys there is rarely influence of
Mediterranean climate.
4.2.   Location and relief of terrain
Starting point of the area of this basin is in Srbinje, more exactly from the place where "Prevracki potok"
empties into Oehotina and goes in northeast direction. Prevracki potok is created from Duboki potok (deep
brook) and Kaldrmski potok, and on his way there are few permanent and periodical little brooks from left and
right side. There are steep slopes on the right and left side, which are intersected with mentioned brooks. Height
is from 400m to 1110 m above sea level.
4.3.   Geological and pedological characteristics
According to pedological map for management unit Slatina, on the entire area of the basin, there is sour
brown soil (distric kambisol) on alternating series of shale and sandy soil. It is the most spread type of soil in
entire FEA "Srbinjsko" and it is located on different silicate substratum.
In the area of basin "Prevracki potok", varieties on softer surface have more appropriate characteristics.
In horizon "A" there is mainly sandy loam, and in horizon "B" mainly loam and sandy-clay loam. Those are soar
soils rich with humus, and degree of saturation with bases is low. Presence of physiologically active phosphorus
is medium, and of potassium and nitrogen is good.
From productive - ecological aspect, these soils belong to productive and soils suitable for forest growing. With
appropriate silvicultural and protection measures these degraded forests can be converted in productive forest
ecosystems.
4.4.   Vegetation characteristics and biodiversity
In this basin, more exactly in sections from 6 to 10 of management unit "Slatina", according to
typological map, high-degraded hill forests are mostly present on deep soar brown soil.
The trees include beech, hornbeam, oak, aspen and birch. Low flora includes: Lactuca muralis, Lamium
luteum, Festuca Montana, Lusula nemorosa, Oxalis acetosella, Anemone nemorosa, Geranium robertianum,
Veronica latifolia, Pteridium aqiinum, Vaccinium myrtillus, Nephrodium fillix mass, Sambucus racemosa, Daphne
mesereum.
Since those are productive habitats, these forests should be converted into more valuable types by
including conifers, and on mezophilic habitats retain beech and purebred deciduous forests.
Other types of vegetation in this area are scion beech forests on deep soar soils and scion oak forests
on deep soar soils. In scion oak forests there are oak, hornbeam, beech, cerris, maple and birch. There are
shrubs: Vaccinium myrtillus, Calluna vulgaris, Lusula nemorosa, Veronica chamaedris, Galium cruciatum,
Potentila erecta, Dorocinium herbaceum, Pteridium aquilinum, Melanopirum pratense, Hieracium murorum,
Ligustrum vulgare, Corilus avelana, Crataegus monogyna and other.
These forests also should be converted into higher growing type, with the fact that beech, oak and
hornbeam and other deciduous trees with successful development would be retained. On more kseroterm soils
white pine should be included.
Data about vegetative communities are entered according to typological map for this area and map
legend for FEA "Gornje - Drinsko".
According to acquired data, following game can be found on this and broader area:
a) Basic game
Roedeer (Capreolus capreolus), bear (Ursus arctus), hare (Lepus europaeus), gray partridge (Perdix perdix).
b) Permanently protected game



8
Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), weasel (Mustela sp), otter (Lutra lutra), hawk (Accipitridae), falcon (Falconaceae),
raven (Corvus corax) and owls (Strigidae).
c) Game protected with closed season
Mallard (Anas sp.) and hazel hen (Tetrastes bonasia).
d) Unprotected
Wild boar (Sus scropha), wolf (Canis lupus), fox (Vulpes vulpes), wildcat (Felis silvestris), pine marten (Martes
martes) , stone marten (Martes fiona), badger (Meles meles) and polecat (Putarius putarius).
4.5.   Hydrological characteristics
This basin, in hydrological sense, can be treated as rich, as well as broader area. Prevracki potok gives
the area basic feature. From the left and right side several brooks empty into Prevracki potok. Some of those
brooks are permanent (Duboki and kaldrmski, and Trnovacki and Osojski), while others are periodical, they
appear during heavy precipitation especially in winter and spring. Right side of the brook is more inhabited, and
there you can find settlements: Zlatari, Gornji Prevra6 i Donji Prevrac.
Left side is not inhabited and is covered with forest vegetation. Planned road passes from the starting
point to the end of the basin and goes from the southeast side of the brook, one with forests. The route is mostly
above the brook, so it's construction should not endanger the brook. On smaller steep part there is a possibility
of partial covering of brook during the road's cutting through, as well as on the beginning of the route where the
road is foreseen to go next to the brook.
Brooks that empty from the left side intersect the road, so the longitudinal and transverse drainage have
to be carried out according to the project, and appropriate culverts placed. Because of hydrological, pedological
and geological features of this basin there is a possibility of erosion and slopes, and it should be taken into
consideration during construction. There is a special problem with steep terrain, where the geological base is
made of horizontal layers of shale.
4.6.   Air pollution
There are no data, on local or broader level, about ait pollution in the basin.
4.7.   Conditions of forests in the area of basin "Prevrtacki potok"
Basin of "Prevrtacki potok" includes sections from 6 - 10 in management unit "Slatina". Structure of the
areas:
-  High degraded forests                                  264.5 ha or 72 %
-  Scion forests                                           91.4 ha or 24.9 %
-  Bare land and shrubberies for afforestation              7.8 ha or 2.1 %
-  Unproductive areas                                       3.6 ha or 1 %
TOTAL                                     367.3 ha or 100%
Timber volume for all forests in arrangement period (overall mass) is:
- High degraded forests  deciduous 259.3 m3/ha or totaly 68 589 m3 82%
- Scon forests           deciduous  162 m3/ha or totaly  14 809 m3- 18%
Total:                   deciduous 234.3 m3/ha or totaly 83 398 m3 - 100%



9
Average annual growth increase volume for all forests is:
- High degraded forests  deciduous 7.2 m3/ha or totaly  1 896 m3 - 79%
- Scon forests           deciduous  5.4 m3/ha or totaly  497 m3- 21%
Total:                   deciduous 6.7 m3/ha or totaly  2 393 m3 - 100%
Annual cut plan (etat) for all forests is (overall timber mass):
- High degraded forests  deciduous 3.4 m3/ha or totaly  914 m3 -88%
- Scon forests           deciduous  1.4 m3/ha or totaly  127 m3 12%
Total:                  deciduous 2.9 m3/ha or totaly  1 041 m3 - 100%
According to previous tables it can be seen that, in this basin, there are only high degraded forests and
scion forests, and exclusively deciduous ones.
Although these are high degreded forests and scion forests, according to conditions of timber reserves
and growth increase, it can be concluded that they belong to more qualitative forest in this classes of forests.
Average reserves of 259.3 m3/ha in high and 162m3 in scion forests, as well as growth increase of 7.7 m3/ha for
high and 5.4 m3/ha for scion forests, shows that those are productive soil. That imposes a need of urgent
conversion of these forests, with different land-reclamation and silvicultural activities, into more productive
forests. This fact, besides utilization of timber mass, favours the opening of this basin.
Annual cut volume for high degraded forests is 47% and for scion forests 26% from annual growth
increase, and according to that significant improvement of existing conditions is expected.
4.8.   Opennes of the basin
Area foreseen for utilization and silvicultural works, sections from 6 to 10, were not open until now. There
are built village roads in the basin, but because of terrain relief and long distance they cannot be used for
skidding of wood assortments from mentioned sections.
5.0. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT EFFECTS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
Planned road in the basin of Mala Inova has a great significance for forest management in the area.
Beside positive effects in ecological and economic sense, if full attention is not payed during construction and
utilization of the road, as well as during the exploitation of forests in the area, there could be negative
consequences especially ecological ones.
5.1.   Positive effects
The most important effect of the road construction is reflected through the fact that the basin will open
and enable carrying out of exploitation works, silvicultural and protection works in the area. Considering the
conditions of forests in which they are now, emergency interventions are requested in order to stop further
degradation and to improve the conditions. It is foreseen with forest management plan that existing conditions of
forests, with land-reclamation and silvicultural activities, should be converted into more productive and
ecologicaly more stable forest ecosystems.
There is a possibility of employment of local residents on construction and maintenance of roads,
silvicultural works, protection and exploitation of forests, and utilization of secondary forest products and other.
Also there is a possibility of utilization of this exciting landscape for recreation.



10
By opening of broader area, pressure on the forests that are already open will be decreased. That opens
the possibility for equal management of forests and other resources.
5.2.   Negative effects
Major undesirable consequences are expected on soil and hydrological conditions in the area, especially
during the road construction and exploitation of forests.
By constructing the road there is increased possibility of slides and erosion appearance, especially on
steep terrains, cuts, side cuts and embankments.
It is necessary to mention that danger of slides is big because of features of geological surface and soil, as well
as terrain relief.
Former water currents are intersected and new ones are formed. Water can be polluted with oil spilling
form machines on the site, as well as by throwing the different garbage on the site and next to the route.
On smaller surface on the road, vegetation communities can change because the intensity of light is
increased with road construction and with that expansion of heliofits, as well as some outer species. The road
significantly endangers the game, because of noise created by vehicles. Machines for constructions and mining
also create noise. There are also many cases of game being hit with vehicles on roads with intensive traffic.
Increased noise is expected during construction of the road and exploitation of forests. There is not
going to be any direct significant air pollution except exhaust gases in the construction phase and utilization of
the road, because of mining and dust on the road. Road will enable more intensive movement of people and
vehicles, and that means increased danger for fires, illegal hunting, illegal felling, illegal utilization of medicinal
herbs, mushrooms, forest fruits, snails and others.
There are no recreative, health or sports objects, cultural and historical heritage in the area, so in that
sense road construction will not have any major impacts.
6.0.   ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (ACTIVITIES)
Taking in consideration all above mentioned impacts of construction of forest truck road "Livade - Bac"
on the environment, it is necessary to undertake certain protection measures in order to, if not avoid, than
reduce to acceptable the negative consequences. Protection measures should include not only road construction
but also everything that precedes it and comes after it (utilization of the road).
Taking the previous remarks into consideration, as well as acquired data, protection measures can be
systematized in several groups:
-  Protection measures in preparatory phase of construction
-  Protection measures during road construction
-  Protection measures during utilization of the road
6.1.   Protection measures in preparatory phase of construction
In order to achieve better effects on protection of the environment during road construction, more exactly
opening of forest complexes, it is necessary that from the beginning and selection of the most appropriate
variant of the road, the most appropriate variant is determined during construction, from the aspect of negative
and positive effects on the environment. After that the best variant would be selected, which would have lowest
negative impacts on the environment. The following should be undertaken:
-  All proposed measures have to be built in the project, or kept in mind while signing the contract with
contractor
-  Since this is the project elaborated before the war it is necessary to renovate the route
-  Property relations need to be solved, if there are any
-  Agree with contractor the rehabilitation of slides, which are not included in the project



11
6.2.   Protection measures during road construction
During construction it is necessary to:
Remove all stumps, trees, humus in order to avoid their covering on the road or in the brook, and to use
humus for covering the slopes
During excavation of soil form side cuts and cuts, use the part of material for embankments and slopes,
and surplus should be deposited on certain places and protect it from moving in the brook during heavy
rainfalls
All operations with petroleum and oil exchange, during construction, should be done on places specified
for that with maximum protection measures
Oil and petroleum packages need to be collected and taken to controlled deposits. That applies for old
tires and broken parts of the machines and other waste on the site
During mining, take care of reducing the damage on trees and soil to minimum
Machines should be parked on particular places determined for that, with maximum protection measures
against pollution of soil with oil, petroleum and products
Since borrows for material were not defined in the project, the investor needs, before the works start, to
determine the places and way of arrangement after the works are completed
During embankment construction, bearing capacity of the ground should be priory defined. Material,
which is built in the embankment need to have appropriate geo-mechanical quality. Compaction should
be done in 20 to 30 cm layers, and crossfall for subgrade must be foreseen, so the water does not retain
Check if the planned profiles of culverts will satisfy the needs or they should be replaced with bigger
Special attention should be paid to transverse and longitudinal drainage of water. If it is not qualitatively
solved , there can be severe ecological and economical damages.
If it were estimated during construction, that additional culvert should be built in the investor would give
order through the supervisor to do so.
6.3.   Protection measures during utilization of the road
Considering the consequences on the environment and damages that can appear during the utilization
of the road, it is necessary to:
-  To equip the constructed road with vertical and horizontal signs, which should include all kind of
necessary information and prohibitory signs
-  Regarding protection of game it is necessary to set the appropriate warning signs for caution
-  It is necessary to place signs which forbid setting of fires, with additional information
-  On noticeable places, information boards which forbid depositing of garbage, should be placed
-  Carry out regular maintenance, especially of culverts and drainage ditches, in order to prevent blockage
and damages to road, soil and water currents
-  In case of rockslide in cuts, side cuts and embankments, it is necessary to intervene promptly in order to
decrease the possibility of severe
-  SFE should introduce monitoring of all kind of damages on the road, and ecological and economic
consequences caused by construction
-  Considering that this is terrain disposed to erosion and slides, before carrying out of exploitation works in
sections gravitating to the road, tractor and other roads have to be planned within the project. These
facts have to be taken into consideration, in order to reduce damages during skidding of wood
assortments in the future.

7.0.   CONCLUSION
Involvement of qualitative high forests in FEA "Srbinjsko" is 39%. Reserves of timber mass and growth
increase are also satisfactory, and involvement of conifers is 38%. Other categories of forests have reserves and
growth increase, which are on the average level for these categories of forests.
Openness of these forests is low and is 8.9kmIlOOOha in high forests, and in low forests is
4.3km/1000ha. This openness is not sufficient and does not provide business economy, as well as carrying out
of necessary silvicultural and protection measures, which can have consequences in endangerment and further
degradation of forest ecosystems in the area. Because of sustainability and more economic management, and
carrying out of silvicultural and protection measures, as well as better utilization of productive abilities of soil in
the area, construction of forest roads and opening of areas is a priority task.
By constructing the road "Livade - Bad" section 11, 6 315m long, sections from 6 to 10 in management
unit "Slatina" will open. It would enable utilization of forests, carrying of silvicultural and protection works, as well
as utilization of other resources. Converting these forests into higher growing classes will be facilitated, which is
planned within forest management plan. That means that further degradation will be prevented with those
measures, and that conditions in productive and ecological sense would be improved.
With prompt interventions and skilled carrying out of works, damages can be significantly reduced if they
occur during construction and utilization of the road, in economic and ecological sense.

INTRODUCTION
Opennes of forests in Republic of Srpska, before the war, has been very low (about 7 km/1 000 ha), and
up to last ten years, because of the war and very difficult financial conditions after the war new roads were not
constructed, so the current openness remained as it was ten years ago. Previously constructed roads, because
they were not maintenanced during and after the war, are exposed to further collapse, and one part became
hardly passable or impassable for heavy trucks with big loads.
Insufficient openness not only influences the forest exploitation economy but negatively reflects on the
environment. Namely, because of the insufficient openness of forest areas annual cut cannot be equally realized
on the entire area, but very often, during the silvicultural rotation, the same area is entered several times or
excessive felling are carried out on the open area. That negatively reflects on the sustainability of forest
management and endangers particular forest ecosystems. In the unopened area prompt carrying out of
protection measures against fires, herbal diseases and natural catastrophes are disabled.
PFE of Republic of Srpska "Srpske Sume" proposed that, among others, construction of forest truck road
"Mala Inova" , 5 298.94 m long, in the area of SFE "Borja" - Teslic should also be included. "Sipad IRC" OOUR
- Planing agency, Banja Luka, elaborated a project for this road in 1986.
Data for Study elaboration were acquired by visiting the route, and during that we have used the project.
After that we have collected data from the SFE, from forest management plan, as well as from forest cadastre for
FEA "Teslicko".
Goal of the Study is to point to all relevant facts, which could have negative impact on the environment
during construction and utilization of the road, as well as to suggest the measures for possible elimination of
negative effects.
It is necessary to emphasize that these studies are the first of this kind, which are elaborated for forest
truck roads, and that authors had problems with lack of necessary data, as well as lack of any research in this
field (branch) in the previous period in the area. Second problem was lack of law scale of norms for the field of
forest road construction, especially regarding protection of the environment.



1.0.   CONDITIONS OF FORESTS AND FOREST LAND IN SFE "BORJA" - TESLIC
SFE "Borja" - Teslic works within PFE "Srpske Sume" and manages FEA"Teslicko". This area includes
forests and forestland in the area of municipality Teslic (96 %), and smaller part of the area belongs to
municipalities Doboj (2.5 %), Kotor Varos (1.1 %) and Celinac (0.4 %). FEA ((Teslicko << includes seven
management units and their parts:
1. M.U. (<Donja Velika Usora>>
2. M.U. (<Gornja Velika Usora)o
3. M.U. ((Mala Usora>>
4. M.U. (Mala Ukrina>>
5. M.U. <<Velika Ukrina>>
6. M.U. <(Tesanjka - parb
7. M.U. (<Ljenica - part))
1.1.   Basic taxation indexes
Conditions of areas of forests and forestland, wood reserves, increment and etat (cut volume) are shown in
tables 1, 2, 3, and 4. Data have been taken from existing FMP, for period from 01.01.1995 to 31.12.2004.
Presence of tree species per mass is:
- Beech                              54%
- Oak                                 19%
- Purebred and other deciduous forests  4%
- Fir                                 13%
- Spruce                               3%
- White pine                           3%
- Black pine                           4%

From the tables, following can be concluded:
- Conifers participate with 23%, and deciduous with 77%, which means that conifers are not
enogh present. According to data from ((Ecological-vegetational classification in BiH)),
elaborated by Forestry faculty from Sarajevo, (<Teslicko>> area belongs to north Bosnian area
within Pre Panonian area, and southern part to area of Zavidovicko - Tesli6ko within internal
Dinaric mountains. Potential vegetation on lower nothern part should contain forests of sessile -
flowered oak and hornbeam (Querco - Carpinetum illyricum), sporadic inundated forests of
English oak (Genisto elatae - Carpinetum roboris), forests of sessile - flowered oak, beech
forests (Fagetum montanum), as well as forests of willow and fir (Abieti - Fagetum silicicolum)
inside which are interpolated forests of pine and oak. Lowest areas belong to beech and oak.
- Reserves of timber mass per 1 ha are significantly lower (somewhere up to 50%) in regard to
normal forests, which is the result of long duration exploitation. Exploitation of forests in this area
begun in 1869, when the Austria-Hungary established the factory for wood destilation in Teslic
and later sawmill for conifers.
- Average annual increment is also below optimal considering conditions in the area. Reason for
this is probably low reserves and their structure.
- During elaboration of new management plan, having in mind conditions of forests, SFE
determined etat significantly lower than increment in order to improve conditions of reserves in
the following period. Increment of conifers for entire FEA is 86 696 m3 or 1.95 m3/ha, and for
deciduous 196 132 m3 or 4.43 m3/ha, or totaly 182 696 m3 or 6.38 m3/ha.
-  Annual felling volume for conifers is 30 960 m3 or 0.7 m3/ha, and for deciduous 163 644 m3 or
4.4 m3/ha. It means that planned annual felling of conifers is 35.8% in regard to increment, and
of deciduous is 83.4%, or totaly 68.8%. From above mentioned it can be seen that in the
following period not only overall conditions will improve, but also involvement of conifers in
regard to deciduous.
-  In the previous period significant areas were afforested. According to the plan there are 6 126.83
ha of afforested areas, from which there are raisings of fir and spruce on 113.24 ha or 1.9%,
raisings of black and white pine on 5 789.49 or 94.6% and other conifers on 215.10 ha or 3.5%.
In mentioned raisings there are raisings with assessed timber mass (3 852.27 ha with total mass
of 511 127 m3) while remaining part of raisings is significantly younger (2 274.56).
-  Since 96% is afforested with pine, there are big problems related to raising measures (thinning)
and lack of market for pine assortments, especially for pitprops and pulpwood.
1.2.   Openness of the FEA
In the FEA there are 338.3 km of constructed forest truck roads, from which 319.1 km through high
forests, 14.0 km through scion forests and 5.2 km through bare land. Beside that, according to to data from
forests cadastre, there are 65 km of asphalt roads and 72 km of public macadam roads in the area. Openness of
high forest is 7.8 km/1000 ha, and low forests is 2.5 km/1000 ha. Data have been taken form forests cadastre
with situation on 31.12.2000. This openness is very low and does not guaranty successful management neither
from economic or ecological viewpoint.
Beside the fact that openness is low it is not equally disposed in the area. That is the reason why more
frequent fellings and excessive utilization of forests occur in the opened part of the area. On the other side, in the
unopened part forests are ruined and there is no possibility of carrying out of silvicultural works.
Excessive felling in the opened part and impossibility of interventions in unopened part of the area
directly endangers stability of forest ecosystems and biodiversity.

2.0.   IMPACT OF OPENNING OF FORESTS, WITH FOREST TRUCK ROADS,
ON THE ENVIRONMENT
Contemporary forest management requires, from economical and ecological viewpoint, optimal
openness of forest areas with forest truck roads.
Optimal openness means the openness that will provide the most economical utilization of forests in the
area, and not to endanger productive capability of soil and forests, and environment and biodiversity of
vegetation and animal world, on that occasion.
Optimal openness depends on terrain conditions, stand conditions and technology of forest utilization.
Openness of high forests in RS is around 7.7 km/1 000 ha, in average for all categories of forests.
That is very low openness in regard to developed countries with developed forestry, where openness in
high forests is 20 to 40 km/100 ha. In our country the most qualitative forests are opened, in economic and
ecological sense. Often there are excessive felling and endangerment of stability of those forest ecosystems.
For proper forest management and continuous supplying of market with wood assortments, it is
necessary that entire area is equally opened, and that means road construction also in rough terrain. During
opening of certain areas it is necessary to realize all possible variants, taking into consideration impacts of
certain variants on the environment, besides economical justification.
Construction of forest truck roads can have positive and negative impacts on the environment.
Positive impacts are reflected through the following:
- Utilization of forests can be done equally in the entire area and there is no need for over exaggerated
felling on particular areas, by which degradation of ecosystems is avoided,
- Protection measures against fires, diseases and natural catastrophes can be promptly and efficiently
carried out,
- Sustainability of management is not endangered,
- Access and realization of all silvicultural works are enabled,
- Access to rural areas and better utilization of agricultural land are enabled,
- Better and more efficient utilization of all natural resources in the area is enabled,
- Access to many landscapes is enabled, in order to use them for recreative, health and sport purposes,
- If there are any historical, natural, archeological or other objects it enables the access to them, as well
as other various scientific, educational, research and other activities.
Opening of forests also has some unwanted consequences, from viewpoint of protection of forests, soil and
water, biodiversities of vegetative and animal world, and others.
During the forest truck road construction and its utilization, greater or smaller damages are done to the
environment. Unprompted and incomplete maintenance of constructed roads can also cause greater or smaller
damages in economic and ecological sense. Intensive damages are especially done on soil, springs and water
currents. The consequence of that is endangerment of the environment.
2.1.   Impact of the road construction on soil
Impact of road construction on soil depends on location, terrain configuration, geological and pedological
base, etc. Relation between roads and land surface is complicated. Roads constructed on slopes can cause
massive movement of mass (landslides or erosion). Roads constructed in foot can often be the obstacle to
moved mass, and if they intersect water currents they can also have influence on stopping of material and even
change of water currents.
Road construction can have negative impacts on geo-morphological processes, as well as on the
environment, in several ways:
-  Productive soil is permanently lost by construction of the road and objects on the road,



8
- Road construction often brings to increased and speed up soil erosion, and in that way it degrades the
soil with deposits and makes great damage to agricultural soil, water currents, reservoirs, inhabited
places and others,
- On places where the soil is formed on the impermeable surface, and is on the slope, because of the
cutting the road through, land slides can appear especially where underground waters appear,
- Also, large slides appear during rockslides on road cuts and embankments in heavy rainfalls,
- Large quantity of water pours on the road, and the damage made by water on the road and on soil under
the road or on water currents etc., depends on the quality of constructed drains and road permeability.
Unfortunately, nowadays we have no concrete data about damages on soil made by forest truck road
construction, and no research has been done regarding that. Also we do not have data about damage on roads
done by bad weather, although we know that they are severe.
2.2.   Impact of the road on geomorphologic processes
Impacts of the road on geomorphologic processes reflects through the following:
-  Speeds up the erosion from the road surface,
-  Directly influences on to the structure and shape of the furrows,
-  Changes the direction of surface flow of water, and changes or lengthens the erosion furrows on
previously untouched part of the area,
-  Causes the mutual influence on water, sediments and timber waste, on the place where the road
crosses the brook.
On steep terrain, forestland susceptible to slides, most significant influence of roads on scope of erosion
depends on increasement of moved mass after road construction. Scope of erosion, created by road
construction, is varying with climatic, geological features, age of the road, way of construction and intensity of
rain and torrent.
Slides, created by road construction, are occurring because of movement of soil mass, irregularly placed
structure of embankments and brook crossings, unsuitable dimensions of culverts, sediments, wood waste
during torrents, bad compaction of road, bad drainage, as well as removal of water currents according to
unstable soil.
It often happens, that during road construction through forest, stumps and other assortments are removed
which cause slides and movement of mass when they decay.
2.3.   Impact of the road construction on hydrological processes
Interaction between forest roads and water represents the essence of several key things, which includes the
impact of roads on the environment.
Roads have three primary impacts on hydrological processes:
-  They directly hold (keep) raindrops on the road surface and road cuts, and divert water bellow the
surface, which pours down the slope,
-  They concentrate the flow across the surface or in the near by canals and ditches and
-  They change the water current from the natural direction, by which the water would flow if there were no
road.
Problems of drainage and transportation of water and materials, especially during torrents, are main reasons
why roads are failure with main structural, ecological and economic consequences. Impacts of roads on
maximum flow of water in brooks depend on size of basin.



9
Construction of forest truck roads can have negative impacts on springs and water quality. Namely, the roads
enable the increased movement and possibility of usage of different chemicals for protection of forests and
fertilization in forests.
During the road construction heavy machines are used, which spill oil and petroleum, and later the rain
rinse it out to the springs and water currents next to the road. Other materials and waste, that can be found on
the road and around it, can be added to that.
Garbage deposits are frequently formed next to roads, and especially in the forests. They come from
households of near settlements or sites in the forest. Those are so called wild deposits, since garbage is
deposited next to the roads without control. Deposits contain different kinds of garbage: metal, plastic, paper and
other kinds of garbage from industry and households. They often contain toxic and harmful substances. All that
pollutes brooks and water currents next to the road.
2.4.   Impact of the road construction on biodiversity
Many species, which are forming the biodiversity in certain habitat, have very significant role for ecosystem
and its stability. For stability of an ecosystem, in order to function, it is necessary to be healthy, in order to enable
all species to live and preserve in most optimal conditions.
In the previous chapter we have seen that forest roads with construction and maintenance can endanger
and divide certain habitat. Since there are big disturbances on soil, water and air, there are also changes in
micro climate in the habitat. All those factors can endanger the species that, in the habitat, have optimal
conditions for growth and can cause the occurence of unwanted outer species, and violation and endangerment
of the ecosystem.
Some species can have more significant role than the others, for normal functioning of ecosystem. On the
other side species that do not have significant role in ecosystem, are creating reservation of potential
adaptations towards changes. Since one ecosystem cannot predict changes, diversity specie serevs as a
defense against those changes.
Biodiversity is significant for long - term functioning of ecosystem, and human activities , which have impact
on decreasement of biodiversity, can endanger it. On that basis, hypothesis is made, that review and
measurement of biodiversity is providing the best integral assessment of road impact on ecosystem.
2.5.   Impact of the road construction on air
During the construction and utilization of forest roads air becomes polluted, which can affect the narrower
part next to the road. Since the roads are mostly not asphalted, but macadam roads, negative impacts can be
reflected in production of dust, noise and exhaust gases, as well as mining in the construction phase on the
route and in quarries, where the construction material is used from.
By road construction quantity of hard particles in the air is increased and visibility is decreased, and besides
that they represent health problem.
According to certain research, dust raised from silicate geological base represents danger for people
exposed to it, more exactly near it.
2.6.   Impact of the road construction on habitat
Construction and presence of the roads in the productive habitat can have impacts on the productivity.
Construction of the road leads to creation of new marginal habitat in the forest. Roads are creating a corridor for
birds and animals from the forest edge, so that they can go deeper into the part of the forest, which were
previously closed with continuous forest cover. Diversity can expand on that location with species inhabiting the
edge of the forest.
Roads can have impact on terrestrial Vertabrata in a way of dividing their habitat, and especially vehicle
traffic has influence because it is a threat of running over them. Because of that Vertabrata are avoiding roads.
With better access to forest complexes, easier hunting and catching of game in traps is enabled, which is a
negative consequence of road construction. By intersecting and covering of brooks, forming of different
obstacles it can be negatively influenced on moving and breeding of fish, and to endanger habitat in water.



10
Road construction and maintenance inside the forest represent disturbances, which create new marginal
habitat. Roads can be first entrance places for outer species in new area and it can serve as a corridor further
expansion of outer plants. Settling of new species can endanger the existing biological ecosystems and their
structure.
2.7.  Socio-economic impacts of the road construction
These impacts can be direct and indirect. Direct socio-economic impacts include employment of the
population on felling and production of wood assortments, export of wood assortments, employment on growing
and protection of forests, collection of secondary forest products (medicinal herbs, aromatic herbs, different
forest seeds and fruits, mushrooms, snails and other). These are restorable natural resources. This can be
significant source of income for local residents. Construction of roads has direct influence on reduction of export
costs for these assortments and enables faster movement.
Roads also serve for easier movement of cattle in the areas where pasture is allowed. Forest roads can also
serve for drawing of energy and mineral resources in areas where they are present.
This can negatively reflect on the environment (loss of habitat, increasement of noise and creation of
particles, which are entering water currents and air).
Roads enable utilization of forests in recreative and health purposes. All these require new approach in road
construction, from the aspect of optimizing of multipurpose utilization of roads.
Indirect socio-economic factors include the role of roads in prevention of forest fires. Constructed roads
enable faster approach (access) and prompt intervention in case of forest fires. Roads also act as the obstacle to
fire expansion and as the line for free and successful intervention of firemen.
Among benefits of the roads we can include researches, inventory and observation in forest. Roads also
provide access to private property and in that way provide better economic utilization of those areas.
Roads also have many non-commercial values, which cannot be measured. Those are access to
landscapes, access to hunting, observation of vegetation and animal world, visits and observation of different
architectural, cultural and historical values.

3.2.   Purpose of the road construction
One of the main reasons for road construction is opening of forest area of brook basin Mala Inova in
management unit "Mala Usora". Main purpose of opening of the area is exploitation the forests in the area, as
well as prompt carrying out of interventions of growing and protection of forests.
Project has special significance for realization of "Program for reconstruction of forests in management
unit Mala Usora".
3.3.  Usage of soil
First part of the route passes through inhabited settlement Buletici (villages Trivunovi6i, Vukovici, Micici and
Radonjici) and is 2.8 km long, and goes over existing village road. Road, through inhabited place, is going over
old route of narrow forest railway and is very narrow, so it has to be significantly widen over private property and
fences have to be moved. Because of that the investor first has to solve property conditions (relations). On the
remained part, planned road goes through the state forest and there are no property problems, because those
forests are managed by the SFE (the investor). That part also goes over the rote of the old forest railway with
smaller deviations and widenings.
Before the works start it is necessary to renovate and set out the route because previous marks are
destroyed. It is necessary to solve property problems on the part that passes through settlement (cca 2.8km),
because the existing village road has to be widened. During solving of property relations, existing fences, walls
andf possible smaller objects has to be moved where required by future road.
Since the are two roads on the starting point, 6 m and 8 m long, contractor has to provide alternative access
to villages and property during construction. On the part that goes through forest the investor is obligated to
mark, cut and remove trees and bushes from the route, and contractor has to extract roots and stumps in order
not to cover them in road base.
Contractor will use following machines for construction: bulldozers, trenchers, loaders, graders, vibrating
rollers and tipper trucks. Stripping of top soil is not foreseen with project, but if there is a need for that it should
be removed on a pile and later use for soiling of the slope. Material for topping will be used from excavation.

3.4.  Review (summary) of alternatives
According to the Technical report it can be seen that the planner examined (discussed) two alternatives:
1. The first idea was to open the basin of brook "Mala Inova" form the road "Berca - Vranpolje". This variant
requires surmounting of the section between Male and Velike Inove, which passes through serpentine
crest. This variant would require bigger and heavier earthworks and would be economically less justified.
Also during the route building, severe damages would be done to soil and forest, and because of that
from the ecological viewpoint this solution less favorable.
2. Second alternative, according to which the project is elaborated, is more favorable from the economic
aspect, because the earthworks are smaller, and the route goes over former narrow forest railway
constructed during the Austrian rule and is not functioning until 1900. According to this variant, the road
is planned mostly to go next to the brook Mala Inova with minor deviations and crossings of the brook on
few places.
All other alternatives, which would possibly go over basin slope or crest, would be more difficult for carrying
out and would require longer road and higher investments.
4.0. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EXISTING SITUATION OF BASIN "MALA INOVA"
AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Road "Mala Inova" passes through the lowest points of the basin of brook Mala Inova and all masses,
from the right and left side of the basin, are gravitating to it. Road opens the sections from 61 to 56 of the
management unit "Mala Usora". Basin area is 539,05 ha.

Average month temperatures point that only in December temperature falls under 0C, and in other months that
temperatures are within average for those months. Most abundant precipitations are in April, July and December,
and most of snowy days are in December. Average month temperature for vegetation period is 15.9C. Average
annual air humidity is 82%, and in vegetation period is 79%, while average sum of precipitations in vegetation
period is 525 mm. Index of drought, according to De Marton, averagely for vegetation period is 23.1. Vegetation
period lasts for 191 days.
According to above data it can be concluded that climate has more expressed moderate-continental
character (55% of precipitations is related to vegetation period) and that it is very suitable for growth of forest
vegetation.
4.2.   Location and relief of terrain
Basin of the brook Mala Inova is located southwestern form Teslic, on the slopes of mountain Borja
between 325m and 1008 m (peak Tajan) above sea level. Starting point of the road is on 325 m above sea level
and ends on 560 m.
First part of the road comes from asphalted road and goes partly over private property over village road.
In upper part the terrain is covered with forests, steep and intersected with small brooks. Brook Mala Inova,
which is the main feature of the basin, flows eastwards and changes direction to northeast until mouth of Velika
Inova. Practically Road will be constructed next to entire flow of Mala Inova.
4.3.   Geological and pedological characteristics
Area of basin Mala Inova, regarding geological characteristics, is the part of large ultramafit massif Borja,
a mountain mainly composed of peridotites. These peridotites are one of the magmatic associations, which is
pressed inside volcanogenic-sediment formation. According to petrographic composition they belong to lerconit,
with the fact that they are more or less serpentined.
Important feature of peridotites is that they are massive, but are easily crushed into scree material with
different size. Presence of large stones is significant. Peridotites are inpermeable rocks, which is important for
appearance of erosions. Increased erosion in area of basin Mala Inova is permanent factor, which should be
taken care about. Peridotites are characterized with relief of (great energy>). It is about steep slopes intersected
with numerous crests and hollows. Main crests are 4 to 6 km long in basin of Mala Inova.
It is important to emphasize specific mineral composition of peridotites through broad ratio between Mg
and Ca, lack of P and K and richness of oligo elements. This is significant for appearance of specific flora, so
called serpentinofits in area of basin Mala Inova.
Disposition of soil on peridotites in Mala Inova firstly depends on relief and on erosion processes, which
have influence on dynamics of these soils.
In this area, there is a series of soils where eutric ranker and kambisol prevail. Luvisol and pseudoglejev
are found out but their presence is not significant, and they are not registered in the maps.
It should be mentioned that significant areas of sirozem (litosol), created as a consequence of erosion on
peridotitic terrains. Eutric ranker are significantly present, which is understandable since those are steep slopes
and crests (parts of sections 51,52,53, 55 and 56). Eutric kambisol have the similar presence and they are on
less steeper slopes (upper part of Mala Inova, sections 52,53,54). Complex soils of topogenic row made of eutric
ranker and eutric kambisol have the same significance and spatial presence. Involvement of these components
in the combination is related to relief. On steep parts involvement of ranker is more intensive, and on less
steeper involvement of kambisol is more intensive. More or less, deeper or shallow soils are important from the
production viewpoint.
It is important to emphasize that rankers and kambisols are particularly skeleton soils; they are
permeable, warm and dry soils, which effects on appearance of vegetation and flora, which are adapted to these
conditions.
From viewpoint of productivity of timber mass sirozems and rankers belong to soil with low productivity,
while kambisols are medium productive. River drift rankers and skeleton rankers a bit can be productive soils,
and shallow and skeleton kambisols have low productivity. If it is about trees, oak has low productivity even on
kambisols, and black pine on rankers has good productivity.

4.4.   Vegetation characteristics and biodiversity
Mountain Borja, according to ecological vegetative area classification, belongs to the area of inner
Dinaric mountains and to area of Zavidovi6 and Tesli6. In this "Peridotitic" terrain, impacts of orographic-edaphic
conditions, determine the disposition of vegetation. Slope increases or decreases flow of energy to a certain
place. Change in certain vegetation units follows the changes in slope and exposition, while the impact of height
in the area of Mala Inova does not have significant impact. South steeper slopes of the sections 55 and 56,
northern very steep slopes and valleys in Male Inove are ecological conditions suitable for communities of black
pine (Pinetum nigrae silvestris, Pavl. 1951).
Mezofile forests of beech and fir with beech (Abieti - Fagetum serp. picetosum a.r.) are located on colder
sites, and they are northern exposition and hollows in northern exposition. Deeper soils are mainly represented
there deep eutric kambisol.
In high layers, they are spread form 450 up to 1000 m above sea level (from riverbed of Mala Inova up to peak
M. Tajan 1008 m).
Scion forests of (Potentillo - Quercetum petraeae Pavl. 1951), are located on north. Northwest and
northeast slopes, next to main crest from M. Tajana to Rudina (677 m above sea level), and which are very
steep. Over narrow crest they descend almost to the riverbed of Mala Inova. On this area, shallow soil prevails
ranker and shallow kambisol. In ecological sense, these forests are located between forests of black pine and
beech-fir-spruce forests.
Observing from the production viewpoint, forests of beech and fir with spruce have average or bad
productivity, but forests of black pine and Quercus petraeae mainly have bad productivity, which in the area of
basin Mala Inova have protective character.
Floristic composition and structure of mentioned communities is related with degree of preservation,
firstly from the conditions of the compositon. In stands that greater openness of shrubs is better developed,
regarding number of species and their number and coverness.
Forests of black pine and sessile-flowered oak are mainly opened and therefore bright and floristically
richer. In tree layer there are black pine and sessile-flowered oak of poor quality, Betula verucosa, Populus
tremula, Sorbus torminalis and Sorbus aucuparia.
In layer of shrubs there are: Frangula alnus, Prunus mahaleb, Rosa glutinosa, Rosa spinosima, Rosa
pendulina, Rubus ideaus, Rubus tomnetosus, Rubus rusticanus, Rubus hirtus, Spirea ulmifolia, Spirea media,
Sorbus torminalis, Sorbus aucuparia, Pyrus piraster, Rhamnus chatartica, Fraxinus ornus and others.
In layer of low vegetation there are: Brachypodium pinatum, Calamagrostris varia, Pteridium aquilinum,
Potentilla alba, Peucedanum camofolia, Serratula tinctoria, Erica camea, Betonica officinalis, Fragaria vesca,
Mellitis melisophyllum, Daphne blagayana, Vaccinum myrtilus, Lilium matragon, Shyphitum tuberosum, Solidago
virgaurea, Aremonia agrimonoides, Campanula persicifolia, Stachis recta, Dictamnus albus, Euphorbia
glabriflora, Euphorbia polychroma, Melica nutans, Festuca heterophylla, Thymus serpyllum, Galium cruciata,
Polygonatum odoratum, Epimedium alpinum, Asplenium adiatum nigrum, Dorychium herbaceum, laserpitium sp.
And others.
In mezzophilic forests of beech and fir with spruce, in tree layer except edificators there are also: Acer
pseudoplatanus, Sorbus aucaparia, Betu/a verucosa, Acer platanoides, Salix caprea, Populus tremula, Ostrya
carpinifolia, Tilia parvifolia and others.
In the shrubberies layer there are: Rubus idaeus, Rubus hirtus, Daphne moesereum, Sambucus
racemosa, Sambucus nigra, Hedera helix, Spirea ulmifolia, Rosa pendulina, Rosa spinossima, Frangula alnus,
Daphne b/agayana and others.
In the layer of low vegetation there are: Festuca drymea, Vaccinium myrtillus, Pteridium aqualinum,
Lusula silvatica, Shyphytum tuberosum, Hieracium murorum, Vida silvestris, Asarum europaeum, Nephrodium
filix mas, Erica camea, Asperula odorata, Glechoma hirsute, Athyrium filix femina, Carex digitata, Ruscus
hypoglosum, Sanicula europaea, Euphorbia amygdaloides, Polystichum lobatum, Asplenium trichomanes,
Senecio nemorensis, Calamagrostris varia, Thymus sp., Atropa belladonna, Polygonatum verticilatum and
others.

According to acquired data, following game can be found on this and broader area:
a) Basic game
Roedeer (Capreolus capreolus), bear (Ursus arctus), hare (Lepus europaeus), gray partridge (Perdix perdix) and
pheasant (Phasanis colchicus).
b) Permanently protected game
Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), weasel (Mustela sp), otter (Lutra lutra), hawk (Accipitridae), falcon (Falconaceae),
raven (Corvus corax) and owls (Strigidae).
c) Game protected with closed season
Mallard (Anas sp.) and hazel hen (Tetrastes bonasia).
d) Unprotected
Wild boar (Sus scropha), wolf (Canis lupus), fox (Vulpes vulpes), wildcat (Felis silvestris), pine marten (Martes
martes) , stone marten (Martes fiona), badger (Meles meles) and polecat (Putarius putarius).
4.5.   Hydrological characteristics
This relatively small basin that gravitates to planned road, in hydrological sense, can be considered rich,
as well as broader area of management unit to which it belongs. Main characteristic, in hydrological sense, is
given by brook Mala Inova, which from its source to the mouth in Velika Inova, flows mainly through the basin.
Brook Mala Inova is created from several springs and small brooks that are mainly on the right slope and their
current is relatively short. According to available data these are permanent springs with small capacity and
always have water in them. Entire surroundings are rich with water currents and most of them are moving from
southwest towards southeast. This movement is caused with geologic base and orography of terrain, because
the area is characterized with presence of numerous crests and steep slopes.
4.6.   Air pollution
Air pollution can be caused by several sources, which can be present on local, regional and
broader area. Polluters can be different objects, which emission particles in different state of aggregation.
Data about air pollution in area of Teslic are very modest. Risti6 T. in his work "Cosequences of
destruction of forest vegetation during wart in municipality Tesli6 - eco-climatic factors" states that excessive
felling of trees in the area during war decreased role of forests as a natural filter for all kinds of aerosols and air
regenerators. In 1987 Forestry faculty from Sarajevo, according to conclusions of federal Committee for
Agriculture in Belgrade and Geneve Convention about excessive air pollution (1979), joined the realization of
Convention, and on the basis of conclusions program known as IPC-forests has been elaborated. With that
program control of forests health conditions has been introduced in Europe, and former Yugoslavia joined the
realization of that program. Bio - indication places were placed in BiH, and there were 4 of them in Tesli6.
Unfortunately war interrupted the supervision of health conditions in forests, air pollution and similar, in BiH, and
also in area of Tesli6 so we were not able to use data from previous registrations.

Mass reserves per ha are far below normal, so these forests should be classified in the category of
degreaded forests. Foreseen scope of cutting, in regard to growth increase, is significantly lower and is 24% with
conifers and 48% with deciduous forests. Considering this condition of forests in basin of Mala Inova and broder
area of management unit Mala Usora, SFE elaborated a program of
forest reconstruction in management unit Mala Usora, by which all sections of basin Mala Inova are included.
The programe foresees:
-  clear cuts                        58,10 ha
-  thinning                          209,30 ha
-  group cutting                     189,10 ha
-  afforestation of bare land        54,10 ha
-  filling of raisings               8,10 ha
So total area for carrying out of works is 518.70 ha. 10 690 m3 of forests would be cut (2 261 m3 of conifers
and 8 429 m3 of deciduous forests). Ares with clear and group felling (247.40 ha) would be afforested. This
reconstruction program has been elaborated before elaboration of management plan, so there are some
differences in areas and volumes.
Successful realization of the program is directly dependent on openness of the area with forest roads, and
that is the main reason why SFE decided to construct a road in basin of Mala Inova.
4.8.   Opennes of the basin
Areas of this basin were opened in the time of Austrian rule in BiH with narrow forest railway, highline
cables and slides. Forest truck roads were not constructed in the basin. There is only adapted route of former
forest railway, which is used by residents of the village near the route, but it is necessary for truck traffic. That is
a part of the route that should be reconstructed within this project.
5.0.  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT EFFECTS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
Planned road in the basin of Mala Inova has a great significance for forest management in the area.
Beside positive effects in ecological and economic sense, if full attention is not payed during construction and
utilization of the road, as well as during the exploitation of forests in the area, there could be negative
consequences especially ecological ones.
Effects of the road will depend on skill, quality and responsibility during construction in the area. If works
are carried out successfully and qualitatively positive effects of the construction will be more significant, while
negative one, if not avoided, than reduced to a minimum.



18
5.1.   Positive effects
Elaboration of this study is already a positive effect, because the goal of the Study is to warn the
contractors on great economic and ecological damages that can occur if construction works, utilization of the
road, exploitation works, cultivation and protection works, are not carried out properly.
The Study would have more significant effect if it were elaborated before main project and if some
proposed measures could be put into the project.
The most important effect of the road construction is reflected through the fact that the basin will open
and enable carrying out of exploitation works, silvicultural and protection works in the area. Considering the
conditions of forests in which they are now, emergency interventions are requested in order to stop further
degradation and to improve the conditions. All works that are foreseen in the reconstruction program for forests
in management unit "Mala Usora" sections 51 to 58, 61 to 65, 75, 76, 78 to 82, can be carried out more
efficiently and cheaper.
Effect of the road is reflected through the possibility of emergency intervention in case of fires, tree diseases and
other damages.
Small villages, which are gravitating on this road, would get better and more qualitative access to their
homes and property, as well as connection with Teslic. There is a possibility of employment of local residents on
construction and maintenance of roads, silvicultural works, protection and exploitation of forests, and utilization
of secondary forest products and other. Also there is a possibility of utilization of this exciting landscape for
recreation.
By opening of broader area, pressure on the forests that are already open will be decreased. That opens
the possibility for equal management of forests and other resources.
5.2.   Negative effects
Major undesirable consequences are expected on soil and hydrological conditions in the area, especially
during the road construction and exploitation of forests. Since the route mostly goes over the former forest
railway, earthworks are reduced to lowest extent as well as damages on soil and brook Mala Inova and its
tributaries.
During construction there can be some covering of brooks and sedimentation of small particles and
creation of mud, so water habitat can be endangered. Also, culvert with insufficient diameter on water crossings
can hold the material and in that way endanger not only water currents but also the road, because during heavy
rainfalls severe damages can be done to the road.
By constructing the road there is a possibility of slides and erosion appearance, especially on steep
terrain, cuts, side cuts and embankments. Former water currents are crossed and new ones are formed. Water
can be polluted with oil spilling form machines on the site, as well as by throwing the different garbage on the site
and next to the route.
On smaller surface on the road, vegetation communities can change because the intensity of light is
increased with road construction and with that expansion of heliofits, as well as some outer species. The road
significantly endangers the game, because of noise created by vehicles. Machines for constructions and mining
also create noise. There are also many cases of game being hit with vehicles on roads with intensive traffic.
Increased noise is expected during construction of the road and exploitation of forests. There is not
going to be any direct significant air pollution except exhaust gases in the construction phase and utilization of
the road, because of mining and dust on the road. Road will enable more intensive movement of people and
vehicles, and that means increased danger for fires, illegal hunting, illegal felling, illegal utilization of medicinal
herbs, mushrooms, forest fruits, snails and others.
There are no recreative, health or sports objects, cultural and historical heritage in the area, so in that
sense road construction will not have any major impacts.



19
6.0.   ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (ACTIVITIES)
Taking in consideration all above mentioned impacts of construction of forest truck road Mala Inova on
the environment, it is necessary to undertake certain protection measures in order to, if not avoid, than reduce to
acceptable the negative consequences. Protection measures should include not only road construction but
everything that precedes it and comes after it (utilization of the road).
Taking the previous remarks into consideration, as well as acquired data, protection measures can be
systematized in several groups:
-  Protection measures in preparatory phase of construction
-  Protection measures during road construction
-  Protection measures during utilization of the road
6.1.   Protection measures in preparatory phase of construction
In order to achieve better effects on protection of the environment during road construction, more exactly
opening of forest complexes, it is necessary that from the beginning and selection of the most appropriate
variant of the road, the most appropriate variant is determined during construction, from the aspect of negative
and positive effects on the environment. After that the best variant would be selected, which would have lowest
negative impacts on the environment. The following should be undertaken:
-  All proposed measures have to be built in the project
-  Since this is the project elaborated before the war it is necessary to renovate the route
-  Property relations need to be solved, on the part passing through the inhabited settlement and private
property
-  Before construction of bridges starts, alternative accesses to settlements should be found
-  After property relations are solved, fences and objects on the route should be removed
6.2.   Protection measures during road construction
During construction it is necessary to:
-  Remove all stumps, trees, humus in order to avoid their covering on the road or in the brook, and to use
humus for covering the slopes
-  During excavation of soil form side cuts and cuts, use the part of material for embankments and slopes,
and surplus should be deposited on certain places and protect it from moving in the brook during heavy
rainfalls
-  All operations with petroleum and oil exchange, during construction, should be done on places specified
for that with maximum protection measures
-  Oil and petroleum packages need to be collected and taken to controlled deposits. That applies for old
tires and broken parts of the machines and other waste on the site
-  During mining, take care of reducing the damage on trees and soil to minimum
-  Machines should be parked on particular places determined for that, with maximum protection measures
against pollution of soil with oil, petroleum and products
-  Since borrows for material were not defined in the project, the investor needs, before the works start, to
determine the places and way of arrangement after the works are completed
-  During embankment construction, bearing capacity of the ground should be priory defined. Material
which is built in the embankment need to have appropriate geo-mechanical quality. Compaction should
be done in 20 to 30 cm layers, and crossfall for subgrade must be foreseen, so the water does not retain
-  On some places, within the project, only cross-sections with 30 cm diameter are foreseen, which would
cause fast blockage and severe damages, which means that during heavy rainfalls part of the road could
be destroyed. On the part of the road that is passing through the forest, culverts should have diameter
50 cm
-  If it is estimated during construction, that additional culvert should be built in the investor would give
order through the supervisor to do so.



20
6.3.   Protection measures during utilization of the road
Considering the consequences on the environment and damages that can appear during the utilization
of the road, it is necessary to:
-  To equip the constructed road with vertical and horizontal signs, which should include all kind of
necessary information and prohibitory signs
-  Regarding protection of game it is necessary to set the appropriate warning signs for caution
-  It is necessary to place signs which forbid setting of fires, with additional information
-  On noticeable places, information boards which forbid depositing of garbage, should be placed
-  Carry out regular maintenance, especially of culverts and drainage ditches, in order to prevent blockage
and damages to road, soil and water currents
-  In case of rockslide in cuts, side cuts and embankments, it is necessary to intervene promptly in order to
decrease the possibility of severe
-  SFE should introduce monitoring of all kind of damages on the road, and ecological and economic
consequences caused by construction
Since the soil is disposed to erosion, it is necessary to plan and build skidding tracks and roads in order to
avoid damages to soil, road and water currents, by which damages can be reduced to lowest extent.
7.0.   CONCLUSION
Openness of FEA "Teslicko" with roads is very low and for high forests is 7.8 km / 1000 ha. Structures of
forests and wood reserves (total reserves for entire area in average is 209 m3/ha, which is far below normal) are
also negative. According to data Begovi6, B. (1986), hundred years ago only in the area of Male and Velike
Usore, and brook Lukavac there were about 23 000 ha of virgin forests. Exaggerated exploitation of forests
especially in the first half of IXX century brought to degradation of forest ecosystems in broader area of Tesli6.
In the basin of Mala Inova, where the the construction of road is proposed in length of 5.3 km, conditions
are worse than in the entire area in average, since the average reserve is 161 m3/ha.
Main goal of the construction of road Mala Inova is enabling the re-construction of degraded forests.
With that purpose program for forest reconstruction in management unit Mala Usora" is elaborated for sections
51 to 58, 61 to 61 to 65, 75,76, 78 to 82 i 86 to 88.
It means that the construction of this road has great ecological significance, since the main goal is to
stop further degradation of forests in the area and gradual improvement of conditions. However, the construction
itself can have negative ecological consequences.
Those are minor negative consequences in regard to benefits (advantages) that are gained with road
construction, in ecological and economic sense. Those consequences can be significantly decreased with
application of mentioned measures. Negative impacts are expected in small scope on water currents, soil and
biodiversity.
