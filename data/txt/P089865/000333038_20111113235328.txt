1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

This Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report corresponds to the first phase
of a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL) series. The program objective of the
APL series was to have a long-term impact on Mexico’s competitiveness through
continued improvement of the National Innovation System. The proposed duration of the
program was ten years divided into an initial four-year phase and two subsequent three-
year phases.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) highlights reasons why the competitiveness of
the Mexican economy was at risk in 2004. Strengthening the innovation system was seen
as important to improving factor conditions and restoring the long term competitiveness
of the Mexican economy. However, according to the PAD, the Mexican innovation
system performed below par compared to economies of its income level. The low
performance stemmed from a combination of factors:
    • Inadequate interest and investment in R&D;
    • Insufficient private investment in R&D, both as a proportion of GDP and as a
       percentage of total national R&D expenditures;
    • Limited international participation and linkages;
    • Inadequate business innovation in part due to inadequate linkages between public
       R&D and the productive sector, and few S&T based start-ups; and
    • Insufficient innovation capacity due to low science and technology skill base.

Rationale for Bank assistance. The Mexican Government invited the Bank to support
reforms in the Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) sector through the preparation
of a follow-on operation to the Knowledge and Innovation Project (1999–2005). The
Government and the Bank included the enhancement of the Mexican economy’s
competitiveness as one of the four pillars of the 2004 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS). This project was an integral element in the Bank’s support for strengthening of
innovation, training and education, one of the five areas that compose Mexico’s
competitiveness agenda as defined by the Secretary of the Presidency (the others being
infrastructure, investment climate, energy and the financial sector).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

There are some inconsistencies between the Project Development Objectives (PDO)
defined in the PAD and legal agreement and between the outcome indicators in the PDO
text and the results framework. This ICR will use2the PDO in the legal agreement, given
                                                 1
that it takes precedence over the one in the PAD. ,

1According   to the PAD, the Program seeks to support the Government's efforts to improve the
competitiveness of the Mexican economy by strengthening the innovative capacity of the private sector,
accelerating advanced human capital formation, and increasing the international integration of the innovation


                                                     1
According to the legal agreement, “The objective of the Project is to support the
Borrower’s efforts to improve the competitiveness of its economy through: (a)
strengthening CONACYT’s institutional capacity; and (b) supporting CONACYT’s
existing grant and scholarship programs designed to increase the innovative capacity of
the Borrower’s private sector, accelerate advanced human capital formation, and increase
the international integration of the Borrower’s innovation system.?

The indicators referred to in the legal agreement, which coincide with those of the results
                                                             3
framework in Annex 3, will be used for the same reason. As a result, the indicators
mentioned in the PDO text on page 6 of the PAD—which are not tracked in the results
framework or linked to the legal agreement—are not used to measure the achievement of
the PDO. Table 1 contrasts the two sets of indicators.

system. To achieve the program's development objectives, a first phase operation is proposed with two major
lines of investment, in addition to supporting the policy framework for and internationalization of Mexico's
innovation system. First, on the demand side, the program would increase support to business innovation;
while, second, on the supply side the program would accelerate the formation of human capital (through
strategic and coordinated use of the scholarship fund); and finally it would support the cohesion and
effectiveness of Mexico's S,T& I system.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

No revisions were made to the PDO or key indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The primary target group is Mexican firms that are or have the potential to be innovative.
Mexican students interested in pursuing higher education in science and technology
related fields, researchers, and universities that participate in research consortia with
firms are also important beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

A full description of the project’s components is presented in Annex 2

Component 1: CONACYT Program to Promote Business Innovation. The first
component would support several of CONACYT’s competitive funding lines. These
funds support established and start-up companies, foster linkages between the public and
private sectors, and support public research centers integrating consortia.

(A) Consortia and Research Networks. This subcomponent would finance grants to
support collaborative research programs between universities/technology centers and
enterprises. The grants would finance start-up expenses for the creation of the consortia
(Mode A), including the development of a joint research agenda, and for the
implementation of the research agenda (Mode B).

(B) Venture Capital Funding. This subcomponent would provide grants to support the
venture capital fund (Emprendedores) that CONACYT administers jointly with NAFIN.
Emprendedores was the first Mexican fund focusing on high technology companies,
established in 2004 with support from a previous World Bank Project (Knowledge and
Innovation Project).

(C) Pre-Competitive Fund. The purpose of this subcomponent is to provide grants to
firms and research centers to help transform scientific and technological developments
into viable high value products and services. In other words, the grants would help
products/services accomplish the “last mile? to move to the commercialization phase.

(D) Sectoral Fund for Economic Development. This subcomponent would finance
matching grants to companies to support innovation and technological development
projects. The fund, known as the Fondo de Innovación Tecnológica, is jointly
administered by CONACYT and the Ministry of Economy.

(E) Researchers and Technologists in Industry. The purpose of this subcomponent is to
provide grants to graduates of science and technology master and doctoral programs to
promote their insertion in the labor market.



                                            3
Component 2: CONACYT Program to Finance Scholarships for Excellence and
Relevance. The second component would support CONACYT’s scholarship programs, to
increase both quality and relevance of human resources to society. In Mexico the
availability of advanced S&T skills is low, and an improved supply of such skills paired
with well targeted incentives would lead to improved innovative capacity. The
scholarship program would support graduate studies at the doctoral, master and
specialization levels, in accredited national programs and foreign programs.

Component 3: Support for Policies to Enhance Innovation and Internationalization in
Mexico. The third component would improve the innovation system by strengthening
Mexico’s ST&I policy framework, and increasing international integration. Further the
component would support professional international exchange with strategic partners and
analytical work in order to raise awareness, share knowledge and experiences and
promote learning for continuous improvement of CONACYT’s programs and Mexico’s
innovation system. Activities under this component would therefore be of capacity
building nature, and are grouped as follows: (A) Governance and Policy Development;
(B) Monitoring and Evaluation of Programs; (C) Support for Scholarship Policies; (D)
Promotion and Diffusion Activities; and (E) Project Coordination Unit.

1.6 Revised Components
The scope of the components was not changed, only amounts allocated to them as further
discussed below.

1.7 Other significant changes

The closing date of the project was extended from December 31, 2009 to December 31,
2010 to allow for the completion of project activities. Funding was reallocated between
different disbursement categories in April 2006, November 2007, and August 2009.
Reallocations reflected changes in demand for and the pace of implementation of
different project activities.

In category 1, the Goods amount was increased to finance institutional strengthening of
CONACYT through IT system enhancements. Examples of purchases include servers,
computers, and back-up systems, all of which allowed CONACYT to operate its
programs more safely and efficiently. Categories 2 and 3 (consultant services and
training) were reduced since the original amounts were overestimated. Part of the training
was conducted with counterpart funding, and the government decided to concentrate
resources more on priority areas after the global financial crisis. In category 4, resources
for Part A.1 (consortia and research networks) were reduced due to a slow start and
financing part of the activities through local funding (PROINNOVA), and resources for
part A.5 (researchers and technologists in industry) were decreased substantially due to
low private demand (see Annex 2 for details). Financing for Part B (scholarships) was
increased substantially, partially to cover existing commitments to international
scholarships that came under pressure due to the devaluation of the peso in late 2008. In
category 6, resources were transferred largely from the Unallocated category to cover
better-than-expected execution in Parts A.2, A.3, and A.4. Funding was also increased for
operating costs (category 6).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis. The background analysis in the PAD was adequate
and important lessons from a variety of sources were reflected in the design. Among
others, project design benefitted from lessons learned through prior World Bank STI
projects in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Korea; the Bank’s studies on “Mexico’s Transition
to a Knowledge Economy and “Closing the Gap on Education and Technology in Latin
America?; a S&T stocktaking workshop in November 2004, and an evaluation of the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) S&T lending. Examples of key lessons
incorporated in project design include:
    • Long-term strategic planning and a coherent vision is a prerequisite for effective
        lending in a sector that depends on the development of complex national
        innovation systems and access to advanced human capital.
    • “Matchmaking? and platforms between the public and private sectors for R&D
        initiatives is necessary.
    • STI projects should have a simple structure and avoid overload of components to
        satisfy different stakeholders in the national innovation system.
    • It is important to reach balance between establishing critical mass in the science
        and engineering base, and creating incentives for private R&D.
    • Fiduciary and safeguard procedures should be as responsive to the beneficiaries as
        possible in order to attract the private sector.


                                                         5
Assessment of project design. The objectives, components, and organization were all
appropriate. A single entity—CONACYT—was responsible for project implementation,
although two subcomponents required collaboration with NAFIN (development bank to
foster financing for private sector development) and the Ministry of Economy (Secretaría
de Economía). The number of components and institutional arrangements were feasible
given the relatively high capacity of CONACYT (compared to similar entities elsewhere
in LAC) and the Government of Mexico in general. As noted earlier, shortcomings
included some inconsistencies (i) between the PDO in the PAD and the legal agreement
and (i) between indicators referred to in the legal agreement and the PAD. In addition, the
selected outcome indicators were not closely linked to project activities or were not
appropriate to measure the impact of project interventions within such a short timeframe,
as discussed in section 2.3.

Adequacy of government’s commitment and participatory processes. Government
commitment, stakeholder consultations, and participation appear to have been adequate
during the design phase, as described in the PAD. Key stakeholders of Mexico’s STI
system were consulted during project design. Project design also benefitted from the
discussions held during the Knowledge Economy Conference that took place in
Monterrey, Mexico, in November 2004, which was sponsored together with the World
Bank Institute and included ample participation from Mexico´s STI sector.

Assessment of risks. The most important risks and mitigating measures were identified in
the PAD, including:
    • Potential shift in policy priorities following the change of Government in 2007.
    • Potential less demand than expected from private sector to engage in cooperative
       research consortia, and other collaborative private-public R&D activities.
    • Potential lack of transparency, management capacity and market knowledge in the
       Venture Capital fund.
    • Potential dilution of targeting of the Scholarships Program towards priority S&T
       fields.

The project, however, underestimated the risk of low demand by the private sector for
researchers.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)

Implementation of the project was relatively smooth, aside from some funding
reallocations across components. The demand for researchers in industry was much lower
than estimated during project design, and the launch of component A.1 to support the
development of public-private research networks and consortia was slowed down by the
change in government in 2007. Overall, the new government did not change its STI
policy priorities. Moreover, STI policies and programs have received greater attention



                                            6
and increased funding under the new government. The project was largely implemented
as originally designed and was never “at risk?.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. The design of the indicators was weak for the following reasons:
  • The outcome indicators referenced in the legal agreement and included in the
     results framework are not consistent with those defined in the main text.
  • Outcome indicators in the legal agreement and results framework (as well as those
     defined in the main text) were not sufficiently linked to project activities. As a
     result, despite successful implementation of most of the project components, most
     outcome indicators were not met, and changes in the outcome indicator that was
     satisfied cannot be attributed to project activities.
  • Baseline data was unclear or inaccurate in some cases.
  • Some of the outcome indicators defined in the main text does not include a target
     nor a baseline.
  • Excessive number of and complexity of indicators.

M&E implementation. Significant efforts were made to track the indicators throughout
the life of the project, including detailed monitoring by the project implementation unit
(PIU) and close supervision by the Bank team. However, there were some difficulties
gathering data on some of the indicators. Data for two output indicators identified in the
results framework was only collected during the mid-term evaluation and the beneficiary
surveys conducted at the end of the project; the beneficiary response rate on the latter was
low. A stronger culture of providing information on program outcomes among
beneficiaries is necessary.

M&E utilization. Weak results on the indicators for two of the subcomponents of
Component A (insertion of researchers in industry and formation of consortia) allowed
for timely identification of problem areas and actions to improve implementation and
reallocate funds to higher-performing subcomponents.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

No safeguard policies were triggered.

Procurement. Commercial practices were permitted for much of the procurement in
Component A given that private companies were the primary beneficiaries. Applying
Bank procurement rules to hundreds of subprojects managed by the private sector would
have created substantial bureaucratic obstacles, discouraged the participation of the
private sector, and taxed CONACYT’s ability to effectively manage the component.

The World Bank conducted adequate supervision of the project through conventional
instruments such as (i) a World Bank prior review of selected activities, and (ii) ex-post
reviews conducted in October 2006, November 2007 and November 2009 with an update
in March 2010. In addition, an external World Bank consultant carried out an


                                             7
Independent Procurement Review (IPR) shortly before the closing day of the Project in
December 2010.

The IPR covered the life of the project but concentrated the review on the last semester of
the project. It noted procurement shortcomings related to the following issues: lack of
coordination between areas within CONACYT that resulted in a failure to update the
signing date of at least one contract subject to prior review given the wrong impression
that the contract was signed before the no objection4; lack of capacity to develop short
lists; and very long periods to carry out procurement processes especially in the case of
non-consulting services where a new bidding document was used in a trial version. This
trial version required both the Bank’s no objection and the authorization from the
Ministry of Public Administration; the latter process caused delays.

On the government’s side, procurement was carried out under the supervision of the
Procurement Coordinator, who had wide experience in World Bank procurement, until
six months before the closing date when he resigned. This position was not replaced with
another expert with the adequate capacity and experience, causing delays in
implementing procurement processes.

Financial Management. During project implementation, the government’s financial
management (FM) systems were utilized for budgeting, accounting, internal control, and
auditing and reporting, among other things, to ensure effective implementation and
appropriate use of funds. Therefore, the FM arrangements were considered adequate to
provide reasonable assurance that the loan proceeds were being used for the intended
purposes. In addition, the FM team provided close follow-up ensuring that all project
funds financed by the Bank were actually incurred and/or delivered to the final
beneficiaries.

NAFIN, as financial agent, provided implementation support and oversight based on its
many years of experience with World Bank-financed projects, maintaining adequate
records and accounts to reflect the project’s operations and financial condition. Despite
the experience and good disposition of the financial agent, staff shortages caused some
delays in responses. The project was audited by an external private firm on an annual
basis and all reports were considered acceptable by the World Bank. Moreover,
throughout the life of the project, CONACYT prepared and submitted semi-annual
Financial Monitoring Reports, which were also considered acceptable.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

A three phase APL series was envisioned in the PAD. In January 2011, the Ministry of
Finance (SHCP) requested the second phase of the innovation series from the World
Bank. This second phase will help ensure that the steps taken during the first phase to
improve CONACYT’s policies and programs are sustainable and continue to be


4   Only one such case was found in the sample of contracts reviewed.



                                                       8
strengthened. The second phase will also likely address new areas, such as support for
research infrastructure and regional innovation initiatives.

The components supported by the project were fully integrated into CONACYT’s
ongoing operations. From a budgetary and staffing standpoint, all components are
sustainable since they will continue to be financed by budget allocations from the
Ministry of Finance.

Some of the programs supported by the project have been changed for technical reasons
to increase their effectiveness, because they are now being covered by complimentary
programs, or because they are being scaled up through related instruments. A brief
summary of the post-completion operation of the each of the project components is
described below:

Component 1: Business Innovation Promotion
  • 1(A). Consortia and Research Networks. Funding for the implementation of
     public-private research projects has been taken over by a program called
     PROINNOVA.
  • 1(B). Venture Capital Funding. The program has continued with an expanded
     funding base of approximately US$3 million provided by CONACYT. At the
     same time, NAFIN is already scaling up VC funding activities through the
     establishment of a “fund of funds?, which includes some funds with technological
     orientations (e.g., ICT). Some of these funds are already under operation (e.g.,
     Fondo de Nuevo León para la Innovación (FONLIN)).
  • 1(C). Pre-Competitive Fund. This program has been subject to some internal
     changes. In 2010, support for these activities was transferred to a different
     program within CONACYT (the Fondo de Innovación Tecnológica). More
     importantly, CONACYT is trying to scale up and systematize efforts to
     commercialize new scientific and technological developments by supporting the
     establishment of technology transfer offices.
  • 1(D). Sectoral Fund for Economic Development. This fund may undergo an
     internal realignment since two new programs—INNOVAPYME and
     INNOVATEC—are now supporting activities similar to what the fund used to
     finance.
  • 1(E). Researchers and Technologists in Industry. In 2009, operation of this
     initiative was shifted to the state level.

While the project did support multi-annual funding, new innovation programs
(PROINNOVA, INNOVAPYME, and INNOVATEC) created by CONACYT in 2009
restrict funding to yearly activities. There is a concern that this restriction may make it
more difficult for beneficiaries to undertake longer-term R&D initiatives.

The above changes to the business innovation programs were positive in the sense that
CONACYT was striving to continually improve their programs. However, in some cases
the changes generated confusion amongst actual or potential beneficiaries. A lesson
learned (see section 6) is that clear communication of program changes to beneficiaries is


                                            9
necessary, as well as ongoing communication to beneficiaries about the availability and
characteristics of funding mechanisms.

Component 2: Scholarships. This program has been operating within CONACYT for the
last few decades, and it will continue to operate and undergo incremental improvements.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening. Support for policy development, evaluations
and related activities will continue, particularly under the table leadership of
CONACYT’s directorate for information, evaluations, and norms.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of the objectives, design, and implementation of the project are high. The
objectives and design are completely aligned with the government’s 2007-2012 National
Development Plan.5 The World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2008-
2013 supports the government’s National Development Plan and enhancing the national
innovation system constitutes a critical element within the sustainable growth pillar of the
CPS FY2008-2013 as well as the CPS progress report issued in FY2010.

At a broader level, there is a growing consensus, particularly among middle and high
income countries, that promoting innovation is a critical way to increase national
competitiveness. This is reflected in recent World Bank publications such as Innovation
Policy: A Guide for Developing Countries (2010), Mexico’s Transition to a Knowledge-
Based Economy: Challenges and Opportunities (2008), Building Knowledge Economies:
Advanced Strategies for Development (2007), Natural Resources: Neither Curse nor
Destiny (2007), Closing the Gap in Education and Technology in LAC (2003), and
others. In other words, innovation is becoming more and more central to the growth and
development agenda. The specific interventions supported by the project are fully aligned
with the gaps and policy recommendations of the various studies of Mexico’s innovation
system undertaken by the World Bank and the OECD.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

As mentioned previously, there are some inconsistencies between the PDOs in the PAD
and the legal agreement and between the outcome indicators in the PDO text and the
results framework (Table 1). This section of the ICR uses the PDO in the legal
agreement, given that it takes precedence over the one in the PAD.6

According to the legal agreement: “The objective of the Project is to support the
Borrower’s efforts to improve the competitiveness of its economy through: (a)
strengthening CONACYT’s institutional capacity; and (b) supporting CONACYT’s

5
  See Eje 2, section 2.5, strategy 5.5: “Profundizar y facilitar los procesos de investigación científica, adopción e innovación
tecnológica para incrementar la productividad de la economía nacional?. Page 108.
6 The PDO contained in the Data Sheet is taken directly from the text in the PAD.




                                                                  10
existing grant and scholarship programs designed to increase the innovative capacity of
the Borrower’s private sector, accelerate advanced human capital formation, and
increase the international integration of the Borrower’s innovation system.?

On aggregate, the project did achieve the development objectives set out in the legal
agreement and the rating is Satisfactory. This rating is based on the success achieved by
the project in strengthening CONACYT’s institutional capacity as well as its programs to
promote business innovation and to improve the supply of advanced skills in science and
technology needed to enhance innovative capacity. Under the project, CONACYT’s
programs to promote business innovation met many of the targets/outputs in terms of
number of consortia established (linking enterprises with research centers and
universities); number of business lines supported through CONACYT’s competitive
funding lines; increase in private sector investment associated with the competitive
funding lines; as well as the number of projects that reached commercial stage and the
number of patents obtained. CONACYT’s programs to improve the supply of advanced
skills in science and technology were also successful in generating a large increase in the
number of students receiving master and doctorate scholarships in Mexico and abroad,
the majority of which are in science and technology-related fields, and all of which are
for study in high-ranking graduate programs. Under the project, CONACYT also
strengthened its capacity to monitor and evaluate these programs, which led to important
program improvements and restructurings.

The increase in the number of internationally published scientific articles surpassed
expectations, although these results cannot be fully attributed to the project given its time
frame as further explained below. The expected outcome of a substantial increase in
private R&D investment and in the hiring of researchers by enterprises were not fully
achieved, although private R&D did increase during project implementation and more
researchers with high degrees were hired. This does not detract from the satisfactory
rating of the project, because both outcomes are long-term outcomes, unlikely to be
achieved after a few years of project implementation. Moreover, the level of private
R&D investment in Mexico and the hiring of researchers by companies were constrained
by the economic impact of the global crisis, when private sector investment contracted by
17 percent in real terms.

The following paragraphs look separately at each component of the PDO. A more
detailed analysis is presented in Annex 2. This section of the ICR uses performance
indicators referred to in the legal agreement (which coincide with those in the results
framework) and summarized in Section F of the Data Sheet under (a) PDO Indicators and
(b) Intermediate Outcome Indicators. The indicators mentioned in the PDO text on page 6
of the PAD—many of which are not tracked in the results framework or linked to the
legal agreement—are not used to measure the achievement of the PDO.

a) Strengthening CONACYT’s institutional capacity (Satisfactory)

The capacity of CONACYT to promote business innovation was significantly
strengthened over the life of the project. When the project began, the business innovation



                                             11
directorate was in an incipient phase. At the close of the project, innovation promotion
programs were an integral part of CONACYT’s work and the programs had undergone
important improvements, restructurings, and evaluations, and many of them are being
scaled up. (Achievements of these programs are discussed below.) The National Program
for Quality Graduate Programs (Programa Nacional de Posgrados de Calidad , PNPC)
was also strengthened significantly during the life of the project, including increased
capacity to evaluate quality graduate programs, substantially increased numbers of
accredited graduate programs (from 680 in 2006 to 1304 in 2010), and greater
internationalization (see below).

CONACYT as a whole has also experienced institutional strengthening through a much
stronger policy, monitoring and evaluation directorate and an improved IT platform.
Improvements to the IT platform are enabling more up-to-date monitoring and efficient
management of CONACYT’s programs, as well as supporting the necessary data
repository to conduct more rigorous evaluations of the institution’s programs. Changes in
the structure and management of the Policy, Monitoring and Evaluation Directorate have
placed a much higher importance on evaluations, which was complemented by project
financing for several evaluations. All of the above institutional strengthening initiatives
either received financing from the project or continuous feedback during supervision
missions.

The intermediate outcome indicators (listed in the Data Sheet as indicators 15, 16, 17 and
20) count outputs instead of outcomes, but give a picture of the project's achievements in
this area. One indicator is the “number of policy studies and Monitoring and Evaluation
reports of CONACYT’s programs?. Although the number of policy studies and
evaluations conducted from 2006 through 2010 did not reach the quantitative target of 40,
the evaluations have covered all of CONACYT’s major programs--including
scholarships, Programa AVANCE (business innovation promotion programs supported in
Component 1), performance of the National Researchers System (SNI), fiscal incentives,
and a meta-evaluation of research and innovation promotion programs. The evaluation of
the fiscal incentives program received an award from the National Council for the
Evaluation of Social Development Policies (Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la
Política de Desarrollo Social, CONEVAL) for being a best practice evaluation within the
federal government. The methodology and findings of the study have been shared with
other countries within LAC and other regions of the Bank to help instill a greater M&E
culture of innovation policies and programs.

Examples of other studies conducted by CONACYT include (i) how to improve the
design of public policies for innovation, (ii) user satisfaction of regional development
programs, and (iii) the identification of factors that determine patenting decisions. An
example of strengthening of program management under the project is the appointment of
professional fund managers for the Venture Capital Fund that resulted in improved
performance of the fund. The fund managers have prior relevant experience, are subject
to clear accountability rules, and their remuneration is based on a combination of a fixed
and a performance-based fee.




                                            12
Another intermediate indicator is the number of state and regional seminars and
workshops for private sector competitiveness. Although the indicator is not particularly
meaningful, the number of workshops and seminars (155) well exceeds the target of 20.
Another indicator, the number of graduate programs evaluated by international
accreditation bodies, increased from zero in 2004 to 9 in 2010, compared to a target of 40
programs. The last indicator, the percentage of firms that are aware of CONACYT’s
programs, was supposed to increase from 2 percent to 5 percent. However, the data to
determine if the target had been met was not collected.

There are no PDO outcome indicators associated with this component of the PDO in the
PAD or legal agreement. However, the institutional strengthening component of the PDO
is rated Satisfactory based on the fact that CONACYT’s business innovation programs
were strengthened substantially, as were the National Program for Quality Graduate
Programs, M&E activities, and the IT platform.

b) Supporting CONACYT’s existing grant and scholarship programs designed to
increase b.1) the innovative capacity of the Borrower’s private sector, b.2)
accelerate advanced human capital formation, and b.3) increase the international
integration of the Borrower’s innovation system. (Satisfactory)

Project achievements under the three areas (b.1, b.2, and b.3) that comprise this
component of the PDO are discussed below.

b.1) Increase the innovative capacity of the Borrower’s private sector (Moderately
Satisfactory)

The project’s contribution to increase the innovative capacity of the private sector was
moderately satisfactory, although it did generate a positive demonstration effect to
private enterprises through its interventions.
The intermediate outcome indicators of this sub-component (listed in the Data Sheet as
indicators 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) were largely met. These indicators are a mix of
outcomes and outputs. They are closely linked to the project interventions and provide a
good indication of the contribution of the project to increase the innovative capacity of
the private sector. The main project achievements based on these indicators are
summarized below.

The program to establish research consortia between universities/technology centers and
enterprises got off to a slow start due in part to the learning curve entailed in launching a
new instrument to stimulate private sector innovation. However, the ultimate results in
terms of consortia created and strengthened vastly exceeded expectations. A substantial
number of public-private research consortia (48) were created with project funds
integrating 173 companies, which surpassed the project target (of 8 consortia and 24
companies) by a large margin. In 2009, CONACYT scaled up the consortia program by
launching a new initiative, PROINNOVA. The loan continued to finance activities under
Mode A and counterpart funds under PROINNOVA financed activities under Mode B.
The latest available information is that a total of 259 consortia were established between



                                             13
2006 and 2010, involving 287 companies. This constitutes an important achievement
given Mexico’s weak tradition of collaboration between universities and industry and the
complexity of bringing together institutions with such different incentives and culture.

The number of new business lines supported through the venture capital (VC) fund,
Emprendedores, (34) nearly attained the project’s target (40), and private sector
investment leveraged was US$36 million, close to the target of US$39 million. Overall,
the fund leveraged 2.5 dollars of private investment for each dollar of public investment
(Table A.2).

The number of projects that reached commercial stage with support from the Pre-
competitive Fund (at least 20) exceeded the target (15). The output figure is an estimate
based on the 2008 evaluation, and the actual number is likely to be substantially higher.
The evaluation also indicates that 14 new jobs, mainly high skilled, were created per
beneficiary. The Pre-competitive Fund and the VC fund were small but had important
demonstration effects. The Pre-competitive fund was a critical instrument to provide
funding to help researchers/entrepreneurs accomplish the “last mile? to move to the
commercialization stage. Its complement, Emprendedores, was the first VC fund focused
on technology companies. These pilot initiatives are now being scaled up through a
variety of instruments by CONACYT (see Annex 2).

Total private sector investment for innovation leveraged through the Sectoral Innovation
Fund with the Secretaría de Economía was double the target. Sixty nine patents were
reported in the final project survey, but only two thirds of beneficiaries participated in the
survey and only half provided information on the issue. This number is a low boundary
and the actual number of patents registered is very likely to be substantially higher. The
program that substantially underperformed expectations was the insertion of doctoral and
masters graduates as researchers in industry. This was likely due to shortcomings in the
program design: hindsight showed that the demand for PhDs in Mexican firms is quite
modest and that alternative and more comprehensive instruments should be considered
for facilitating the insertion of researchers in industry.7

The PDO indicators of this component (PDO indicators 1 and 2 in the Data Sheet) are an
increase in private R&D as a percentage of GDP from 15 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in
2009 and an increase in the proportion of private R&D in total R&D from 39 percent in
2004 to 46 percent in 2009. Although these targets were not met, private R&D increased
on average by 6.2 percent in real terms from 2004 through 2008 (Table 2). Actual private
R&D investment amounts for 2009 are not yet available. Most likely, private R&D
investment was strongly affected by the global financial crisis during 2009, particularly
since overall private investment in Mexico fell by 17 percent in real terms during that

7 For example, some of the innovation projects supported by the Sectoral Fund implemented together with

Secretaria de Economia comprised the establishment of new R&D laboratories in industry which included the
insertion of researchers and technologists. The consortia networks supported by the project and other
CONACYT programs have also contributed to the insertion of researchers and technologists in industry.




                                                   14
time. It is reasonable to assume that many firms deferred their R&D investments due to
serious external and internal financing constraints, and private R&D investment would
have increased more substantially in the absence of the global crisis.

Private R&D as percentage of total R&D showed an increasing trend from 2004 through
2006 but the rate declined in 2008 (Table 3). The ratio decline is due to a boost in public
sector R&D investments as STI programs gained a higher profile in the government’s
policy agenda. The ratio is likely to have declined again in 2009 because of the
contraction in private sector investment in the midst of the global crisis, which was
counterbalanced by increased public funding for STI.

     Indicators                              2004     2005      2006     2007      2008*
     Enterprise and private non-profit R&D
     (millions of constant 2009 pesos)       17,632   20,189   20,831   21,031     22,419
     Private R&D as % of total R&D             39%      42%       45%        45%     42%
     Private R&D as a % of GDP               0.15%    0.17%     0.17%    0.16%     0.17%
     * Estimated

Judged by these indicators, the project did not achieve the expected impact. However, the
scale of project interventions (US$11 million per year) is not commensurate with the
targeted improvement in the proportion of R&D investment in the national total, which
would have required an additional US$700 million in private R&D investments per year.
Moreover, some of the programs supported by the project were not directly aimed at
increasing private sector R&D, but to facilitate private sector innovation by providing
venture capital fund for high technology companies and grants to help products/services
accomplish the “last mile? to move to the commercialization phase. The intermediate
outcome indicators discussed above are a better indication of the positive contribution of
the project to increase the innovative capacity of the private sector.

b.2) Accelerate advanced human capital formation (Satisfactory)

The project met the project objective of accelerating human capital formation by
expanding scholarships in high ranking graduate programs in demand-oriented areas.
The intermediate outcome indicators of this sub-component of the PDO (listed in the
Data Sheet as indicators 11, 12, and 13) were largely met. Between 2006 and 2010,
CONACYT awarded 72,888 scholarships, of which roughly two-thirds were in science
and technology. About 67 percent of scholarships were awarded for master programs and
29 percent for PhD programs, and the number of scholarships awarded grew steadily
from 10,027 in 2006 to 21,019 in 2010 (Figure 1). The Bank project financed roughly
half of those scholarships (35,282), 83 percent of which were in science and technology.
In addition, the percentage of scholarships allocated to demand-oriented programs


                                              15
increased substantially reaching 66 percent of the total, just short of the output target of
70 percent. All national scholarships are allocated to high ranking programs under the
National Program for Quality Graduate Programs (Programa Nacional de Posgrados de
Calidad, PNPC), surpassing the project’s output target of 90 percent. The performance
of the PNPC has also improved substantially in recent years, in particular the process for
evaluating and classifying graduate programs. However, both of these indicators present
shortcomings since they are only partially linked to project interventions.

The PDO indicator for this sub-component—number of researchers per thousand
employment—(PDO indicator 3 in the Data Sheet) increased by 25 percent between 2004
and 2009, reflecting a positive trend, but still fell short of the target defined in the results
framework. The target assumed that the number of researchers would increase by 66
percent, corresponding to an increase of roughly 30,000 researchers (based on a
workforce of about 45 million).

There are several explanations for why the PDO target was not realistic. First, there is a
lag between the provision of a scholarship and the entry of the beneficiary in the labor
market. The lag concerns both master and PhD scholarships but is substantially higher for
the latter (between 4 to 6 years). As a consequence, despite the accelerating trend in the
provision of scholarships for advanced human capital, a substantial number of these have
not yet completed their studies and were not reflected in the numbers of employed
researchers in 2009 (latest available). At best, the 2009 numbers could reflect the results
of master scholarships awarded during 2006 and 2007 (and earlier years) and doctoral
scholarships awarded in 2005 or earlier (i.e., before the project started implementation in
2006). Second, a substantial number of the scholarships granted correspond to masters,
and not all master students in technology fields are employed as researchers. They are
also employed by industry in the production process, government institutions, health
centers, middle education, etc (Table 4). In sum, the selected outcome indicator on
advanced human capital formation could only partially capture project achievements.

 b.3) Increase the international integration of the Borrower’s innovation system
(Satisfactory)

The project’s objective of increasing the international integration of the innovation
system was achieved. The targets of the intermediate outcome indicators (listed in the
Data Sheet as indicators 14 and 18) have been partly met. The percentage of international
scholarships allocated increased three-fold from 4 percent to 12 percent, a substantial
increase, although it fell short of the 20 percent target. However, the number of students
studying abroad under collaborative agreements between national and foreign programs,
including becas mixtas, reached 720, much higher than the target of 320. Moreover, there
has been a significant internationalization of the National Program for Quality Graduate
Programs (PNPC), inter alia through the incorporation of international experts in the
evaluation process to include graduate programs in the PNPC; increased scholarships for
students and professors to undertake a portion of their work internationally; enhanced
linkages with international doctoral programs; and the inclusion of students from other
LAC countries in PNPC graduate programs.

The PDO outcome indicator for this subcomponent—increase in the number of
internationally published scientific articles—(PDO indicator 4 in the Data Sheet) was
exceeded. However, it is difficult to attribute most of this achievement to project
activities due to the substantial lag between project interventions and final outcomes. For
example, the increased internalization of scholarships is bound to raise the number of
internationally published articles by enhancing the international exposure of doctoral
students as well as professors who benefitted from them. But, the substantial lag between
the intervention (initiation of doctoral studies with the scholarship’s support) and the
outcome (publication of the research work) makes it unlikely that the project could have
influenced the target substantially within such a short period.

(PNPC).


3.3 Efficiency

Cost effectiveness. The Project was cost effective and made use of a very light
administrative structure. The costs of the project coordination unit were 0.56 percent of
the total amount of the loan.

The economic and financial analysis in the PAD focused on international evidence of the
returns to investments in R&D and overcoming market failures such as uncertainty of
outcome; the need for collaboration among many institutions and firms for innovation,
diffusion, and application; information asymmetries; appropriability problems; lumpiness
and scale economies; and tacit knowledge. No formal efficiency analysis was presented
in the PAD, nor is one possible at this time given the nature of the project interventions—
primarily matching grants to firms and scholarships. The project components actively
addressed the market failures outlined in the PAD and the innovation interventions were
in line with the literature and international best practices on the most efficient way to
promote business innovation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating



                                                       18
Rating: Satisfactory.
The introduction to Section 3.2 highlights the bigger picture about why the project is
deemed as successful. Additional considerations for this rating are that the relevance of
the project objectives and its design was high and closely linked to Mexico’s National
Development Plan and the World Bank’s CPS. The efficiency of the project, to the extent
that it can be estimated, was also high since the interventions conform to international
best practice and were grounded on solid analysis. The achievement of the PDO is also
considered satisfactory on the basis of the intermediate outcome indicators, which can be
considered as proxies for the four subcomponents of the PDO and are closely associated
to the project’s interventions. By contrast, all four PDO outcome indicators present only
partial links to project activities either because of a substantial lag between the program
intervention and the proposed outcome or the project’s activities were too small to
reasonably assume that they could stimulate improvements of the scale necessary to meet
the targets. Consequently, they cannot be utilized to measure the PDO achievement
within such a short timeframe. It is expected that a stronger assessment can be made at
the end of the APL series when a longer time framework will show the full impact of the
interventions.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project did not focus explicitly on any of these elements.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

See section 3.2.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

As mentioned in section 5.1(b), as part of supervision activities, the World Bank team
organized a study tour for high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Economy and
CONACYT to Washington, DC in April 2010. The delegation considered the visit to be a
very worthwhile learning experience that highlighted models of how Mexico could
strengthen its innovation system at the national and state levels. Mexican officials were
also able to make strategic connections with their counterparts in the U.S. This can be
considered a very positive impact that was not part of the original project design.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

The vast majority of the Project consisted of grants to the private sector to undertake
innovative projects and scholarships for masters and PhD students. For the grants to the



                                            19
private sector, there is negligible risk to the development outcome because the innovative
capacity of the private sector was increased by the mere fact that the projects were
undertaken. (Undertaking innovative projects and R&D produces knowledge and
capacity-building benefits regardless of whether the project is ultimately commercially
successful.) For the scholarships, the risk to development outcome is negligible since the
human capital has already been created.

The risk to the development outcome of increased international integration of the
Mexican innovation system is low for two reasons. The first is that international
cooperation is becoming increasingly ingrained at a decentralized level, including
through university to university exchanges of students and researchers. The second
reason is that CONACYT continues to prioritize increased internationalization,
particularly through its National Program for Quality Graduate Programs as well as its
international scholarships. The third reason is that CONACYT is promoting increased
participation of Mexican STI institutions in the European Union Framework Agreement
Programs as well as other bilateral collaborations with firms and research institutions in
various countries.

For the outcome of strengthened institutional capacity within CONACYT, the risk is
higher than the other areas, but still relatively low. Staff turnover could mean loss of tacit
knowledge about how programs can and should function. On the other hand, CONACYT
is a professional organization where programs function according to established rules and
guidelines, many of which have been strengthened with assistance from the Project.
These improvements are unlikely to be easily undone, even assuming changes in staff.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
As noted in previous sections, all World Bank inputs concerning the project’s strategic
relevance and its technical design were sound. The project was strongly linked to the
Government’s strategy of enhancing Mexico’s competitiveness through investments in
innovation. The design of the project and its specific components considered the lessons
learned from previous World Bank projects in Mexico and other high middle income
countries as well as the experiences of other OECD countries with policies and programs
to foster STI. The project’s risk assessment as well as the design of fiduciary and
implementation arrangements was also satisfactory.

The rating was downgraded from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory due to the issues
listed below:
     • Shortcomings in the definition of a sound monitoring and evaluation framework.
        Examples include project outcome indicators that were not linked to project
        activities or that had a timeframe that was inconsistent with the life of the project,
        and inconsistencies between the indicators in the PDO text and the results
        framework.


                                             20
   •   Shortcomings in the design of the Researchers and Technologists in Industry
       Program (subcomponent 1.E / A.5). This subcomponent would have benefitted
       from more careful assessment of the demand for PhDs in Mexican firms during
       project design. The importance of this shortcoming in the overall quality at entry
       rating is relatively small given that the subcomponent accounted for only 5
       percent of the original project budget, and the project elected to take an innovative
       approach in a field where knowledge on good practices is still evolving.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory
World Bank supervision maintained a continuous focus on development impact.
Supervision missions routinely incorporated a multisectoral team as well as an
internationally renowned expert to provide feedback on the private sector innovation
programs (Component 1), given that they have historically been in more of a
developmental phase than the scholarship programs (Component 2). Supervision
missions consistently provided feedback on how to improve program performance and
make adjustments midstream to areas that were underperforming. Supervision also
focused on providing feedback related to institutional strengthening, for instance in the
area of strategic planning for the national innovation system. Aide memoires were candid
and comprehensive in their treatment of areas for improvement.

The midterm review conducted in April 2008 included a comprehensive review of all
project activities. The review resulted in quick adjustments to improve the performance
of some components as well as recommendations geared toward improving the longer-
term performance of others. For example, recommendations for Component 1 (Business
Innovation) included, inter alia, establish systematic project tracking mechanisms and
increase emphasis on impact indicators; intensify dissemination efforts at the regional
level to stimulate demand for the programs; and further decentralize activities where
possible.

Several of the recommendations were adopted during the last years of the project. In
particular, since late 2008, CONACYT has established an electronic monitoring system
for all programs to promote Business Innovation that allows it to track progress on
monitoring indicators from the start of the activity. This system has been applied to calls
for proposals issued since mid-2008 and progressively adopted to some of the earlier
ones. As a result of the midterm review, CONACYT also agreed to conduct surveys of
beneficiaries from Business Innovation programs at the end of the project. The surveys
were conducted on-line, but the response rate was not as high as expected. In the future,
consideration should be given to face-to-face surveys even if they are more costly. In
addition, as a result of the midterm review and the evaluation of the scholarships program
supported by Component 3, CONACYT started to implement measures to strengthen the
monitoring of this program and its impact. As a starting point, CONACYT has
strengthened the relationship with students and universities where scholarship
beneficiaries are studying and is paying closer attention to the quarterly reports that
students present. CONACYT is also developing a tracking system that will allow it to
monitor more closely the insertion of scholarship recipients in the labor market.


                                            21
Improvements, e.g. enhanced project tracking and a heightened focus on M&E, are
expected to be sustained well beyond the end of the project.

As part of the project supervision activities, the World Bank team organized a study tour
for high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Economy and CONACYT to Washington,
DC in April 2010. The purpose of the trip was for the delegation to learn about how U.S.
institutions promote innovation, R&D, technology transfer, and SME development, as
well as to discuss U.S.-Mexico collaboration possibilities. The delegation included the
vice-minister of economy and her advisor, the director general of CONACYT, and
several of CONACYT´s deputy directors. The delegation was highly satisfied with the
visit. They considered it to be a very worthwhile learning experience that highlighted
models of how Mexico could strengthen its innovation system at the national and state
levels. It also allowed the Mexican officials to make strategic connections with their
counterparts in the U.S.

Supervision of fiduciary aspects was satisfactory, with active engagement by financial
management and procurement specialists throughout the duration of the project.

Regarding transition arrangements, the programs supported by the Project are all part of
CONACYT’s ongoing operations and budget (even though they have undergone
reorganizations in some cases as mentioned in Section 2.5). As a result, few transition
arrangements were required. The Bank is working with CONACYT to define what areas
will continue to be supported under the second phase of the APL and what new areas will
be included.

In summary, Bank supervision can be considered satisfactory given that, inter alia: a) the
team proactively made a series of changes agreed upon with the client, e.g. reallocations
and through the midterm review, to ensure that project implementation was successful; b)
the team consistently added value through expert advice on all aspects of CONACYT’s
programs throughout the life of the project; and c) the team organized a highly successful
study tour for top Mexican government officials to learn about innovation programs in
the U.S, which has had an impact on the design of new programs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Given that the bulk of quality at entry elements was satisfactory, as was the quality of
supervision, overall World Bank performance is considered satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Although the implementing agency, CONACYT, was the principal interlocutor with the
World Bank on the project, Nacional Financiera (NAFIN), the Ministry of Economy
(Secretaría de Economía) and the Ministry of Finance (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito
Público, SHCP) all played a role in contributing to the achievement of the development
objectives. Their performance and that of the government as a whole was satisfactory.
NAFIN executed their responsibilities well in terms of serving as the designated financial


                                            22
agency for the project, particularly in terms of overseeing financial management,
procurement, and administering the Fondo Emprendedores (Component 1.B). The SHCP
provided the necessary budgetary allocations (subject to some limitations on consultant
expenditures) and institutional commitment, and participated in all missions. The
Ministry of Economy jointly administered the Fondo de Innovación Tecnológica
(Component 1.D) with CONACYT. It also played an oversight role of the operation as
the chair of the board of CONACYT, which created linkages between the business
innovation programs and strategies of the Ministry of Economy and CONACYT. The
enabling environment for the project in terms of supportive macro, sectoral, and
institutional policies was adequate.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall, CONACYT’s performance was satisfactory. The agency was committed to
achieving the development objectives, with a particular improvement seen on its
commitment to Component 1 over the life of the project. Implementation of some of the
programs, particularly within Component 1 (e.g. the research consortia program), got off
to a slow start. This can largely be attributed to the change of government that occurred at
the start of the Project as well as the learning curve associated with the launch of a new
policy instrument. (The PAD had already identified the potential slowdown due to the
government transition as a risk.) After a new management team came on board,
implementation progress picked up again.

CONACYT counterparts were always open and willing to work with the World Bank
team to improve performance. Key staff were appointed in a timely manner and always
professional. Some procurement issues were encountered (see Section 2.4) and generally
resolved in a collaborative way between CONACYT and the World Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Both the government and implementing agency performed satisfactorily, as described
above.

6. Lessons Learned

General applicability
• Clear communication of program changes to beneficiaries: Clear communication is
   needed with potential beneficiaries about the availability and characteristics of
   funding mechanisms. Frequent changes in such mechanisms can be confusing for
   potential applicants. CONACYT made a number of changes to its programs and
   instruments during the life of the Project. This was positive in the sense that it was
   striving to continually improve, but generated confusion amongst many actual or
   potential beneficiaries interviewed during project supervision.
• Monitoring and evaluation: The outcome indicators should not have only conceptual
   relevance to the project development objectives but also have realistic causal links
   with project activities and be realistic with respect to the time it takes for some
   government interventions to produce the expected results, particularly when it comes


                                            23
    to private investment decisions (see sections 2.3 and 3.2). In addition, realistic
    monitoring mechanisms should be determined during project preparation and
    implemented at the start of the project. Periodic beneficiary surveys are needed to
    track the results of project grants in real time, rather than just at the end of the project
    (see sections 2.3 and 3.2).
•   Beneficiary surveys need personal interview element. Beneficiary surveys that are
    solely conducted online run the risk of getting a low response rate. For this reason,
    any online component should be complemented by personal interviews with
    beneficiaries to ensure that a critical mass of complete responses is obtained.
•   Knowledge exchange on international good practices can be highly valued by
    middle income clients. In more developed client countries such as Mexico,
    knowledge services are seen as a key reason for engagement with the Bank. For
    instance, the government considered a study tour organized by the Bank team for
    high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Economy and CONACYT to Washington,
    DC to be a very worthwhile learning experience. The study tour highlighted models
    of how Mexico could strengthen its innovation system at the national and state levels
    and Mexican officials were able to make strategic connections with their counterparts
    in the U.S.

Specific to Innovation Programs
• Flexibility in project design: Investment loans that include the private sector as
   important project beneficiaries need to take into account commercial practices.
   Applying World Bank procurement rules to hundreds of subprojects managed by the
   private sector would have generated bureaucratic obstacles and discouraged private
   sector participation.
• Need for multi-year funding for large scale R&D programs. Funding for innovation
   projects in firms, research centers, and universities should be multi-annual because it
   is very difficult to complete the necessary research and development activities within
   the short period of a year. Limiting support to annual funding also imposes a heavy
   “tax? on the public institution supporting the program as well as the public and
   private beneficiaries that have to regularly apply for small grants diverting their time
   and resources from productive research activities. While the project did support
   multi-annual funding, new innovation programs created by CONACYT in 2009
   restrict funding to yearly activities. This restriction makes it more difficult for
   beneficiaries to undertake longer-term R&D initiatives. The practice in other OECD
   countries is to combine multi-annual funding with performance targets and close
   monitoring by the public institution administering the program, which allows for
   prompt reallocation of resources if the beneficiary’s performance is suboptimal.
 • Insertion of researchers in firms. When aiming to facilitate the insertion of doctoral
   graduates in firms, innovative mechanisms are needed, as well as realism in terms of
   potential demand from the private sector. The labor market insertion program for
   PhDs financed by the project had worthwhile objectives and was a valuable learning
   experience. However, it drastically underperformed expectations. In the future,
   alternative instruments should be considered to foster linkages between PhD students
   and firms, such as encouraging students to collaborate with firms on their theses and



                                              24
    dissertations, and for collaborative research consortia involving industry and other
    programs aimed at increasing private R&D to engage PhD students.
•   Learning curve of collaborative research programs. The launch of new instruments
    aimed at stimulating private sector innovation entails a learning curve and takes time.
    The formation of public-private research consortia can be particularly lengthy due to
    difficulties in developing partnerships among institutions with different cultures and
    incentives. Such a process can take a year or two. The public sector agency
    sponsoring the program can facilitate the consortia formation by sharing lessons
    learned from other countries with similar experiences, including options for managing
    intellectual property rights emanating from the consortia.
•   Need for professional management of venture capital fund managers: Venture
    capital funds financed by government entities should have significant private
    participation, including professional management from the private sector with clear
    accountability and robust performance incentives. The performance of the
    Emprendedores Venture Capital Fund has improved following the appointment of
    professional fund managers. The fund managers have prior relevant experience, are
    subject to clear accountability rules, and remuneration is based on a combination of a
    fixed and a performance-based fee.
•   Need to consolidate some of the program. The Sectoral Fund for Economic
    Development (renamed as Technology Innovation Fund) and INNOVAPYME and
    INNOVATEC support similar activities. It would be desirable to integrate some of
    these funds to reduce administrative costs, and simplify access and prevent confusion
    among potential beneficiaries.

Parts A-C) instead of that used in the PAD (Components 1-3).

Part A. Business Innovation Promotion (US$54.5 million)
A.1 Consortia and Research Networks (US$1.7 million)
This subcomponent financed grants to support collaborative research programs between
universities/technology centers and enterprises. The grants financed start-up expenses for
the creation of the consortia (Mode A), including the development of a joint research
agenda, and the implementation of the research agenda (Mode B). The loan financed 48
total grants to consortia through the calls-for-proposals published in 2007 and 2008.
Forty-five of the grants fell in Mode A and 3 in Mode B. These 48 projects included
linkages with 173 firms, 84 higher education institutions, and 77 research centers (Table
A.1). The most common sectors that received support were aeronautics, biotechnology,
manufacturing, and automotive.

A beneficiary survey was undertaken at the end of the project and 17 out of 19 consortias
contacted responded. According to the survey respondents, the most common outcomes
of the consortia grants were the development of prototypes and new products (47% each),
followed by the development of new services and reduction in production costs (29%
each).

In 2009, CONACYT decided to scale up and institutionalize collaborative research
between industry and research institutes through a new program PROINNOVA.
Following its launch, the loan continued to finance activities under Mode A and
counterpart funds under PROINNOVA financed activities under Mode B. During 2009-
2010, PROINNOVA supported 244 consortia projects involving 244 firms, 344 higher
education institutions, and 147 research centers. In addition, in 2009, CONACYT
launched another initiative together with the government of Spain to start internalization
research consortia. During 2009 and 2010, this initiative supported 12 consortia /research
networks in areas such as ICT and biotechnology.

The indicators for this subcomponent are shown in Table A.2 below. The data combines
results from the consortia financed by the loan, government’s financing under
PROINNOVA, and the Mexico-Spain initiative. Although this subcomponent got off to a
slow start, the ultimate results in terms of consortia created and strengthened vastly
exceeded expectations. This was largely due to the combination of loan resources with
counterpart financing through PROINNOVA and the Mexico-Spain initiative, which built
on the groundwork financed by the loan.

A.2 Venture Capital Funding (US$8.4 million)
This subcomponent provided grants to support the venture capital fund (Emprendedores)
that CONACYT administers jointly with NAFIN. Emprendedores was the first Mexican
fund focusing on high technology companies. It was established in 2004 with support
from a previous World Bank project (Knowledge and Innovation Project, Loan No: 4349-
ME). Funding from the current project allowed the expansion and maturation of the fund,
which invested in 34 firms between 2006 and 2010. Table A.3 summarizes the indicators
for the subcomponent and Table A.4 the investments, including the amount of
complementary investments made by the private sector. The amount of private resources
leveraged was 2.5 times the resources invested by the fund.

Two recent developments improved the performance of the fund. First, the increased
publicity received through the Innovation for Competitiveness Forum in January 2009 in
Mexico City has expanded the deal flow. This led to 12 new investments in 2009
compared with 6 the previous year. Second, day-to-day management of the fund was
transferred to professional venture fund managers in the private sector in February 2009,
which improved efficiency.

At the close of the project, 4 firms were in the process of exiting (or have already exited)
the fund, a desirable process that is part of the natural cycle of a VC fund. In two of the
cases, the ownership stake of the VC fund was being bought back by the entrepreneur,
and in the other two the stake was being purchased by a third party. In one of the cases of
purchase by a third party, CONACYT’s share was purchased for 73% more than it
originally invested.

A.3 Pre-Competitive Fund (US$20.4 million)
The purpose of this subcomponent was to provide grants to firms and research centers to
help transform scientific and technological developments into viable high value products
and services. In other words, the grants would help products/services accomplish the “last
mile? to move to the commercialization phase. The program, known as Ultima Milla
(Last Mile), supported 184 projects between 2003 and 2009. Of those, 111 were
associated with this World Bank loan, corresponding to the 2005-2007 calls for
proposals. The most common sectors supported were chemicals, design and
manufacturing, health, biotechnology, and ICT. According to an impact evaluation done
by ITAM (a Mexican university) in 2008, 20 projects had reached a commercial stage,
82% had developed new products, and an average of 14 new jobs was created per
beneficiary. Table A.5 contains the indicators for this subcomponent.

A beneficiary survey was undertaken at the end of the project to measure outcomes;
however the response rate was very low. The survey combined results for the Venture
Capital Fund (Emprendedores) and Ultima Milla, and out of 196 beneficiaries contacted
(43 for Emprendedores and 153 for Ultima Milla), only 15 complete responses were
received. Hence, results can not necessarily be considered representative. According to
the survey, 44% of the respondents’ projects concluded successfully and 50% are still in
development. Only 1% of respondents categorized their project as concluded without
success. 50% of the firms said that they would not have undertaken the innovation
without the support of CONACYT, while 100% of firms felt that the support they
received helped them undertake the innovation more rapidly. 97% of respondents felt that
the support helped them do a better job of undertaking the innovation.

* These numbers are based on the 2008 ITAM evaluation, which only included a subset of project
beneficiaries, so actual results are likely higher. The beneficiary survey done at the end of the project was
intended to update the numbers, but the very low response rate of 15 beneficiaries yielded fewer results
than the 2008 evaluation.

Ultima Milla was a positive pilot experience. The program has undergone some recent
evolutions as part of a broader strategy to scale up efforts to commercialize research and
technology developments. In 2009, CONACYT began piloting the program at the state
level. The first states to incorporate it in their S&T programs have been Nuevo León,
Estado de México, and Baja California. In 2010, support at the national level for the
creation of new businesses was shifted under the umbrella of the Fondo de Innovación
Tecnológica (see subcomponent A.4 below). In addition, CONACYT plans to further
scale up efforts to commercialize research by fostering the development of technology
transfer offices, which would be           intermediaries specialized in facilitating the
commercialization of technologies developed by universities, firms or public-private
partnerships through licensing or the creation of new ventures. These intermediaries are
largely missing within Mexico’s national innovation. The program will be launched in
2011.

A.4 Sectoral Fund for Economic Development (US$23.4 million)
This subcomponent financed matching-grants to companies to support innovation and
technological development projects. The fund, known as the Fondo de Innovación
Tecnológica, was jointly administered by CONACYT and the Ministry of Economy. The
fund supported 397 projects between 2005 and 2010, and this WB loan financed 132 of
the 151 projects that were part of the 2007-2008 calls-for-proposals. The most common
sectors that received support were food, electronics, chemicals, and ICT. Indicators for
this component are shown below (Table A.6).

* According to the beneficiary survey, 69 patents were registered but only a two-thirds of beneficiaries
participated in the survey and only half answered this part of the questionnaire. If the number reported is
extrapolated to the rest of beneficiaries, the number of patents could be as high as 138.

In 2009, the government created two new programs with substantial resources,
INNOVAPYME and INNOVATEC, to replace a tax incentives program. These new

programs financed similar activities as the Fondo de Innovación Tecnológica, prompting
some shifts in the focus of the Fondo towards gazelle firms and the creation of new high
value-added businesses (similar to Ultima Milla described above). These new focus areas
for 2009 and 2010 were not financed by resources from the World Bank loan, as the
resources had already been committed during the 2007-2008 calls for proposals. Table
A.7 summarizes the number of projects and amounts financed by the Fondo de
Innovación Tecnológica, INNOVAPYME, and INNOVATEC between 2005 and 2010.

At the close of the Project, a beneficiary survey was undertaken for firms that
participated in the 2007 and 2008 calls-for-proposals for the Fondo de Innovación
Tecnológica. Out of the 151 firms contacted, 97 responses were received, although 25 of
the responses were incomplete. Respondents reported that 67% of the projects concluded
successfully and 29% were still under development. Only 1% of projects had concluded
unsuccessfully and 3% were suspended. In terms of the financial structure of the projects,
roughly 50% of the costs were financed from the firms’ own resources, almost 40% came
from CONACYT, and the remainder came mainly from bank credit and other investors.
Table A.8 shows the type and frequency of innovation results obtained according to the
beneficiary survey. The fund had resulted in (i) development of new products for about
70% of respondents and (ii) development of new processes for about 45%. More than
40% had increased sales and participation in markets and 30% had reduced production
costs.

A.5 Researchers and Technologists in Industry (US$0.5 million)
This subcomponent provides grants to graduates of science and technology master and
doctoral programs to promote their insertion in the labor market. The program, known as
IDEA in Spanish, financed grants for 84 researchers through the 2006, 2007, and 2008
calls-for-proposals. Of the 84, 49 received financing from the WB loan and 61 were hired
full-time by the firms after the subsidies to their salary ended. The results generated in the
research projects that the master and doctoral graduates were hired to work on are
summarized in Table A.9.

Far fewer masters and doctoral graduates and firms participated in this program than
were anticipated in the PAD. (The PAD had a target of 1000 doctoral and master


                                                       33
graduates incorporated into companies.) In 2009, this program was shifted to the states in
an attempt to give it more traction. The program has had slightly more traction at the
state level. Alternative approaches to facilitate the insertion of researchers in industry
need to be considered, such as encouraging students to collaborate with firms on their
theses and dissertations and for collaborative research consortia involving industry to
engage master and doctoral students.

Part B. Scholarships (US$185.8 million)

This component provided scholarship grants for master and doctoral students to study
both in Mexico and abroad. As shown in Figure A.1, the number of scholarships awarded
by CONACYT for postgraduate studies grew steadily from 10,027 in 2006 to 21,019 in
2010, for a total of 72,888 scholarships during that time. This WB project financed
roughly half, or 35,282, of those scholarships. Of the 35,282 scholarships financed by the
Project, about 83% or 29,118 were in science and technology. The rest were in the
humanities and social areas. Overall, roughly two thirds of the 72,888 scholarships
awarded by CONACYT were in science and technology.

As noted in section 3.2, the component results (i.e. output) targets for this component
have been exceeded in some cases and almost met in others. The number of doctoral
graduates in S&T and the percentage of national scholarships in high ranking graduate


                                               34
programs exceeded the targets. The percentage scholarships allocated to demand-oriented
programs increased from 0% in 2004 to 66% in 2010, falling just short of the target of
70%. The percentage of international scholarships allocated increased from 4% in 2004
to 13% in 2010, a substantial increase even though it did not attain the target of 20%.
(See Table A.11.)

During the life of the WB project, the scholarship program became increasingly targeted
to strategic areas of study. In 2008, a new set of program guidelines was published
orienting the program toward strategic areas and permitting integration with regional
development. Since 2009, CONACYT has held competitions jointly with some states to
award international scholarships in areas considered regional priorities. The scholarships
were co-financed by CONACYT and the participating states.

Over the last few years, CONACYT has continued to make progress on the
internationalization of the scholarships program as well as post-graduate programs in
general. Besides increasing international scholarships for doctoral students, CONACYT
has rapidly expanded the mobility scholarships and “mixed scholarships? for professors
and postgraduate students to spend a term or more in an international university. Between
2007 and 2010, 3,214 scholarships were awarded in these areas. CONACYT has also
been developing links between domestic and international doctoral programs (e.g., with
France, Germany, and Brazil), joint degree programs between Mexico and Germany, and
links between domestic doctoral students and French researchers or firms. Although WB
financing was not provided for these initiatives, the PAD anticipated that the Project
would indirectly contribute to the strengthening and internationalization of graduate
programs.

Closely linked to the scholarship program is the National Program for Quality Graduate
Programs (Programa Nacional de Posgrados de Calidad, PNPC). The PNPC accredits
domestic graduate programs based on evaluations of indicators related to the program’s
quality. Programs must be accredited by the PNPC to be eligible to receive CONACYT
scholarship recipients. Given the close linkage between the scholarship programs and the
PNPC, as well as the need to have high-quality graduate programs to “accelerate
advanced human capital formation? (which is part of the PDO); the Bank team provided
frequent input aimed at improving the PNPC over the life of the project.


                                                35
The performance of the PNPC has improved substantially in recent years. The number of
accredited programs nearly doubled between 2006 and 2010, moving from 680 to 1,304
(see Figure A.2). Of the 1,304 accredited programs, 742 are master level, 396 are PhDs,
and 166 are for specialties. Many of the Bank’s suggestions have been incorporated,
specifically with respect to including more international experts in the PNPC evaluation
process.

Figure A.2: Evolution of the Number of Programs in the PNPC




CONACYT has also made improvements to the operational aspects of the scholarship
programs. One example is an electronic platform that is currently being developed to
track scholarship recipients from the moment they are awarded funding through
completion of their academic studies and beyond. This will give CONACYT real-time
data on graduation rates, time required to graduate, occupation of former scholarship
recipients, etc. This data is currently not available, which has made it harder to evaluate
the full impact of the scholarships program.

As part of project supervision, the WB team engaged in discussions with CONACYT on
both the policy and operational aspects of the scholarship program, making suggestions
on how its performance and relevance could be improved. Partly as a result of such
suggestions, several changes were implemented to improve the functioning of
CONACYT’s scholarships and related programs (e.g., increased role of international
evaluators and other changes to the PNPC, establishment of a more robust platform to
monitor the program, and other changes to make scholarships more demand oriented).

Part C. Institutional Strengthening (US$6.7 million)
The subcomponent breakdown of the legal agreement is used below due to some small
inconsistencies in the description of this component between the PAD and the legal
agreement.

C.1. Support policy development in the areas of science, technology and innovation.
Besides enhancements to existing policy instruments, the operation has contributed to the
design of new policies instruments (inter alia infrastructure equipment for research and


                                             36
technology transfer offices) that seek to further strengthen STI in Mexico. As further
discussed below, the operation has also supported the strengthening of CONACYT’s
M&E system, which is critical to understand the effectiveness of STI policies and
provides the analytical basis and rationale to make necessary adjustments to them.

Another key contribution of this component was the implementation of a study visit to
Washington, D.C., in April 2010, which included the participation of high-ranking
government officials from the Ministry of Economy and CONACYT. The purpose of the
trip was for key policy-makers to learn about the overall U.S. policy framework for STI,
the key institutions responsible for it, and specific policies and programs to promote
innovation, R&D, technology transfer, and SME development, as well as to discuss U.S.-
Mexico collaboration possibilities. The visit also comprised an analysis of policy
interventions at the regional level, using the state of Maryland as a case. The delegation
included the vice-minister of economy responsible for innovation and her advisor, the
director general of CONACYT, and several of CONACYT’s deputy directors.

The delegation met inter alia with the advisor to the White House on Science and
Technology Planning; National Science Foundation; Technology Transfer Office of the
National Institutes of Health; Small Business Administration (including the capital
access, entrepreneurial development, and Small Business Innovation Research divisions);
a technology incubator run by Montgomery County, Maryland; venture capitalists;
Advanced Projects Research Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) within the U.S. Department of
Energy; Global Entrepreneurship Program of the State Department; University of
Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute; Manufacturing Extension Program (Virginia
and national level); American Association for the Advancement of Science; and World
Bank Science, Technology, and Innovation Global Expert Team

The delegation was highly satisfied with the visit. They considered it to be a very
worthwhile learning experience that highlighted models of how Mexico could strengthen
its national innovation system as well as regional innovation systems. It also allowed the
Mexican officials to make strategic connections with their counterparts in the U.S.

The output indicator for this subcomponent in the PAD’s results framework is “number
of policy studies and Monitoring and Evaluation reports of CONACYT’s programs?. As
described in the subcomponent below, CONACYT undertook evaluations covering all of
their main programs in the past three years, for a total of 14 evaluations and related
studies. In retrospect, the indicator presents shortcomings because the target is 40 studies
and evaluations, a number that would suggest a large number of small, disjointed studies
as opposed to the reduced number of more comprehensive studies that CONACYT
actually conducted. Moreover, the indicator would be better associated with the M&E
subcomponent below.

C.2. Establish a comprehensive information, monitoring and evaluation system.
CONACYT’s M&E system has been substantially strengthened during the last three
years. The Mexican government’s 2007 Presupuesto de Egresos included an institutional
evaluation framework (Marco Institucional de la Evaluación en México) that required



                                            37
federal entities to evaluate their programs and establish monitoring indicators. To
complete this requirement, CONACYT scaled up their M&E activities substantially
starting in early 2008. Since that time, CONACYT has undertaken evaluations related to
the following: programs to promote innovation in enterprises; scholarships program;
determinants of patenting; national researchers system; INNOVAPYME, INNOVATEC,
and PROINNOVA programs; user satisfaction of regional development programs; meta-
evaluation of projects related to research, technology development, and innovation; tax
incentive programs; and programs financed under Component A of this WB project.
These evaluations were financed by a combination of World Bank and CONACYT
resources.

The output indicator associated with this subcomponent in the PAD is “number of state
and regional seminars and workshops for private sector competitiveness?. Although this
indicator is poorly designed in the sense that it covers a much broader range of activities
than just M&E, CONACYT held 185 such events between 2006 and 2010, well
exceeding the target of 20.

C.3. Design and implement a public information campaign to disseminate CONACYT’s
programs. Over the last few years, CONACYT has increased its dissemination activities,
especially to promote its new innovation and technology programs as well as its novel
initiatives at the state and regional levels. Many of these have been financed with
CONACYT’s own resources, not funds from the loan. One example is the annual
Innovation for Competitiveness Forum, which was first launched in January 2009 and has
now been institutionalized. The first of such forums presented success stories from the
Ultima Milla and Emprendedores programs, among other things, and led to an increase in
the deal flow for the Emprendedores VC fund. In October 2009, CONACYT organized
the first national forum/workshop on regional innovation and competitiveness and a
second version of it was held in 2010. The World Bank team made presentations in the
first Innovation for Competitiveness Forum in 2009 and the first and 2nd regional
innovation forums in 2009 and 2010. During the last two to three years, CONACYT has
intensified its contacts with chambers of commerce, business associations, and other STI
organizations as part of its dissemination strategy and efforts to expand the outreach of its
programs.

The output indicator associated with this subcomponent is “Percentage of firms that are
aware of CONACYT programs that support firm ST&I?. The baseline value for 2004 was
2% and the 2009 target was 5%. A survey has not yet been conducted to capture this data
point.

C.4. Strengthen CONACYT and the PCU to assist in the carrying out the Project.
The Project financed a small number of staff within the PCU, as well as a number of
improvements to CONACYT’s IT platform. IT improvements included: conceptual
design of a data recovery plan (in case of a disaster); data cleaning within the CONACYT
systems; maintenance of the CONACYT institutional servers; acquisition of back-up
power supplies (UPS) in case of electricity outages; personal computers; improvements
to email services; consultancy services to update the payroll and human resources system



                                             38
within CONACYT; and creation of an information portal for CONACYT’s funds. These
have complemented other improvements to CONACYT’s IT systems (e.g., the
development of a more comprehensive and agile monitoring system for its scholarship
program, and the framework for M&E), which the institution has financed (or is
financing) with its own funds.

Support for Scholarship Policies. The PAD contains an additional subcomponent on
“Support for Scholarship Policies? that the legal agreement does not include. Three
output indicators were associated with this subcomponent. The table below shows these
“orphaned? output indicators.

Table A.12: Output Indicators Associated with Support for Scholarship Policies Subcomponent

Number of students studying abroad in           10              320               720 (2007-2010)
postgraduate programs within the frame of a
collaborative agreement between a national
and foreign program (including becas mixtas)

Nine graduate programs (largely in business schools) have received international
accreditations. Although a precise number on the percent of “students enrolled in
internationally accredited graduate programs? indicator is not available, this number
would not be of high relevance to the project since such programs are not the core of
human capital formation programs financed by CONACYT. Also, international
accreditations are not available for the majority of graduate programs in scientific and
technological fields, much less for doctoral programs. The institution has instead pursued
a strategy of accrediting high-quality graduate programs domestically through the
National Program for Quality Graduate Programs. As explained above, the certification
of its top programs includes international evaluators.

The final indicator—number of students studying abroad in postgraduate programs within
the framework of a collaborative agreement between a national and foreign program
(including becas mixtas)—exceeded the target by a wide margin (720 students versus a
target of 320).

Economic and Financial Analysis

Cost effectiveness. The Project was cost effective and made use of a very light
administrative structure. The costs of the project coordination unit were 0.56% of the
total amount of the loan.

As mentioned in Section 3.3, the economic and financial analysis in the PAD focused on
international evidence of the returns to investments in R&D and overcoming market
failures such as uncertainty of outcome; the need for collaboration among many
institutions and firms for innovation, diffusion, and application; information
asymmetries; appropriability problems; lumpiness and scale economies; and tacit
knowledge. No quantitative economic or financial analysis was presented in the PAD, nor
is one possible at this time given the nature of the project interventions—primarily
matching grants to firms and scholarships. The project components actively addressed the
market failures outlined in the PAD and the innovation interventions were in line with
international best practices on the most efficient way to promote business innovation.

Annex 7a. Comments from the Federal Government
Desempeño del Prestatario
Desempeño del gobierno. Durante el Gobierno del Presidente Felipe Calderón se
mantuvo el apoyo gubernamental al segmento de Ciencia y Tecnología, sector que no ha
sufrido recortes como algunos otros sectores.

Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), participó como Agente Financiero del Gobierno
Federal en todas y cada una de las Misiones de Supervisión realizadas por el Banco, las
cuales siempre se llevaron a cabo en un ambiente propositivo, de ayuda mutua y en aras
de logro de los objetivos del proyecto así como de contribución en la eficiente ejecución
del proyecto, a través de asistencia técnica en temas de adquisiciones, desembolsos y
cumplimiento de compromisos contractuales.

Nacional Financiera apoyó al Ejecutor y trabajó conjuntamente con él respecto a la
verificación del cumplimiento de la normatividad en las adquisiciones de bienes y
servicios conforme a las Normas del Banco aplicables según el Contrato de Préstamo, así
como en la capacitación del uso del Sistema de Ejecución y Planes de Adquisiciones (
SEPA ).

CONACYT tuvo a bien planear y llevar a cabo una cantidad considerable de procesos de
adquisiciones de bienes y servicios, las cuales, todas fueron revisadas y en aquellos casos
que aplicaba, comentadas por Nacional Financiera en lo conducente.

Así mismo, en el tema de Desembolsos y Gestión Financiera, NAFIN constantemente
revisó, aclaró, retroalimentó, llevando el control junto con CONACYT de toda la
información presentada para Desembolsos. Sin embargo, se detectó la necesidad de
realizar talleres para darle a conocer a CONACYT los cambios acordados en la
utilización de los modelos y/o formatos autorizados para temas relacionados con
adquisiciones y desembolsos, en este sentido, es de suma importancia consultar y trabajar
coordinadamente con el Agente Financiero, a fin de evitar cualquier tipo de error o
incumplimiento en la aplicación de la normatividad del Banco.

Desempeño del Ejecutor
En general CONACYT siempre mantuvo una disposición cordial a la atención de
sugerencias y revisiones ex post por parte del Banco Mundial y de NAFIN.

Si bien es cierto que derivado del cambio del staff (equipo) del proyecto hubo que pasar
por una curva de aprendizaje, con la disposición y flexibilidad de CONACYT, para dar
cumplimiento a los compromisos contractuales y la normatividad del Banco Mundial
aplicable, fue posible mantener el avance de la ejecución del proyecto, aunque en
ocasiones no en el grado que se hubiera deseado debido a situaciones administrativas o
coyunturales en la ejecución del programa.



                                            45
Es de importancia señalar, que el CONACYT siempre mantuvo una actitud de apertura
respecto a la presencia de dificultades, obstáculos, burocracia y conflictos
administrativos, que se fueron presentando durante el programa, lo cual permitió
identificar las necesidades y efectuar los ajustes para continuar con la debida ejecución
del proyecto; así como plasmar estas necesidades en las ayudas memoria de las misiones
de supervisión, derivando en ocasiones, en reasignación de recursos entre categorías e
incluso en la extensión por un año de la fecha de cierre del proyecto del 31 de diciembre
2009 al 31 de diciembre 2010.

Existieron algunos contratiempos en la presentación de la información por parte de
CONACYT, no obstante siempre proporcionó la información que NAFIN solicitaba a
efecto de llevar a cabo un correcto desembolso y el cumplimiento de compromisos
contractuales.

Nacional Financiera en algunas ocasiones tuvo que recordar al especialista en
adquisiciones en el CONACYT que la forma adecuada tanto en tiempo como en forma de
presentar la información relativa a adquisiciones, era a través del Agente Financiero ya
que se llegó a detectar que se omitía alguna gestión respecto a las no objeciones o
registros necesarios de los procesos de adquisiciones que repercuten en el desembolso
correspondiente.

Desempeño del Banco Mundial
El Banco Mundial siempre mostro interés en conocer los avances, dificultades y
propuestas tanto del Gobierno Federal (SHCP, NAFIN) como de CONACYT respecto a
la ejecución del programa.

Así mismo, mostró voluntad y flexibilidad en analizar y proponer conjuntamente con
CONACYT la mejor solución, camino o salida pertinente, en aras de apoyar y contribuir
con el logro de los objetivos e indicadores planteados para el programa, aun cuando
detectaba que el logro de dichos objetivos podía no ser el óptimo esperado.

El Banco Mundial proporcionó y puso a disposición de CONACYT el constante apoyo
de asistencia técnica, que consideró necesario para enriquecer la ejecución del programa,
por medio de experiencia de expertos internacionales así como de su participación en
talleres de retroalimentación en la materia, quienes a su vez participaban en las misiones
de supervisión y agregaban valor.

Las Misiones de Supervisión llevadas a cabo por el Banco siempre derivaron en
cuestionamientos y retroalimentación constructivas, lo cual permitió que CONACYT
trabajara en la solución de las dificultades que se presentaban y en el reforzamiento de los
temas que solo requerían ser mejorados.

Annex 7b. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

This annex contains excerpts from the closing report prepared by the Borrower (in
Spanish).

Objetivo y Antecedentes
En 2004 el gobierno mexicano consciente del bajo nivel de competitividad en la
economía mexicana, derivada de la posición obtenida en el Foro Económico Mundial,
posición 45 de 104 países y la identificación de algunos retos por parte del Banco
Mundial en su estudio “Competitividad Programática y Comercio? como: la reducción en
las exportaciones, pérdida de empleos y migración de las empresas, disminución de la
inversión extranjera y una limitada producción industrial con alto valor agregado y alta
investigación y desarrollo, enfoco la agenda en materia de competitividad para ese año,
en cinco áreas estrategias: 1) Reducir costos de logística, 2) Mejorar el clima de negocios,
3) Ampliar la oferta energética, 4) Profundizar el sistema financiero y 5) Fortalecer la
capacidad de innovación, capacitación y educación, de tal manera, que el sistema
mexicano de innovación tendrá un papel esencial en la mejora de estas condiciones
permitiendo restablecer la competitividad de la economía mexicana.

Sin embargo, a pesar de los esfuerzos realizados desde la aprobación de la Ley de Ciencia
y Tecnología en 2002, a través del cual se desenvuelve el Sistema Nacional de Ciencia y
Tecnología y de la importancia de contar con un sistema nacional de ciencia, tecnología e
innovación coherente e incluyente, es necesario el diseño de políticas públicas que den un
mayor énfasis a la productividad, calidad e innovación, en donde se tenga una visión
integradora de las diferentes grupos de interés, como empresarios, ingenieros y
tecnólogos, que favorezcan un mejor y mayor financiamiento público y privado en la
investigación y desarrollo tecnológico que fomenten la formación de recursos humanos
en áreas estratégicas vinculadas al desarrollo regional y estatal.

Es por esto, que los objetivos del Programa Especial de Ciencia y Tecnología 2008-2012,
están enfocados en el fortalecimiento científico, tecnológico y de innovación del país a
través de la vinculación e integración de todos los agentes involucrados, que permitan
mejorar el nivel de competitividad a nivel mundial entre otros aspectos.

Factores generales que afectaron la implementación
El cambio de administración entre el periodo del presidente Vicente Fox (2000-2006) y el
presidente Felipe Calderón (2006-2012), provoco algunos cambios en los programas e
iniciativas conceptualizadas durante el diseño del programa.

La operación de los fideicomisos o recursos fideicomitidos son un aspecto que durante la
implementación del programa, originaron replanteamientos sobre todo en aquellos casos
en los cuales el fideicomiso es constituido por dos dependencias, razón por la cual se
tuvieron retrasos en la publicación de las convocatorias en el Fondo de Innovación
Tecnológica.




                                            47
Otro aspecto relevante, fue el ciclo natural de los proyectos, dado que de común acuerdo
se estableció que las aportaciones realizadas a los Fideicomisos para los sub-
componentes del Fondo Emprendedores CONACYT-NAFIN y el Fondo de Innovación
Tecnológica, podían ser presentadas para su desembolso de la línea de crédito, lo que
ocasiono el tener un avance del 100% en la situación financiera de dichos sub-
componentes, a pesar de que a nivel técnico el ritmo de ejecución de ambos programas,
no era el esperado.
Adicionalmente, y a pesar de que el programa cuenta con un componente que incluye las
actividades de evaluación, divulgación y capacitación en ayuda a la mejora de los
programas del Consejo, la SHCP año con año ha sido más estricto en el control del gasto,
en particular en lo que riere a estos conceptos gasto.

Resultados de los Componentes y Factores que Afectaron la Implementación
A.1 Alianzas publico-privadas de Innovación para la Competitividad
Objetivo. Promover la formación de grupos de trabajo -entre la academia y la industria-
que contribuyan a mejorar la competitividad de los sectores productivos del país,
mediante el otorgamiento de apoyos para el desarrollo e implementación de proyectos
vinculados que fomenten la investigación y propicien la creación de nuevos grupos que
ayuden a la creación de redes en áreas estratégicas.

Descripción de actividades. Esta programa inicia con la formación de redes de
colaboración integradas por Centros e Institutos de Investigación Superior y Empresas,
cuya labor consiste en identificar las áreas de vinculación (Modalidad A) que permitan
generar un portafolio de proyectos de servicio, plataformas tecnológicas e investigación,
que brinde soluciones de negocio basados en la aplicación del conocimiento y en la
innovación de procesos científicos y tecnológicos (Modalidad B).

Las Alianzas y Redes se forman para abordar las áreas estratégicas del PECYT en
materia de investigación y desarrollo tecnológico, con la finalidad de posicionar al país y
sus regiones en nichos científicos y tecnológicos que ayuden a inserción competitiva en
la economía global del conocimiento, como son: Automotriz, Aeronáutica, Salud,
Biotecnología, Diseño y proceso de manufactura avanzada, Agrotecnologías,
Microsistemas electrónicos, Tecnologías de la Información, Nanotecnología y Materiales
Avanzados.

En 2008, se modificaron los términos de referencia de la Modalidad A, con lo cual no
solo se otorga el apoyo para la integración de la red, sino también para la integración de
la cartera de proyectos y el plan de prospectiva a mediano plazo, incrementado el monto
máximo a $1.5 mdp. En cuanto a la Modalidad B esta fue absorbida por el programa
PROINNOVA, en el cual cada proyecto puede recibir un monto máximo de $21 mdp, de
acuerdo al tamaño de las empresas involucradas de un 50-75% del gasto total en
investigación, desarrollo tecnológico e innovación elegible.

Resultados. Durante, la vigencia del Programa se apoyaron los proyectos de las
convocatorias publicadas en 2007 y 2008. Para 2007, se generaron 19 colaboraciones, de
las cuales 16 proyectos fueron para la integración de nuevas redes (modalidad A) y 3 más



                                            48
para el desarrollo de proyectos vinculados en beneficio de los sectores productivos
(modalidad B). Para 2008, se apoyaron 29 colaboraciones, las cuales desarrollarán la
perspectiva de mediano plazo para la ejecución de su cartera de proyectos, con estos 48
proyectos el programa de Alianzas Estratégicas y Redes de Innovación ha vinculado a
173 empresas, 84 Institutos de Educación Superior y 77 Centros de Investigación. Los
sectores más apoyados son: Acuícola, Biotecnología, Electrodomésticos y Manufactura.

Adicionalmente, se apoyaron 244 colaboraciones a través de PROINNOVA, 47 proyectos
en la convocatoria 2009 y 197 en 2010, vinculando a 244 empresas, 344 Institutos de
Educación Superior y 147 Centros de Investigación principalmente en los sectores de:
Tecnologías de la Información, Automotriz, Alimentos y Agroindustrial.

Conclusiones. Sin duda, el desempeño de este componente tuvo un retraso por cambios
administrativos y la modificación de la política en el Programa de Estímulos Fiscales a
finales de 2008, sin embargo, en el último año se ha logrado avanzar de manera
importante en la articulación de la cadena de valor, permitiendo contar con una visión
empresarial, académica y científica en cada una de las vinculaciones, fortaleciendo las
capacidades tecnológicas en sectores estratégicos por medio de los diversos instrumentos
operados por CONACYT.
    • Alianzas Estratégicas y Redes de Innovación.(AERIs)
    • Desarrollo e Innovación en Tecnologías Precursoras. (PROINNOVA)
    • Proyectos de Investigación, Desarrollo Tecnológico e Innovación Bilateral
Dentro de la cartera de proyectos se encuentran diversos casos de éxito como: MABE y
el Clúster Automotriz de Nuevo León.

A.2 Fondos de Capital de Riesgo
Objetivo. Promover la inversión de capital en empresas en etapa comercial para la
implementación de nuevas líneas de negocio basadas en desarrollo tecnológico que
ayuden a la consolidación de la empresas, mediante aportaciones económicas y
facilitando la capitalización proveniente de otros accionistas.

Descripción de actividades. La ejecución del programa es de manera conjunta entre
CONACYT y NAFIN; CONACYT aporta los recursos económicos al Fondo
Emprendedores NAFIN-CONACYT (fideicomiso administrado por NAFIN) de esta
manera, CONACYT proporciona recursos a través de la compra de acciones así como,
aporta su capacidad para evaluar los proyectos de negocio desde el punto de vista
tecnológico. Por su parte, NAFIN participa validando financieramente el negocio
determinando su viabilidad, aprovechando su capacidad e infraestructura como
institución promotora del desarrollo de las empresas.

El Programa Emprendedores está dirigido a empresas de reciente creación y/o empresas
en marcha, que han desarrollado nuevos negocios de alto valor agregado a partir del
desarrollo tecnológico en etapas de escalamiento industrial y comercial.
En febrero de 2009, el portafolio del Fondo Emprendedores se dividió en cinco partes,
cuatro de ellas administradas por empresas privadas expertas en Banca de Inversión
coordinados por el Fondo y una quinta que continua bajo la administración directa del


                                          49
Fondo, con la finalidad de dar un seguimiento más estrecho y puntal a las inversiones,
permitiendo contar con información financiera al día y sobretodo permitió iniciar el
proceso de venta de las acciones del Fondo (primeras salidas).

Resultados. El periodo de ejecución del programa ha sido de 6 años de 2004 a 2010, la
primera etapa financiada por el Proyecto de Conocimiento e Innovación (4349-ME) en el
cual se realizaron inversiones en 14 empresas provenientes de la primera aportación por
un importe de 70 millones de pesos para capitalizar el fondo y la segunda etapa
financiada por el Programa de Innovación para la Competitividad (7296-ME) en la cual
se realizaron 30 inversiones adicionales provenientes de las aportaciones realizadas
durante 2007 y 2008 por un importe de 129.6 millones de pesos.

Con respecto, al ritmo de ejecución del programa de 2005 a 2008, se realizaron en
promedio cinco inversiones por año, sin embargo en enero de 2009, tras la realización del
Primer Foro “Innovación para la Competitividad en México?, el ritmo de ejecución del
fondo se aceleró realizando en ese año 12 nuevas inversiones, debido a esto, CONACYT
realizó una aportación adicional por un monto de 40 millones de pesos, recursos que ha
servido para apoyar a 6 nuevas empresas en 2010, por lo que el Portafolio del Fondo
cuenta con 43 inversiones. El sector más apoyado es el de Tecnologías de la Información.

La operación del fondo continúa con respecto al seguimiento de la cartera de proyectos,
hasta que estos se retiren del fondo mediante la re-compra de acciones o adquisición por
parte de un tercero, a la fecha existen cuatro empresas que están en esquema de salida:
• Óptima energía, se vendieron al emprendedor a plazo de 60 meses a una tasa del
    18%.
• Macrivcel, se inicio en octubre la venta de las acciones a un plazo de 60 meses a una
    tasa del 14% al emprendedor.
• Hydratechnolgies, se vendieron a Impulsora de proyectos en $7 mdp, con un primer
    pago de 5 mdp en octubre 2010.
• Internacional Healthy Snacks, se vendieron a un Gabriel Sacal por $9.5 mdp en julio
    2010.

Conclusiones. Dado que el programa fue una experiencia piloto, la incorporación de
proyectos fue un tema difícil en los primeros años, sin embrago al día de hoy el programa
está consolidado y por el contrario son ahora los emprendedores los que se acercan al
fondo, otro tema fue la participación en cada uno los consejos de las empresas, lo que
origino la contratación de operadoras de fondos. Dentro de los proyectos destacados se
encuentran: Fit-Bitz, Ingressio, Hydratecnologies, Mastrettta y Healthy Digital Systems.

A.3 Fondos para proyectos en etapa pre-competitiva (Programa AVANCE – Última
Milla)
Objetivo. Apoyar la transformación de desarrollos científicos y tecnológicos maduros en
prospectos de inversión, originando de esta manera negocios de alto valor agregado o
nuevas líneas de negocio.




                                           50
Descripción de actividades. El programa está dirigido a instituciones, universidades,
centros, laboratorios o empresas relacionadas con actividades de investigación a través
del otorgamiento de apoyos para la última fase de un desarrollo científico - tecnológico
en camino a su transformación hacia un nuevo producto o proceso, generando la
integración de un prospecto de inversión que facilite la participación de inversionistas así
como su explotación comercial.

Resultados. El programa ha apoyado 184 proyectos de empresas a través de las
convocatorias (2003-2005, 2005-2007, y 2008) de los cuales 111 están relacionados con
el préstamo, los cuales han sido ejecutados en su totalidad por los beneficiarios por un
importe de 290.3 millones de pesos, lo que representó un desembolso de 19.9 millones de
dólares. De acuerdo a los resultados de la evaluación de impacto realizada en 2008 por
ITAM, 20 proyectos están en etapa comercial, el 82.1% ha logrado desarrollar nuevos
productos y se han generado un promedio de 14 empleos por cada empresa apoyada. Los
sectores más apoyados ha sido: Tecnologías de la Información, Salud, Diseño y
Manufactura, Biotecnología y Materiales Avanzados.

En 2009, CONACYT comenzó a pilotear el programa en los estados mediante apoyo al
estado de Nuevo León por medio del Fondo Nuevo León para la Innovación (FONLIN)
por 10 mdp, al Estado de México a través del Consejo Mexiquense de Ciencia y
Tecnología por 7 mdp y en 2010; se sumó el estado de Baja California por 6 mdp. Estos
estados a su vez han incorporado la modalidad en sus convocatorias con gran aceptación.

Conclusiones. En vista de los resultados obtenidos, el modelo se está replicando mediante
la incorporación de la modalidad de nuevos negocios en otras iniciativas como Avance en
los estados y el Fondo de Innovación. Entre los proyectos de Casos de éxito se
encuentran: Negocios Especializados, Agro Ux Biocontrol, SP Films, Servicios
Administrativos MEXIS y Aplicaciones de Alta Tecnología (Hydratechnologies).

A.4 Fondo de Innovación Tecnológica (CONACYT – Secretaria de Economía)
Objetivo. Fortalecer la competitividad de las empresas establecidas en el país mediante el
apoyo a proyectos de innovación y desarrollo tecnológico que promuevan la creación de
negocios de alto valor agregado, a partir de la aplicación de conocimientos y avances
tecnológicos.

Descripción de actividades. El programa está dirigido a Micro, Pequeñas y Medianas
Empresas (MIPyME) y /o grandes empresas que incluyan la participación de MIPyME,
así como personas físicas con actividad empresarial que presenten propuestas con un
grado de innovación y/o desarrollo tecnológico mediante nuevos productos, procesos,
servicios o materiales, que permitan elevar su nivel de competitividad.
En 2007, el Fondo se realizaron ajustes administrativos con la finalidad de mejorar los
apoyos otorgados con lo cual el nombre del mismo cambia al nombre que hoy conocemos
como: Fondo de Innovación Tecnológica antes Fondo Sectorial de Economía.

Resultados. Durante la ejecución del Programa de Innovación para la Competitividad
(PIC), se apoyaron 289 proyectos por un importe de 698.2 mdp, a través de las



                                            51
convocatorias de 2005 a 2009, de estos 132 proyectos están vinculados a recursos de
crédito externo, lo que representa 33% de los apoyos otorgados. Los sectores
mayormente beneficiados son: Alimentario, Química y Petroquímica, Tecnologías de la
Información y Farmacéutico.

En Junio, se publico la convocatoria 2010, la cual tuvo una respuesta muy satisfactoria,
en sus dos primeros cortes publicados en los meses de septiembre y octubre, se aprobaron
108 proyectos por 295.7 mdp, de los cuales el 10% corresponde a la modalidad de nuevos
negocios.

Adicionalmente, durante sus dos primeras convocatorias los programas de
INNOVAPYME e INNOVATEC han apoyado a 967 proyectos por 2’788.9 mdp, en los
que participan 295 Centros de Investigación y 517 Institutos de Educación Superior.

Conclusiones. El Fondo ha tenido un avance importante en el ritmo de operación gracias
a la reducción de tiempos en el proceso de evaluación de propuestas, lo que ha permitido
optimizar tiempos en todo el proceso desde la publicación de la convocatoria hasta la
formalización de los proyectos aprobados, debido a esto la ejecución de los recursos ha
mejorado substancialmente, se ha podido disminuir el saldo disponible del fondo de $
700 mdp a $ 400 mdp, los cuales tienen altas posibilidades de ser comprometidos en el
tercer corte de la convocatoria , el cual se publicará en febrero de 2011.

A.5 Incorporación de Científicos y Tecnólogos en las Empresas
Objetivo. Promover la creación y fortalecimiento de grupos de investigación, a través de
la integración de personal de alto nivel científico y tecnológico en el sector productivo,
mediante el otorgamiento de apoyos complementarios.

Descripción de actividades. El programa va dirigido a jóvenes profesionistas con
maestría o doctorado, interesados en desempeñar labores de investigación y desarrollo
tecnológico de tiempo completo dentro del sector productivo, mediante el otorgamiento
de una beca a través de convocatorias publicadas de acuerdo a las necesidades y
requerimientos de los distintos sectores.

Resultados. El programa ha apoyado 84 becarios en sus tres convocatorias (2006, 2007 y
2008), de los cuales 49 están relacionados al PIC, de estos 61 becarios se ha incorporado
a la industria y 3 más están en proceso, lo que representa el 76 % de éxito. Dentro de los
logros más destacados se encuentran 70 nuevos procesos y 49 Vinculaciones con Centros
e Institutos de Investigación Superior y 32 Prototipos. En 2009, se regionalizó el
programa para dar un nuevo impulso a través de Centros e Institutos de Investigación
como el Centro Mexiquense de Ciencia y Tecnología (COMECYT), EL Instituto de
Innovación y Transferencia de Tecnología de Monterrey y el Consejo Estatal de Ciencia
y Tecnología del Estado de Jalisco.

Conclusiones. EL programa no alcanzó el impacto esperado, si bien es cierto que los
logros obtenidos por los apoyos otorgados fueron buenos, el número de apoyos otorgados
en las tres convocatorias publicadas por el programa fueron pocos. Los factores



                                           52
principales que influyeron en la ejecución del programa son: Las empresas aprovecharon
la oportunidad de someter aplicaciones en convocatorias de otros instrumentos como, el
Fondo de Innovación, INNOVAPYME, PROINNOVA E INNOVATEC y otros, en los
cuales existe un concepto de honorarios para personal altamente calificado que participe
en el desarrollo del proyecto, sin la necesidad de crear un pasivo laboral. Adicionalmente,
existieron retrasos en el otorgamiento de recursos derivados de cambios administrativos
principalmente en el Fondo, lo que provocó cierta molestia en los beneficiarios y la
consideración de continuar el programa con recursos fiscales. Entre los proyectos de
Casos de éxito se encuentran: Mexifrutas, Nucitec y Apliatec.

B. Programa de Formación de Científicos y Tecnólogos
Objetivo. Apoyar la Formación de Recursos Humanos de Alto Nivel, mediante el
otorgamiento de Becas para realizar estudios de posgrados de calidad, que contribuyan al
desarrollo nacional a fin de incrementar la capacidad científica y tecnológica del país.

Descripción de actividades. El programa va dirigido a aspirantes a cursar estudios de
posgrado para especialidad, maestría y doctorado tanto a nivel nacional como en el
extranjero. En 2005, el programa cambió el concepto de “beca-crédito? que había
operado históricamente, estableciendo un nuevo enfoque de “Becas de Inversión en el
Conocimiento?, eliminando los pagarés y creando un nuevo reglamento, lo que facilitó el
seguimiento, integración y vinculación de los ex becarios. En 2008, atendiendo los
objetivos del PECITI (2008-2012), se publicó el nuevo reglamento de Becas (vigente), el
cual establece que el Fortalecimiento de la Formación de Recursos Humanos de Alto
Nivel esté orientado en áreas estratégicas, permitiendo su integración al desarrollo
regional. En 2009, CONACYT incrementó la relevancia de los programas de posgrado
con la publicación de convocatorias conjuntas con algunos estados de la república,
atendiendo las necesidades regionales, mediante el otorgamiento de becas al extranjero en
áreas estratégicas según cada entidad federativa; por medio de aportaciones tanto de
CONACYT como de los estados.

Resultados. En cuanto al PNPC, los programas han tenido una evolución muy
significativa logrando incorporar a 624 programas adicionales de 2006 a 2010,
certificando 1304 programas, de los cuales el 55% corresponden a programas
consolidados. Los programas certificados corresponden principalmente a estudios de
maestría 742, seguidos por los de doctorado 396 y finalmente especialidades con 166;
49% están en ciencias aplicadas como: Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Biotecnología y
Ciencias Agropecuarias e Ingenierías, 33% en Humanidades y Ciencias sociales y 18%
en Ciencias Básicas como: Ciencias Físico Matemáticas, Ciencias de la Tierra, Biología y
Química.

Con respecto a, las Becas otorgadas han tenido un incremento importante de 2006 a 2010,
apoyando año con año a más becarios tanto nacionales como extranjeros, a Octubre de
2010 se otorgaron 19’029 becas. Un avance sumamente relevante, es el desarrollo del
módulo de seguimiento de los becarios por medio de la plataforma de People Soft, el cual
incorporará a partir de las convocatorias el núcleo académico , los estudiantes, la
eficiencia terminal y la productividad académica del programa en su primer alcance, sin



                                            53
embargo, a largo plazo se tiene previsto que el módulo se vincule con otros módulos de
modo que permitan llevar un estrecho monitoreo desde la asignación de los recursos por
cada convocatoria, quienes y cuál es la situación académica de los becarios apoyados, así
como donde están los ex becarios. Este avance permitirá un proceso de mejora continua y
permanente.

Adicionalmente, se está trabajando con otras iniciativas que ayuden a la
internacionalización del posgrado mediante la alineación de los diferentes programas de
posgrado y becas, como:
1. Becas de movilidad o mixtas: De 2007 a 2010 se han otorgado 3124 apoyos, de los
    cuales 1631 corresponden a España y EUA.
2. Becas posdoctorales: De 2007 a 2009 se otorgaron 198 becas sabáticas y 957
    posdoctorales.
3. Colegios Doctorales: Facilita la colaboración interinstitucional e internacional, la
    vinculación con los sectores productivo, público y social, el acceso a laboratorios
    especializados y acervos bibliográficos.
4. Programa ECOS: Fomenta la formación doctoral a través de proyectos de
    investigación vinculados con investigadores franceses y el PCP, permite la
    elaboración de un proyecto de tesis en colaboración con la industria nacional o
    francesa.
5. Posgrado Internacional: El diseño del programa incluye una estancia de 6 a 12 meses
    en Alemania, para al término obtener una doble titulación México-Alemania.

Conclusiones. El Programa de Formación de Científicos y Tecnólogos, popularmente
llamado “Becas?, es uno de los programas estandarte de CONACYT, es por ello que
enfrenta constantemente grandes retos en su afán de crear nuevas estrategias y
mecanismos de vinculación entre la academia y el sector productivo, lo que implica el
desarrollo de competencias de diversa índole para satisfacer la demanda de los sectores
considerados como vitales para el país.

C. Fortalecimiento del Marco de Política Científica y Tecnológica e Institucional
Objetivo. Apoyar las políticas sectoriales que permitan mejorar el sistema de innovación
así como su internacionalización y fortalecimiento integral dentro del marco de la política
científica y tecnológica.

Descripción de actividades. Este componente es instrumentado mediante cuatro
iniciativas:
• C.1. Gobernabilidad y Desarrollo de Políticas. Elaboración de estudios relacionados
    con los principales instrumentos normativos del sector científico y tecnológico.
• C.2. Apoyo a los Sistemas de Información, Monitoreo y Evaluación. Fortalecimiento
    de las actividades de monitoreo y evaluación mediante la realización de encuestas y
    evaluaciones, a fin de recopilar y obtener un análisis de la información sobre Ciencia
    y Tecnología.
• C.3. Actividades de Promoción y Divulgación. Incorporación de actividades
    relacionadas con la difusión de programas y subprogramas así como la divulgación de
    los resultados obtenidos a través de las evaluaciones y estudios realizados.


                                            54
•   C.4. Fortalecimiento Institucional y Gestión del Programa. Incorporación de
    contratación de bienes y servicios de asesoría técnica relacionados con la
    sistematización de procesos y modernización de la plataforma informática del
    Consejo.

Resultados. En este rubro es primordial precisar que el detonador del Marco Institucional
de la Evaluación en México que hoy día se tiene, fue el decreto establecido en el
Presupuesto de Egresos de 2007, en el cual se señala la evaluación a todos los programas
presupuestarios de la administración pública federal, así como el desarrollo de
indicadores para mejorar la gestión y el desempeño por resultados, a raíz de esto,
surgieron disposiciones en la ley para establecer una unidad de evaluación en cada una de
las dependencias; al interior de CONACYT es hasta abril de 2008, cuando se le da un
mayor impulso a las evaluaciones de los programas operados por el Consejo.

En 2009, otro de los cambios fue la creación del Comité Técnico Especializado en
estadística de Ciencia Tecnología e Innovación, integrado por INEGI, CONACYT, el
Foro Consultivo Científico y Tecnológico, Secretaria de Economía y Secretaria de
Educación Pública y el Comité Intersectorial para la Innovación, integrado por la
Secretaria de Economía, la Secretaria de Educación Pública y CONACYT así como
invitados permanentes del sector público y social para enriquecer las sesiones, ambos
promueven la generación de propuestas del ámbito científico y tecnológico así como el
diseño y la operación de las políticas públicas en materia de innovación.

Las primeras evaluaciones fueron: Impacto en las Empresas, Impacto en el Programa
AVANCE e Impacto en el Programa de Formación de Científicos y Tecnólogos,
realizadas en 2008. Para 2009, se efectuó la Evaluación de Impacto del Programa de
Estímulos Fiscales y la Identificación de los Factores determinantes del Patentamiento en
México. Las evaluaciones específicas de desempeño del Programa de Becas, del Sistema
Nacional de Investigadores y del Fomento a la realización de proyectos que incrementen
la capacidad científica y tecnológica, a nivel sectorial y regional, fueron coordinadas por
CONEVAL y las evaluaciones de: Diseño del Programa de apoyo a la consolidación
Institucional, Innovación Tecnológica para Negocios de Alto valor Agregado, Innovación
Tecnológica para la Competitividad de las Empresas y Fortalecimiento en las Entidades
Federativas de las capacidades científicas, tecnológicas y de innovación, fueron
coordinadas por CONACYT.

Adicionalmente, se llevó a cabo el diseño de la metodología para el diagnóstico de la
Infraestructura en CTI con el apoyo de Dr. Michael Sargent, experto en políticas
públicas, lo que derivó en la Implementación del Sistema de Información de
Infraestructura que se llevará a cabo en 2011 y que ayudara a la orientación de las
convocatorias en materia de Infraestructura.

En 2010, se iniciaron tres estudios de gran relevancia que permitirán obtener mayor
información sobre los programas operados por CONACYT:
1. Evaluación de los Programas de Innovación (INNOVAPYME, PROINNOVA E
    INNOVATEC).



                                            55
2. Evaluación de la Satisfacción de Usuarios de los Programas de Desarrollo Regional.
3. Metaevaluación de Proyectos orientados a la Investigación, Desarrollo Tecnológico e
   Innovación.
4. Evaluación del Componente A del Programa de Innovación para la Competitividad (
   AERIs, IDEA, Fondo de Emprendedores, Nuevos Negocios y Fondo de Innovación
   Tecnológica)

Complementando las actividades de monitoreo y evaluación, CONACYT participo en
“La iniciativa Internacional para la Evaluación de Impacto (3ie)?, en la cual presento las
propuestas para la evaluación de impacto de los programas del SNI y becas de posgrado,
las cuales fueron seleccionadas de entre 35 propuestas de 27 países postulantes para ser
financiadas por esta iniciativa y realizadas por investigadores internacionales de
prestigiadas instituciones como Stamford, Washington University e ITAM, dichas
evaluaciones estarán concluidas en 2011.

En cuanto a las actividades de difusión en 2009, se realizó el 1° Foro de Innovación para
la Competitividad (Enero) en el cual se presentaron casos de éxito del Programa de
Nuevos Negocios y Emprendedores y la 1° Jornada Nacional de Innovación y
Competitividad (Octubre), en el que se presentaron modelo exitosos de sistemas de
innovación locales y regionales a nivel internacional. Para 2010, se llevaron a cabo las
segundas ediciones tanto del Foro (Enero) como de la Jornada Nacional de Innovación
(Noviembre).

Contribuyendo con la divulgación en materia de evaluación, se realizó el Foro
Internacional: “Evaluando resultados de los programas de apoyo a becas de posgrado?
(Junio), en el cual se discutieron las metodologías idóneas para medir los resultados
alcanzados por el Programa, así mismo, la Dirección Adjunta de Información, Evaluación
y Normatividad del CONACYT, recibió un reconocimiento por parte de CONEVAL
como “Práctica destacada en la evaluación de la Administración Pública Federal?, por el
diseño de la metodología para evaluar los Programas de Estímulo a la Innovación, la cual
busca determinar cuál es el impacto real que tienen los apoyos económicos otorgados por
el Consejo para incentivar la inversión en ciencia, tecnología e innovación en el sector
privado.

Otra iniciativa de suma importancia, es el fortalecimiento del registro CONACYT de los
evaluadores Acreditados (RCEA) mediante el Banco Iberoamericano de Evaluadores, el
cual contará con una base de datos normalizada y herramientas de búsqueda que facilitará
el acceso a expertos en áreas específicas.

En cuanto al Fortalecimiento Institucional, se han llevado a cabo los servicios de Diseño
Conceptual de un Plan de Recuperación (en caso de desastres), limpieza de datos de los
sistemas de CONACYT, mantenimiento del conjunto de los servidores institucionales en
el site del Consejo, adquisición de UPS para el respaldo de Energía tanto de CONACYT
como de los Consejos Estatales, servicio de computo personal, servicio de correo
electrónico y colaboración para oficinas centrales y regionales, control de asistencia e
infraestructura de servidores, así como, los servicios de consultoría para la actualización



                                            56
del módulo de nómina y recursos humanos de People Soft versión 9, soporte e
implementación a dicha actualización y la creación del portal de fondos de CONACYT,
contribuyendo al fortalecimiento de la plataforma informática.

En 2010, se adjudicaron los procesos de licitación para los servicios de infraestructura de
comunicaciones de voz y datos para las oficinas centrales y regionales del CONACYT y
el servicio de seguridad de datos –Firewall.

Conclusiones. En términos generales, la evaluación en México, poco a poco, ha ido
integrando diversas iniciativas apoyadas por un marco legal que ha sufrido cambios desde
2007 a la fecha, estos cambios han favorecido que más programas sean incorporados en
un Plan Anual de Evaluación y que los propios responsables de los programas apoyen
estos estudios, que contribuyan al mismo tiempo al mejoramiento de las políticas de los
mismos y que además faciliten la asignación de recursos a dichos programas.

Desempeño del Prestatario
Desempeño del gobierno. A pesar de la crisis económica global, el ambiente
macroeconómico ha dado visos de estabilidad durante el gobierno del presidente
Calderón. El apoyo gubernamental, específicamente al segmento de Ciencia y
Tecnología, no ha disminuido en términos generales, aún cuando otros sectores han
sufrido recortes de diverso tipo y profundidad. No obstante, las promesas emitidas por el
gobierno anterior –Fox-, de alcanzar cifras cercanas al 1% del PIB en este renglón, están
aún lejos de convertirse en realidad.

Aún cuando ha habido algunas mejoras administrativas en las secretarías relacionadas
con el flujo de recursos, el exceso de trámites ha impedido algunas veces cumplir en
tiempo y forma con los propósitos y objetivos inicialmente trazados. No obstante los
progresos, estos han tenido costos, ya que ha sido esta una época de dificultades en los
acuerdos políticos necesarios para permitir que en las cámaras legislativas se dé luz verde
a iniciativas relacionadas directa o indirectamente con Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación.
Las tradicionales diferencias económicas regionales también contaminan al sector
mencionado, es así que a despecho de avances recientes, existen aún desequilibrios
notables en el desarrollo de proyectos de investigación, de formación de recursos
humanos, de vinculación entre sector público y privado y de infraestructura, entre
regiones.

Desempeño del ejecutor. Se han mantenido, no sin grandes esfuerzos, los pilares
tradicionales sobre los que el CONACYT se ha desarrollado a través del tiempo, es decir:
la formación de recursos humanos, el SNI, ciencia básica y tecnología. Se ha registrado
notable evolución en áreas del Consejo anteriormente menos atendidas, como en las de:
• Evaluación y normatividad. Se han cumplido con éxito diversos estudios
    encaminados a determinar el impacto de varios de los programas del Consejo,
    algunos de ellos de reciente introducción y otros de tiempo atrás.
• Regiones. Se ha fortalecido la relación con estados y municipios por medio de fondos
    establecidos para el efecto.




                                            57
Además, la creación de varios programas en el ámbito de la ciencia aplicada, la
tecnología y la innovación, ha permitido ampliar la colaboración entre el sector público y
el privado y a perder gradualmente la desconfianza tradicional entre ambos. Se han
multiplicado los acuerdos con universidades nacionales y del extranjero para incrementar
las posibilidades de que los becarios del CONACYT se inscriban en posgrados de
calidad.

La creación de nuevos programas de infraestructura permitirá reponer, actualizar y
renovar el equipo de instituciones de diversa índole en CyT. La red de Centros de
Investigación del CONACYT ha progresado hasta el punto de que muchos son los que
cuentan con reconocimiento internacional y algunos son capaces de generar una buena
cantidad de recursos propios con visos hacia la autosuficiencia.

Desempeño del Banco Mundial
En general podría decirse que la relación entre el Banco y el CONACYT ha seguido los
lineamientos establecidos desde un principio en el Convenio de Préstamo del PIC.
Para que esta relación fuera funcional fue indispensable pasar por un período de
aprendizaje de ambas partes, habiendo siempre voluntad para efectuar los ajustes
necesarios. Existió siempre una actitud de flexibilidad por parte del Banco de manera de
entender que dichos ajustes se debían a situaciones coyunturales y a cuestiones de
ejecución del programa mismo así como a que los resultados obtenidos a través del
tiempo no eran necesariamente siempre los esperados.

Hay que tomar en cuenta además, que existieron otros actores involucrados en el PIC –
Secretarías de Estado, NAFIN, beneficiarios de los programas, proveedores de bienes,
evaluadores, etc.-, lo que potencialmente podía haber complicado el flujo del Programa,
sin embargo, los problemas fueron mínimos y cuando los hubo siempre se pudieron
resolver en un ambiente de colaboración. Para el futuro, tal vez sería conveniente aligerar
algunos de los procedimientos burocráticos de modo de que el tiempo no nos gane.

Calidad de la supervisión. La supervisión por parte de los representantes del Banco se
cumplió siempre en condiciones de mutuo entendimiento y cooperación. Más que de
supervisión –un término que no siempre es bien entendido-, las misiones del Banco
mostraban una disposición de ayuda para cumplir con las metas y objetivos planteados y
para solventar los obstáculos encontrados en el camino. La comunicación entre la Unidad
Coordinadora en México y los representantes del Banco en Washington fue siempre fácil
y cordial. Fue así que hubo posibilidad de asistir a talleres de evaluación, contar con
información diversa de lo que se hacía en el exterior, viajar para establecer contactos,
conocer expertos que habitualmente acompañaban a la misión. Todo ello como un valor
agregado al préstamo como tal.

Los resultados de las visitas de supervisión siempre fueron útiles como retroalimentación
para darnos cuenta de cuáles son los puntos que deben ser corregidos y cuales sobre los
que hay que insistir en la misma ruta. De la comunicación entre ambas partes se
desprendieron varias ideas que se concretaron en evaluaciones de impacto –algunas por
