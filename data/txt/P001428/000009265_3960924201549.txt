PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LIBERIA
RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan 1544-LBR/Credit 786-LBR)
PREFACE
1.   This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Rubber
Development Project in Liberia, for which Loan 1544-LBR in the amount of
US$7.0 million and Credit 786-LBR in the amount of US$6.0 million
equivalent were approved on March 30, 1978. The project was co-financed
by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which provided a loan
equivalent to US$7.0 million. The United Kingdom Ministry of Overseas
Development (ODA) made a technical assistance grant equivalent to US$1.4
million for eight British rubber experts. The Credit was fully
disbursed before its extended Closing Date of December 31, 1985. The
Closing Date for the Loan was also extended to December 31, 1985.
However, in order to honor withdrawal applications the Loan was kept
open until October 7, 1986 when, after the last disbursement, it was
closed. An amount of US$1.0 million of the Loan remained undisbursed
and was cancelled. Including this amount, and the earlier cancellation
of US$3.5 million, total cancellations of the Loan were equivalent to
US$4.5 million.
2.   The PCR was prepared by the Agricultural Operations Division
(AF4AG) in the Western Africa Department of the Africa Regional Office
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The Borrower was not
sent Parts I and III, nor could they provide Part II because the
government collapsed as a result of the ongoing civil war. Preparation
of this PCR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit and the
Loan Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower; and internal Bank Memoranda.1/
1/ A Project Completion Mission visited Uberia In June, 1986 to collect data. 'he Government also caried out its
own review of the project. However, most of these materials are not traceable in the Bank's records.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LIBERIA
RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1544-LBRICREDIT 786-LBR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Liberia has a dualistic economy.  Its agricultural economy
coexists with an enclave sector which is export-oriented and produces
besides iron ore, rubber and forest products. The enclave sector
provides about 701 of export earnings, generates about 25Z of GDP and
about 151 of all government revenues. Total population is about 1.7
million. About 601 of the population is classified as agricultural
households. Soils are generally fertile and tne climate is suitable for
a variety of field and tree crops. With the decline in demand for iron
ore, which was a dominant product for export earnings, government began
to make serious efforts to diversify the economy and emphasize
development of its export oriented tree crop production. However, with
the collapse of the government, the continuing civil war situation is
likely to have serious impact on the tree crop sector.
2.    Obiectives:  The aim of the project was to increase Liberia's
export earning from natural rubber and to improve income distribution
within the country. As designed originally the project included a
program to replant abandoned small rubber farms and rehabilitate mature,
but untapped rubber trees. Small and medium sized rubber farmers were
to be helped to achieve higher productivity and incomes by providing
them with better extension services and credit for farm inputs. The
project also aimed at strengthening the institutional capability to plan
and carry out further development of Liberia's rubber industry by
establishing the Liberian Rubber Development Unit (LRDU) and training
local staff. Funds were also provided to enable the Government to carry
out a rubber pricing study and a feasibility study for a second stage
project.
3.    ImRlementation Experience:  Project performance was below
expectation throughout. During a review of the project in June 1980, it
was found that only 800 acres had been replanted compared to a target
for that date of 6,000 acres, and only 2,500 acres had been
rehabilitated, against a target of 8,500 acres. The only training
provided had been to some field staff, and the building program was a
year behind schedule. There were three main reasons for poor
performance: (a) inadequate management; (b) insufficient capacity to
process rubber; and (c) low producer prices resulting from high
transport and handling costs and the low quality of rubber. Farmers'
low interest because of inadequate support services for purchase of
smallholder rubber, inadequate management and unrealistic tarAets
prompted the revision of the project in March 1982. The objectives



iv -        4
remained the same and there was a drastic reduction in the
planting/rehabilitation targets.  Other significant changes were the
addition of a processing component and a rubber collection unit to
service the project farmers. Even the revised planting/rehabilitation
program wae under-fulfilled, and at reappraisal in August 1983, the
project was found not to be viable economically *.r financially. The
agricultural program was then phased out and only the processing
component was pursued. When the Rubber Corporation of Liberia (RCL)
factory was established after a long delay, it suffered from financial,
technical and operational problems. Bank staff relationship with the
expatriate project management appeared to undergo stresses and strains,
particularly during the later years.
4.    Results:  The project objectives of increaning rubber production
from Liberian-owned small farms and productivity tnd income of
small/medium farmers were not realized. Only about 25Z of the original
appraisal target of 40,000 acres of planting and 23,500 acres of
rehabilitation was achieved. Actual project costs (US$18.1 million)
were about 601 of the Appraisal Cost (US$29.6 million). However, the
project Unit and the RCL accounts show 100l and 25Z cost overruns
respectively. The project's economic rate of return (ERR) which was
originally estimated at 13%, was re-estimated at 16% at the time of the
project revision (1982). At reappraisal in 1983, the ERR was estimated
to be 5.51 and the financial rate of return to be 4.12. The main
reasons for the reduction in ERR were the reduction in rubber yields
(from 1450 lbs/acre to 1200 lbs/acre and the lengthening of the period
to maturity (from 6.75 years to 7.5 years). The resulting overall
reductions in yield were not offset by a proportional reduction in real
production cost. Due to insufficient data re-estimation of ERR was not
done at the time of preparing the PCR.
5.    Sustainabilitv:  The project, even with the 1982 revisions, was
not sustainable. Lack of farmers' interest and inadequate extension,
training, marketing and processing facilities led to a situation in 1983
when it was considered imprudent to pursue the project's agricultural
program. The farmers were not getting an adequate prico for rubber and
consequently did not have sufficient incentive to produce and sell
their raw rubber. The ERU to incremental planting at the time of
reappraisal was estimated at only 5.5Z. Liberia had natural comparative
advantage in the rubber sub-sector but required a much stronger effort
in reaching its objective of putting outgrower rubber on a viable
footing. The institutional format that could handle this task needed to
be carefully examined together with a different target group (larger
farmers) before Liberia could proceed with a follow-on project.
6.   Findings and Lessons Learned:
(a)   A project of this type can not be successful on the basis of
agronomic possibilities alone; complex sociological and
institutional issues also need to be thought through (pera
22).
(b)   Small farmers need intensive extension and training
assistance which impose a burden on any project management;



.V.
inveostment of scarce funds and management resources in the
early stages of sectoral development on such farmers, who
are often scattered over a wide area, may not be fruitful
(para 26).
(c)   Production and output efforts require road and
transportation network as well as marketing and processing
facilities; in far-flung rural areas, unless these matters
are given equal attention, farmers' profitability and
consequently incentives are bound to diminish (paras 16 and 18).
(d)   Timely availability of adequate funds is important for
project implementation but equally important is the
management's ability to plan and execute a project. Lack o:
funds can often be a weak management's cover to hide lack of
direction and efficiency (para 14).
(e)   Project mid-term reviews are desirable in some cases.  They
can be beneficial only if an examination is made of the
project's fundamental shortcomings. Adjustments in the
targets and project costs can prove to be illusory (para
25).

RVP Unit:         Africa
Country:          Liberia
Sector:           Agriculture
Subsector:        Tree Crops - Smallholder Agriculture
Background
L.   The Development Plan of Liberia attached high priority to
agriculture as the corner stone of the Sovernment's diversification
strategy. The objective was to diversify and modernize agricultural
production, increase productivity, improve associated rural economic
activities such as marketing and processing, and provide social and
physical infrastructure to promote income distribution and improve the
quality of life in the rural as well as urban areas. Agriculture is the
second largest productive sector in the economy and provided one-quarter
of gross domestic product. About 54.5% of the total population of
Liberia work in agriculture. With low average population density, land
is not a constraint to agricaltural development. The critical
constraints are trained manpower and efficient institutions.
2.    The Plan earmarked about one-fifth of total investment resources
for developmant of agriculture. Based on general ecological conditions,
factor endowments and market prospects, agriculture had greater
potential for efficient diversification of the economy than any other
productive sector. It could also provide a continuing source of the
country's growth and development to supriement earnings from iron-ore
which was likely co gradually decline. Within this framework, the
Government had adopted two basic strategies: development of smallholder
agriculture and development of industrial tree crop plantations.
3.    A distinctive feature of Liberian agricultu-e is the existence of
a dominant rubber industry, accounting for 702 of all agricultural
exports and employing one third of the national labor force. The rubber
industry is divided into foreign-owned concessions and Liberian-owned
rubber farms. Two decades of d_elining rubber prices had led many
Liberian planters to abandon and neglect their plantations. As a
consequence, only 143,000 acres (382 of the total acres planted) were in
production in 1978, and about 502 of the plantations were estimated to
become over-aged by 1984. Poor planting material and low management



2-
standards were responsible for the low yields -- 150 to 500 lbs./acre
compared with over 1000 lbs./acre on the foreign-owned concessions.
While Liberian-owned farms accounted for 72% of the total rubber
acreage, they produced only 31% of the total output estimated at 83,000
tons. Except for the Liberian Rubber Processing Company (LRPC) which
was owned by the Government, all the five companies which purchased
rubber from Liberian farmers for processing and exporting were
foreign-owned. Fireitone buying 70Z of Liberian-owned farm production,
was the largest and effectively set producer prices.
4.    The most critical constraint to rapid expansion in the
agricultural sector was shortage of trained manpower. Another major
constraint was the institutional deficiencies in the delivery of
essential Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) was aware of the need to develop
an effective structure for servicing smallholders. The Bank supported
the MOA's efforts through consultants provided under previous
Bank-financed projects. The Government also consulted closely with the
Bank regarding the appropriate organization and operating policies for
institutional credit for the traditional agricultural sector and
established the Agricultural and Cooperative Development Bank (ACDB).
Proiect Obiectives and DescriRtion
(i)   Objectives
5.    The principal objectives of the project were to increase Liberia's
income and export earnings from rubber through an intensive program of
replanting of old rubber and rehabilitating of mature untapped rubber.
This was to be the first phase of a long-term effort to increase and
sustain production from Liberian-owned rubber farms. The project also
aimed at improving productivity and the incomes of about 6,300 small and
medium size rubber farms (70% of total Liberian holdings) through
provision of credit, better extension services and assistance for
on-farm processing and marketing. In order to strengthen the
Government's capability for the further development of Liberian-owned
rubber industry, the project made provisions for establishing a Liberian
Rubber Development Unit (LXDU), staff training and technical assistance.
(ii)   Components
6.    The project included the following:
(a)   creation to rep!  9 the existing Rubber Advisory Services
and provide a permanent extension service;
(b)   provision of financial assistance to farmers for replanting
40,000 acres of old rubber with high-yielding varieties and
rehabilitating 23,500 acres of mature untapped rubber;
(c)   training project headquarter and field staff, managers,
overseers, headmen, budders, tappers and farmers in modern
rubber production techniques;



- 3 -
(d)   providing marketing assistance to smallholders in on-farm
processing and transportation;
(e)   providing farm planning advice to large farmers and helping
them to prepare investment proposala for commercial
financing; and
(f)   provision of funds for hiring consultants to assist the
Agricultural and Cooperative Development Bank, conduct a
rubber pricing study, prepare a follow-up project, advise
LRDU on smallholder marketing and train instructors.
Proiect Desizn and Organization
7.    The Project was designed to increase the productivity of
Liberian-owned rubber farms by providing credit, extension services and
training. Arrangements for collection and purchase of rubber from the
farmers at prices profitable to the farmers was recognized by the Bank
preparation team to be vital to maintaining farmers' interest in
increasing production. The insufficiency of processing capacity
available to the stuallholder rubber was also known to the team.
Therefore, it should have been quite obvious to the preparation team
that there had to be a radical change in the purchasing and processing
of rubber, if an equitable return was to be ensured to the small
farmers. In this context, designing and financing of a primarily
agricultural project aimed at increasing the production of raw materials
instead of a manufacturing (processing) project was clearly inadvisable
and untimely. The high cost per beneficiary of the project had also
been raised by the Bank's senior manageme,=.
8.    Since its inception in 1978, the project faced many difficulties
in implementation. The Bank, however, continued to focus mainly on the
shortfalls in achieving the planting and rehabilitating program. The
June 1980 Bank and CDC (Commonwealth Development Corporation) project
review mission found that inadequate sanagement and low farmers'
interest were the main reasons for the project's poor perfkrmanco. The
project management failed to provide planting material and organize an
effective training program and extension service. Low farmers' interest
was caused by insufficient producer prices to cover labor, input and
transportation costs. Inadequate processing capacity and delays by the%
enclave plantation factories in payment to farmers compounded the
farmers' difficulties in keeping labor as farmers were unable to pay
cash-wages on time.
9.    Changes in project design, revision in the agricultural program
and modifications in organization were discussed with the Goverr.ment in
1981-82.  Project amendments were approved by the Executive Directors on
March 16, 1982. Although the aims of the project remained the same,
five significant changes to the original project were made.  The
.aplant'ng and rehabilitation targets were scaled down from 40,000 acres
to 20,uOO acres and from 23,500 acres to 14,000 acres respectively.  To
serve project farmers and provide adequate processing capacity, a
processing component under a new agency -- the Rubber Corporation of
Liberia (RCL) with an initial capacity of one ton/hr was added. Other



changes were the incorporation of a small land survey and road
construction unit into LRDU, and organization of rubber collection
serv.ice to assist farmers in marketing. The project implementation
period was extended by 18 months until June 1985.
10.   The Bank along with CDC showed considerable flexibility and
realism in making the above changed.  However, there were delays in
setting up the processing plant, rutbber collection services did not work
well, and even the revised planting and the rehabilitation program could
not be fulfilled. In September 1983, the project had to be reappraised.
It was found to be unviable economically or financially (ERR and FRR
both below 6%), due mainly to lower than expected yields, drop in
international prices, high mortality of new plantings, and poor field
maintenance by the farnmers. In light of the reappraisal mission's
conclusions, and after discussionis with the Government, the Bank decided
to continue with the factory rehabilitation program while phasing out
the planting program in such a way as to minimize unnecessary losses and
damage to the LRDU operations and the project farmers.
11.   The Bank begun to realize that the project was inappropriate and
wrongly designed. It as recognized that rubber was not attractive to
small farmers with limited land. It was introduced as the sole crop.
Food crops could only be cultivated by inter-planting during the first
2-3 years; thereafter, farmers had no means of subsistence or resources
to bring the rubber crop to maturity at year 8. The Liberian conditions
called for a different strategy with an adequately designed system to
achieve project objectives. It appeared that larger farmers who had
other sources of income should be involved with such development
projects, and nucleus estates with satellite block plantations should be
included. The Bank also realized that what was needed were facilities
to process an internationally accepted grade of rubber that could
command a higher price. Farmers would then rehabilitate their rubber
areas to enjoy good income.
Prolect Implementation
12.   Since the time of appraisal in mid-1977, changes in economic and
political climate in Liberia had adversely affected project performance.
Equipment, building and transport costs increased 3ubstantially and the
government-set agricultural wage rose from US$1.50 in 1978 to US$2.00
per day. Despite an increase in rubber prices on the world market
between 1975 and 1979, the higher transport and labor costs which the
Liberian farmer faced decreased his returns. Processing capacity for
Liberian rubber declined significantly and by the end of 1980, the
Bank's Review Mission concluded that unless adequate collection and
processing facilities could be provided to the farmers in the project,
there was no point in continuing with the planting and rehabilitsation
program.  The Government's suspension of land transactiors following the
April 1980 coup resulted in delays in deeding and this affect;ed project
operations in the subsequent years.
13.   From the commencement of the Project in 1978, project performance
was routinely poor. Successive Bank superviuiion missions reported on
project problems and recommended actions to alleviate them, including



adversely affected the execution of a project which already had a host
of other problems.
Prolect Results
17.   The project's main objectives of doubling rubber production from
Liberian-owned farms and bringing about a substantial increase in
productivity and the income of small and medium farmers were not
realized. In July 1986, a Bank project completion mission found that
only about 252 of planting and 242 of replanting of the appraisal
targets were achieved. Only 402 of the rehabilitated area was being
tapped at the time, bringing down the actual rehabilitated area to only
102 of the appraisal target. Farmers' interest could not be raised and
sustained due to a number of complex reasons - high transportation and
collection costs, inadequate processing capacity and above all the
farmgate price was insufficient to provide a strong incentive.
18.   Following a major review of the project in June 1980, changes were
formally introduced in 1982 but the project objectives remained the
same. The changes were in respect of the agricultural targets (which
were lowered) and processing capacity (expansion). Certain
institutional changes were also introduced through the establishment of
the Rubber Corporation of Liberia (RCL) which was to be in charge of
collection and processing of project farmers' rubber output. As a
result of a reF.ppraisal in 1983, the agricultural component, which was
faltering, was agreed to be gradually abandoned. Meanwhile, it was
considered expedient to proceed with the rehabilitation of an existing
public sector processing plant.
19.   The particular socioeconomic situation of the smallholders in
Liberia (e.g. low economic capacity, and necessity for intensive
extension and training, and price incentive) explains the project's poor
performance. In addition, the poor selection of participants, poor farm
maintenance and high proportion of absentees among project farmers and a
very low credit recovery rate of less than 62 among rehabilitation
farmers contributed to the project's shortcomings. The extensive area
covered by the project required higher input of lower base contact
personnel which was not provided, and resulted in higher transportation
cost and poor supervision. The inadequate project management compounded
these difficulties.
20.   Pricing of rubber and receipt by the farmers of a fair price were
major issues identified during project appraisal. Farmgate price was
expected to be increased as economies were realized in the marketing and
processing stages between the farmgate e'nd international markets. A
pricing study financed by the project was completed through consultants
but the report was not acted upon by the Government which was not
satisfied with it. At the time of the project's revision it was agreed
that a pricing formula based on international prices and updated
production costs of farmers, and transport and processing costs would be
adopted by the Government within six months of the start-up of the
rehabilitated processing plant. Farmgate price was to be reviewed and
adjusted regularly. Various methodologies were discussed between the
Government and the Bank, but the matter was not finalized until the



the removal of the first project manager in June 1979 and the
scaling-down of field targets. Despite increase in the factory-gate
price of rubber in early years, the project continued to experience
difficulty in attracting participants. The non-achievement of targets
were due to managerial problems within LRDU and problems in smallholder
marketing, processing and rubber pricing resulting in low farmer returns
and a lack of farmer response. Other problems such as poor farm
management and knowledge of modern rubber production techniques and
seasonal and regional shortfalls in labor supply for tapping also
affected farmer response. The latter (i.e. labcr shortage) was clearly
identified as a risk by the Bank's appraisal mission. Loan recovery,
particularly from the rehabilitation farmers was unsatisfactory. By
end-1983, all 211 such farmers had defaulted. This was to some extent
due to a steep fall in rubber prices.
14.   The supervision missions during 1983-85 had mentioned the lack of
funding, particularly for LRDU, as a major problem requiring commercial
bank overdraft facility. This was attributed to the Government's
desperate financial situation and the Bank and CDC suspension of
disbursement from time to time. However, the Bank mission for
collection of project implementation data in July 1986 concluded that
the financial problems faced by the project during its implementation
was not a serious constraint in project development activities; donors'
contributions, along with overdraft facility granted by ACDB which was
used to bridge gaps caused by delays in releasing funds, met all project
financial requirements.
15.   The actual project cost estimated in July 1986 was US$18.1 million
which was about 60X of the appraisal estimate (US$29.6 million).
However, RCL :jad cost overrun of 25% compared to its estimated cost;
LRDU had cost overrun of 1002 with only 25% achievement of its revised
planting/replanting target. The original appraisal estimate of an
economic rate of return of 13% was not achieved. At the time of
revision of the project in 1982, the rate of return was optimistically
estimated to be 162 on the expectation of higher efficiency of RCL and
higher rubber prices. This, however, could not be achieved in the
circumstances that the revised project found itself. In 1983, as
pointed out earlier under Evaluation Summary (para 3), the economic rate
of return to incremental planting was estimated at about 5.5%.
16.   The project management was inadequate.  The high turn-over rate of
personnel in top management had its toll on project productivity and
performance. During the implementation period (1978-1985), three
project managers were appointed and about 12 expatriates worked in the
project for an average of 2 1/2 years. Some of them were found
unsuitable for the tasks and as a result, the project failed to
effectively provide the materials, extension services and training. The
project management did not appreciate the expertise of the supervision
mission staff, nor the quality of their advice. While both project
management and Bank staff were in agreement that rubber made good
ecological and economic sense in Liberia, their views on the appropriate
development strategy and the sequence of required actions differed
considerably. Also, their relationship was often strained. This

completion of the project. Prices meanwhile were being determined by
market forces, as in the past.
Project Sustainabilitv
21.   The project as originally approved was not sustainable due to lack
of farmers' interest, and marketing and processing shortcomings. The
revised project was an improvement in the sense of a more realistic
target of planting and rehabilitation areas, and the recognition of
processing inadequacy through provision of a processing plant. However,
at the time of reappraisal in 1983, it was found that pursuing the
agricultural program was not prudent due to the very low rate of
economic return to incremental planting. During the subsequent years,
even the scaled-down agricultural targets were not reached and the
component was gradually abandoned. Only the rehabilitation of the
processing facility was actively pursued towards the end of the project.
22.   The sustainability issue for this project involves the fundamental
question faced during implementation--whether in the Liberian socio-
economic situation for smallholders it was possible to increase the
rubber yield through a high-input high-output approach. The
smallholders could theoretically reach a higher yield than they achieved
under the project, but that would have required a more favorable
financial condition for the farmers, better farm management, higher
prices received by them, and a much better management of input supply
and extension and training efforts. These conditions were not
attainable in Liberia at the time and even with all the good intentions
on every side, the project as conceived was not viable and could not be
sustained.
23.   Perhaps a different strategy was needed for the subsector -- that
of working with the larger farmers who had greater financial strength
and crop management skills. Advisability of utilizing available land
for nucleus estate and block plantations could also have been
considered. This, in conjunction with the development of access roads,
collection systems, effective training and adequate processing capacity
could have been considered for future development. In fact, the Bank's
thinking was moving in that direction when, in conjunction with the
Government, terms of reference were drawn up and proposals sougut from
consultants to prepare a possible follow-up project for the rubber sub-
sector. However, because of the suspension of Bank operations in
Liberia on debt service grounds, the matter could not be further
pursued.
Bank Performance
24.   The most positive element in the Bank's performance on this
project was its flexibility in dealing wlth the problems as they
surfaced. This was amply demonstrated by its readiness to undertake a
review of the project contents early in the project execution period and
an agonizing reappraisal of the project towards the end. The Bank
openly acknowledged the project's shortcomings, and by closely working
with CDC and the Government, it successively modified the project.
After the reappraisal, the Bank was realistic enough to be ready to



- 8 -
abandon the project save the one element (processing capacity) v'.Ich
still made economic and practical sense. The Bank's pragmatism helped
in avoiding further misdirected efforts and minimizing financial and
investment losses (project expenditures in the end were well below
appraisal estimates).
25.   The main weakness of the Bank was that it went too quickly into
too big a program. It did not fully appreciate the situation of the
smallholder rubber farmer and their low yielding old rubber trees on
which the project concentrated and the shortcomings of the marketing and
processing capacity in r       -  f the smallholder output.  The pricing
issue was recognized from the ou set and the Bank required that a
pricing study be completed and acted upon. The Bank was, however,
unable to effectively deal with it, complex as it was with the
transportation costs, price setting by Firestone (largest
concessionaire) and the international rubber price movements. The
quality aspect of rubber in price determination was not fully taken into
account by the Bank at appraisal and the output/yield increase estimates
were out of line with the Liberian reality. Consequently, the
realization that probably the project design was inappropriate and
untimely did not come to the Bank staff until the evaluation of the
reappraisal mission's findings (close to the project's originally
scheduled completion time). It was clear that during discussion on
amending the project in 1980-82, the Bank either did not appreciate that
the project design was flawed or was not ready to accept it at that
stage. It did recognize the need for a fundamental review of the rubber
sub-sector and a sector review as subsequently undertaken by the Bank in
September 1984. On hindsight, it may be said that a sector review
should have preceded launching of the project. The Bank naturally
relied on the Malaysian experience and staff were sent there for
training. These could not, however, mitigate the conceptual and design
deficiencies in the project arising from the fundamental differences in
the Malaysian and Liberian situations, particularly in respect of the
smallholder farmers.
26.   The lesson that the Bank can draw from the project experience is
that preconceived notions of agricultural development strategies and
priorities, particularly when it involves the uneducated poor
traditional rural sector, should be very critically examined at the time
of project preparation. It would be prudent to consider more cost-
effective investments in extension, demonstration and training-intensive
ways of assisting the small farmer. Also there are stages of
development in every sub-sector. It is essential to resolve credit,
transportation, marketing and processing issues while planning an
increase in agricultural production. A project design, which may be
appropriate at one time, can be premature at a different or earlier
time. This is particularly so where the private sector (as in Liberia)
is incapable, or slow in its response to meet the deficiencies in the
market.
Borrower Performance
27.   The Borrower had show commitment at the outset by completing
start-up actions on time e.g. acquiring of land for nursery and project

headquarters and establishing of the Project Steering Committee before
the negotiations. It also showed sufficient flexibility in dealing with
the project issues. For example, when it came to dismissing the first
Project Manager due to his ineffectiveness, it was quick to do so; when
it came to shuffling project staff to more appropriate positions
matching their expertise, the Borrower acted wisely. The Project
Steering Committee functioned well at an appropriate level of
representation. However, the Borrower's handling of the important
pricing study was dilatory and when it decided not to follow the
recommendations of the expatriate consultants, it delayed agreement on
alternative ways of producer price determination. Project staff
performance was generally satisfactory but there were problems at the
lower levels mainly because of lack of discipline and agronomic skills.
28.   The funding of the project was often inadequate, caused by the
Government's own financial difficulties. But remedial measures
recommended by the supervision missions were acted upon, e.g. arranging
through the ACDB bridging funds (overdraft facilities). In any event,
either due to slow project implementation and/or inadequate management,
iii the end the funding issue was not considered to have been the major
constraint. The Borrower was slow in arranging the rehabilitation of
the processing plant which was a critical matter. It did set up the RCL
and through it the rubbar collection service which was functioning
satisfactorily. The last Bank mission is 1986, however, found that
after a year and a half of the RCL factory coming on stream and eight
months since management was taken over by Liberian staff, RCL's
financial, technical and operational situation was deteriorating.
Factory maintenance was inadequate causing operational problems and
reducing productivity. Lack of spare parts and poor maintenance also
caused near collapse of the rubber collection system. If the RCL
factory collection system was not introduced as an alternative to the
foreign concessionaires' facilities, one would have ventured to suggest
that perhaps these RCL activities could have been given to the private
sector. However, in the Liberian situation, this might not have been a
feasible alternative particularly if one looked for Liberian
entrepreneurs.
Consulting Services
29.   Project consultants provided valuable assistance to the Project
Management in project implementation including training of local staff.
A good relationship existed between the consultants and the Project
Management and the Borrower.
Project Documentation and Data
30.   The documentation for the project was adequate.  The Loan and
Credit Agreements were quite adequate for achieving project objectives.
The appraisal report provided a useful framework for review of project
implementation.

This project was identified by GOL and prepared by consultants, Agrar-UND-
Hydrotechnic (AHT), financed under Liberia Agricultural Development and
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 306-LBR). The Pilot Rubber Scheme (PRS)
also financed under Credit 306-LBR, has provided useful organizational,
financial and technical lessons beneficial to the project. The project was
revised in March 1982 and reappraised in September 1983.
