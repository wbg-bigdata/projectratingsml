RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of Liberia (GOL) has requested Bank Group assistance
in financing a rubber development project. This report appraises a project
designed to strengthen the Liberian-owned rubber industry by: improving
management and technical knowhow; developing an efficient rubber extension
service; providing funds for rehabilitating rubber of tappable age and for
replanting abandoned rubber in accessible areas with high-yielding material;
assisting smallholders in marketing and processing; and developing an appro-
priate rubber pricing policy.
1.02     During the 5-year investment period, approximately 40,000 acres of
low-yielding, poorly managed rubber would be replanted, and 23,500 acres of
mature rubber tapped under the control of a Rubber Development Unit (RDU) to
be created within the Ministry of Agriculture (MA). Approximately 4,000 farm
families would directly benefit from the replanting program and 2,300 from
the rehabilitation program.
1.03     This project was identified by GOL and prepared by consultants,
Agrar-UND-Hydrotechnik (AHT), financed under Liberia Agricultural Development
and Technical Assistance Project (Credit 306-LBR). The Pilot Rubber Scheme
(PRS), also financed under Credit 306-LBR, has provided useful organizational,
financial and technical lessons which would be beneficial to the proposed
project. Lofa County Agricultural Development Project (Credit 577-LBR),
financed by IDA (US$6.0 million), USAID (US$5.0 million) and GOL (US$6.0 mil-
lion), and Bong County (Credit 700-LBR) Agricultural Development Project,
financed by IDA (US$7.0 million), USAID (US$6.0 million and GOL (US$7.3 mil-
lion) were also prepared with funds provided under Credit 306-LBR. Overall,
the aforementioned projects are progressing satisfactorily. However, the
Bong County project has not been signed, due to delays in appointing senior
staff.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01     The project area, shown in   Map IBRD13114, includes the counties
shown in Table 1. The area consists of two main zones. The first (Zone 1)
consists of Marshall and Bomi Territories, Montserrado and Grand Bassa and the
second (Zone II) comprising Bong and Nimba Counties. It covers some 288,000
acres of rubber lands (75% of the total acreage of Liberian-owned rubber
farms). Development would affect 24% of Liberian-owned rubber in the area and



- 2 -
would take place on farms located on both sides of the main Monrovia-Ganta road.
Development would not take place contiguously, but would depend largely on the
distribution of small farmer holdings, which are scattered. Nurseries, training
centers, headquarters and processing factories are easily accessible. Key charac-
teristics of the project area are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Smallholders in
the project area grow rice, cassava and rubber and work part-time for large farmers.
Sinoe, Maryland and Lofa Counties, although they have rubber, were excluded from
the project area for different reasons. In Sinoe, more than 90% of holdings are
greater than 100 acres and would not qualify for project assistance.  In the case
of Lofa, Government decided that with one Bank-financed project in the county, they
would concentrate on rubber development elsewhere. Maryland has been excluded
because of labor shortages arising from competing needs of the rubber, sugar, oil
palm and forest industries.

Physical Aspects
2.02     Topography and Soils.  The project area varies widely in topography.
It is generally heavy rolling in Montserrado and lower Bong Counties, but
gently rolling in the counties further north. Soils are generally deep and
intensively weathered with a weak porous and loamy texture. They can be
divided into gravelly, yellowish brown (Plinthic Ferra-soils) and gravel-free
yellowish and reddish brown soils. Gravelly soils are typical of the rolling
uplands. Practically all soils show a gradual increase of clay content with
depth. All have a low fertility status. They are generally suitable for
rubber growing, but would require fertilizers during the growing period.
2.03     Climate.  Climate is generally very favorable for rubber cultiva-
tion. It is hot (average 80°F) and humid (90%). Average annual rainfall
varies between 160" and 185" on the coastal belt; 70" in the central uplands
(around Suakoko, Gbarnga, Belejunai areas), and 125" around Ganta and the
Nimba mountain ranges. Most of the rainfall occurs during April to November.
General Infrastructure
2.04     Social and related services up to Totota along the main road from
Monrovia are satisfactory. There is a good airport at Robertsfield and an
airstrip at Totota. Electricity along the main road is satisfactory.
Gbarnga is served by a small power plant (rated capacity 2,280 kw), which
serves LRPC. Water supply up to Totota is generally satisfactory. Private
concerns supply water at Bomi Hills, Bong, Raye, Harbel, Nimba, Robertsfield,
Marshall and Kle. Areas away from the main road on either side have inade-
quate water supplies. Roads up to Gbarnga are good and, although side roads
are unsatisfactory during the rain season, rubber farms can be reached by
4-wheel drive vehicles.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Summary project Description
3.01     The project would aim to increase rubber export earnings and improve
the income and welfare of a considerable number of small and medium farmers.
It would be implemented over 5 years and would include:
(a) creation of a Rubber Development Unit to replace the
existing Rubber Advisory Services and provide a
permanent extension service;
(b) provision of financial assistance to farmers for
replanting 40,000 acres of old rubber with
high-yielding varieties and rehabilitating



- 4 -
23,500 1/ acres of mature untapped rubber;
(c) training project headquarter and field staff, managers,
overseers, headmen, budders, tappers and farmers in
modern rubber production techniques;
(d) providing marketing assistance to smallholders in
onfarm processing and transportation;
(e) providing farm p:Lanning advice to large farmers and
helping them to prepare investment proposals for
commercial financing; and
(f)  provision of funds for hiring consultants to assist
the Agricultural and Cooperative Development Bank,
conduct a rubber pricing study, prepare a follow-up
project, advise RDU on smallholder marketing and
train instructors.
B. Detailed Features
Rubber Development Unit
3.02     RDU would be formed with three divisions:  Finance and Administration,
Technical and Operations (see para 5.02). It would be staffed, equipped and
operated under the project. It would be guided by a policy-making steering
committee (PRS), chaired by the Minister of Agriculture. Because of the techni-
cal and financial complexities of the project, RDU would require experienced and
well-qualified staff who are not readily available locally. Provision would
therefore be made under the project to recruit up to ten senior staff inter-
nationally. It is intended to replace the internationally-recruited staff with
Liberians by 1983 (see para 5.03). RDU would employ 210 salaried staff, includ-
ing 80 extension officers who would constitute the core of the permanent exten-
sion service after Year 5. Office buildings, training centers and staff housing
would be constructed, costing US$2.5 million. Senior staff would be provided
with cars and 4-wheel drive vehicles (Annex 1). GOL agreed:
(i)  as a condition of Board presentation, to establish RDU
as a semi-autonomous unit within MA, with appropriate
financial and administrative authority and with terms
of reference 2/ satisfactory to the Bank; and
1/ Rehabilitation is defined here as opening up mature but presently
untapped rubber. Trees would be tapped for a minimum of 5 years.
2/ Suggested terms of reference for RDU are detailed in Project File,
Annex 4, and have already been discussed with GOL.



(ii) that by July 1, 1978, land would be made available for
headquarters, housing, training centers, warehouses,
nurseries and other project needs.
Field Development
3.03     Planting Program.  The replanting and rehabilitation programs are as
follows:
Project Year      1978 1/       1979      1980       1981      1982     Total
…-------…------------- Acres -----------…-----------
Replanting          -          2,000     8,000    15,000    15,000    40,000
Rehabilitation     500         5,000     6,000      6,000     6,000    23,500
The replanting and rehabilitation program would be carried out by small farmers
each owning less than 10 acres rubber, medium farmers (10-30 acres) and farmers
owning 30-150 acres. In addition, the project would assist large farmers (above
150 acres) by providing farm planning and technical advice (see para 3.07).
Whereas, all farms' investments up to 30 acres would receive RDU's technical
assistance and loans in cash and kind, replanted farms up to 6 acres would also
receive cash grants (para 3.04). For rehabilitation, farmers would receive
short-term credit to meet initial expenditures on materials (US$30/acre) (see
para 5.07) and labor (cash US$10.50/acre). This would be repayable over 48 months
at 10% per annum. After the tree is opened, it would yield for five years during
which period, labor and material costs would be met by farmers. For replanting,
farmers would receive credit for establishment and material costs totalling
US$510/acre (Table 10), including US$124 in cash for labor costs. Farmers would
repay the credit at 10% interest per annum over 20 years, including an 8-year
grace period during which interest would be capitalized. The proposed on-lending
interest rate (10%) is consistent with both the ongoing commercial interest rates
for agriculture, and the recent Bank-financed projects in Liberia.
3.04     Because of low yield expectations under traditional methods of cultiva-
tion and the long gestation period of the crop (8 years), in the past, small
farmers have been reluctant to replant rubber. RAS survey shows that most small-
holder rubber farms in the project are semi-abandoned, and that when tapped,
yields range somewhere between 150 lbs to 300 lbs per acre. The majority of
smallholders grow rice and cassava for subsistence and work on large rubber farms
and concessions on a part-time basis for cash. The cash flow for a three-acre
rubber enterprise replanted under the project (see para 7.02) shows that when
loan interest is capitalized during the eight-year maturity period, total debt
is US$2,336. During the maturity period up to Year 8, returns per manday are
1/ Project Year 1: July-December 1978.

unattractive compared to that expected from alternative activities such as
growing traditional food crops or even working as estate labor. Government
clearly recognizes the importance of rubber to the economy as a long-term
renewable asset and is prepared to provide financial assistance to smallholders
up to Year 8 to encourage them to replant their farms up to 6 acres would,
therefore, be a grant equivalent to 80% or US$95 per acre of the inputed cost
of smallholders family labor. This would reduce the loan element to US$600 per
acre and total indebtness for a three-acre farm to US$1,814. The total cost of
providing smallholder grants is estimated at US$1 million. To ensure success-
ful smallholder participation, the project would apply very rigidly, the eligi-
bility criteria detailed in paras 5.04 and 5.05.
Training
3.05     This is an important element in institution building which would affect
all participants and Liberian staff as shown below:

Budders                               662           37                   38
Staff Recruits                        85           118                   39
Staff in Service                     363            -                    24
Courses would emphasize practical rubber production and marketing techniques. The
program, which would be administered by RDU extension and training officers, would
be conducted at three residential training centers (4,500 square feet each), built
to accommodate 40 trainees and 2 instructors of rubber assistants' grade. Each
center would be managed by a resident instructor in senior rubber assistants' grade
(SRA). There would be 5-day residential courses and 1-2 days seminars. Each
center would consist of lecture halls, dining rooms and dormitories and would be
equipped with audiovisual aids consisting of 16mm cine projector, 35mm slide pro-
jector, and accessories including a synchro-recorder. The center would, in addition,
operate a mobile unit comprising a 4-wheel drive vehicle and audiovisual equipment.
The initial cost of the mobile unit is estimated at US$12,400, with annual operating
costs of US$5,900. Practical demonstrations would be held at the center, which
would be sited on areas with about 100 acres of rubber, 60 of which should be mature.
The project would train 1,150 farmers, 700 tappers, 160 budders, and 100 staff
annually. To encourage smallhLolder participants, they would be paid US$4.00 per day
subsistence for meals and other requirements. Senior Liberian staff would be sent
abroad to work on smallholder commercial rubber plantations and/or rubber research
centers in East Asia. This would provide them with the necessary skills and
practical experience to assume senior RDU positions.



-7-
Marketing
3.06     RDU would assist smallholders by improving on-farm processing and
reducing transportation costs. RDU would also work closely with processing
factories in scheduling farmers' deliveries and collections. An experienced
full-time marketing specialist would be funded under the project, assisted
by an experienced marketing consultant who would make visits totalling four
months during the project period. The marketing department would be equipped
initially with three 7-ton lorries, card punching and weighing equipment, a
4-wheel drive vehicle and 350cc saloon car. During the first two years, the
project would concentrate on farmers within a 40-mile radius of the LRPC
Gbarnga factory, to serve some 940 farms covering 23,000 acres. To determine
the most cost effective and practivally feasible method for collecting and
transporting smallholder rubber, several methods, including the use of group
marketing organizations, cooperatives and private contractors would be tried.
Furthermore, the marketing specialist would work closely with extension staff
in improving on-farm processing techniques.
Farm Planning
3.07     There are many Liberian farmers with farms above 150 acres, who are
anxious to obtain commercial credit for rubber replanting and rehabilitation.
One of the main hindrances to commercial bank lending is the lack of techni-
cal staff to assist farmers in preparing investment plans. RDU would operate
against a fee, a farm planning service to assist medium and large farmers in
preparing applications for commercial bank financing. Senior and junior
farm planning officers, who would be provided with 4-wheel drive vehicles and
office equipment, would provide these services as required. RDU fees for
this service would be designed to fully cover staff salaries, vehicles and
all other operating costs.
Consultant Services, Studies and Surveys
3.08     The project provides for 7.6 man-years of consultants who would:
(a) conduct a Rubber Producer Pricing Study (Project File,
Annex 3) (24 man-months) including an examination of
the present rubber tax and the establishment of a
special rubber development fund;
(b) assist RDU in formulating and monitoring smallholder
marketing programs (4 man-months);
(c) train RDU training instructors (6 man-months);
(d) examine the feasibility of a follow-up project,
including the establishment of Liberian-owned rubber
processing factories (9 man-months); and



- 8 -
(e)  assist the Agricultural and Cooperative Development
Bank (ACDB) in training staff; establishing account-
ing systems and formulating operating procedures
(48 man-months).
The estimated cost per consultant man-year is US$68,000.
C. Cost Estimates
3.09     Total project costs over the 4-1/2 year development period, 1978-1982,
are estimated at US$29.9 million, of which, US$13.8 million, or 46%, would be
foreign costs. Project cost estimates include an estimated US$0.25 of identi-
fiable taxes, but excludes all other identifiable import taxes on all items
imported especially for the project. The latter reflects the Government's
present policy to exempt from duties and taxes all goods imported expressly
for the project. Base cost estimates are based on prices and quotes obtained
during appraisal, updated to reflect baseline costs expected at the end of 1977.
Costs include:
(a)  physical contingencies equal to 5% of base cost estimates: and
(b)  price contingencies which, in accordance with the Bank's
general guidelines, are calculated on base costs plus
physical contingencies and allow for compounded increases
based on the following annual rates of price inflation:
Inflation Rate (%)
1978-79     1980-82      1982 Onwards
(1)   Vehicle, Equipment
and Farm Inputs              7.5          7.0             7.0
(2)   Building and Con-
struction Material           9.0          8.0             8.0
(3)   Salaries, Consultants,
Technical Assistance         7.0          7.0             7.0
3.10     Total contingencies calculated on the foregoing basis are equivalent to
22% (US$6.6 million) of total costs or 29% of baseline costs. Details of project
costs are presented in Annex 1 and summarized in Table 3.

D. Proposed Financing
3.11    Of the total project cost of US$29.6 million, IBRD would finance
US$7.0 million at 7.45 per cent per annum and IDA would provide US$6.0 million
on standard terms. The Bank loan would be for 20 years with a 5-year grace
period. The combined loan and credit would cover 44% of total project costs
net of taxes comprising the foreign exchange costs, and another US$600,000 of
local costs. CDC would finance the local cost of the rehabilitation and
replanting component amounting to US$7.0 million. A further US$1.4 million
would be provided by ODM as technical assistance to meet the cost of eight
expatriate staff salaries of RDU. CDC and ODM financial contributions, which
have been agreed in principal, have yet to be finalized. Farmers would finance
US$0.8 million of farm development cost (materials and hired labor) equivalent
to 3% of total project costs. GOL would finance US$7.4 million, or 25% of
total project costs.

3.12     To achieve the planting program over the 4-1/2 year investment period,
several start-up activities would be carried out between July 1977 and June 1978,
including training of existing staff and new recruits, acquiring lands for
nurseries, headquarters and training center, site preparation for buildings, and
appointment of a general manager. At appraisal, GOL had already allocated
US$0.5 million to MA to cover the start-up activities, which are now progressing
satisfactorily.
E. Procurement
3.13     Most of the fertilizers, chemicals, vehicles, equipment and tools with
an estimated cost of about US$3.1 million would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for vehicles,
equipment and tools would be bulked to the extent possible to permit ICB. Con-
tracts for less than US$50,000 would be obtained by local competitive bidding
under procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Such purchases would be limited to a
total of US$500,000. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% pre-
ference or the applicable import duties whichever is the lower when comparing bids
with those of foreign manufacturers. Civil works, with an estimated cost of
US$3.0 million comprise mainly offices, senior and junior staff housing, training
centers and warehouses, are widely scattered and construction is phased over 4-1/2
years, hence it would not attract international contractors;, consequently, these
would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding satisfactory to the Bank.
F. Disbursement
3.14     Bank Group funds of US$13.0 million would be disbursed over 4-1/2 years
to cover 44% of total project costs against the following categories:
Category I:     100% of the total foreign costs of directly
imported vehicles and vehicle operating
costs; equipment; machinery for felling old
rubber trees; spares, fertilizers, agrocides
and all other on-farm/nursery materials
required for the replanting and rehabilita-
tion program, or 80% of local cost if produced
locally, totalling US$5.6 million;
Category II:    80% of the cost of buildings and furnishings,
totalling US$2.3 million;
Category III:   100% of the costs of internationally recruited
staff (other than those financed by ODM, para
3.11), including their salaries, allowances,
and recruitment costs, and of consulting



- 12 -
services, feasibility studies, totalling
US$1.0 million;
Category IV:     85% of the total costs of training, total-
ling US$1.4 million; and
Category V:      an unallocated amount of US$2.7 million.
Application for withdrawals from the loan/credit would be fully documented.
G. Accounts and Audits
3.15     RDU would maintain accounts in accordance with acceptable accounting
practices to reflect the operations and financial position of the project and
to provide evaluation data. The accounts of RDU would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audited accounts, balance sheets
and operating statements would be submitted to the Bank within four months of
the end of the financial year. GOL would ensure that ACDB, when operational,
would maintain adequate credit and accounting records for each farmer. These
would be available for review by Bank supervision missions and audited annually
by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank.  During negotiations, assur-
ances were obtained to this effect.
IV. TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTION SPECIFICATION 1/
A. Planting Materials
Clones
4.01     The project would not use clonal seedling material since there are no
seed gardens in Liberia and very few plantings of modern clones from which seed
might be collected. The project would therefore produce its own high-yielding
material using bud-grafted clones. Initially, two clones, GTI and Harbel would
be used in about equal proportions, but later, RRIM 600 would be introduced on
larger farms. Characteristics of these three, as well as others that would be
considered, are shown in Table 5.

Annex 1, Working Paper.

Budded Stumps
4.02     The basic material produced would be bareroot budded stumps.  Partici-
pants would be supplied 180 per acre for initial planting. Allowances for
replacements would be 30 per acre for the year of initial planting and a furtI;--
15 per acre the following year. The budded stump requirements, including pro-
visions for sales to large farms outside the project, demonstrations, repla-t-
ings and budwood nursery establishment are shown in Table 6.

Budwood Nurseries
4.04     The project would produce its own budwood for grafting.  Assuming that
one acre of budwood nursery supplies budwood for three acres budded stumps in
the year following planting of the budwood, six acres in the second year follow-
ing planting of the budwood and eight acres budded stumps annually thereafter,
then the acreage of budded stumps that could be sufficiently supplied from the
budwood nursery would be as shown in Table 8.

of recommended fertilizers (Project File, Annex 1), a mix of 50% GTI and 50%
Harbel and allowing for 6-9 months tapping in the year of opening (Year 7 from
planting), the estimated project yields are as shown in Table 9. Results of
the Pilot Rubber Scheme show that rehabilitated semi-abandoned farms can yield
up to 525 lb per acre for about 5 years.

/1   Project tapping Year 1 is a part year at Year 7 after planting.  The
first full year of tapping is Year 2, corresponding to Year I for other
data.
/2   Assuming 50% planted to GTI yielding 80% of Malaysian yields and 50%
Harbel 1 yielding 90% of concession yields, rounded to 50 lb/ac/yr.
AL   Peak yield is assumed for 8 years; tapping yields 10-17 corresponding to
planting years 16-23. T'hereafter, yields are assumed to decrease by 50
lb/ac each year.
*    Less than 15 records.
Farm Inputs. Costs and Credit Requirements for Replanting
4.06      Per acre farm input: requirements and costs for replanting are shown
in Table 10. Total investment costs are US$510.00 per acre of which US$346.00
is for material costs and US$164.00 for labor.  Part of the labor costs
would be met from cash credit: of US$124 per acre. Farmers would contribute
US$49.00 per acre.

Farm Inputs and Cost for Opening One Acre of Rehabilitated Rubber
4.07      The cost of opening an acre of rehabilitated rubber is approxi-
mately US$40 (Table 11). In addition, the farmer would contribute an esti-
mated US$37.00 for tapping in the opening year, and about US$85.0 each year
thereafter for five years (Project File, Annex 1, Table 26) when the trees
are slaughtered. 1/

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 1/
A. Organization
5.01      Project organization would consist of a Rubber Development Unit (RDU)
and a Project Steering Commit'tee (PSC), which would work closely with Agricul-
tural and Cooperative Development Bank (ACDB), Ministry of Lands and Mines
(MLM) and processing companies. PSC and RDU were established as conditions of
Board presentation. Details on project organization are shown in Chart 18073.
PSC would comprise the Minister of Agriculture as Chairman, the Ministers of
Finance, Lands and Mines, and Planning and Economic Affairs, Presidential
Affairs, President of ACCB, P'resident of the Rubber Planters Association, who
will be a Liberian and a smaliholder rubber farmer. RDU's project manager
would be a member and secretary of the Committee. It would be responsible for
determining RDU's policy, approving work programs, budgets and annual reports
and appointing senior staff. It would meet at least four times each year and
other times as the need arises.
B. Rubber Development Unit
5.02      RDU would have three divisions, Finance and Administration, Tech-
nical and Operations. Senior RDU staff would comprise the project manager and
his deputy, heads of the Financial/Administration, Technical and Operations
divisions, and Extension and Training, Farm Planning, Marketing, Credit
Research, Monitoring and Planting Materials officers. The project manager,
who would be the chief executive implementing the project, would be directly
responsible to the Committee. The chief technical officer (CTO) would orga-
nize and direct project technical matters, including overall responsibility
for teaching materials, research, field control, monitoring and evaluation.
The chief operations officer (COO) would implement the program and would be
assisted by senior operations assistants responsible for replanting and reha-
bilitation, training and credit. The financial controller would be responsible
for administration and all project and financial controls and procedures. An
assurance was sought that the project manager, financial controller, chief
technical officer, and chief operations officer would be employed with qualifi-
cations and experience satisfactory to the Bank.
1/ Annex 4 of the Project File Working Paper gives more
detailed information.

Staffing
5.03      Senior staff would be qualified people with experience in commer-
cial rubber production. As there is a general shortage of Liberians of this
caliber, it is expected that candidates for the ten key posts in para 5.02
would have to be recruited internationally. By the end of the project period,
it should be possible to fill these posts with Liberian personnel and a major
responsibility of all internationally recruited staff would be the training
of local staff.  Tentatively, it is envisaged that by project year 3 the ex-
tension and training, marketing and processing specialists and the operations
officer would be replaced by Liberians. Other senior staff are expected to
continue until project year 5. If, however, circumstances permit, the expa-
triate staff would be phased out earlier. RAS staff would be absorbed into
RDU and existing senior counterpart Liberian staff, extension aides, and staff
of the pilot project at Suakoko would become RDU nucleus staff. Liberians
would be hired as line not counterpart staff; as on the job training would
facilitate their replacing expatriate staff.
C. Criteria for Project Participation
5.04      RDU would provide assistance for three categories of farmers:
smallholders depending for their main source of income on rubber enterprises
of 10 acres or less; medium-size farmers 10 to 30 acres; and large farmers
cultivating more than above 30 acres. However, in implementing the project's
replanting/rehabilitation program, RDU would adopt the following credit guide-
lines designed to ensure that the program's beneficiaries include as many
smallholders as possible:
(a) in selecting participants, priority would be given in the
order of:
(i) small farms up to 10 acres; at least 30% of project credit
would be earmarked for this category of farmers;
(ii) medium-size farms of more than 10 acres but not more
than 30 acres; and
(iii)  large farms of more than 30 acres but not more than
150 acres.
Within each category, farms operated by resident owners would
be given preference over other types of farms;
(b)  in order to further encourage smallholder participation, part
of the financial assistance to smallholder farms of up to 6
acres would be a grant, in lieu of a loan, with respect to
labor input (para 3.04);



- 23 -
(c) in all cases project credit would be subject to a maximum
of 30 acres per farmer and would be limited to persons who
own not more than 150 acres of rubber lands; and
(d) large farmers not eligible for project credit would be
assisted by RDU's Farm Planning Service Unit in preparing
proposals for commercial bank financing. However, a fee
would be charged to such farmers to recover salaries
and operating costs of the Farm Planning Service Unit.
An assurance was sought from GOL during negotiations that GOL would ensure
application of the above mentioned credit guidelines in implementation of the
project's replanting/rehabilitation program and that each year it would review
in consultation with the Bank Group the application of the above mentioned
guidelines.
5.05      Prospective participants in replanting must satisfy RDU that they:
(a) have family or hired labor available to establish the
proposed area of replanting and maintain it to maturity;
(b) have the means to finance the estimated farmer contribu-
tion to the total cost of replanting;
(c)  meet RDU criteria for credit worthiness; 1/
(d)  will enter into a formal credit agreement with RDU and
ACDB requiring, inter alia, that they will:
(i)  attend a 5-day replanting course, or, where appropriate,
arrange for the person who will operate the replanting
to attend;
(ii) follow RDU recommendations on replanting techniques and
maintain their replantings to required husbandry standards;
(iii) at maturity, tap their replantings according to RDU
recommendations and sell the whole crop to a single buyer
acceptable to RDU;
(iv) repay their credit in full plus interest rate of 10% per
annum over an 8-year period following 8 years grace for
principal, during which interest would be capitalized; and
(v)  are prepared to offer lands as collateral.
1/ Here the farmer's character, farming skills, debts and proposed investment
plans, if any, would be considered.



- 24 -
5.06      The following eligibility criteria would be applied to ensure small-
holder participation in the rehabilitation program:
(a) the farm must be an ongoing enterprise with part under mature
rubber not tapped;
(b) the trees to be brought into tapping must have a girth of 20
inches or more, measured 30 inches from the ground and
tappable bark sufficient for not less than 5 years regular
tapping on the half spiral, alternate daily system;
(c) the applicant must show to the satisfaction of the project that
he has either family or hired labor available to tap the area
proposed for rehabilitation on a continuing basis; and
(d) the applicant must be prepared to complete a tripartite
tapping credit agreement with the RDU and ACDB which will,
inter alia, require the applicant to:
(i)  attend a training course offered by RDU;
(ii) if appropriate, arrange for all tappers to be employed
on the rehabilitated area to attend a training course
offered by the RDU;
(iii) tap or arrange for tapping of the rehabilitated area
and processing of the crop in accordance with RDU
recommendations;
(iv) sell all rubber harvested from the rehabilitated area
until the credit is completely repaid to a single buyer,
chosen by the applicant and made known to the RDU;
(v)  repay the total credit, over a period of not longer than
four years, plus interest charged on the outstanding
balance at the rate of 10% per annum; and
(vi) permit tapping organized by RDU if he fails to tap or sell.
D., Loan Processing
5.07      Initial screening and selection of project participants would be the
responsibility of the RDU operations division with ACDB administering the credit.
During negotiations, it was agreed that ACDB would receive a 2% commission for
administering project credit and that an agreement acceptable to the Bank would



- 25 -
be made between RDU and ACDB specifying the terms and conditions under which
ACDB would administer project funds.   Signing of this agreement is a condi-
tion of effectiveness of loan/credit. To qualify for project credit, farmers
must be prepared to offer land as collateral. RDU would assist participants
to obtain freehold title authenticated by the Land Survey Department of the
Ministry of Land and Mines. ACDB would hold a lien on the property of the
borrower and would accept the land title as collateral.
5.08      Once formalities are completed, RDU staff would appraise the appli-
cants for technical suitability and credit worthiness. Following evaluation,
a farm plan would be prepared for review and approval by a Credit Authoriza-
tion Committee, comprising the project manager (chairman), chief operations
division, financial controller and the senior credit officer.
5.09      Successful applicants would sign an agreement with ACDB which would
stipulate the amounts, terms, conditions and a schedule of loan repayments;
it would also include an undertaking by the borrower to deliver his output
to a processing plant on his own choice, which would be authorized to make
regular loan deductions.
E. Credit Recovery
5.10      Credit recovery would be made through processing companies.  There
are only a limited number of domestic market outlets for rubber and processing
plants are already making tax deductions on behalf of Government. Furthermore,
processing plant managers have shown willingness to assist in credit collection
at no cost, since increased deliveries from farmers would allow them to make
more efficient use of their plant capacity. For credit recovery, each borrower
at the beginning of the year would designate/authorize in advance a processing
plant to make loan deductions from his production income. Once the authoriza-
tion is made, the farmer would not be permitted to unilaterally either order
suspension of loan deductions or to sell his production elsewhere. Any change
would require the borrower to obtain prior RDU agreement (which shall in turn
inform ACDB of the new arrangement). To facilitate loan deductions, ACDB would
send periodic statements of outstanding loans to processing plants advising
them to deduct fixed amounts per pound dry rubber delivered. In turn, the
processing company would regularly remit to ACDB the loan deductions made with
a statement showing individual quantities delivered, payments made after loan
deductions.



- 26 -
F. Programming and Budgeting
5.11      RDU would prepare annual budgets based on appraisal estimates,
amended where necessary to reflect changes in costs and project development
policies. These would be submitted to the Project Steering Committee for
approval. Quarterly cash flow statements indicating costs, revenues and
capital requirements would also be prepared by RDU and submitted to PSC for
approval. Ministry of Finance would deposit advances to the project bank
account on the basis of these cash flows at least one month prior to com-
mencement of quarter. As condition of Board presentation, RDU has opened a
bank account with an initial deposit of US$250,000.
VI. PRODUCTION, DEMAND, MARKETING AND PRICES
Production
6.01      Liberia's current annual production of 83,000 tons is 2.4% of the
world's total production of natural rubber estimated at 3.5 million tons.
More than 90% goes to the United States. Firestone, B.F. Goodrich and
Uniroyal, three large U.S. tire manufacturing companies, process and sell
Liberian rubber. Some of it is sold to their U.S. affiliates, while the
rest is sold competitively on the commodities exchange market. Sallala Cor-
poration, African Trust Company, Allan Grant and LRPC sell to Europe and
Japan.
Demand and Market
6.02      On the basis of expected replanting and rehabilitation program set
forth in para 3.03 and expected yields (Table 9), output of the project is
expected to increase from 600 tons in 1979 to a high of 26,000 tons by 1998
(Table 18). Project output would be exported as block rubber as its techni-
cal qualities can be specified accurately, hence its demand by manufacturers.
Analyses of world market demand and supply for rubber by IBRD's Commodities
and Export Projections Division in May 1977 show that natural rubber produc-
tion, which had fallen considerably in 1975 as a result of low market prices
and Government-sponsored production controls in some key producing countries,
was slow to react to a changing market situation. The recovery in total
rubber demand was spurred in 1975 by the sharp upturn in industrial activity
in developed countries which account for about 70% of total world consumption
(showing a demand increase of 7.5%) and producing an increase in prices of
natural rubber of more than 30% in 1976. The current price of natural rubber
is US$0.44/lb and the projection of the likely future trend indicates that it
should be selling in 1980 at US$0.436/lb in constant 1977 terms. Furthermore,



- 27 -
the relationship between forecast production and consumption trends indicates
that natural rubber prices are projected to be by the mid-1980s at roughly the
same level -in constant 1977 terms- as in 1980. For the economic analysis of
this project, a price of US$0.436/lb for 1980-1984 and of US$0.426/lb from
1985 onwards have been assumed. Table 13 gives details of the price calcula-
tions used in this analysis. Bank price projections are for RSS1. It is as-
sumed that 80% of project  .upuI: would be SMR5, which is equivalent to RSS1.
6.03      There is surplus processing capacity of 11,000 tons per annum in the
project area 1/. Firestone has a surplus of 5,000 tons (35%), LRPC 6,000 tons
(43%), B.F. Goodrich 2,400 tons (17%), and Allan Grant 1,250 tons (81%).
Because of the high transportation costs of wet coagulated slab rubber (the
form in which farmers sell their product), farmers would sell to the nearest
factory. Farmers are widely scattered throughout the project area and all
processing companies would share in processing incremental project output from
rehabilitation. The incremental output from rehabilitation is expected to
reach a maximun of 5,600 tons in 1983 out of which 3,000 tons would be processed
by LRPC, while the rest would go to concessionaires.  The incremental output
from replanting is estimated to reach 12,000 tons by 1990 and a maximum of
26,000 tons by 1998. By 1990, none of the existing processing companies would
have excess capacity and steps would have to be taken by Government to build
new facilities, unless the private companies take the initiative. UJnder the
project, provision has been made for examining the need for and feasibility of
establishing new Liberian-owned processing facilities.
Producer Prices
6.04      Firestone is the current price setter.  Each month it posts producer
prices for various grades of SPEC, non-SPEC and latex, which are calculated by
taking average Singapore FOB prices of the previous months and deducting pro-
cessing and other expenses. As many Liberian smallholders are questioning, the
justification for the current pricing policies, funds have been provided under
the project for a pricing study which, inter alia, would examine the level of
the selling prices of the concessionaires particularly in comparison to world
prices in the manner in which their prices are fixed; the current pricing for-
mula; processing and marketing costs of all processors, including LRPC and
farmers' production costs. This would provide the basis for a pricing formula
and reviewing pricing annually. The average farmgate price assumed under the
project is 28 cents per d.r.c. pound. The difference between the assumed price
of 28 cents/lb and the current Firestone price of 22 cents/lb for SPEC rubber
is mainly due to the differences in processing costs, finance charges and profit
element of Firestone and that estimated for LRPC 2/. An assurance would be
sought that within 24 months of loan/credit signing, GOL would have completed a
study of rubber pricing policy executed under terms of reference and by consul-
tants acceptable to the Bank; thereafter GOL shall establish in consultation
with the rubber processors an equitable producer pricing policy for rubber pur-
chased from Liberian farmers and the implementation of the policy acceptable
to the Bank.
1/ Further details are provided in Annex 3, the Project File Working Paper on
Marketing, Processing and Prices.
2/ The mission's estimates of LRPC's processing costs based on 400 m/ton output
were USU6 d.r.c./lb, which compares favorably with the recent CDC engineering
appraisal mission estimates of USJ7/lb.

VII.  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Implications for Farmers
7.01      There is no reliable data on the structure of land holdings in the
project area, making it difficult to prepare a typical budget for small and
medium size farmers. RAS surveys of farms less than 100 acres in the project
area indicate a variety of farm sizes: less than 10 acres, 32%; 10-20 acres,
33%; 21-50 acres, 23%; and 51-100 acres, 12%, each group has farms in various
stages of development. Illustrative farm cash flows have been prepared for
small and medium size farms which would constitute the project target group
including: a 3-acre smallholder replanting unit using family labor; a medium
size 15-acre replanting unit using hired labor; and an 8-acre rehabilitation
unit which is a one-man operation in which the farmer provides most of the
labor (2 tasks, 500 trees per task, 125 tapped trees per acre) 1/.
7.02      An illustrative cash flow for a 3-acre rubber enterprise is shown
in Table 14. To provide smallholders with adequate incentives to adopt new,
technology including high yielding planting material, insecticides and fer-
tilizers and to compensate for his labor involvement on the crop during the
gestation period, a cash grant of up to 80% would be provided (para 3.04).
Smallholders would begin loan repayments in year 8. By year 10 with yields
of 1,450 lbs/acre and producer prices of US$0.28/lb they would earn, in
constant 1977 terms, US$3.64/man-day increasing to US$6.96/man-day by year 16.
Overall, the return per man-day is adequate compared to US$1.50/man-day the
smallholder earns in alternative agricultural activities, including working
as unskilled labor on large farms or with concessionaires, or even growing
rice or cassava.
7.03      An illustrative farm cash flow for a 15-acre farm enterprise is
shown in Table 15. With yields of 1,450 lbs during the peak period, producer
prices of US$0.28/lb and wage rates of US$1.50/day, the financial return for
the 15-acre operation is 16.5%. The farmer would begin loan repayment in
year 8. By year 15, when yields are at their peak, net cash returns per acre
are US$231. A 15-acre medium size farm at that point would be able to provide
annual incomes of US$3,698, comparable to the salary income of junior civil
servants and commercial employees residing in urban areas.
1/ Smallholder farms on which replanting and rehabilitation are done simul-
taneously were not considered since:
(a)  smallholders cannot provide labor required for both replanting and
rehabilitation; and
(b) they do not have land for both, replanting and rehabilitation.

7.04      Small farmers would be encouraged to rehabilitate at least 8 acres.
This is a 2-task unit capable of providing full employment to one man. Once
managed properly, these farms can quickly repay loans and show positive
returns. An illustrative farm cash flow for an 8-acre unit is shown in
Table 16. In year 1, an 8-acre unit, after paying all costs, including debt
servicing, yields US$2.3/man-day reaching US$3.5/man-day by year 5. This
compares favorably with the prevailing wage rate of US$1.50/day. Overall,
the returns from replanting and rehabilitation are financially attractive,
and are expected to provide good incentives for participation in the program.
B. Financial Implications to Government
7.05      An illustrative government project cash flow is shown in Table 17.
High investment costs in the early years result in cumulative deficit of
US$8.8 million by project year 5; a further US$23.9 million is required
between 1983 and 1989 (the final year of the program), to bring all plantings
to maturity resulting in peak cumulative deficits of US$34 million in year 12.
However, there would be annual surpluses from 1990 and cumulative deficits
would be eliminated-by 1993, in year 17 of the project. The pattern of
expected deficits is quite consistent with government cash flows for other
projects of this nature, involving long gestation. Moreover, all costs
incurred in establishing RDU and imparting training to its field staff have
been fully imputed to this project -this is quite conservative for in fact,
RDU may also serve to implement further expansion of the project. During ap-
praisal GOL assured the mission that after year 5, it could finance the re-
planting program up to maturity. One way of doing this could be through the
creation of a special rubber development fund financed from an additional
cess on rubber exports. This was discussed with Government during negotia-
tions and it was agreed that the terms of reference for the rubber pricing
specialist should include a study of the rubber tax structure which inter alia
would examine the possibility of creating such a fund.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Economic Benefits and Justification
8.01      Primary benefits would be increased production and exports of rubber
which, at full development in 1998, would amount to about 26,000 tons and
generate annual net foreign exchange earnings of US$18.5 million. The project
would provide employment and increased incomes for approximately 500 budders
and 3,000 tappers.

8.02      There would be 4,000 participants in the replanting program and
2,350 in the rehabilitation program. RDU, through selection criteria, stated
in para 5.04 and 5.05, would ensure that the majority of holdings are less
than 10 acres, owned and operated by family labor. These farms would be a
permanent source of income for smallholders permitting them to earn approxi-
mately US$6.96/day (constant 1977 terms) at full development, compared to
Government wage rates of US$1.50/day and concessionaires, US$3.00/day.
Medium size producer (15-30 acres) would use family labor to organize and
plan the farm, but would hire headmen, tappers or most likely, overseers to
assist in day-to-day operations. At full development, these farms would
generate about US$4,000/annum (1977 constant terms), which compares favorably
with the salaries of junior level civil servants and commercial employees in
Monrovia. The 8-acre rehabilitation farms would generate incomes of approxi-
mately US$3.00/man-day, which compares favorably to Government and concession-
aire wage levels. The cost per farm family and per acre rubber affected in
the replanting program would be US$4,204 and US$420 respectively 1/. The
cost per farm family and per acre rubber affected in the rehabilitation program
is US$1,652 and US$165 respectively.
Economic Rate of Return
8.03      Table 18 shows costs and benefits used in computing the rate of return.
Assumptions are:
(i) a project life of 30 years (corresponding to the normal economic
life of rubber trees planted under the project) with no residual
value attributed after this period;
(ii) all prices are expressed in end 1977 terms;
(iii) project costs exclude price contingencies but include 5% physical
contingencies; exclude identifiable taxes and duties; include
only 50% of costs of studies related to this project, and to
reflect the general scarcity of agricultural labor (para 8.06)
an efficiency wage of US$1.50/man-day as compared to the observed
market wage of US$1.0/man-day (at time of appraisal) has been
used for all project labor (family and hired);
(iv)  in project benefits, per acre yields from replanting are estimated
to increase from 200 lb/acre in the year in which tapping com-
mences to a peak of 1,450 lb/acre (para 4.05); net value of pro-
duction foregone has been calculated on yields of 300 lbs/acre
with a tappable bark of 5 years (Table 26(b), Project File);
1/ This excludes costs of training, consultant services, studies, surveys,
nursery lands, and contingencies, but includes RDU establishment and
operating costs.

(v)  economic farmgate prices are based on IBRD forecasts for 1978,
1979, 1980 and 1985 (EPD, April 1977), expressed in 1977
constant terms (Table 13); and
(vi) in the absence of an official estimate of a standard conversion
factor, all costs and benefits have been valued at the existing
exchange rate.
8.04      Under these assumptions, the rate of return is 13%.  Several tests
were made to determine the sensitivity of the rate of return estimates to
various alternative assumptions. Table 19 shows that the project remains
viable with increases in costs up to 20% and with decreases in benefits to 15%.
A decrease in benefits could occur either as a result of a decrease in commod-
ity prices or due to an overall reduction in yields, the latter resulting from
either below average or poor tapping or disease. The analysis was further
tested to a possible delay in benefits (while variable costs were treated fixed)
by one year which is likely to occur due to a slower than expected rate of
farmer participation. In such an event, the rate of return declines to 11%.
Overall, the rate of return compares favorably with other Bank-financed rubber
projects.
Environmental Impact
8.05      The project would assist in soil and water conservation.  Fertilizers
and chemicals would have no effect on local ecology assuming sound precautions
in their application under RDIJ guidance.
Constraints, Limitations, Risks
8.06      Shortage of professional staff, skilled and unskilled labor is a
possible risk to project implementation, but this would be overcome by:
(i) employing highly experienced expatriate technical staff who
would train Liberian assistants to work with them;
(ii) training existing staff and new recruits at all levels at
project training centers and commercial smallholder rubber
operations in the Far East;
(iii) training tappers, budders, smallholders, headmen and
overseers;
(iv) providing regular jobs at satisfactory wages; and
(v) using mechanical felling.

Although there are no major technical risks, susceptibility to wind damage,
incidence of dry trees, destruction of bark reserve caused by poor tapping
and disease could cause some risk to the project (Table 5). Projected
yields based on concession records are considered feasible under Liberian
soil and climatic conditions; project participants would be able to carry
out proper agronomic practices with RDU technical assistance.
IX. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) GOL would provide by July 1, 1978 lands for headquarters,
housing, training centers, warehouses, nurseries and other
project needs (para 3.02);
(b)  annual accounts of RDU and ACDB would be audited by external
auditors acceptable to the Bank and such reports would be
submitted to the Bank within four months of the end of the
financial year (para 3.15);
(c) positions of project manager, financial controller, chief
technical officer, and chief operations officer would be
filled with qualifications and experience acceptable to the
Bank (para 5.02);
(d) GOL would ensure that RDU would apply, the credit guidelines
at para 5.04; furthermore GOL would review annually in con-
sultation with Bank Group the application of the credit
guidelines;
(e) within 24 months of loan/credit signing, GOL would have
completed a study of rubber pricing policy executed under TOR
and by consultants acceptable to the Bank. Thereafter, GOL
