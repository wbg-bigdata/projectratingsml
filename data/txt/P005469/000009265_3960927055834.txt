MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL CREDI BANk OF mROCCO
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL CREDfT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed financial-intermediary loan to
Morocco for US$190 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variable IBRD interest rate. It would help finance an agricultural
credit project and assist Morocco in meeting national objectives set by the
Government and CNCA for agricultural credit for 1988-92. The National
Agricultural Credit Bank (CNCA), a major specialized financial institution
created in 1961, would be the Borrower, and the Kingdom of Morocco the
Guarantor. The project would be cofinanced by ADB, EIB, FADES, KfW, and OECF
for a total additional US$298 million equivalent.
2.       E             Morocco has a well-developed financial sector which in
1987 provided about DR 52.7 billion to the economy, about two thirds of which
(DR 33.4 billion) were short-term. As part of the adjustment process, efforts
are being made and measures taken to simplify the regulatory framework, reduce
distortions in the financial markets, develop the money market, and strengthen
institutional systems. Financial sector reforms in Morocco have been
supported by the Bank's Second Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment (ITPA
II) loan in 1985 for US$200 million. The National Agricultural Credit Bank
(CNCA) is the largest source (752) ot farm credit in Morocco and virtually the
only source for small farms (1 to 7 ha) in rainfed and poverty-related areas.
CNCA has provided investment credit to farmers over the last 25 years and
currently serves some 500,000 farmers, i.e. one third of farmers in the
country. Bank Group lending for agricultural credit began in 1966 and to
date, six loans have been made to CNCA for a total of US$384.4 million plus
cofinancing by KfW, IFAD, FADES, ADB, EIB/EEC and USAID. These loans have
been highly successful in (a) mobilizing capital for private sector
investments in Morocco; (b) increasing production while improving food
security; (c) upgrading agricultural technology and productivity; and (d)
building an efficient and viable farm credit institution (CNCA). OED has
commented favorably on performance (Schedule C). CNCA's on-lending rates are
positive (average 111 compared with the current inflation rate of about 52)
and it is profitable. However, CNCA still needs to be strengthened to provide
a better range of banking services to its diversified clientele in a period of
dynamic growth, to improve resource mobilization, and to improve the credit
coverage of small farmers from the current level of 152.  At the same time,
recovery performance and policy for provisions need attention.
3.       The project is being introduced at a critical moment for the
agriculture credit sector in Morocco. The medium-term adjustment program for
agriculture, which has been supported by loans 2590-MOR and 2885-MOR is in mid
course. Private investment in agriculture is currently experiencing a period
of dynamic growth after a slowdown in the early eighties due to drought. A
162 real growth was recorded in 1988 and this rate is projected to continue

at least through the coming three years as the effects of adjustment work
t'aeir way through the economy. Sector exports (US$1,032 million in 1988) have
shown renewed growth, outpacing other sectors, and now account for 31% of
total exports (1980/84 28%) with fisheries and agroindustrial exports the
major sources of expansion. In recent years private investment has overtaken
public investment in agriculture reversing the previous proportions.
4.       CNCA needs to position itself to respon-d to this dynamic investment
environment while continuing to play its crucial role in providing for
investment in the poorer regions of the country through its network of local
branches (Caisses Locales) which cover the country. At the same time CNCA
needs to restructure to face increased competition from other commercial banks
in a period where restrictions on all banks are being lifted and competition
is accelerating in all sectors. CNCA's proposed evolution towards a full
service bank by diversifying lending activities and proposed major new efforts
to attract deposits and savings from its local clientele and Moroccan workers
abroad is an essential part of this transformation. Deposits have been
falling in the recent past decreasing from 14.51 of total resources in 1985 to
13.5% in 1987. A growth in domestic deposits of some 302/year is now aimed at
through vigorous new efforts to attract resources from prospective depositors.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Agriculture, which accounts for 181
of GDP and 40S of employment, is a key economic sector in Morocco and the
success of the adjustment program in the sector is essential if the Moroccan
economy is to continue to achieve satisfactory growth rates. The project is
an important element in the Bank's continuing assistance for Morocco's
adjustment program. Bank support in project preparation has been instrumental
in designing a project which would support long-term efforts to promote
private sector investment, stimulate supply responses from the sector and
build the supporting institutional framework required, while paying adequate
attention to the important social aspects of agriculture. At the same time,
apart from supporting conventional lending, the project would support new
efforts in areas of particular interest to the Bank, i.e. (a) export growth,
through an increase in the quality and volume of investments in agroindustries
and fisheries both of which have good export potential, (b) poverty
alleviation by assisting CNCA to develop an innovative project component aimed
at helping the rural poor and rural women through microenterprise and rural
housing development, and (c) local resource mobilization by helping CNCA
design a strategy to mobilize savings and deposits nationwide and from
Moroccan workers abroad. Through the project, the Bank would also support
CNCA's efforts to raise US$298 million of additional cofinancing for
investments in the sector.
6.       Project Obectives. The project objective is to assist CNCA to adapt
its organization and procedures so that it can be responsive to an
accelerating investment rate by the private sector in the rural areas of
Morocco. The project would aim to (a) increase private sector investment in
agricultural development, production and food self-sufficiency; (b) promote
increased investment in high return projects with emphasis on export
production; (c) diversify CNCA clientele and activities; (d) increase domestic
resource mobilization; (e) provide a full range of banking services and
products to the farmer commmnity and to non-farm clients and enterprises so
that CNCA can evolve into a full service bank; and (f) strengthen CNCA's
institutional and financial performance.

7.       Pro ect DeserlvtioWi   The project would support the following
activities over a four-year implementation period (July 1989 - June 1993):
(a)  CNCA Credit Program:  First, the project would continue financing
of (i) on-farm and forestry investments by private farmers.
enterprises and cooperatives; (ii) agro-industrial investments; and
(iii) investments in rural housing construction. Second, as new
elements of the proposed credit program, the project would support
CNCA financing of (i) working capital for agro-industrial exporters;
(ii) private coastal fisheries; (iii) private artisans, with a
special effort being made to support women's activities; (iv) rural
non-farm enterprises; and (v) land consolidation;
(b) Institutioal Development: The project would fund (i) the training
program and equipment needed to better manage CNCA as a universal
bank, assist CNCA's clientele, and promote export-related operations
and lending to women; (ii) training specialists; (iii) professional
visits overseas for local trainers and managers; (iv) consulting
services required for the strengthening of management and to support
Project implementation; and (v) the construction or rehabilitation of
a new tranche of CNCA's regional and local branch offices and other
facilities.
The total project cost is estimated at US$1,532 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$502 million equivalent or about 332. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Retroactive financing of up to 102 of the loan amount (US$19 million) would be
made available to the Borrower for payments made for eligible expenditures
after October 1, 1988 as a bridge between the Sixth Credit Line and this
loan. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The proposed Bank loan of
US$190 million would finance about 12S of total project costs and 33S of the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the project. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Morocco are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7453-MOR, dated Nay 20, 1989, is being distributed
separately.
8.       Actions Taken and Areed.  CNCA has provided a policy statement
satisfactory to the Bank redefining CNCA's medium-term development
objectives. This statement has been endorsed by the Government. CNCA has
also established a satisfactory personnel manual, target organization plan and
training program. In addition, CNCA and the Government have agreed on the
following actions: (a) CNCA would establish within two major regional
branches a unit of its agro-industrial department by December 31, t989, with
terms of reference, staffing, and means satisfactory to the Bank; (b) CNCA
will continue to maintain its prudent overall financial policy and performance
by maintaining minimum standards of capital adequacy, liquidity, profitability
and levels of interest rates and debt, as measured before June each year by
appropriate financial ratios, and ensuring adequate provisioning for bad
debts; (c) CNCA would take satisfactory actions during project implementation
to improve its organization and procedures for developing new competitive
banking services and products for its increasingly diversified clientele; (d)
CNCA will obtain the Bank's prior approval for bidding packages for works and
equipment, of US$700,000 equivalent or above, and for individual subloans to
agro-processing and fishery investors of above DR 10 million (US$1.25 million



-4-
equivalent); (e) the Government's requested margins will allow CNCA to set
interest rates at leveis sufficient to maintain CNCA's financial viability;
and (f) Government will prepare a study by June 30, 1990, with a view to
establishing during project implementation, a National Guarantee Fund to cover
the risk of unpaid subloans in rainfed areas in case of calamities.
Satisfactory arrangements have been made between the Borrower and the
Guarantor for sharing the risk of foreign exchange losses. On-lending terms
and conditions would be in accordance with CNCA's existing policies and
practices, which are acceptable to the Bank. For the financing of working
capital subloans for exporters (US$20 million), receipt of their terms and
conditions and operating procedures satisfactory to the Bank would be a
condition of disbursement of this part of the project. Fulfillment of the
conditions of effectiveness of all cofinanciers' loan agreements would be
aimed at before June 30, 1990.
9.       Benefits. The proposed project would help achieve a vital
transition in CNCA's institutional development by converting CNCA into a
full-service bank which would improve Morocco's institutional capabilities to
promote private sector investment and growth in the rural sector, and increase
domestic savings. Through provision of investment credit to private farmers
and other operators, the project would also contribute to increased
production, exports, and rural employment while reducing pressure for public
investment. This, in turn, would impact favorably on the economic and social
goals of Morocco.
10.      Risks. The risks are mainly associated with (a) the length and
difficulty of the ongoing institutional reform process at CNCA because of
Government's past reluctance to increase CNCA's managerial autonomy; since the
Government reaffirmed in 1987 full support for CNCA's reforms, this risk is
considered reduced; and (b) the threat of severe droughts which Morocco seems
to experience at intervala of about five years. Droughts create problems in
eredit recoveries and may warrant writing off arrears or rescheduling farmers'
debts. On the basis of current and past experience, this risk has not
adversely affected CNCA's performance mainly due to CNCA's prudent lending
policies, collection methods and provisions for bad debts. For the future,
the proposed creation of a National Guarantee Fund being pursued under the
project would provide additional safeguards to CNCA in cases where it is clear
that arrears have been caused by a natural calamity.
11.      Recommendatio.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan to CNCA
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the loan.
