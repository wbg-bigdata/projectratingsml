Description         The Government o f Poland has requested a US$1.25 billion
                    equivalent Development Policy Loan in support o f its fiscal reform
                    and consolidationplans and broader economic reform program. The
                    loanwould be the first ina programmatic series o f three policy loans
                    within a total lending envelope o f US$3.75 billion equivalent over
                    the next 2 to 3 years.

Benefits            The programmatic policy lending program would support the
                    government's plans to enhance the quality and efficiency o f public
                    finances, increase the supply o f relevant and skilled labor, and
                    strengthen the business environment. The programmatic series will
                    be accompanied by a program o f technical cooperation and
                    knowledge sharing to complement and extend existing reform plans
                    and priorities. The policy focus o f each operation would be closely
                    aligned with the government's current reform priorities and the
                    political feasibility o f specific reforms. The Bank's engagement with
                    Poland on key policy issues provides important experience and
                    knowledge to the Bank as well, which will be relevant for our
                    collaboration with other countries inthe region.

Risks               Deterioration of macroeconomic balances.             The medium-term
                    macroeconomic scenario           o f slowing economic     growth and
                    moderating inflation i s subject to further downside risks. While
                    inflationary pressures have abated significantly with the recent
                    global slowdown and tighter credit conditions, wage growth has
                    been relatively robust, and the recent depreciation o f the zloty could
                    rekindle inflationary pressures. Poland has one o f the most solid

                   financial systems in Europe, but, nevertheless, the authorities have
                   responded to rising pressures with confidence-restoring and
                   liquidity-enhancing measures. Going forward, fiscal policy will need
                   to play a key role in managing demand flexibly while the supply
                   side needs to be further stimulated through acceleration of structural
                   reforms. Public sector wage growth will need to be contained, in
                   particular to help send the right signal to private labor markets. The
                   proposed series of operations supports this policy mix through its
                   emphasis on fiscal discipline and reform, labor market and pension
                   reform, deregulation, privatization, and overall policy coordination.
                   The Government's announcement of an ambitious planto adopt the
                   euro in 2012 helped to anchor financial market expectations and
                   lendsfurther credibilityto its medium-termfiscal plans.
                   Weakening political support for            reform.      The political
                   environment-with     the Government's lack of qualified majority in
                   Parliament and risk of Presidential veto on new proposed
                   legislation-may    make it increasingly difficult for the Government
                   to advance its reform program over the next two years as
                   Presidential elections approach. However, the inherent flexibility of
                   the proposed programmatic approachwill allow program content to
                   evolve instep with government priorities.
                   Insufficient institutional cupacity. Policy formulation in Poland
                   has tended to be fragmented and technical and administrative
                   capacity in some ministries is weaker than desirable. The proposed
                   programmatic series would help strengthen policy coordination and
                   technical/administrative capacity through the Bank's analytic and
                   advisory services.

                        I. BACKGROUND RATIONALE AND

 1. Polandhas madeimpressiveprogress towards creatinga modern,market-based
economy, and has successfully managed its integration into the European Union
(EU) since accession in 2004. Recent macroeconomic performance has been favorable,
with strong output growth and a rapid decline in unemployment combined with low
inflation and external imbalances. Meanwhile, buoyant tax revenues have ledto a decline
inthe fiscal deficit. Growthhasbeenbuilt on avibrant private sector which now accounts
for three-quarters o f the economy. High growth in domestic consumption reflects the
rapid increase in living standards for most Polish citizens. Likewise, poverty levels have
decreased and are now concentrated inrural areas and among the long-term unemployed.
But the reform momentum has slowed following EU accession, and the strong growth
over the last few years reflects to a significant extent a rebound from the economic
downturn in the earlier part of the decade combined with a favorable external
environment.

 2. The constraintsto continuedrapidconvergenceto averageEU income levels are
becomingvisible.Notably, infrastructure development has been lagging and bottlenecks
are emerging in the labor market-xacerbated         by outward migration, including o f
skilled and highly educated workers-fueling     acceleration in wage growth that i s adding
to inflationary pressures and increasing the external current account deficit. The business
environment has been hampered by excessive regulation and high costs. Lack o f fiscal
space, combined with technical and administrative constraints, has also contributed to a
slower rate o f absorption o f EU funds. Environmental commitments and the challenges
posed by global warming at the same time call for,further efforts to improve energy
efficiency. Growth diagnostics are discussed inmore detail inBox 1below.

 3.  The key challenges now will thus be to enhance the quality and efficiency of
publicfinances, increasethe supply of relevantand skilledlabor, and strengthenthe
business environment. Along the road to adopting comprehensive EU standards and
practices, further strengthening o f public administration capacity and reforming public
finances will be essential. Poland intends to increase the quality o f its public services
(including the quality and relevance to the labor market of the skills o f graduates from the
education system) and make room for financing o f critical infrastructure and other
investments while further lowering the high tax burden, not least on labor. To this end,
the Government will strive to improve the efficiency o f social and pension spending and
the targeting o f social assistance programs. The development o f an effective medium-
term expenditure framework, consistent with continued lowering o f the fiscal deficit and
reduced public debt servicing costs, and increased performance-orientation in the
management o f public resources are key complements in this regard. Streamlining o f
business    regulations,  improvements     in public-private    partnership frameworks,
privatization in strategic sectors, and enhanced efficiency o f the judiciary sector are
needed to maintain the ongoing stimulus in private investment. The program o f the new
Government, which came into power in late 2007, augurs well for addressing these
critical challenges, although concrete strategies and policies in many areas remain to be
fully articulated.

4. The World Bankhas been a close partner of Polandin supportingits successful
transformationandEUintegration,both by helping design and implementpolicies and
institutional reform, and addressing the social costs o f transition. The focus o f the World
Bank duringthe 1990s and early 2000s was on private sector development, strengthening
social support services, rebuilding basic infrastructure, and protecting the environment.
Working closely with successive governments, World Bank support has been provided
through a combination o f analytic and financial services and technical cooperation (TC).
Since World Bank lendingto Poland started in 1990,financial commitments total US$6.4
billion for 45 projects. Currently, eight investment projects are under implementation in
support o f roads rehabilitation and modernization, port improvements, energy efficiency,
river basin flood prevention, and social services in rural areas. Recent analytic and
advisory activities includes studies on growth, employment and living standards; the
fiscal framework for growth (public expenditure and institutional review); Doing
Business and investment climate assessments; a knowledge economy assessment; legal
barriers to contract enforcement; and regional economic andpublic finance reports.

 5.  The World Bank has been adjustingits partnership model in Poland to reflect
the country's major progress and evolving needs. The nature o f Poland's challenges
and reform agenda has changed considerably since the earlier days o f World Bank
involvement. The EU and its institutions are now Poland's main external partners, to
which the World Bank i s committed to play a supporting role. Poland also has access to
considerable external financing, including large volumes o f EU Structural and Cohesion
Fundson a grant basis. Inthis context, the nature of the relationship has moved to a more
selective engagement, with more flexibility to respond to Poland's priorities and
increased focus on areas where the World Bank can offer the most value added. At the
same time, support for broader policy reform continues to be most effectively provided
through bundling o f lending and technical cooperation as this helps to strengthen policy
coordination and consistency and build consensus around reforms.

 6. The new Government and the Bank have recently focused on defining a more
strategic re-engagementin core policy areas. The Bank has renewed its dialogue with
several line ministries under the new government, and there is interest in technical
cooperation and knowledge-sharing in key policy areas such as strengthening the
business environment, infrastructure development, regional development, public finance
and administrative reform, and climate change.

 7. The proposedoperation is fully consistent with the diagnostics, strategic pillars
of engagement and Bank value-added in the 2005 Country Partnership Strategy.
The 2005 CPS for Poland included three pillars: fiscal consolidation, convergence/
competitiveness, and employment and poverty. The proposed operation (discussed inthe
following), while not foreseen in the CPS, i s fully consistent with Bank intervention
along the envisaged strategic pillars of engagement. The operation focuses on core areas
o f Bank value-added, notably public finance reforms, labor market and pension reforms,
and private sector development.' The broad and strategic 2005 CPS envisaged


  The challenges of tackling labor market rigidities and population aging are prevalent across Central and
EasternEurope. Engagementwith Poland on these key economic policy issues will provide the Bank with
important experience andknowledge, which will be relevant for our engagement with other countries inthe
region.

       elaboration o f annual, more concrete business plans, but no such plans were agreed in
       FY07-08given the rapid changes onthe political scene.

                     BOX 1.SUPPORTING HIGHAND SUSTAINABLEECONOMICGROWTHMPOLAND

Although recent economic performancehas been impressive, Poland still faces important growth constraintswhich
may slow down the real convergence process over the medium-long term. In 2007, Poland's GDP per capita at
purchasingpower parity amountedto 53.6 percentofthe average for the EU-27. A continued rapidreduction ofthe income
gap requireshighand sustainablegrowth based on sustained productivity increases and higher employment and investment
rates (potential medium to long term growth rates are estimatedat 4.5 to5.0 percent assuming a continued gradualincrease
inemploymentrates, rapidinvestmentgrowth, andcontinuedrobustproductivity growth).

While the Bank has not completed any core diagnostic work on Polandrecently, many key issues have been coveredin the
Bank's regional economic studies. There is broad consensus (including among the EC, the IMF, and the OECD) that
policy interventions aimed at promoting high and sustainable growth should be focused on the following three
broad areas:
(a) Public finance and administrative reforms aimed at continued fiscal consolidation, lowering of the tax burden, re-
orientation of spending towards more productive areas, improved public finance management, and enhanced public
administration (publicfinance and administrative reform);

(b) Promoting private sector investment through an improved investment climate, more product market flexibility, and
restructuring of key sectors (structural reforms); and

(c) Increasing labor force participation and employment including in order to further reduce poverty and encourage social
inclusion (labor supply mobilization).
Publicfinance reforms are required in order to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances. Further fiscal
consolidation is needed to improve macroeconomic stability and provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy. A lower
tax burdenand simpler tax system is needed to encourage formal private sector activity. A re-orientation and restructuring
of spending is needed to provide fiscal space for increasedproductive spending, notably on infrastructure, and improved
outcomes of key public services (including health and education). Public finance management reforms are needed to
enhance the transparency and predictability of public finances and should include introduction of a medium-term
expenditure framework and enhanced performance-orientation in spending ministries and agencies. Public administration
reforms are needed to support more efficient management and service delivery, including better policy coordination. This
should include reforming and modernizing Poland's courts (which are a source of major delay for businesstransactions)
and enhancing the capacity and results-orientation of the civil service and the public administration at all levels of
government.

Structural reforms are needed to improve the general investment climate and support the restructuring of low-
productivity sectors. Poland ranks low on Doing Business Indicators even among its regional peers, and further
deregulationis needed. This should include a simplification of Poland's onerous legal, tax and administrative environment
for entrepreneurship and business development. Licensingrequirements and business startup regulations are particularly
burdensome. Inaddition, the Government could facilitate the continued shift away from old industrial and low-productivity
sectors to new job-rich, high-productivity sectors. This would include restructuring sectors such as coal or energy
generation and removing incentives for people to remain in low-productivity agriculture while accelerating the
privatization process (including in what are considered strategic sectors). The Government could also further support the
high productivity sectors by promoting private sector research and development to increase the overall level of R&D
expendituresas well as its composition in line with successful innovating economies, including through provision of seed
capital for developing early stage technologies.

Labor supply mobilization is needed to raise low employment rates, not least among the older cohorts, and improve
the skills of the workforce. This requires reform of the system of social protection and labor taxation in order to enhance
incentivesto work along with development of more flexible forms of employment, improved active labor marketprograms
targeted at disadvantagedworker groups and promotion of life-long learning. Limiting the number of professions entitled
to early retirement would be in line with the principles of the pension reform introduced in 1999 and in support of
increasedlabor force participation. Continued reforms in the education system are also needed to improve labor market
relevance and skills. While outward migration has been a concern following EU accession, remittances have been
substantial, andpeople are beginning to return as economic prospects improve at home.

 8. The proposed operation i s also consistent with the Bank's new Regional
Partnership Strategy currently under preparation. The new Regional Partnership
Strategy (planned for Board discussion in March 2009) will update the 2004 Framework
paper for the EU-8 countries and replace individual Country Partnership Strategies for
new EU Member States. The aim of the regional approach is to set out the broad themes
on which the Bank will engage with countries across the region over the next few years
while the instruments for engagement will be determinedby each country's relationship
with the Bank. The overarching theme will be to help countries meet the LisbonAgenda.
The proposed operation fits well within the proposed areas of engagement, which
include: global and regional public goods (including climate change and financial
stability); growth and competitiveness (including investment climate reforms and labor
market flexibility); social and spatial inclusion; and public sector reform (including
public finance and administrative reform).

 9. The Bank has engaged in close consultations with both the International
Monetary Fund and the European Commission, who are supportive of continued
Bank policy lending as long as it support further restructuring of public finances and
fiscal consolidation and is fully consistent with EU commitments, including the Broad
Economic Policy Guidelines, Poland's Convergence Program and Council Opinions on
this, andEC assessments of Poland's National LisbonStrategy implementation.

10. Robust growth has remained well-balanced and other macroeconomic
fundamentals broadly sound despite unfavorable global trends. Strong growth has
beencreating newjobs. Rising labor demand and, to a lesser degree, external migration,
have reduced the unemployment rate to 7 percent in 2008 from 20 percent a few years
ago (Box 2). Inline with global tendencies, from late 2007 inflation acceleratedabove the
inflation target (of 2.5 +/-1 percent), driven largely by cost factors (higher food and
energy prices) but also rising unit labor costs resulting from the sharp labor market
tightening. In response, interest rates were hiked gradually from spring 2007, while
accompanying zloty appreciation made monetary conditions even more restrictive.
Although the external current account deficit widened further to 4.7 percent of GDP in
2007, it remained moderate by historical and regional standards and was almost fully
financed by net foreign direct investment (FDI). In addition, the foreign-debt-to-GDP
ratio stabilized at around 47 percent of GDP in2007.

                                   Box2. RECENTLABOR         MARKET  DEVELOPMENTS
Labor market conditions in Poland have improved considerably in the last few years. The unemployment
rate fell from about 20 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in Q2-2008. The growth in employmentwas accompaniedby
strong growth in real wages, which averaged 3 percent per year over the last 5 years, accelerating inthe last two
years. However, despite the considerable progress in reducing unemployment, labor market outcomes remain
unsatisfactory in Poland. The employment/populationratio is one of the lowest inthe EU(57 percent against the
EU average of about 65 percent) and far from the Lisbon target of 70 percent. The low employment rate is
primarily due to the low labor force participationof older workers (ages 55 to 64), which at only 32 percent is the
lowest in the EU. The very low labor force participation of older workers is primarily accounted for by the
availabilityof generousearlyretirementschemes.

While long-term unemployment looms large in Poland, its incidence has recently declined significantly (from
50 to 30 percent over the last year). Still, many of the unemployedcannot find ajob despite strong labor demand,
a sign of labor market, and consequently social, exclusion.

The improvementin labor market conditions has had a profoundpositiveeffect on poverty.As a result, the
official poverty rate dropped by almost 5 percentage points injust three years: from the peak of 19.2 percent in
2004 to 14.6percent in2007, with the trendcontinuingin2008.

Although labor resources are substantially underutilized in Poland, many firms face acute labor and skill
shortages.The strong growth in labor demandhas brought about labor shortages, aggravatedby out-migrationof
skilled workers. The job vacancy rate has increased and employers now cite lack of skilled labor as the most
important obstacle to the operation and growth of their firms. Skill shortages indicate that unemployment in
Poland has a significant structuralcomponent, becausethe unemployeddo not possessthe skills that are required
by employers. Ifnot addressed, skill shortages may become a constraint on investment and firm growth and thus
hinder future economic expansion. It is encouraging that the rapid outflow of workers to other EU countries
following EU accession now appears to have subsided as employment and income prospects have improvedat
home, includingwith the rapidappreciation ofthe zloty.

In short, within just a few years, the Polish economy has moved from a shortage of jobs to a shortage of
skilledworkers. The table below summarizesthese developments.

11. The fiscal stance improved significantly in 2006-07 in tandem with the economic
upturn. The general government deficit, in line with ESA95 methodology and including
the costs of pension reform (around 2 percent of GDP per annum), amounted to 2 percent
of GDP in 2007 compared to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2006 and 4.3 percent of GDP in
2005. This impressive outcome was achieved due to strong revenues and tight spending
control. Due to strong nominal GDP growth, zloty appreciation, and a primary fiscal
surplus of around 0.5 percent of GDP, the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from over
47 percent of GDP in 2005-2006 to 45 percent of GDP in 20072. At the end of 2007,
Poland met the reference values for deficit and debt (officially the fiscal criterion was
fulfilled after the abrogation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure in July 2008) and
fulfilled the inflation and interest rate criteria of the Maastricht Treaty.

12. Due to the timing of the budget cycle, the Tusk cabinet had little opportunity to
introduce any major changes in the draft budget for 2008, which implied
a deterioration of the fiscal policy stance in 2008 by around 0.5 percentage points of
GDP as compared to the surprisingly good fiscal performance in 2007. This outturn is
due to policy measures adopted before the October 2007 parliamentary elections, both
reducing public revenues (a second cut of the disability pension contribution rate and
income tax relief for families with children), and increasing expenses (more generous
pension indexation). This effect will be only in part offset by deficit-decreasing factors
(higher inflation, better tax compliance and broader tax base due to tax wedge reduction,
and excise duty hikes). During the Parliamentary debate after the elections, the state
budget deficit for 2008 was reduced rather symbolically as compared to the draft budget
preparedby the former Government.

13.  The latest Convergence Program adopted by the Tusk Government in March
2008 envisaged a more ambitious fiscal consolidation in 2009-10 than earlier
programmed. The difference resulted both from the good revenue outcome in 2007 and
a firm commitment to fiscal discipline. In 2009-10, the official fiscal path envisaged an
improvement of the headline and primary fiscal balances by 0.5 percent of GDP per year.
At the same time, the structural deficit was to be reducedby 0.6 percent of GDP in2009
and 0.7 percent of GDP in2010. The fiscal adjustment was expectedto occur against the
background of real GDP growing close to its potential rate of 4.5-5 percent per annum.
The structural deficit was set to reach the medium-termobjective (MTO), as defined in
the Stability and Growth Pact at around -1 percent of GDP, in 2011-0ne year after the
time horizon of the Convergence Program. Even with the temporary fiscal policy
relaxation targeted in 2008, public debt would remain on a downward trend and decline
from around45 percent of GDP in2007 to around 42 percent o f GDP in2010.

  In 2007, Poland's nominal GDP increased by 10.2 percent. The Zloty appreciated significantly against
currencies, in which public debt is denominated(6.2 percent against the Euro and 16.3 percent against the
USdollar). At end-2007, 24.2 percentof State Treasury debt was denominatedinforeign currencies, with a
dominating role of the Euro (17.4 percent ofthe total debt), while the U S dollar constituted 2.7 percent, the
Japanese Yen 1.8 percent, the Swiss Franc 1.7 percent and other currencies 0.6 percent.. At the same time,
interest payments of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2007 were pushing the public debt-to-GDP ratio up. In 2007,
the average term to maturity (ATM) of marketable domestic State Treasury debt increasedto 5.30 years
from 5.11 years in2006, while the A T M of foreign State Treasury debt remained unchanged as compared
to the previousyear and amountedto 8.28 years.

   14. Planned policy measures would have little impact in 2008 but result in faster
   decrease of public expenditures than revenues in 2009-2010. As compared to the
   expected outcome of 2008, the adjustment would be broadly equally distributed over
   2009 and 2010. Over the two years, overall expenditures would decline by 2.4 percent of
   GDP and focus on social spending and current operational spending. At the same time,
   revenues would decline by 1.3 percent o f GDP. The combination of lower expenditures, a
   lower overall tax burden, and a declining share of direct taxes in the structure of tax

  and expenditure cuts would be desirable giventhe still quite large public sector.

 15.    The EC on June 11, 2008 recommended closing Poland's Excessive Deficit
  Procedure (imposed in 2004). In mid-2008, the EC made its recommendation on the
  basis of Poland's updated Convergence Program and confirmed that the deficit was
  reduced below the reference value o f 3 percent of GDP in a credible and sustainable
  manner.Nevertheless, the EC, inRecommendationfor a Council Opinion on the Updated
  Convergence Program o f Poland (adopted also on June 1l),              invited Poland to exploit the
  favorable growth conditions to strengthen the pace o f structural adjustment towards the
  MTO, inparticular in order to contain possible inflationary pressures, by using any extra
  revenue and unspent resources for deficit reduction in 2008 and by specifying and
  implementing measures, especially on the expenditure side, inthe following years. These
  views were echoed by the European Council in its opinion, which also noted that "given
  the risks to the budgetarytargets from 2009, mainly due to a lack o f specified measures,
  the MTO may not be achieved by 2011 as planned in the program. Moreover, should
  inflationary pressures appear, a tighter fiscal stance than foreseen in the program would
  be required." The IMF endorsed the Government's fiscal consolidation plans in its April
  2008 Article IV consultation, but also expressed some concern owing to the downside
  macroeconomic risks and the absence o f well-specified measures to achieve the fiscal
  targets.

 16. Poland has not been immune to the ongoing global financial crisis despite
  relatively moderateexternal vulnerability. Since the beginningo f September 2008, the
  headline equity index (WIG) has declined by 30 percent. Outflow o f foreign investors
  from emerging markets resulted in heavy depreciation o f the zloty-since                          early
  September, the zloty has fallen by 20 percent against the U S dollar and 8 percent against
  the euro. The re-pricing of risk has also been reflected in widening government bond
  spreads-Poland's     Euro-denominated sovereign bond spreads were at 237 basis points in
  early November, 150 basis points higher then in September 2008, though relative to other
  emerging market economies these increases are on the low side. Poland's external


                                                12

vulnerability is considered moderate. While external debt amounts to about 50 percent o f
GDP and the short-term debt on a "remaining maturity basis" and short-term debt in
relation to foreign exchange reserves are high, Poland seems better positioned than other
emerging markets. For instance, output i s close to potential, the current account deficit i s
low, and private sector credit growth, while still averaging in nominal terms some 30
percent per year, i s much lower than inother transition countries.

17. In addition, the authorities have reacted with confidence-restoring and
liquidity-enhancing measures,          highlighting their       commitment to       sound
macroeconomic management. In particular, in late October 2008, the Government
announced a roadmap to euro adoption in2012,3 which helped to anchor financial market
expectations. The Polish banking system i s widely considered to be relatively robust (See
Box 3), but the National Bank o f Poland took precautionary steps and expanded its term
liquidity management operations and FX swap facility in euro and US dollar. The
Government also increased guarantees for bank deposits to EUR 50,000 from EUR
22,500 and proposed a law to support financial market institutions facing insufficient
liquidity. The support may be granted inthe form o fthe state treasury guarantees, lending
treasury papers, sale o f treasury papers with a delayed maturity or spreading the
repayments     into   installments. The Financial Supervision Authority issued
recommendations on tightening of existing lending rules. As a result, a number of
banks have already introduced restrictions on Swiss Franc loans, tightened lending
procedures, and introduced new mortgage lendingregulations, including higher margins,
stricter creditworthiness assessment criteria and increases in the amount required for
down payments.

18.  GDP growth prospects have deteriorated markedly, and the IMF expects a
sharp slowdown from 5.0 percent this year to 2.9 percent in 2009, while a more
moderateslowdown(to 4 percentin 2009) is projectedby the Bankwhich is close to
the recent EC forecasts and market consensus. Because the markets have not yet
stabilized, the projections are still subject to unusually large uncertainty, and downside
risks dominate. In recent weeks, virtually all international financial organizations and
private financial institutions have lowered their global growth forecasts, including for
Poland, and the Government o f Poland i s also revisiting its macroeconomic forecasts. An
updated Convergence Program i s due inDecember 2008.

19. Although the slowdown in the second half of 2008 and into 2009 was expected
for cyclical reasons, the escalation of the internationalfinancial crisis and sharper
than envisaged slowdown in the global economy and euro-zone, combined with
tighter domestic credit conditions, are exacerbatingthe downturn. High frequency
indicators-industrial    and construction production or retail sale-suggest       a modest
slowdown in the third quarter o f 2008 while confidence indicators suggest a sharper
deterioration ineconomic conditions (see Chart 5).




 This would implyjoining the ERM-2aroundthe middle of2009.

                                       BOX 3. POLAND'S BANKING SYSTEM
In 2007, the performance of Polish banks was very good. The banks' aggregated return on equity reached28.6
percent, resulting from improvements in virtually all areas including: (i) increase in net interest margin; (ii)a
                                                                          an
substantial increase in fee income from banking products and mutual funds; and (iii)a decrease in the cost to
income ratio, and lower risk charges. The profitability of other financial sector institutions was also robust.
According to the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA), through September 2008 the net financial profit
o f Polishbanks equaled to PLN 12.7 billion as compared to PLN 10.5 billion a year ago (21 percent increasey/y).
However, the profitability is expected to decline in 2008 and a few years beyond, for various reasons including
that: (i) collapse in equity value has led to redemptions from mutual funds for the first time in years, thereby
         the
reducing fee income for banks; and (ii)the cost of risks is expected to increase with the slower economic growth
and lower real estate prices.

Poland has one of the most solid financial systems in Europe.According to the IMF Article IV report of 2008,
Polandhas little, if any, exposure to U S sub-prime mortgage assets. The National Bank of Poland Stability Report
of June 2008 confirms this and highlights that insurance companies and pension funds are also not exposedto the
USsub-primecrisis. Foreigncapital inflows have heldupwell compared to other European emerging markets. In
contrast, the stock market retrenchment has beenmore severe given the strong gains o fthe last years.
Starting from January 1, 2008, financial supervision is carried out by the PFSA, after the integration of
financial and banking supervision inview of the growing significance of multinational financial groups and cross-
sector financial products. Tasks of the PFSA are more broadly defined than its predecessors, including
undertaking measures aimed at ensuring the stability, safety and transparency of the financial market, and
consumer issues such as clients' complaints, financial education, and codes o f best practice. Banking regulations
and supervision practices are harmonized with EU directives and practices, and 7 of the 9 largest banks are
controlled by foreign banks. The Solvency Ratio of Polishbanks has fallen after the implementation of Base111, to
11percent at the end of 2007 (from 14 percent in2006) and to an estimated 10.2 percent in2008.

I n 2008, credit growth remained strong (at 25-30 percent year-on-year), especially in the mortgage market,
but started slowing (from annual growth rates over 40 percent in 2006-07) under the impact of rising interest
rates, falling real estate prices, and tighter lending standards. The private sector (households and enterprises)
credit to GDP ratio increased from 3 1 percent in 2006 to 39 percent in 2007 and to 45,percent in mid-2008. The
penetration of deposits has also increased, from 42 percent of GDP in 2007 to 45 percent in mid-2008.
Nevertheless, these numbers remain among the lowest in the EU and well below the EU average, and future
growth should be significantly slower.

Generally, the Polish banking system is sound, albeit with some vulnerability; and the high profitability
related to outstanding macroeconomic performance and booming markets is not sustainable over the
medium-term.
-   Banks' foreign debt increased in recent years, but the level is relatively low (in mid-2008, it amounted 13.4
    percent of GDP as compared to 38.1 percent of GDP on average inthe EU10). Therefore, banks in Poland are
    not as much dependent on foreign financing as banks in other countries inthe region.
-   The loan to deposit ratio is around 100 percent, much lower than inmost other countries inthe region. Credit
    expansion is mainly financed from domestic deposits.
-   Foreign currency loans constitute around one-quarter of total loans to the private sector, a lower share than
    elsewhere inthe region. However, as much as 49 percent o f retail mortgage debt outstanding is denominated
    in foreign currency, mainly the Swiss Franc. The share of Swiss Franc-denominated business fell since mid-
    2006 when supervisory restrictions were implemented (imposing stricter LTV ratios and requiringbanks to
    conduct depreciation stress tests). Macroeconomic and property price corrections should make mortgage
    lending inforeign currency riskier.
-   Bank ownership is well diversified. Foreign investors control around three-quarters of the assets of the
    banking sector in Poland, but the ownership structure is well balanced in terms o f country of origin although
    mainly from Western Europe.

  20. The IMF's updated World Economic Outlook (WEO) assumes a sharp
   slowdown of economic activity with zero growth in investment and associated
   import compression resulting in a strong improvement of external and internal
   imbalances.The current account deficit is projectedto narrow to 2.6 percent of GDP and
   inflation to decline to close to the 2.5 percent NBP inflation target in2009 (Table 2). The
   Bank and EC assume a slower deceleration indomestic demand growth, but even inthese
   more optimistic GDP growth scenarios, the external current account deficit should remain




                                                15

within relatively safe limits while inflation should ease from its current elevated level
towards the N B P target.

21. Under these circumstances, a case can be made for fiscal policy to allow
automatic stabilizers to operate in 2009 while staying within medium-term fiscal
boundaries. The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the 2009 budget bill (4.8
percent growth) have been overtaken by events and sticking to the targeted deficit would
imply an untimely fiscal withdrawal. Given the below-potential growth and fiscal
consolidation to date, automatic stabilizers-operating on the revenue side-would
provide a welcome counter-cyclical impulse. Fiscal policy should, nonetheless, remain
governed by the budget envelope and the authorities' overarching medium-term
objective. Fiscal performance so far in 2008 has been better than targeted (in January-
October 2008, the state budget deficit amounted to 43 percent o f the original annual
target), and the expected stronger base in 2008, combined with the legally binding state
budget deficit target in 2009, will help protect the fiscal position in 2009. The
Government is also planningsome institutional reforms with a new law on public finance
(including consolidation o f budgetary units, a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework with
state-budget deficit ceilings, and advances inperformance budgeting), which would help
contain public expenditures and add credibility to medium-term fiscal commitments.
Overall, the Bank finds the macroeconomic policy framework to be adequate for a
development policy operation.

22. The global economic outlook remains uncertain. According to the most recent
WE0 Update, financial conditions continue to present serious downside risks. While the
forceful policy responses in many countries have contained the risks o f a systemic
financial meltdown, there are reasons to remain concerned about the potential impact on
activity o f the financial crisis. The process o f deleveraging could be more intense and
protracted than factored into the macroeconomic projections for emerging markets.
Intense deleveraging could also increase the risks o f substantial capital flow reversals and
disorderly exchange rate depreciations for many emerging economies. Another downside
risk relates to growing risks for deflationary conditions inadvanced economies, although
these are still small given well-anchored inflation expectations. In the current setting,
upside risks are limited. Nonetheless, it i s possible that the financial sector policy
measures, once fully specified and implemented, foster a more rapid-than-expected
improvement in financial conditions. In the meantime, the relatively strong balance
sheets o f nonfinancial corporations might help forestall a major cutback o f investment
across both advanced and developing countries. Under such conditions, confidence could
also recover rapidly and spending by households and firms quickly rebound.


'Inrecent  years, the current account deficit has beenlow for regional and Poland's historical standards and
largely financed with net FDI inflows (90 percent coverage in 2007 and more than 100 percent in 2004-
2006). FDI inflows were well-diversified by sectors. Over the last 4 years, 53 percent of FDI went to
services (financial intermediation 20 percent, trade 15 percent,transport and communication 7 percent, real
estate and business activities 5%, and other 6 percent), 43 percent manufacturing (mainly metal and
mechanicalproducts, motor vehicles, food products, wood, publishing and printing, chemical, and rubber
and plastic products), and the remaining 4 percent to other sectors (electricity, gas and water, and
construction). After EU accession, the real effective exchange rate of the Zloty has been appreciating (11.4
percent in2005,2.0 percent in2006, and 4.3 percent in2007, accordingto ECB data).

                       111.    THEGOVERNMENT'S             REFORMPROGRAM

  23. The current Government formed by PM Donald Tusk after the October 2007
   elections has restarted the structural reform agenda. Economic policy objectives in
   the medium-term were set by the Government inthe March 2008 Convergence Program.
   These objectives are: (i)     reduction o f the tax burden (personal income tax reduction and
   simplification in 2009, and possible further personal and corporate income tax reduction
   in2010-11); (ii)    increase o f labor activity; (iii)
                                                        increase o f growth-enhancing expenditure
   and restructuring o f social spending; (iv) acceleration o fprivatization; (v) economic
   liberalization (elimination o f obstacles for doing business, administration reform, and
   better functioning o f judiciary); (vi) reduction o f the public debt-to-GDP ratio through
   gradual reduction o f the fiscal deficit; and (vii) preparation o f Poland's economy for Euro
   adoption. InSeptember 2008, P M Tusk announced that Poland was committed to meeting
   the Maastricht criteria and obtaining the go-ahead from the EU for Euro adoption in


                                                    17

2011, making it possible to introduce the Euro from 2012, a very ambitious but feasible
target.

24. While structural, market-orientedreforms generally slowed down in 2006-07,
there were some positive steps. Larger privatization projects virtually stalled, and
despite lengthy discussions around the "Kluskapackage," a one-stop shop service for
starting a business was not created. Some steps were taken to strengthen the institutional
budgetary framework, including the adoption o f a nominal state budget deficit anchor
although this rule proved inadequate in the environment o f strong economic growth. On
the revenue side, labor taxes were reduced through a reduction o f mandatory disability
contributions in 2007-08, indexation o f personal income tax brackets, and tax allowances
for children. The former Government also scheduled personal income tax (PIT) rates
reduction and simplification from 2009 (from the current three 19, 30, and 40 percent
brackets to two 18 and 32 percent brackets), advocated for organizational changes inthe
public finance sector, and took the first steps inintroducing performance-based budgeting
(PBB).

25. While the Tusk Government announced a comprehensive array of economic
reforms when it took office, implementationstarted only fully in the context of the
work on the 2009 budget. The reforms will focus both on reducing the impulse from
public finances and strengthening the economy's supply response - mainly through fiscal
measures aimed at a steady reduction o f the structural deficit and reforms aimed at
boosting labor force participation. The following provides a brief overview o f key reform
directions, while more detail i s provided in Section V in areas covered by this policy
loan.

26. Decentralization. The Convergence Program and the Strategic Governance Plan,
published after 100 days o f the Government, identify changes in public administration
and decentralization as an important medium-term task. Changes aimed at enhanced
division o f competence between the central and local administration will be implemented
and enhance the efficiency o fpublic expenditure and absorption o f EUfunds.

27. Public Finance Management (PFM). To improve the quality o f public finance, the
Government aims at consolidating public finance units, relaxing budget rigidities, making
the existing austerity measures in the event o f critical increases in public debt more
restrictive, and introducing a 4-year budget planning and PBB system. The specific
regulations regarding these areas were included in the draft amendments to the Act on
Public Finance publishedby the Ministryo f Finance inlate August.

28.  Taxpolicy. The Tusk Government maintained the scheduled PIT simplification and
reduction o f tax rates to 18 percent and 32 percent, but also announced further changes on
the revenue side (to be implementedfrom 2009) oriented towards shifting the tax burden
from direct to indirect taxes. In direct taxes, additional changes include favorable tax
treatment o f taxpayers working abroad and a tax allowance incorporate income tax (CIT)
for producers o f bio-components. In indirect taxes, simplified procedures and a uniform
tax refundperiod will be introduced in VAT and excise duties on tobacco products will




                                             18

be hiked in line with EU harmonization requirements.Moreover, the excise on LPG gas
will be increased.

29. Labor market and pension reforms. To boost labor force participation, the
Government plans to lower social spending and associated taxes, and limit eligibility to
social security benefits. The tax wedge on labor has already beensubstantially reducedby
cutting the payrolltaxes by seven percentagepoints during the last year. The Government
also prepared a comprehensive program, known as "Intergenerational Solidarity - 50+",
which includes a number of incentives to stimulate labor force participation by older
workers, in particular a substantial tightening of early retirement provisions. It is
estimated that the reforms will reduce the number of persons eligible to early retirement
pensions from about 900 thousand to less than 250 thousand. The 50+ program is
expected to be adopted by parliament by the end of 2008. At the same time, the
Government intends to raise labor force participation by improving workforce skills and
developing opportunities for life-long learning, although reforms in this area are less
advanced.

30. Liberalization of the economy. Streamlining the regulatory environment for doing
business, in order to support more rapid investment growth, i s a high priority for the new
Government. Reform proposals include amendments to the laws on the freedom of
economic activity and accounting (already submitted to Parliament). Work is underway
on a package of laws ("Szejnfeldpackage") aimed at facilitating the start-up and closure
of a business (e.g., through introduction of a possibility for temporary suspension of
business activity and creation of one-stop shop services for starting a business), reducing
red tape, simplifying licensing and inspection procedures, and enhancing tax
administration. Poland's position in the Doing Business ranking could significantly
improve after the implementation of the planned changes. The Government has also
announced an ambitious privatization agenda aimed at selling state shares in more than
700 enterprises over the coming three years.

3 1. Strengthening of educationpolicies and outcomes. The Government recognizes the
importance of addressingthe skills gap that has developedas a result of the rapid changes
in the job market and the challenges of reform in secondary and higher education.
Building on early successes in education reform, the Government intends to continue
strengthening and expanding the teaching of general secondary education by: (a) further
delaying tracking into specialized training to lothgrade; (b) reforming the curriculum in
upper secondary education to better integrate vocational training with general education;
and (c) establishing stronger and more stable national examinations, including a revamp
of the matura test and the inclusion of mandatory math testing at the exit of secondary
education. Because of the widely recognized and documented impact of high-quality
early education, the Government also intends to expand and strengthenthe schooling of 5
and 6 year olds, by linking their classrooms to primary schools and by developing age-
appropriate curricula to better respond to the needs of these children. Further, the
Government intends to gradually support the expansion of preschool (for 3- and 4-year
old children) through increasedflexibility for non-public managedinstitutions to flourish.
Finally, the Government intends to maintain its proactive role in adjusting the school
network as needed, using incentives and accountability to entice gminas (municipalities)


                                            19

to engage in this effort. Teacher attrition i s seen as an important factor to allow this
flexible managementto succeed.

32. Healthcare reform. The central objectives o f the health sector reforms inPoland are
enhanced resource mobilization and improved efficiency in resource allocation. The
Government aims to achieve these goals with provider payment reforms in hospitals,
health financing reforms, and rationalization o f the hospital sector. Case-based payments
inthe hospital sector are being introduced from July 1, 2008. The Government is also
reviewing options to reform the current single health insurance system. Current plans
envisage the re-organization o f the National Health Fund (NHF) into six-seven regional
insurers, which would then be transformed into insurance companies that could compete
for members and providers without geographic restrictions. Private insurers would also
be allowed to enter the market under the same conditions as the public insurers and
compete for the same business. In the next phase, the focus would be on developing a
risk-equalization mechanism between insurers to set a disincentive for risk-selection, and
introduce innovative provider payment and contracting reforms to allow insurers to
become more efficient by contracting with more efficient providers. There would also be
need for an independent regulatory authority and insurance supervisory bodies which
would have the oversight o f the insurance and provider market. In order to improve
efficiency in hospitals, the Government i s also planning to corporatize public hospitals
and change their ownership structure. Finally, a monitoring and evaluation framework is
needed to define a baseline for cost, productivity and access indicators, and conduct
regular follow-up surveys against which the progress made under these reforms will be
measured. The MOH plans to use results from analysis to adjust reforms in provider
payment, insurance and hospital restructuring andensure they contribute to overall health
policy objectives.

33.  Increase of growth-enhancing expenditure, especially on transport infrastructure.
In the medium-term, the most important infrastructure investments will be focused on
road construction and modernization financed both from the national budget and EU
structural funds. Expenditure associated with the road construction program (with EU
funds included) will rise from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to 2-2% percent of GDP in
2009-20 10. Multi-year infrastructure investments related to the Euro 2012 Soccer
Championship will include roads, airports, stadiums6 and accommodation facilities (road
investments will be realized withinthe National Road Construction Program 2008-2012,
approved by the former Government in September 2007). As pointed out in the latest
OECD survey o f Poland, the legal framework needs to be streamlined in many areas to
keep the tight deadlines for many transport investments. Public procurement (especially
the ease with which multipleappeals can be launched), issuance o f buildingpermits, and
environmental impact assessments are key in this regard. Vigilance over possible
collusive behavior among suppliers o f building materials and ensuring competitive
tendering procedures is also critical. Further, better coordination among various
ministriesand implementingbodies inEUfunds absorption is required. The adoption of a
multi-year budgeting system could facilitate these efforts.


  On 24 June, 2008 the Government approved a multi-year program related to the construction of six
stadiums inPoland.

               IV.     POLICY FOCUS OF BANK-SUPPORTED                         PROGRAM

                                 A. PublicFinance Management
34.   While Poland has made progress in recent years in bringing down the fiscal
deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio, spending levels have remained high. Further required
fiscal consolidation will need to rely more on streamlining expenditures while improving
the efficiency o fkey spendingprograms. Polandwill needto make additional fiscal space
available to co-finance increasing inflows o f EU funds and reduce excessive tax rates to
stimulate higher employment and growth. Looking further ahead, population aging will
exert pressure on pension spending-despite an important earlier reform o f the pension
scheme-and       boost demand for healthcare.

                 BOX4. ANALYTIC UNDERPINNINGFORPFMREFORM SUPPORT

Poland's proposed reforms' broadly respondto recent internationalassessments~including
those of the World Bank and the IMF, which pointed to numerous shortcomings of the
Polish fiscal framework. Budget+agmentation, mainly due to the existence o f multiple extra
budgetary funds leads to inefficient allocation o f budget resources. Although some progress in
this area has been made recently, there are still agencies and funds that do not appear in the
budget. Their number declined in recent years, but the amount o f money they receive actually
increased. Budgetprocess is only very loosely connected with the Government'spolicies. In fact
spending ministers act more like mere administrators o f existing laws and programs, rather than
managers o f policy and programs. Additionally, international assessments call for strengthening
of the accountability +amework within the public sector by creating incentives for improved
public service delivery.

In the area of Performance-Based Budgeting, the planned reforms also benefit from
widespread discussion in Poland of the internationalexperience. The European Commission
suggested P F M enhancements in numerous assessments to Poland's Convergence Program
Updates and demonstrated useful lessons in different editions o f "Publicfinances in E W ' . An
international conference with the participation o fthe OECD and IMF on PBB was organized with
Bank DarticiDation inNovember 2007 inWarsaw.


35.   The key challenges inthe area of public finance management can be summarized
as: (i)ensuring a continued gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit to help stabilize the
economy and meet requirements for Euro adoption in a sustainable way; and (ii)
improving the quality o f public finances through a lowering o f the tax burden and

increased emphasis on productive spending. (See Box 4 for related analytic work.)
Addressingthese challenges will require actions ina number o f areas:

        Consolidatingspendingunits and focusingon general government activities.
        The budget is too fragmented and there is a need for organizational consolidation
        o f numerous public units (various funds and agencies) as their finances are not
        transparent.

    0   Introducingperformance-basedbudgeting(PBB). This would help strengthen
        the link betweenpolicy formulation andbudgeting while enhancing the efficiency
        o f spending programs and accountability o f managers. It would also support
        much-improved budgetary classification and reporting systems and higher quality
        o f forward estimates used inthe MTEF (see below), which suggests to implement
        themjointly.

        Introducing an effective Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).
        The budget should be formulated inthe context o f a MTEF that sets firm ceilings
        on spendingover a multi-year horizon-ideally              longer for capital pen ding.^

        Enhancingadministrative capacity in the public sector. Progress in the areas
        outlined above has to go hand in hand with efforts to enhance the general
        administrative capacity o f the Government and Public Sector. This includes in
        particular improved management o f humanresources.

36.  Some progresshas beenmade on introducingPBB, butit will remainan agenda
item for many years to come. The Chancellery of the former Prime Minister launched
an initiative to implement PBB in 2006, but in early 2008 the Tusk Government decided
to transfer this activity to the Ministry o f Finance. Some progress has already been made:
(i)definition o f a general roadmap for transition to PBB; (ii)reclassification exercise o f
                                                                         a
the 2008 State budget according to "functions" and "tasks" (to be further broken down to
sub-tasks); (iii)  a preliminary exercise inthe definition o f indicators; (iv) a revised budget
circular for the 2009 State budget outlining criteria for aligning the budget with the PBB
methodology; and (v) launching o f a training program on PBB through the European
Institute o f Public Administration. Substantial efforts are still necessary to: (i)          incorporate
elements such as program evaluations as part o f the PBB framework; (ii)define
processes, responsibilities, and information systems for the management o f performance
indicators; (iii)  implement associated reforms that may be needed in P F M systems (such
as accounting or reporting) to accommodate PBB concepts; and, more basically, (iv)
ensure the ongoing evolution o f the PBB strategy as new concepts are widely discussed
andaccepted.



 The IMFhas recommendedintroduction of a multi-annual fiscal framework with expenditure ceilings and
strengthening of fiscal institutions, and has recently provided technical assistance in this area. The IMF
proposed introduction of binding expenditure ceilings that would be set for four years at the beginning of
each electoral cycle and include most government expenditure. The IMF also pointed to the need for
strengthening fiscal institutions to support the introduction of a multi-annual fiscal framework and
improving fiscal transparency. Further, it noted that performance-based budgeting reforms could be
supportive for MTEF implementation.




                                                   22

37. As mentionedin Section 111, the Tusk Government announced reforms on the
public finance agenda and a draft new law on public finance was published by the
Ministry o f Finance in August 2008. It incorporates institutional measures making the
budget more transparent and predictable over the medium-term and more performance-
oriented. The draft law also aims to tighten further corrective measures triggered by
critical increases in public debt, and expenditure control will be strengthened through
new regulations on internal control and audit and consolidation o fbudgetary units.

38.  The Bank has been actively involved in public finance management reform in
Poland for many years. In 2002-2003, the World Bank prepared a comprehensive
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review. Inrecent years, the World Bank has shifted
its activities in this area in the New EU Member States more inthe direction of regional,
cross-country comparative analytic work on fiscal reform issues, combined with country-
based TC (moreover, many fiscally relevant topics were covered in the EU8+2 regular
economic reports). For example, the Bank has provided technical support to the Ministry
o f Finance inits deliberations on possible reform o fthe ministry.It has also supported the
process o f PBB development through the co-financing and organization of an
international conference on performance-based budgeting focused on lessons for Poland,
inWarsaw inearly November 2007, and a program of continued technical cooperation is
under discussion. Moreover, in response to a request from the Ministry o f Finance, the
Bank has proposed a broader program o f analytic and advisory services in the area of
PFM (including links between public finances and labor supply as well as budget
rigidities). This work could be done inthe context of a Public Expenditure Review.

                                   B. LaborMarket Policies


39. The Government realizes that mobilizinglabor supply i s critical for sustainable
economic growth, especially given population aging and the steadily increasing
demographic dependency ratio. In addition, the Polish economy already suffers from
shortages o f skilled labor. The expensive social security system supports inactivity and i s
financed by high labor taxes. In particular, the availability of generous early retirement
(and to a lesser extent disability) schemes i s fiscally costly and results in very low labor
force participation o f older workers (aged 55-64). The implied high level o f labor taxes
inhibits labor demand by raising labor costs and discourages labor supply by lowering the
take-home pay. Further, the low skills and productivity o f a significant fraction o f the
workforce i s reflected in a low employment/population ratio and a high incidence of
long-term unemployment among the less educated workers. (See Box 5 for related
analytic work.)

          Box5. ANALYTIC UNDERPINNING LABOR     FOR           MARKET   REFORM    SUPPORT

The labor component of the DPL reflects the results of the analytic work done by the World
Bank, UNDP, the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP) as well as by the Polish
independent research institutes in recent years. The main objective o f the labor component of the
DPL is to increase the employment/working age population ratio, which is low in Polandby the
EU standards, despite the recent sharp fall in the unemployment rate. This is consistent with the
government analysis o f the priorities for labor market reforms as stated in the MLSP (2008).'0
World Bank (2007)" documents that the employment/population ratio in Poland is one of the
lowest inEUand argues that the primary cause is the low labor force participationrate, especially
among older workers. The report shows that the actual retirement age in Poland is the lowest in
EU8+2 despite the fact that the official retirement age is the highest. Accordingly, the report
attributes the low labor force participation rate in Poland to easy access to various early
retirement schemes. This conclusion is consistent with that presented in a recent comprehensive
analysis o fthe Polish labor market in Bukowski (2007, 2008).12

The labor component of the DPL also contains policies to increase the employment/population
ratio by reducing the incidence of long term unemployment and the skills mismatch. These
policies refer to improving the functioning of Public Employment Services, including improving
cost-effectiveness and targeting efficiency of active labor market programs. This again reflects
the findings of the analysis carriedout by MLSP (2008), Bukowski(2007,2008) and the findings
of an earlier study o f the Polish labor market done by UNDP (2005).13 These studies have
consistently identified social exclusionto be closely associatedwith poor skills and a major cause
of long-term unemployment inPoland.

10. The low labor force participation by older workers i s a result of the generous
early retirement policies introduced in the 1990s to alleviate labor market tensions
associated with intensive enterprise restructuring. These policies by design were
meant to be temporary and the Government started to phase out early retirement benefits
in the mid 2000s, when the pace of enterprise restructuring decelerated and job
opportunities began to improve, enhancing the chances for older worker to find new
employment.

41.  Those who fail to find a new job are still eligible to severance pay,
unemployment benefit and social assistance. The biggest outstanding challenge i s to

raise the effective retirement age. This requires abolishing early retirement privileges
granted to some occupational groups, such as teachers or railway workers by equalizing
the retirement age for these with that of the rest of the population. At the same time, the
Government plans to raise salaries o f some o f the groups (mainly teachers) who are to
lose the early retirementprivileges.

42. Recent Reforms and Progress (2005-07). Facedwith unsatisfactorylabor market
outcomes, consecutive Polish governments have undertaken a number of labor
market reforms aimed at fostering labor demand and improving labor supply
incentives.The most recent measures include:

(a)     Reduction in the tax wedge on labor. The disability pension contribution rate was
lowered by 7 percentage points, from 13 to 6 percent o f payroll. The employer part was
lowered by 2 percentage points and the employee part was lowered by 5 percentage
points. The reduction was done in two steps: in July 2007 (3 percentage points) and in
January 2008 (4 percentage points). Before the reform, the tax wedge on labor inPoland
was inthe upper-end o f the EUrange, while after the reform it is inthe middle o f the EU
range.

(b)     Limiting early retirement options for the unemployed. Eligibility conditions for
pre-retirement allowances were substantially tightened in 2004. This followed earlier
policy o f limiting pre-retirement benefits. As a result, the coverage o f both benefits was
considerably reduced and both benefits are being gradually phased-out (the pre-
retirement benefits were repealed in2002).

(c)     Relaxing regulations on employment of foreign workers. Work permits were
abolished for workers from neighboring countries employed on a temporary basis (for no
more than 6 months during the year). Furthermore, the costs o f work permits for other
foreign workers were significantly reduced. These measures were meant to address the
emerging labor shortages. They are also a first step toward increasing employment o f
foreign workers, which is necessary given population aging.

43.  Government Reform Objectives and Plans. In a recently prepared document
"The Priorities for Labor Market Reforms," the Ministry of Labor and Social
Protectionidentifiedthe followingthreemainobjectives:

(a)     To increase labor force participation and employment rates. This particularly
refers to the older workers (among which the labor force participation rate is particularly
low) so as to reach the Lisbon targets (70 percent overall employmentrate and 50 percent
employment rate for older workers). Increasing labor force participation by older workers
requires primarily reforming the social security system so as to limit the availability o f
early retirement benefits.

(b)     To lower structural unemployment and prevent labor market exclusion.
Unemployment in Poland i s increasingly due to the skills mismatch rather than to
deficient demand for labor. This i s associated with labor market exclusion of
disadvantaged groups and reflected ina highincidence o f long-term unemployment.

(c)     To improve the targeting and cost-effectiveness of active labor market programs.
Available evidence suggests that these programs are poorly targeted, have limited net


                                            25

  impact, and are thus not cost-effective. Accordingly, efficient use o f public funds requires
  that the programs are monitored and evaluated andthen redesigned so as to increase their
  impact and efficiency.

 44. Government reform plans include the following:

  (a)       Implementation of the government program to increase labor force participation
  of older workers, known as "50+". The plan envisages, inter alia: (i)reducing the
  eligibility to early retirement pensions; (ii)         lowering the cost o f employing workers in
  pre-retirement age (60/55) by reducing some o f the social security contributions; and (iii)
  extending the eligibility for public employment services to the employed workers aged
  45+.

  (b)       Preparation of draft amendments to the "Law on retirement and disability
  pensions '' whereby the receipt of a disability pension can be combined without limits
  with earningsfrom work. This measure i s intendedto encourage labor force participation
  o fthe disabled and to foster their social inclusion.

  (c)       Development of cost-effective active labor market programs to reduce structural
  unemployment and foster labor market inclusion. This includes: (i)                Extension o f the
  scope o f labor market information and monitoring (including the development o f a
  consolidated database o f employment and social assistance office clients) to inform
  employment policy, and (ii)Evaluation o f targeting efficiency and the net impact o f
  active labor market programs and adjustment o f program design and program mix to
  reflect evaluation results.

  (d)       Implementation of a program to reduce the administrative cost of employing the
  first worker (including "one-stop shop"). Over the medium term, the Government also
  aims to improve the responsiveness o f the education system to changing labor market
  needs and equipping students with key employability skills.

  provide technical cooperation to identify priorities for labor market reforms and
  recommend policies to improve labor market outcomes. These priorities were presented
  ina report producedjointly by the Ministry and the Bank, which is meant to be adopted
  as an official document o f the Ministry. The Ministry i s interested infuture collaboration
  with the Bank inthe following three closely related areas: (i)         improving functions and the
  coordination betweenemployment and social welfare offices; (ii)            improving the targeting




                                                      26

and cost-effectiveness o f active labor market programs; (iii)  designing modem activation
policies.

                                      C. PensionReform

46. Faced with increased deficits in its pension system, Poland undertook a major
pension reform in the late 1990s which was implemented beginning in 1999. The new
Polish pension systemmoved from a defined-benefit basis to a defined contribution basis,
where individual contributions are recorded and the pension at retirement is based on the
contributions plus notional interest earned on those contributions. The actual system
contains two components, a publicly managed component and a privately managed
component. Inthe publicly managed component, contributions o f 19.52 percent o f wage
are paid to the public pension agency, which records the contributions and accrues an
interest rate equal to the rate o f growth of the wage bill on the contributions. The balance
in this account is then divided by life expectancy at retirement to determine the public
portion o f the pension. Despite the defined contribution mechanisms for benefit
determination, the public pension agency takes the contributions and uses them to finance
pension benefits for current pensioners. A second component, managed by private
pension funds, takes an additional 7.3 percent o f wage as contribution, which i s then
invested by private pension funds incapital market instrumentswhich generate a market-
determined rate o f return. This money becomes available at retirement age and i s
converted into a stream o f pension payments by either the pension fund or an insurance
company. (See Box 6 on related analytic work.)

             BOX 6. ANALYTIC UNDERPINNINGS FORPENSIONREFORMSUPPORT

The pension system reformelements inthe policy matrix supporting the loan address several of
the important issues commonly cited in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) pension systems. As
noted in the World Bank publication From Red to Gray: The "Third Transition" of Aging
Populations in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union (World Bank Working Paper), in
most ECA pension systems the rate of system dependency is high relative to population
dependency. The number of beneficiaries per contributor is significantly higher than the
percentage of retirement age population relative to working age population, leading to high
pension expenditures coupled with moderately low revenuesand a resultingfiscal problem. Two
of the most common reasons for the high system dependency rates are the high rate of disability
pensions awardedto those below the normal retirement age and the high rate of early retirement
pensions. Reducing these components will help bring down pension expenditures and help raise
additional contribution revenue, bringing the systems closer to balance. Two of the reform
measures to be undertaken by the Polish Government, the redesign of the disability benefit
system to reduce incentives for choosing disability pensions and the tightening of criteria for
early retirement,will both help to reduce system dependency rates and bring the Polish system
intobetter fiscal balance.

A third element of the policy matrix addressesthe issue of payout options for the funded pillar.
The ongoing financial crisis emphasizes the importance of adequately designing payout options
such that individuals are not forced to annuitize their pension savings at retirement or at a
particular age under adverse market conditions. The payout options need to be designed so that
they are flexible enough to withstand market fluctuations while protectingworkers. The use of
multipleportfolioswith a mandatory shift toward a fixed income portfolio in the yearsjust prior
to retirement is being suggested as a way of protecting workers against sudden drops in the
valuationof financialassetsjust priorto retirement.


47.  Given the enormous changes undertaken in the pension system, there were a
number of issueswhichwere not addressedat the time of the initialpensionreform,
namely reform of the disability pension system, early retirement provisions, the payout
mechanisms for funded pensions, reform of the agricultural pension system, and linkages
betweenadministration of social assistance benefits and social insurancebenefits.

(a) Disabilitypensions. While the benefitprovisionfor old age pensionswas completely
altered, the old formula remained for those considered disabled. Rather than integrating
the disability financing with the old age financing as is common in almost all other
countries, a separate contribution rate of 13 percent of wage was charged to employees
and employers for financing disability pensioners, which was the highest contribution
rate for disability anywhere inthe world. The disability pension systemduring the 1990's
was also used to provide relief to workers who were displaced during the labor market
transformation, resulting inlarge numbersof disabled.


    0   Progress thusfar. The contribution rate for financing disability was reducedfrom
        13 percent of wage to 6 percent of wage in2 stages, June 2007 and January 2008.
        Eligibility conditions for disability were tightened, resulting in a drop in the
        number of new disability pensions awarded from 86,000 per year in 2001 to
        50,000 per year in2007. The total number of disability pensioners was reducedby
        over 40 percent from 2.5 million in2001 to 1.5 million in2007.


                                              28

       Reform plans. The disability benefit formula is expected to be redesigned to be
       consistent with the old age formula, using the same notional account calculation,
       with credit given for the period between the age o f disability and the retirement
       age eliminating the incentives to retire under the currently more generous
       disability formula.

(b) Early retirement. In addition to those who earned the right to early retirement by
being part o f particular occupations, all workers 5 years short o f retirement who lost their
jobs and were registered as unemployed had the right to receive 80 percent o f their old
age pension during the 5-year period before retirement. These were known as pre-
retirement pensions. In addition, there were a multitude o f occupations which had rights
to early retirement.

       Progress thusfar. Pre-retirement benefits were limited to those who not only lost
       their jobs, but whose former employers became bankrupt.The level ofthe benefit
       was also reduced to a flat benefit irrespective o f earnings and unrelated to the old
       age pension. However, even as recently as 2007, after these reforms were
       implemented, 82 percent o f all new old age pensioners were retiring before the
       minimumretirement age.

       Reform plans. The Government plans to limit the number o f occupations eligible
       for early retirement, with the expectation o f reducing the number o f early retirees
       from more than 900,000 per year to 250,000, and to introduce actuarial
       adjustments for early retirement pensions.

(c) Reformsto the funded system. Critical elements o f the funded system were not fully
specified at the start o f the reform, including how the funded system would pay benefits.
Given the rules on entry, the first women are expected to retire from the funded system in
2009. Mandatory funded systems always contain a trade-off between offering freedom o f
choice for participants and providing appropriate supervision and security. Initially, the
Polish authorities opted for a conservative approach with each pension fund offering only
one portfolio. N o w that the system has functioned well for a number o f years, more
choices could be provided to individuals without jeopardizing either the capacity to
supervise or the safety o f the portfolio.

       Reform Plans. The Government is preparing legislation which specifies the
       payout provisions for those retiring with funded pensions during 2009- 13. The
       Government also has plans to develop longer-term annuities market and options
       and introduce multiple portfolio choices with potentially multiple fee structures
       for those retiring beyond 2013. The funded component could thus become more
       attractive to workers, encouraging greater compliance.

(d) Farmers' pensionsystem. Farmers, definedas those owning and farming at least one
hectare o f land, receive pension coverage through a separate system, KRUS, which has
much lower contribution rates but provides the same minimum pension as the main
pension system, ZUS. Contributions cover less than 15 percent o f expenditures in this


                                              29

system. The system provides a major element o f social protection as those in the rural
areas are poorer than those in urban areas and provides a mechanism o f old age
protection for the rural poor without the large contributory cost o f belonging to ZUS.
However, rural income i s rising as the agricultural payments from the European
community are phased in, which both make higher contribution rates more affordable for
some farmers and raise the demand for higher pensions than are currently beingprovided.


    0   Reform Plans. The Government plans to study options for reforming KRUS, but
        this is very much a medium-term issue and not an issue the Government plansto
        address inthe short run.

(e) Informationsharing and administrativeintegrationof social protectionbenefits.
Currently, a variety o f social benefits are available in Poland, including social assistance,
unemployment benefits, and pensions. One basis for social assistance eligibility i s
unemployment, which i s verified by registration with the employment office. The
individual applying for social assistance has to first register with the employment office
and then present evidence o f this registration to the social assistance office. Ideally, the
social assistance office should be able to access the employment office information
electronically and verify the individual's status without requiring a separate set o f
documentation. Such a system would lower transaction costs for individuals and for the
offices administering the programs, as well as helping the Government design a
comprehensive social protection program which covers all the various social risks.

        Reform Plans. The Government will soon decide among alternate designs o f an
        information system which allows the sharing o f information across various social
        protection agencies.

48.  The Bank has had a long-standinginvolvementwith the Polish authorities on
pension reform with staff exchanges between Bank staff and key pension reform
officials in Poland, which has led to continued informal dialogue and information
sharing. In addition, the Bank has financed administrative reforms in KRUS as well as
policy studies looking at reform options for KRUS. Going forward, the Bank will
continue its dialogue with the Polish authorities as the new phases o f the pension reform
involving the payouts from the funded pillar unfold, will provide assistance to KRUS in
modeling policy reform options, and will provide assistance on the administrative
linkages between social protection services, particularly on linkages between social
assistance and employment offices.

                              D.PrivateSector Development

49. The Government o f Poland i s presently engaged in a major reform effort to facilitate
the growth o f private enterprise. This involves two main pillars: (i) and regulatory
                                                                        legal
changes to reduce the costs borne by the private sector o f establishing and conducting
business; and (ii) new phase o f privatization to transfer ownership o f remaining state
                   a
enterprises to the private sector. (See Box 7 on related analytic work.)

     BOX 7. ANALYTIC UNDERPINNINGS FORPRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT                    SUPPORT

In the area of business regulatoryenvironment, the Bank has evaluated a number of legislative
initiatives being undertaken by the Government to reduce the regulatory burdens of enterprises.
The evaluation has also been linkedto the Bank Group's DoingBusiness indicatorsto determine
the impact of government reforms on the DoingBusiness assessment. High impact reform areas
havebeenidentifiedanddocumented, andare currentlyunder discussionwith the authorities.

Inthe privatizationarea, the Bankhas hada longstanding engagement. Several piecesof analytic
work were conducted in the past few years relating to the management and governance
arrangements for state-owned enterprises and suggested reforms that would impact firm
performance. More recently, with the need to consider the privatizationof multiple, small state
minority shares in remainingenterprises, the Bank has consolidated worldwide experiences and
documentedthe operationaland financialmechanismswhich are suited for privatizingsuch small
shares without pooling them into investment funds which would create investor disincentives
given the varying performance quality and sector composition of underlyingenterprise shares.
Financialoptions for risk sharing on future performanceof larger state enterprises have also been
examined in order to set risk sharing incentives for the management of enterprises with uncertain
profit and cost prospects and low equity bases, requiring upfront strategic investment. More
recent work with the Government has involved the analysis of public-privatepartnerships as a
mode of transferringstate run sector (e.g.: various infrastructureservices) to privatemanagement
with options of lease/buy. The Government wishes continued Bank engagement in the above
areas so as to providethe menuof options to consider for the privatizationand PPP arrangements
to divest state ownership and managementto the privatesector.

Further, considerable analytic work has been done on governance in state-owned enterprises,
includingby the Bank, inrecent years.

ReducingAdministrative and LegalBarriers for the Business Environment

50. The reform program on reducingbarriers to private enterprise has progressed
swiftly since the new Government took office. Followinginitiatives from the Executive
Branch, the Parliament recently approved laws to increase areas for special economic
zones aimed at promoting high productivity, employment and innovation, with
accompanying tax incentives for qualifying enterprises. Another law was approved to
help the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development support micro, small- and medium-
size enterprises, including their capacity for adaptation and innovation. Also, legislation
was approved recently providing lending incentives to finance private enterprises'
technological capabilities and upgrading.

51.  A number of other legislative bills were recently submitted to Parliament
including an Accountancy Law setting out different/graduated financial reporting
requirements for small versus large enterprises, based on revenue volume generated, so as
to reduce reporting burdens. Other initiatives now in Parliament include a bill o f law to
provide seasonal businesses more flexibility               in meeting regulatory       reporting
requirements, a bill o f law allowing enterprises to engage contracts in currencies other
than the zloty without asking for prior central bank authorization, and a change to the
commercial law to sharply reduce minimumcapital requirementsfor starting a business.




                                               31

UpcomingChallengesin Business Regulatory Reform
52. The Government has an ambitious plan in the next 24 months to continue
already started reforms and expand them to reduce the costs for businesses and further
encourage private enterprise. A large planned project involves the analysis o f all
regulatory steps for both starting businesses and providing licenses and other
authorizations. Inthe interim, other more immediate steps are being taken to analyze the
feasibility o f setting up a "one stop shop" for enterprise start-up and registration
procedures as well as unifying the inspection system to ensure coordination, minimal
time spent and to avoid overlap among the various inspection authorities overseeing
private enterprises. It i s also proposed that enterprises need no longer obtain new
certification letters from public agencies to prove their good standing when applying for
licenses or permits, with a signed truthful statement by the company (e.g., on tax
compliance, licenses) as being deemed sufficient. The Government also plans to institute
a system allowing businesses to maintain commercial receipts in electronic format and i s
considering setting up a system for electronic filing o ftax returns.

53.  To enhance labor mobility, much progress has been made on defining new
proposals,for example to limit employers' liability for long sick leaves taken, to provide
incentives for hiringuniversity graduates for short periods, and for medium term plans to
make working hours legally flexible thus removing rigidities regarding employer
obligations for higher night-time pay above base pay, for example, and other inflexible
contract obligations.

Second/FuturePhaseReforms -Administrative Costs of Regulation

54. A second phase following the above initiatives i s already under consideration
and involves an overhaul o f all sector/Ministerial requirements for registering and
starting business operations and subsequent licensing. To implement these reforms
systematically, the Government intends to conduct a costing analysis o f each regulatory
step currently inplace. The intent i s to reduce or modify the regulatory requirements and
free up enterprises' management and administration time for productive activity while
estimating economy-wide savings achieved (with a target aimed at a 25 percent reduction
inthe cost o f regulation). At the same time public accountability reforms are expected to
specify much more clearly individuals' functions, roles and responsibilities in public
agencies to ensure that regulatory changes or decisions issued are properly scrutinized
and reviewed. Other reforms are also under consideration, including making it easier for
SMEs to bid under public tenders or contracts and simplifying the diverse requirements
for product regulation while maintaining the requisite safety standards under such
regulation.

55. At the corporate level, the Government is analyzing the means by which
cooperative enterprises can more easily and swiftly be legally converted to
commercial companies and to institute more broadly the acceptance o f electronic
signatures as legally binding. Reforms are also anticipated in credit registry procedures
so that enterprises that have paid off debts can be removed from bad debtor status once a
reasonable new payment record has been set.



                                             32

56.  At the public sector level, besides the direct role o f public agencies in regulatory
procedures, the Government is emphasizing the principles embodied in regulatory
impact assessments, including           consultations  and consensus building among
stakeholders, for any new initiatives underway, including cost-cutting ones. Since the
reform agenda i s broad, it also requires awareness o f the process o f reform itself, that is,
the legislative approval procedure which the Government and lawmakers are critically
examining with a view towards simplifying it, clarifying steps needed, and managing it
better according to priorities, review procedures and overall readiness and quality o f
proposed legislative packages.

The Privatization Program and AssociatedReforms

57.  Another pillar of the private sector development agenda is a final privatization
phase.Inthe 1990s and mid-2000s the successive Polish Governments privatized a large
mass o f State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) through various means including tenders, mass
privatizations and other methods. However, there still remain a small yet not insignificant
number of residual enterprises which are becoming an administrative drain on the State
and should rightly be reconstituted as private sector industries. For some of these, the
State i s the majority shareholder, but some 2-300 are small enterprises with only minority
holdings by the State.

58.  The Government recently announced a plan to privatize 740 enterprises and
liquidate or wind down another 350. A small share o f enterprises (e.g. in the energy
sector) will not be privatized given the needfor the Government to first consider strategic
needs and choices for the economy in such specialized sectors. Inaddition to the official
announcement o f its privatization plans, the Government has approved a number o f
reforms to carry out this process. This includes the removal o f previously existing legal
impediments to sell enterprises via an auction process or through the stock exchange, two
methods which would provide open public information to all investors regarding such
opportunities. Administratively, some restrictions are being removed, including the need
to have a Council of Ministers decision to proceed with privatizations o f enterprises with
less than a 25 percent State shareholding. In addition, the Ministry o f Treasury would be
permitted to have the sole responsibility for conducting pre-privatization analyses
involving legal status issues and asset valuation, prior to offering enterprises for sale.

59.  A major reform from a social perspectiveis the Government's earmarking of a
specified portion of privatization revenues to increase the pre-funding of the public
pensionsystem which is in need o f reserves given actuarial and demographic trends in
Poland.

60.  The privatization reforms will, for a number of companies, involve an initial
program of commercialization so as to better corporatize and prepare companies for
receptivity to the market. Among some o f the corporate governance reforms envisaged is
the creation o f independent company boards and management that can turnaround
companies with revenue potential, as well as market-based remuneration for key
management staff to dissuade unproductive rent seeking. Separately, to encourage




                                            33

public/private partnerships, the Government will reduce the Ministerial authorizations or
interventions required for these deals to move forward.

61. As part of the overall privatization effort, the Government is committed to an
open transparent consultative processwith full public disclosure and involvement of
key stakeholders such as labodtrade unions, public officials, the private sector, and
existing enterprise managers. The privatization program has already resulted in signed
privatization agreements for 15 companies, active offers initiated for 55, as well as 35
enterprises placedunder a program o f commercializationprior to privatization.

Challengesand Follow-Up Phases in Privatization
62. The main challenges will involve meeting the privatization targets for the mass
of enterprises to be offered, especially in the more difficult external environment
brought about by the international financial crisis. Market receptivity may not exist in
all sectodindustries and the financial condition and turnaround potential for certain
enterprises will need to be assessed. Any restructuring methods, treatment o f liabilities,
and means to increase the asset value o f the enterprises will be crucial in determining
whether an equilibrium price will be reached between buyer and seller. A further
liquidation program will also need to be considered for enterprises that after valuing their
assets and equity do not show prospects o f recovery.

63.   Technical collaboration between Poland and the Bank in the above areas has
recently focused on a diagnosis of regulatory reforms needed to reduce the
administrative barriers affecting private enterprise operations, and identifying the
high impact non-legal changes that might be effected to improve the business
environment. Further, inthe area o f state assets, collaboration with the Bank has moved
from privatization projects to analyzing designs for settingup public private partnerships
for the operation o f infrastructure services. Going forward, collaboration i s expected to
continue on business environment reforms including broader consultation, impact
estimates, implementation methods,          continued work on novel and alternative
privatization instruments and private financing o f infrastructure, and integration o f
financial and investor markets with neighboring countries.

                  E.Fiscal Costs of ReformsSupported by the Operation

64. The reforms on the agenda generate substantial and immediate costs for the
budget, while the resulting savings will be phased in only over a longer period of
time. According to official estimates, the reduction o fthe labor tax wedge translates into
net fiscal costs o f 1.3 percent o f GDP in2008 rising to about 2.0 percent o f GDP in2009-
2010 due to the scheduled PIT rates reduction and simplification. Positive effects should
materialize over the medium term as employment and growth i s stimulated, but the effect
i s difficult to quantify. The overall program 50+ will cost around 0.2 percent o f GDP per
annuminthe short-medium-term, but will have positive longer-term implications as older
people are reactivated or become better able to remain longer in the workforce. The
introduction o f bridge pensions based on medical criteria will yield savings only
gradually as new cohorts enter the existing early retirement age period as the current
stock o f early retirees will not be affected (official estimates are that budget costs o f early


                                               34

retirement will decline from four to five billion zlotys in case the system was left
unchanged to 500-600 million zlotys under the proposed reform). l4The privatization
program will generate some one-time revenues that can be used to partially finance the
short-term costs of the reforms.l5The deregulation program should support additional
private investment and growth, but againthe impactof this i s very hardto quantify.

                                     A. OperationDescription

65.  The proposedUS$1.25 billionequivalentDevelopmentPolicyLoan,the first ina
programmatic series of three policy loans within a total lending envelope of up to
US$3.75 billion equivalent, would support the Government's plans to enhance the
quality and efficiency of public finances, increasethe supply of relevant and skilled
labor, and strengthen the business environment.The core focus on raising labor force
participation and employment would span supply-side incentives (including social
protection policies and labor taxes), skills, and labor demand (including through
deregulation and privatization). Particular attention will be paid to raising employment
rates of low-employment and vulnerable groups (including the elderly, people on
disability pensions, youth, and socially-excluded minorities). The program would be
carefully aligned to Poland's commitments to the EU, notably the Convergence Program
and associated Council Opinions and the National Lisbon Reform Program and regular
Commission assessments. (See Box 8 on the application of good practice principles on
conditionality to this operation.)

                        Box 8. Good Practice Principles on Conditionality


Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership

The operation supports a key subset of policy actions within a broader government program. This government
program benefits from well-established participatory processes and consultation on critical elements. A large
body of analytic work supports the policy directions of the government program as well as the conditions set out
inthis operation, preparedby the Bank and others over anumber of years (see Boxes 4 to 7). The programmatic
series will be accompanied by a program of technical cooperation and knowledge sharing to complement and
extend existing reform plans and priorities. is discussing a menu of technical cooperation. The policy focus of
each operation is to be closely aligned with the government's ongoing reform priorities and the political
feasibility of specific reforms.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the government and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The Bank's support is summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix. No other donors are currently providing
budget support. The Bank has engaged inclose consultationswith both the International Monetary Fundandthe
European Commission, who are supportive of continued Bank policy lending as long as it support further
restructuring of public finances and fiscal consolidation and is fully consistent with EU commitments, including
the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, Poland's Convergence Program and Council Opinions on this, and EC
assessments of Poland's NationalLisbon Strategy implementation.

Principle 3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

The Bank has preparedthis programmatic series in response to an explicit government request, after a hiatus in
such lending support for some years. The timing of delivery of this operation, aiming to deliver disbursements
before the end of the calendar year, and the subsequent ones in the series, will be driven by the government's
schedule and financing needs. The policy reforms supported by the operation draw on various analytic work over
anumber ofyears and derive from careful evaluation ofpolicy options.

Principle 4: Chooseonly actionscriticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement

The Bank's policy matrix uses a limited set of conditions (6 intotal), and it contains 12 benchmarks for the first
operation, all selected for their criticality in delivering the expected results of the programmatic series and
demonstratingan appropriatediscipline indesign for a middle-income client.

Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive topredictable andperformance-basedfinancial
support
As agreed with the government, the first operation is timed to country's budget cycle (to disburse before the end
of calendar 2008). The financing of the subsequent operations has already been announced. The accompanying
package of technical cooperation will lead into preparation of the next operation, which is expected to be
available well in advance of the closing of the government's next fiscal year. A limited number of outcome
indicators, closely linked to the supported policy actions, have been selected to measure the impact of the
operational series, andthese will be tracked as part ofthe operation implementation.



                                             B. Policy Areas

66. T h e policy focus of each operation will be closely aligned with the government's
current reform priorities and the political feasibility of specific reforms. The first
loan will support current efforts to further lower labor taxes (both social security
contributions and personal income taxes), restrict generous early retirement provisions,
strengthenactive labor market policies, streamline businessregulations, and revitalize the
remaining privatization agenda. All prior actions for the first loan have been met,
including submission to Parliament o f the draft budget for 2009 consistent with Poland's

                          C. ParticipatoryProcesses andConsultations

67. Various aspects of the reformssupportedby this operationhave been subject to
extensive stakeholder consultations. On the program Generational Solidarity 50+, the
Government started wide ranging consultations with all stakeholders once the draft
program was ready in March 2008. Inparticular, the draft was sent for opinion to trade
unions, employers' associations and local government representatives as well as to other
institutions dealing with labor issues (NGOs, research community, etc.).                           The
consultations with stakeholders are still under way, and the main forum for the dialogue
i s the Tripartite Commission for Socio-Economic Affairs. The perception o f the relevant
trade unions is that the costs o f the program (the loss of the right to early retirement)
outweigh its benefits interms of higher lifetime earnings and thus the unions oppose the
reform. Incontrast, it is strongly supportedby employers.

68.   On the privatization program, the Government has instituted a structured
dialogue with pertinent stakeholdersand a transparent public informationprocess.
This process is used to inform civil society and stakeholders at every stage of the
privatization process. All privatizations require public information disclosure on the
agreement and conclusion of a social package (salary, severance, benefits, other) to be
offered to employees. The monetary value of investment commitments and obligations
guaranteed by new investor/owners is also made transparent and disclosed. The
Government has already held numerous consultations with social partners such as trade
unions inthe industries affected, notably inregard to the potential employment effects of
the plannedprivatizations.

                           D. RelatedTechnicalCooperationProgram

69. The program of technical cooperation and knowledge sharing associated with
the programmaticpolicy loanswould focus both on complementingexisting reform


                                                37

plans and priorities and supporting the preparation of reforms in others areas that
could become priorities and focus o f subsequent operations in the programmatic series.
The envisaged program o f analytic and advisory activities (AAA) over the next 12
months i s summarized inTable 5 below (see Annex 2 for more details). This program has
been discussed with the relevant line ministries. While several activities could be
financed from the Bank's own budgetary resources, some may need to rely on cost-
sharing or fee-for-service arrangements.

70. Further, the Bank has discussed a broader program of technical cooperation
and knowledge exchange as part of its recent strategic dialogue. In addition to the
areas covered under the programmatic policy loans, this could include support for
reforms related to infrastructure development, regional development, and climate change.
Ineachcase, the Bank has developed a program o ftechnical cooperation incollaboration
with the related line Ministries which needs to be confirmed in the context of finalizing
the programmatic Policy Loan Program. Several of these activities would have to rely on
cost-sharing and fee-for-service arrangements given the Bank's budgetary constraints.

                      E. RelatedPolicyAreas with OngoingEngagement

71. Reforms in the health and education sectors, which are closely related to the
intent and objective of the programmaticseries, but where the planningof further
reforms is less advanced and/or the current political feasibility is limited, may be
included at a later stage in this programmaticreform series. The policy framework
reflected in the Policy Matrix (Annex 1) includes the reform areas where the
Government's three year program i s fully defined. In the meantime, the Government i s
interested in working with the Bank on the preparation o f reforms inthese related policy
areas and they have therefore been included in the technical cooperation program

                            VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                              A. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis

72. Like other EU countries, Poland has an elaborate and comprehensive
monitoring system to track progress in reducing poverty and social exclusion. In
2001, the Laeken European Council endorsed a set o f 18 common indicators-the                         so-
called "Laeken indicators"-to         monitor the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
Indicator 1, the "at-risk-of-poverty-rate",       i s calculated as the share o f persons with an
equivalized total net income below 60 percent o f the national median income in each
country. Using this measure, Poland hadthe highest poverty rate (21 percent) of all EUlO
countries in 2005, However, recent improvements in labor market conditions noted
earlier have had a significantly positive impact in reducing the incidence o f poverty.
Moreover, new analytic work by the World Bank shows that the tax and benefit system in
Poland plays a very strong redistributive role in the country, reducing overall income
inequality considerably compared to what it would have been in the absence o f these
redistributive taxes and public transfers.l6

73.  The European Commission's 2007 "Joint Report on Social Protection and
Social Inclusion" identified several key social inclusion challenges. While Eurostat
data show considerable recent progress in reducing unemployment, employment rates in
Poland remain low compared to other EUlO countries, well short o f the Lisbon target o f
achieving an employment rate of 70 percent by 2010. The at-risk-of-poverty rate among
children in Poland is, as in other EUlO countries, considerably higher than the population
as a whole: however, unlike in most other EU countries, people aged 65 years and older

Countries, and the Role of Taxes and Transfers in Reducing it.


                                                  39

face poverty risks considerably lower than the rest o f the population. Looking ahead, the
EC report notes the following key challenges for Poland: (i)             promote active inclusion by
decreasing inequalities in the education system, further developing active labor market
instruments, particularly for young people, women, and older workers, implementing
policies to make work pay for recipients o f various forms o f social transfers and
providing social services needed to support reintegration in employment; (ii)                 strengthen
the administrative capacity of social assistance and labor market institutions, supported
by mechanisms improving coordination policies at various levels; and (iii)                 continue the
pension reform process by reforming farmers' and disability pension schemes and
organizing conversion o f funded pension savings into safe annuities.

74. The labor market and pension reforms supported under the policy loan will
generate higher employment, incomes and pensions and thus reduce poverty. The
reforms are expected to raise employment rates o f older workers as well as to reduce
youth- and long-term unemployment thus benefiting several o f the most vulnerable
groups. The most contentious part o f the program i s the limitation o f access to early
retirement schemes. Early retirement benefits and allowances for the unemployed have
largely been phased out, but this was done during a period of rapidly falling
unemployment which mitigated any potential negative effects. Limiting early retirement
options inthe future will not be associated with termination o f any monetary benefits but
instead the right to retire early will be granted solely on medical grounds to occupational
groups working in hazardous conditions. This implies that some groups, most notably
teachers and railway workers, will lose the right to early retirement. Instead, however,
they will work longer, reach higher income levels, accumulate more funds in their
notional contribution accounts, and receive higher future old-age pensions thus protecting
them from the risk o f old-age poverty (people who retire early are more likely to end up
with a minimumpension). To the extent that leisure is valued highly, the reforms may of
course lower individual welfare.

75. In general, the Government provides a fairly comprehensive safety net in the
form of unemployment and social assistance benefits. This safety net mitigates the
potential poverty and social implications o f the policy agenda supported under the loan,
including the limitation o f early retirement and any job loss that might be associated with
privatization. The unemployment benefit requires workers to be registered with the public
labor office and to have worked at least 365 days in the last 18 months preceding
registration at wages equivalent to at least half the minimum wage. The benefits vary
between six and 18 months in duration depending on the regional unemployment rate.
The level o f benefit provided is approximately equal to the guaranteed minimumincome
per capita. The social assistance system provides the difference between the guaranteed
minimum income per capita and the actual income of a family, but is also based on
factors such as long-term unemployment and di~abi1ity.l~Family benefits are also
provided on a means-tested basis to families with children.

reasonablywell-targeted. In 2004, responsibility for the social assistance program was transferred to local
governments.It would be important to assess how well the locally financed and organized social assistance

                                   B. EnvironmentalAspects

76. The specific country policies supportedby the operation are not likely to cause
significant effects on the country's environment, forests, and other natural
resources; moreover,Polandhas adequateenvironmentalcontrolsin place.Poland's
environmental legislation and regulation is reinforced by EU environmental directives,
including the EU's guidelines on adoption of environmental assessments at the planning
and programming level (June 2001) and the EU's Environmental Liabilities Directive
setting out liability for damage to properties and natural resources (April 2007). As far as
the privatization program is concerned, pre-privatization environmental audits are
required to determine the existenceand scope of any such liabilities of companies instate
hands, manifestedas contamination on real property or other conduits. The quantification
of such liabilities is then used as part of the overall valuation of the state enterprise for
purposesof negotiating a fair purchase price with the private party. Private sector bidders
of enterprises will be subject to the environmental provisions embodied inPolish and EU
law once they acquire previous state assets inthe processof ownership transfer.

                                 C. MonitoringandEvaluation

77. The Bank will work closely with the Ministry of Finance and sector Ministries
to monitor and assess reform progress and impacts during the life of the Program.
Monitoring and evaluation will be supported by the various Ministries as well as
budgetary, legislative and economic data provided by the authorities and verified in
official disclosures, directives and regulations. Baseline and updated data will be
provided by the respective specialized agencies for the pertinent functions, and tracked
according to the indicators and outcome measures as shown in the Monitoring and
Results Framework (Annex 3).

                                       D. FiduciaryAspects

78. As part of its accession process to the European Union, Poland has achieved
significantprogressin reformingitspublic financialmanagementsystem (PFM).l8It
has upgraded its legislative framework, in line with the EU acquis, introduced internal
audit, and prepared for EUaccreditations process of fund managing agencies. Poland has
also made significant improvements related to the public availability and coverage of
fiscal information, particularly the adequacy of accounting and reporting standards and
regularity of reconciliations of bank accounts.

79. Other areas of reform include cash management. This includes the introduction
o f a single treasury account (TSA) system, computerization of all cash transactions and
central monitoring o f commitments and liabilities, development o f the State Budget
Trezor IT system and its implementation in several stages to include initially the lSt     and
2"dtier State budget holders, with the remaining units to be all included inthe final stage,


   The status of the PFM was derived from the World Bank's ongoing monitoring of PFM reform and
previousdiagnostic works conductedby the Bank and external organizations.

an inter-system interface connecting the NBP accounting system with the Trezor system,
makingpossible an online correlation betweenpendingpayment orders and State Budget
cash availability, and internal control.

80. In furthering its PFM reform agenda, the Government has issued a draft new
law on public finance expected to be adopted in 2008. The draft law enhances budget
transparency, predictability and performance-orientation over the medium-term. As
discussed elsewhere inthis document, it introduces inter alia: multi-year budget planning,
integration o f remaining Extra Budgetary Funds and externally-financed expenditures
within the State Budget, and strengthened internal control over public expenditures via
new regulations on internal audit and internal control.

81. In the area of external audit, Poland is advanced in relation to availability of the
audit reports to the public, independenceo f the Supreme Audit Institution (NIK) from the
executive, and control o f the NIK budget, providing a well functioning public financial
accountability and assurance mechanism for the legislature andthe public.

and it has upgraded its accounting and reporting policies in accordance with the
guidelines of the EuropeanCentralBank. Its financial management and operations are
transparently disclosed and presented on its website. The NBP's annual financial
statements are regularly audited and the most recently available audit reports (for 2004-
07) have unqualified audit opinions and were approved by the Council o f Ministers.
Overall, the fiduciary risk to this operation arising from Poland's public financial
managementsystem and use o f budget resources and its foreign exchange environment as
controlled by the Central Bank i s low.

                                       E. Disbursement

83.  Loan proceeds will be disbursed in one single tranche to the foreign currency
national budget account at the National Bank of Poland (Central Bank).
Disbursement will be made upon declaration o f loan effectiveness and submission of a
withdrawal application to the IBRD. At the request o f the MOF, the IBRD will deposit
the proceeds o f the loan into the foreign currency national budget account indicated by
the Government that forms part of the budget management system o f the country. The
proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
lending. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, thus no procurement
requirements will be necessary. The Government shall maintain accounts and records
with respect to the deposit o f loan proceeds inthe National Bank o f Poland (NBP). Ifthe
loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the loan agreement, IBRD
will require the borrower to refundthe amount directly to IBRD.

84.  N o additionalfiduciary arrangementswill be required.The Bank will not require
an audit o f the Deposit account but will require the Government to provide confirmation
to the Bank in the form o f an official letter from the Ministry o f Finance on the amounts
deposited inthe foreign currency account within 30 days o f receiving the funds.

                                F. RisksandRiskMitigation

85. Deterioration of macroeconomic balances.          Growth in Poland has been well-
balanced and the country is less exposed to a slowdown in Western Europe than other
new EU members. The baseline medium-termmacroeconomic scenario of slowing but
firm economic growth and moderating inflation is, however, subject to downside risks.
While this scenario takes into account the ongoing slowdown inthe global economy and
the euro-zone, there is significant uncertainty about global economic prospects and risks
are likely to be mainly on the downside. At the same time, inflationary pressures both
worldwide and in Poland, fueled by higher food and fuel prices, may become more
resilient if inflationary expectations rise and become more entrenched, including through
faster wage growth. The recent depreciation o f the zloty could add to inflationary
pressures. Meanwhile, the recent sharper than expected global economic downturn and
easing o f commodity prices as well as tighter credit conditions will help contain
inflationary pressures.

86. At the same time, fiscal policy will need to play a key role in constraining
demand while the supply side needs to be further stimulated through structural
reforms. Also, public sector wage growth needs to be contained including to send the
right signal to private labor markets. The proposed operation supports this policy mix
through its emphasis on fiscal consolidation and reform, labor market and pension
reform, deregulation, andprivatization, and overall policy coordination.

87.  While fiscal targets through 2011 are broadly realistic based on baseline
macroeconomicprojections,the measures needed to offset the negative short-term
fiscal impact of planned reforms remain to be fully articulated and the risks of
slower growth discussed above could underminethe envisaged fiscal consolidation
process. Although the European Commission on June 11, 2008 recommended closing
Poland's Excessive Deficit Procedure (imposed in 2004), both the European Council and
the IMF have expressed concerns about the feasibility o f fiscal targets in 2009-10 inthe
absence o f clear measures and giventhe macroeconomic risks.

88.  The executionof the budgetin 2008 has remainedtight and the outcome for the
year is expected to be better than programmedprovidinga stronger base for 2009.
The 2009 budget envisages firm control over total public spending. Further, the deficit
target limit inPoland is bindingproviding additional assurancethat program goals will be
met. Nevertheless, the fiscal outcome in 2009 may be somewhat weaker than targeted
owing to the weaker than earlier expected growth, but the IMF believes that allowing
automatic stabilizers to operate on the revenue side is an appropriate policy response in
the current environment. Looking further ahead, the Bank's involvement and cooperation
with the Government on the implementation of its reform program would facilitate the
establishment o f clear spending priorities in key policy areas. This would support the
achievement o f fiscal targets over the medium term.

89. The markets could react to Poland's request to the Bank, either positively, as
the Bank is giving a seal of approval of the reform program; or negatively, if the
request is misconstrued as due to financial or economic difficulties. Poland has until


                                             43

recently beenraising sizeable financing ininternational markets at attractive spreads, thus
demonstrating market confidence in its economic prospects, although the most recent
spill-over from the global and regional financial problems have also affected Poland. The
proposed Bank loan is very small compared to regular market financing and refinancing
operations and would signal Bank support for Government's reform program. This
reduces the risk that the loan would be perceivedas emergency financing. Inaddition, the
Bank will work with the authorities to carefully manage communications with the
markets and ensure that the basis for the request i s fully understood.

90.  Weakening political support for reform. The political environment-with             the
Government's lack of qualified majority in Parliament and risk o f Presidential vetoes on
new proposed legislation-may      make it increasingly difficult for the Government to
advance its reform program over the next two years as Presidential elections approach.
However, the inherent flexibility o f the proposed programmatic approach will allow
program content to evolve instep with government priorities.

91. Insufficient institutional capacity. Policy formulation in Poland has tended to be
fragmented and technical and administrative capacity in some ministries is weaker than
desirable. The proposed programmatic series would help strengthen policy coordination
and technical/administrative capacity through the Bank's analytic and advisory services.

                           UNDER     PROGRAMMATICPOLICY LOAN

PublicFinanceManagement

The proposed Technical Cooperation (TC) on Public Finance Management intends to support the
Government in the improvement o f the management o f public funds. Pending confirmation from
the Ministry o f Finance, the TC program will include studies on links betweenpublic finances
and labor supply, budgetrigidities, and continuedwork on performance-based budgeting.

An alternative to this program is a poverty and social impact analysis, which is currently being
discussed with the new deputy finance minister responsible for taxes. Moreover, within the series
o f cross-country comparative studies on public finance reform, there i s the ongoing regional
study on PBB and medium-termexpenditure frameworks (MTEF), in which Poland is covered
among five other countries inthe region.

Labor MarketsandEmployment

The TC in the area o f employment and labor markets intends to improve the capacity of the
Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy to design and implement modern, cost-effective labor
market programs aimed at reducing structural unemployment. The main area where the Ministry
of Labor expressed interest in Bank TC is on improving functions and coordination between
employment and social welfare offices. Specifically, the Ministry expressed interest in finding
out what informationis sharedbetweenemployment and welfare agencies inother countries.

Other topics of interest to the Government that could be pursued if additional funding for TC i s
identified (or cost-sharing by the Government secured) include: (a) improving the targeting and
cost-effectiveness o f active labor market programs; and (b) designingmodern activation policies,
especially those targeted at socially-excluded groups (the long-term unemployed, youth from
disadvantaged backgrounds, etc.). In addition, TC can be used to strengthen the capacity o f the
Ministry of Labor to monitor and evaluate the net impact of labor market programs, so as to
select the most cost-effective interventions.

Pensions and SocialAssistance

The TC program onpensions and social assistanceaims to provide support and global experience
to the Government's efforts for modernizing the pensions and social assistance systems. The
technical cooperation activities include modeling and policy assistance for the agricultural
pension system. KRUS and the Ministry o f Agriculture requested Bank assistance indeveloping
a pension model which could be used to look at the various reform options for KRUS. A list o f
the data required to calibrate the Bank's PROST model was shared with the Ministry o f
Agriculture and calibration and training will be provided to the Ministry and KRUS once the
required data have been received.

Other topics of interest to the Government that could be pursued if additional funding for TC is
identified (or cost-sharing by the Government secured) include: (a) review of social assistance
legislation and implementation; and (b) review and sharing o f international best-practice in
integration o f various types o f social benefits and information-sharing across benefit types.


                                          51

Private Sector Development

The TC in the area o f private sector development includes: (a) implementation o f business
regulatory reform recommendations in line with Doing Business diagnosis; (b) implementation
o f public private partnerships (PPP) for infrastructurehegional projects and private participation
in finance instruments; and (c) methods, based on best practice, for privatizing minority-owned
government shares in enterprises as well as majority stakes including options for alternative
mechanisms.

Other topics o f interest to the Government that could be pursued if additional funding for TC i s
identified (or cost-sharing by the Government secured) include: (a) developing a regulatory
impact assessment methodology; (b) costing the value o f reductions in regulatory barriers; (c)
evaluation o f new government initiatives inthe context o f Doing Business impact; (d) achieving
efficiency in the legislative reform process; (e) integration o f Polish and Ukrainian financial
markets for insurance and banking; (f) financial governance and management structures for state-
owned and regional enterprises.

Health Sector

The TC program in the health sector intends to support implementation o f health insurance and
hospital reforms. The Bank would engage in a global knowledge-sharing agenda on key issues
that include the introduction o f health insurance competition, the associated regulatory agencies
and supervisory bodies, the different types o f non-public insurers, and risk-equalization
mechanisms. With regard to hospital reform, knowledge-sharing topics could include public-
private partnerships and corporatization, hospital debt management, and approaches to increase
financial and management autonomy.

Education Sector

The TC program in education covers two Ministries (Ministry o f National Education and
Ministry o f Science and Higher Education) and has been designed in collaboration with these
Ministries. The objective o f the program i s to provide global knowledge to inform policies
targeted at the upgrading of skills for competitiveness in Poland. The TC program in the
education sector will support global knowledge sharing on: (a) reforms in Higher Education; (b)
the World-Class University implementation (and its specific implications for Poland); and (c)
new global trends inScience curricula inbasic education. `Also, the TC program will support the
Ministry of National Education in the development of a strong analytic program on PISA,
including a partnership to convene an international event in Poland that will promote the use o f
PISA analysis for policy-making.

Other topics o f interest to the Government that could be pursued if additional funding for TC i s
identified (or cost-sharing by the Government secured) include a Policy Note on global efforts to
create Labor Market Observatories and a Policy Note on the lessons o f the implementation
process o f "Grade Zero" incountries that have made recent progress inthis area.

    Polish economy afready suffers from shortages of skfiled labor. The expensive social security system supports
    inacttvrtyand is financed by high labor taxes. in particular, the availability of generous eatly retirement (and to a
    lesserextent disability)schemes k fiscally oostfwand results in very low labor force participationof older workers
    (aged 55-64). FurFher, the low skifls and productivity of a significant fractionof the workforce Is reflectedin a low
    emptoyrnent/popuiation ratio and a high incidence of long-term unemployment among the iesx-educated
    workers.

    Privatization and deragulation
    Another pillar of the government's reform program is private sector development, including completion of the
    privatiratlon agenda, In the 1990s and mid-200ds, the successive Polish Governments prkatized a large mass of
    State-OwnedEnterprises(SOEs) through variousmeans includingtenders, mass privetisationsand other methods.
    However, there dill remains a small yet not imignificantnumber of reddual enterprises which are becoming an
    administrate drain on the State and should rightly be reconstituted as p r h t e sector companies. For some of
    these, the State is the majority shareholder though some two to three hundred are small enterprises with only
    minority holdingsby the State. As part of its privatization agenda, the Governmentrecentlyannounceda plan to
    privatlze 740 enterprlses and liquidate or wind down another 350. A small share of enterprlses (e,g, energy
    sector) wilt not be privatizedgiven the n e d for the Governmentto first consider strategic needs and choices for
    the economy in such specialized sectors. Among some of the corpoate governance reforms envisaged is the
    creation 61 independen company boards and management that can turn around companies wirh revenue
    potential, as well as market-based remuneration for key management staff to dissuade unproductive rent

I   seeking. Separately, to encourage public/private partnerships, the Government will reduce the Ministerial
i   authorlzations or Interventionsrequiredfor these dealsto move forward. Further, the Government is pursuingan
    ambitious deregulationprogramaimed at improvingthe environmentfor doing business.

    Furtherreforms are envisaged duringthe subsequentphasesof the programmaticcooperation framework.These
    include continuation of reforms in the areas abwe as well as envlsaged reforms in other social sectors, notably
    education and healthcare servlces. The focus of subsequent loans would be defined more precisely during the
    discussion of these, with due conslderatlonto maintainafocused approach to the policyareascoveted.

    I strongly believe that the World Bank can bc supportive for us in all of the above mentionedareas and I am
    confidentthat our cooperation would also be valuable to the BankIn itswork with other cllents. Ihope that in the
    context of the ongoing global financial turmoil, the Bank would be ready to deliver this regular, man-emergency
    asdstance as the Polish macroeconomyand financialsystem are sound.

    Mr. Presldent, Since I set store by transparency of this process, please k me copy this corfespondence to Mr.
    Joaquin Afrnunia, European Commissioner for Economk and Monetary Affairs, Mr. Dominique Straw-Kahn,
    Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund and Mr. Stawomit Skrrypek President of the National
