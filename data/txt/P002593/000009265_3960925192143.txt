SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Sudan
Stock Route Project (Credit 1525-SU)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Sudan - Stock Route Project (Credit
1525-SU) prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in conjunction with the Africa
Regional Office. FAO also acted on behalf of a cofinancier (the International Fund for Agricultural
Development). Part II was not submitted by the Borrower.
The project aimed to support the Government's policy of stimulating meat production
from the traditional livestock producers to meet the needs of a growing urban population and a ready
eport market in the Middle East. This was to be achieved by providing transhumant livestock with
drinking water and veterinary services along traditional stock routes.
The 55-year project was completed in 7.5 years, due to initial delays in effectiveness
and initial technical constraints in borehole drilling. Eventually, the project succeeded in meeting its
physical targets and private herders reduced treklking costs by making heavy use of the stock route.
The project failed, however, to convert the parastatal, Livestock Route Corporation, into a private
institution that would continue providing animal health services. The economic rate of return has
been reestimated at 20 percent compared to the appraisal estimate of 27 percent. The PCR provides
a detailed account of project implementation and outcomes.
The overall outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, its sustainability as
uncertain and its institutional development as partial.
No audit is planned.

STOCK ROUTE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1525-SU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for the Stock Route Project in Sudan for which Credit
1525-SU in the amount of SDR 5.5 million (US$5.5 million equivalent) was approved on October 16,
1984. The project closed on December 31, 1992, two years behind schedule. SDR 5.3 million was
disbursed. The last disbursement was on February 17, 1993. In addition, the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) provided a loan of SDR 5.95 million (US$6.0 million equivalent).
Parts I and m of the report were prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in
conjunction with the World Bank's Agriculture and Environment Division, Country Department II, Africa
Regional Office. A draft has been sent to the Government of Sudan as well as the cofinancier for
comment.
The report was based on findings of an FAO mission that visited Sudan in July 1992 and the
Bank's final supervision mission of August 1992. Information was also obtained from the President's
Report, Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

SUDAN
STOCK ROUTE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1525-SU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Livestock plays an important role in Sudan and makes significant contribution to the agricultural
GDP, employment and to foreign exchange earnigs. In the late seventies and early eighties, the rapid
increase of livestock numbers in the major production areas of Western and Southern Sudan was
exceeding optimal carrying capacity. At the same time, domestic and fo.eign demand for livestock
products was increasing. This induced GOS to look for means to augment livestock off takes in order
to satisfy growing demand, prevent overgrazing and improve the income of livestock producers. GOS
adopted a strategy that called for the provision of water and other services for livestock on their
traditional migratory routes. Such support was expected to prolong the period of migration beyond the
rainy season, and reduce the stress on animals while trekking on the route.
Objectives
2.    The project aimed to support GOS's policy of stimulating meat production from the traditional
livestock producers to meet the needs of a growing urban population and a ready export market. This
was to be achieved by providing livestock with drinking water and veterinary services along the
traditional stock routes, thus increasing the offtake and reducing trekking losses. The project also aimed
to provide some balance in regional development as it was to assist those regions in the east and south
that were less well endowed than those with irrigated developments.
Implementation Experience
3.    The project became effective on October 18, 1985, a year after the Board approval date. The
lapse was caused mainly by adminisave delays in finalizing the subsidiary Loan Agreement between
GOS and the Livestock Route Company (LRC) which was responsible for project implementation.
4.    The Wateryards component experienced financial and technical constraints. Due to appreciation
of the contract currency (the Deutsche Mark), the foreign exchange fwuds available to the project were
insufficient to meet the contract as negotiated. The number of wateryards was therefore reduced from
59 to 53. After two years of implementation, it was found that only about half the boreholes drilled were
considered capable of producing water along the stock route. Based on this success rate, it was concluded
that only about 45 wateryards could be constructed in the 59 sites identified at appraisal. To complete
the network, eight wateryards in new locations were needed. At the request of GOS, IDA agreed to
transfer US$ 2.45 million from the Western Savannah Project II (Credit 1640-SU) to finance the
additional construction. In retrospect, much redundant and expensive production borehole specification
drilling might have been avoided by including an exploration drilling phase prior to the production
drilling phase. Nevertheless, the project had constructed 52 wateryards at completion.



- iv -
5.    All civil works under the project including the veterinary service stations weate seriously delayed
and downsized. Progress was slow and at the end of the project, none of the buildings was constructed.
6.    Privatizaion of LRC was not implemented as the process proved to be much more complicated
than envisioned in the Staff Appraisal Report. In retrospect, the project should have provided technical
assistance to ensure that LRC had the expertise to carry out the privatization plan. Government
intervention in the staffing and operations of the LRC also hampered its evolution into a commercial
enterprise.
Project Results
7.    The project achieved its main goal of establishing wateryards to serve livestock along the
traditional stock routes. At completion, 50 wateryards were operating. The number of animals trekking
on the routes increased. The economic rate of return was re-estimated at completion to be 20 percent,
compared with the SAR estimate of 27 percent. The lower return was due to higher than expected
investment costs and implementation lags that delayed the materialization of benefits.
S.    The financial performance of LRC was poor. A project covenant regarding water charges was
not fulfilled during the first half of the project. Not until mid-1991 were new water prices finally set and
LRC's financial status improved. However shortly afterwards, the Sudanese Pound devalued by forty
times. The last supervision mission estimated that in order for the company to be financially viable,
average water rates needed to quadruple.
Sustainability
9.    The key factor is LRC's financial viability. Without adequate management and resources for
operation and maintenance of the wateryards, LRC would be hard pressed to continue its services. One
route to self-sufficiency and sustainability is privatization, which (OS is currently pursuing.
Lessons Lared
10.   The main lessons are:
(a)    The economic return of water supply on stock routes is good in Sudan. To protect
project investments, immediate attention needs to be given to improving LRC's financial
status, with a view to privatizing the company in the near future;
(b)    Privatization is a complex process that requires political commitment as well as the
expertise to carry it out. The project should have provided adequate technical assistance
and staff with management capability to implement it. LRC has been encouraged to
apply for funds available under the Public Enterprises and Economic Management Project
for this purpose;
(c)    The autonomy of LRC should have been clearly spelled out to enable LRC to develop
into a commercial enterprise;
(d)    Given the hydrological unerties of the area, more exploratory drilling should have
perhaps been carried out. The difficulty of well-drilling in arid lands cannot be
underestimated.

Bacdgprnd
1.    Sudan faced a severe balance of payments problem in the early 1980s, with a current account
deficit of $1.3 billion in 1981/82. The crisis came about largely as the consequence of inadequate
economic management policies compounded by external factors, such as the sharply increased cost of
petroleum imports and the steep rate of international inflation. While the value of imports increased,
Sudan's exports declined in real terms. The decline was concentrated in cotton, which occurred becxse
of excessive government controls that hampered production and marketing, the deterioration of the
irrigation infrastructure, and an overvalued exchange rate. By the end of 1982, external payments arrears
had accumulated to above $2.2 billion.
2.    Against this background, the Government of Sudan (GOS) undertook several significant decisions
to establish financial equilibrium, restore export growth through appropriate policies and public
investments, improve the performance of public corporations, and install an adequate system for
management of the nation's external debt. An essential aspect of the stabilization program was a drive
to increase foreign exchange earnings through the Export Action Program, which was designed to raise
the volume of cotton exports. Several investments in the irrigated subsector, which were financed by the
Bank and other aid agencies, supported this export recovery. Attention was also given to the livestock
subsector, which in 1981 was Sudan's second largest export (US$78 million).
3.    Agriculture and lvestock. Agriculture, including livestock production, provides livelihood for
80 percent of the population and accounts for 40 percent of GDP and 95 percent of exports. Livestock
plays an important role and makes a significant contribution to the agricultural GDP, employment and
to foreign exchange earnings. The bulk of the exports consisted of live animals and meat to the Middle
East. In the late seventies and early eighties, the rapid increase of livestock numbers in the major



-2-
production areas of Westem Sudan, and to some extent of Southern Sudan, was exceeding optimal
carrying capacity. At the same time, domesdc and foreign demand for livestock and livestock products
was increasing. Ibis induced GOS to look for meats to augment livestock off-akes in order to satisfy
growing demand, prevent overgrazing and improve the income of livestock producers.
4.    Strengthening marketing infrastructure and services on the traditional west to east route was
GOS's first course of action. From 1979 to 1986, it implemented a Livestock Marketing Project (Credit
782-SU) with IDA assistance. The project provided livestock trains and trucks, livestock markets,
railway holding and loading yards and technical support. In spite of the usefulness of these facilities,
their limitations soon became clear as they could service only a small portion of the livestock marketed.
GOS adopted a strategy that called for the provision of water and othei. services for livestock on their
traditional migratory routes. Such support was expected to prolong the period of migration beyond the
rainy season, and reduce the stress on animals while trekking on the route.
Project Objectives and Description
5.    The project aimed to support GOS's policy of stimulating meat production from the traditional
livestock producers to meet the needs of a growing urban population and a ready export market. This
was to be achieved by providing livestock with drinking water and veterinary services along the
taditional stock routes, thus increasing the offtake and reducing trekking losses. The project also aimed
to provide some balance in regional development as it was to assist those regions in the east and south
that were less well endowed than those with irrigated developments.
6.    The project comprised the following components:
(a)    Construction of 59 wateryards with about 83 tubewells on two main routes, over a
distance of about 2,000 km. Ihe wateryards were to be equipped with water storage
tanks, selling facilities, staff housing, vehicles for delivery of supplies and radio
equipment.
(b)    Establishment of veterinary service stations equipped with office buildings, staff housing,
drugs, vehicles and equipment.
(c)    Establishment of facilities for project administration, including the construction of an
office, store and staff housing in El Obeid, provision of vehicles, equipment and
incremental staff.
(d)    Provision of technical assistance and staff training, consisting of 50 man-months for a
hydrologist and a ohief engineer; 68 man-months of short-term international consultancy;
72 man-months of local consultancy; and staff training in administration and engine
mechanics.
Project Design and Organization
7.    Project design was based on a Government project in the early seventies that established water
stations on the Dry Season Stock Route in the south. Encouraged by the positive response from livestock
producers and merchants, the Govermment proposed to invest in improving services on the Northern Stock



-3 -
Route) from Nyala to Omdurman near Khartoum. As requested by GOS, a mission by the International
Fund for Agricultural Development (WFAD) visited Sudan in June 1981 and identified a Stock Route
Development Project along the northern route. In October 1981, a preparation mission from the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Investment Centre visited Sudan and concluded that it was not
possible to recommend major improvements on the northern route beeause adequate water supply could
not be guaranteed. Instead it recommended an experimental project to develop hafirs (ponds) on the
southern route, parallel to the railway line and north of Omdurnan, and to rehabilitate existing
wateryards. Tbis proposal was unacceptable to GOS as it wantEd development on the northern route
only. Subsequently, IFAI) agreed with GOS on the matter and requested IDA to prepare and appraise
a stock route project. IDA mounted two missions: a pre-appraisal mission in November 1982 and an
appraisal mission in March/April 1983. IDA's final proposal was a compromise which entailed drilling
boreholes on both routes. The rationale was that this would have a favorable ecological impact by
allowing one route to recover while the other was in service. The risk of low-yielding wells was
recognized and was to be minimized by providing for sufficient exploratory boreholes and additional
prod -ction wells in low-yield locations.
8.    Project objectives, as spelled out in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) were clear and simple. The
components were relevant and conducive to the attainment of the objectives. The project was to be
implemented by a new company, the Livestock Route Company (LRC), to be established under the
project. At the early phase of the project before the LRC was fully operational, the Livestock and Meat
Marketing Corporation (LMMC) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources was to carry out
the project. (The LMMC was the executing agency of the Livestock Marketing Project.) The LRC was
to be registered as a private company and governed by a Board of Directors. A General Manager was
to act as an executive head of the company. It was agreed that 80% of the Government's equity holding
in LRC would be sold to livestock traders and producers by July 1, 1989. This arrangement stemmed
from the unsatisfactory experience with Government supplied water services in remote rural areas over
the previous decade and the successful self-help operations in some of those areas.
Project JImplementation
9.    Ihe project was declared effective on October 18, 1985, a year ater the Board approval date.
The lapse was caused mainly by administrative delays in finalizing the subsidiary Loan Agreement
between GOS and LRC.
10.   Wateryards.  In the meantime, the currency under which the contract was negotiated, the
Deutsche Mark, appreciated by 25 percent vis-a-vis the US dollar. The foreign exchange funds available
to the project were insufficient to meet the contract as negotiated. Negotiations with the contractor were
completed in July 1986, after reducing the number of wateryards to be constructed from 59 to 53. It was
also decided that drilling production-size boreholes rather than test drilling smaller ones would be more
economical and efficient. In September 1986, the three LRC resident consultants (Chief Hydrologist,
Chief Engineer and the Supervising Civil Engineer), were in place and carrying out preparatory works.
Drilling started around April 1987 and progressed remarkably well. In the first year, 13 wateryards were
completed and handed over to LRC. By November 1989, about 38 wateryards were completed, but only
26 were handed over to LRC.
11. Some wateryards were not handed over because of a dispute concerning the installed engines.
After LRC discovered problems with the pump engines in mid 1989, the manufacturer had them repaired,



-4-
but LRC obtained an engineering report that the engines would still have problems unless they were
modified. After lengthy negotiations, it was agreed that the contractor should replace the 36 installed
engines with modified ones, and modify the 31 engines not yet inslled. This process was completed
by the end of 1991.
12.   At the end of 1988, an IDA supervision mission found that only about half the boreholes drilled
were considered capable of producing water along the stock route. Based on the success rate of finding
sufficient water and the necessity to drill deeper than anticipated, it was concluded that only about 45
wateryards could be constructed in the 59 sites identifled at appraisal. To complete the network, eight
wateryards in new locations were needed.  At the request of GOS, IDA agreed to transfer
US$ 2.45 million from the Western Savannah Project 11 (Credit 1640-SU) to finance the additional
construction. At completion, the project had constructed 52 wateryards.
13.   The hydrologists' final report I/ concluded that 'had an exploration drilling program preceded
the production borehole drilling, it is probable that all 59 wateryards could have been realized in a
rationally distributed network for litle or no extra costs." 'Iey maintained that the test drilling program
could have provided for the evaluation of not only the hydrogeology but also the preferred method of
dri,ling and development prior to preparation of the contract documents. In addition, many of the
shallower boreholes could have been completed at production diameters with inexpensive PVC screen and
casing. If the tested yield were acceptable these boreholes could have been capped and incorporated in
the final production borehole contract, thereby avoiding duplicate drilling at some hcations. With a
sound specification based on empirical experience, the contractor would be much better placed to execute
the works with optimum efficiency without having to continually resort to variation orders to make
necessary adjustment. Ihe client would have been assured a higher success rate of production boreholes,
thereby avoiding the uncertainty as to how to deploy pumping equipment. Much redundant and expensive
production borehole specification drilling could have been avoided by including an exploration drilling
phase prior to the production drilling phase. However, the hydrologist's conclusion is open to debate as
no cost comparison has been done on the two approaches. This dilemma underlines the degree of
uncertainty of well-drilling in arid areas. Even with a physical contingency provision of 20 percent of
the cost of civil works, the project ran out of funds.
14.   Vetrinary Service Stations. The design and tendering of all civil works, including the
vetrnry service stations, were seriously delayed because LRC was preoccupied with the construction
of wateryards. At the mid-term review in November 1989, none of the civil works packages had gone
to tender. Given the shortfall in project funds and the already stretched implementation capacity of LRC,
it was decided that the headquarters bu  liug and veteary clinics should be downsized and that priority
should be given to the construction of a workshop and stores in El Obeid. Progress was slow and at the
end of the project, none of the buildings was constructed.
15.   Provision of Fadlities for Project Administration. Construction of LRC headquarters at El
Obeid did not take place due to the shortage of funds. On a Bank supervision mission recommendation,
LRC rented offices in El Obeid and LMMC provided it with office space in Xhartoum. LRC had
difficulty recruiting staff initially because of Government restrictions on staff recruitment. In the end,

prepared by the project's second hydrologist who took over after the first one left.



however, it did fulfil its staffing targets. Vehicles and radio sets were procured, although less than SAR
targets. Due to the lack of funds, the workshops were not constructed. LRC now has two mobile
workshops, which can do limited repairs.
16.   Privatization of LRC. LRC failed to fulfil the covenant to offer 80 percent of the Government's
holding for sale to livestock traders and producers by July 1, 1989. In addition, serious institutional
problems arose when the new Government issued a decree in July 1989 abolishing all members of the
boards of public corporations including LRC. The Government also replaced the LRC Director-General
with LMMC's Director General, further undermining LRC's autonomy and evolution into a private
commercial operation. Following much prodding from IDA, the Government appointed a new Director
General and agreed to carry out a diagnostic study to set out the decisions, actions and steps for
privatizing LRC. The study, finded by special IFAD allocation and completed in late 1991, gave the
broad outlines of a privatization plan. After some delay, GOS established a four-person committee to
implement LRC's privatization. However, due to the lack of know-how and commitment to carry out
the plan, no action had been taken as at the end of the project. IDA recommended that GOS include LRC
in the list of companies to be considered for privatization under another IDA-financed project, the Public
Enterprises and Economic Management Project (Cr. 1798-SU). Privatization of LRC proved to be much
more complicated than envisioned in the SAR. In retrospect, the project should have provided technical
assistance and staff experienced in commercial management to ensure that LRC had the expertise to carry
it out.
17.   Total project cost is estimated at US$22.8 million, compared with the appraisal estimate of
US$19.6 million. Because of implementation delays, the closing date was extended twice to December
31, 1992.
Project Results and Impact
18.   The project achieved its main goal of establishing wateryards to service livestock along the
traditional stock routes. Although the project accomplished seven wateryards less than what was
envisaged at appraisal, their distribution along the route enabled the animals to obtain water, thereby
reducing loss due to mortality and weight loss. At completion, 50 wateryards were operating, two being
temporarily idle due to security risks. According to project staff, there was sufficient demand for water
in the wateryards from livestock traders and local inhabitants, except in a few areas where other sources
of low-cost water supply were available. The number of animals trekking on the routes increased.
However, there was little information on the amount of water supplied because of the lack of monitoring
and analysis. ITere are currently plans to install water meters in the near future.
19.   The last supervision mission re-stimated the economic rate of return to be 20 percent, compared
with the SAR estimate of 27 percent. The lower return was due to higher than expected investment costs
and implementation lags that delayed the materialization of benefits. The direct benefits were derived
from reductions in mortality, live weight loses and holding costs. The parameters for calculation of
benefits are given in the table below. All of the Without Project values, shown in the table are taken
from the SAR, except for the trekking and holding costs and the value of meat which were set at 1992
price level (exclusive of taxes, duties, subsidies, interest and other transfer payments). The Standard
conversion Factor for all local costs other than labor is set at one since the exchange rate at the time of
completion (LS100 to US$1) was considered to reflect the "real" or "economic" value of the local

currency as compared to the US dollar. Costs used in the analysis included investment, recurrent and
replacement costs, as well as the residual value of investnents.

20. The financial performance of the corporation was poor. A project covenant stipulated that LRC
set water charges at a level which assured full cost recovery, and such charges were to be adjusted
annually. During the first half of the project, water prices remained unchanged. At the mid-term review,
a financial analysis showed that prices needed to increase three to five times. IDA staff recommended
that LRC prepare data on alternative pricing strategies and propose new water prices to the Board.
However, LRC did not take action and continued to incur large losses. Finally in June 1991, the Mmister
for Agriculture nominated a committee to establish a formula for water pricing. On the basis of an
agreed formula, new prices were set and LRC's financial status improved. However, shortly afterwards,
the Sudanese Pound devalued by forty times, causing the replacement value of fixed assets to increase

drastically. According to the analysis of the last supervision mission, in order for the company to be
financially viable, average water rates needed to quadruple.
21.   LRC appointed an environmental officer responsible for monitoring rangeland and planting trees
around wateryards, and sowing seeds on bare ground. The last supervision mission found that the
wateryards caused little or no damage to the environment. There was, in fact, evidence at many yards
visited that the growth of vegetation close by was better than the growth in more distant areas. The
mission surmised two reasons: soil fertility in these areas was high due to the accumulation of animal
manur and the provision of water encouraged catel movement earlier in the year, thereby reducing the
grazing pressure on rangelands in the southwest.
Project Sustainability
22.   The key factor is LRC's financial viability. Without adequate management and resources for
operation and maintenance of the wateryards, LRC would be hard pressed to continue its services. One
route to self-sufficiency and sustainability is privatization, which GOS is currently pursuing. In order
to attract private sector iunxest, the last supervision recommended immediate steps to improve LRC's
financial status such as increasing water rates and collection and strengthening the finacial capability of
LRC's management. LRC can also apply for funds from Cr. 1798 which provides technical assistance
to implement privatization, including valuing of assets, developing prospectus, advertising the sale of
shares and creating safety nets for employees.
Bank Performance
23.   'Me Bank's appraisal did not recognize the issues involved in privatizing a state-owned company.
First of all, no measure was taken to ensure the autonomy of LRC. It operated and reported like a
normal Government department in budget planning and utilization of funds, and had no authority to set
water charges. Its staffing at senior levels was subject to political intervention. These charactics
were detrimental to LRC's financial performance and its evolution into a private commercial enterprise.
Te Bank also failed to foresee the expertise required for carrying out the privatization process, resulting
in a lack of project provision for technical assistance in this area.
24.   Supervision missions during the first half of the project were preoccupied with procement
issues. From early 1988 on, more attention was paid towards financial issues. The Bank and IFAD
provided from their own resources consultants to address LRC's financial and management problems.
Mission members conducted financial analyses and recommended the levels of water charges that would
enable the company to cover its operation. However, such periodic technical advice could not replace
the presence of longer term resident consultants.
25. The supervision mission's performance during the dispute between the contractor and LRC was
good. While they tried to help by inviting the two parties to dialogue, they refrained from being involved
into the acta  dealings between the two contending parties. Identification and preparation were
undertaken by WFAD and FAO.



Borrower Performance
26.   LRC's performance in constructing the wateryards was commendable. In spite of difficult natural
and political conditions, it established a network of wateryards which yielded considerable benefits.
The Government, however, sent conflicting signals with regard to its commitment to the project. From
project formulation to appraisal, GOS actively participated and expressed the need for a speedy start of
the project. Once the project had been appraised, GOS did not keep the same momentum. First of all,
due to administrative delays (para 9), credit effectiveness lagged by a year. Secondly, it did not provide
the LRC with the necessary staff, funds and equipment At a crucial poin of the project, the new
Government removed the LRC Board and its director general, who was an effective manager. This was
a serious impediment to project implementation.
27.   GOS was also slow to address the issues of water charges and privatization, although its
performance improved towards the end of the project. It has expressed commitment to privatize the
corporation and appointed a high level political figure to be in charge of the process.
Project Relationship
28.   The relationship between GOS and the Bank was satisfactory throughout the project
implementation period.
Consulting Services and Studies
29.   Four international consultants were recruited under the project to fill the posts of Chief Engineer,
Hydrologist and Supervising Civil Engineer. The Chief Engineer stayed with the project for about 36
months and the other two positions were filled from one company for 30 months. The Hydrologist
position was filled by two candidates for equal periods of time. While the performance of the consultants
was generally satisfactory, the performance of the Chief Engineer was considered not forcefil enough
in the dispute over the defective engines.
30.   The only major study funded by the project was the Livestock Services Study. This was
undertaken during the second half of 1987 by a foreign firm. The study was useful in preparing GOS
development programs for the livestock subsector.
Project Documentation and Data
31.   The Development Credit Agreement and the Staff Appraisal Report were well prepared and
adequate for the implementation of the project. The Staff Appraisal Report was a useful document for
project staff during implementation.
32.   Results and findings of the water resource development program were recorded in the
hydrologists' final report. It was a source book for LRC managers and technicians and established a clear
and comprehensive framework in which future developments and technical questions could be discussed.
Data on the operation of the wateryards, however, was not collected and analyzed. The voiume of water
used could have been calculated from the pumping time, but this was not done. The lack of data posed
difficulties to the preparation of the PCR, and many analyses had to be based on assumptions from the
appraisal report.

Lemons Leamed
33.   The main lessons are:
(a)   Tle economic return of water supply on stock routes is good in Sudan. To protect
project investments, immediate attention needs to be given to improving LRC's financial
status, with a view to privatizing the company in the near future;
(b)   Privatization is a complex process that requires political commitment as well as the
expertise to carry it out. The project should have provided adequate technical assistance
and staff with management capability to implement it. LRC has been encouraged to
apply for funds available under the Public Enterprises and Economic Management Project
for this purpose;
(c)    The autonomy of LRC should have been clearly spelled out to enable LRC to develop
into a commercial enterprise;
(d)   Given the hydrological uncertainties of the area, more exploratory drilling should have
perhaps been carried out. The difficulty of well-drilling in arid lands cannot be
underestimated.

Dear Ms. Ganguly,
Re: Sudan - Stock Route Project (IFAD Loan 155-SU)
With reference to your letter of 14 April 1993, please find
attached  the  loan history  data  for the  above-mentioned  project.   In
general, we concur with the draft completion report, however, paragraph 12
should read:
"12.   At the end of 1988, an IDA supervision mission found that only
about half the boreholes drilled were considered capable of producing
water along the stock route. Based on this success rate of finding water,
it was concluded that only about 45 wateryards could be constructed in the
59  sites  identified  at  appraisal.   To  complete  the  network,  eight
wateryards in new locations were needed. At the request of GOS, IDA and
IFAD agreed to transfer US$2.45 million from the Western Savannah Project
II  (Credit  1640-SU  and  Loan  181-SU)  to  finance  the  additional
construction. At completion, the project had constructed 52 wateryards."
