STOCK ROUTE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Democratic Republic of Sudan
Amount:             IDA Credit SDR 5.5 million (US$5.5 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard.
Cofinancing:        IFAD Loan SDR 5.95 million (US$6.0 million equivalent)
Beneficiary:        Livestock Route Company
Onlending Terms:   Sudanese Pounds equvalent to SDR 3.03 million will be
onlent to the Livestock Route Company with annual
service charges equivalent to 16% of the outstanding
loan balance, 15 year repayment including 5 years grace,
with the Government bearing the foreign exchange risk;
Sudanese Pounds equivalent to SDR 1.44 million will be
made available as an equity investment in the Livestock
Route Company; Sudanese Pounds equivalent to SDR 0.96
million will .be transferred to the Livest-ock Route
Company as a grant; and SDR 0.12 million will be
retained by the Government to conduct a study of the
livestock industry.
Project Description:
Objective:          To ensure the continued flow of marketed livestock from
the project areas of western Sudan to the principal
towns and for export, by renewal and extension of water
supplies and veterinary services along livestock trade
routes.
Components:         The project would include:
(a)  Fifty-nine wateryards with about 83 tubewells to be
constructed on two main and two feeder stock routes;
(b)  Facilities and materials for veterinary inspection,
treatment and vaccination at about 18 veterinary centers
along stock routes;
(c)  Project administration facilities (office, housing,
vehicles and equipment);
(d)  Technical assistance and training.

Benefits:           The main annual financial benefits would include, re-
duced livestock holding costs (LSd 0.5 million); reduced
livestock trekking weight losses (LSd 1.5 million); and
reduced livestock mortality during trekking (LSd 1.2
million). Benefits that could result from increased
offtake or sale of water to sedentary farmers along the
stock route were not included in these estimates.
Risks:              Beneficiaries may not be motivated to invest in the
proposed Livestock Route Company and tubewell yields may
be inadequate at some locations. Both risks are
considered low in view of the success of self-help rural
water supplies in Sudan, and the careful analysis of
risk carried out at each wateryard site, and financial
provision made for test bores and supplementary
tubewells.

SUDAN
STOCK ROUTE PROJECT
I. Background
A. The Agricultural Sector
1.1       Sudan has a population of 19 million people, a massive land area
of 2.4 million km2, and rainfall varying from 1,500 mm per annum in the
Equatoria Province of the Southern Region1/ to 150 mm in the Northern
Region. The northern half of the country is arid and cultivation is only
made possible by irrigation from, and adjacent to, the river Nile.
The Southern Region has a high but also mostly unimodal rainfall. The
project area lies mostly between latitudes 10°N and 16°N where rainfall
declines northward from about 500 mm to 150 mm per year. In that area, the
country's main irrigation schemes extending to 4 million feddans (1.7
million hectares) lie adjacent to the White Nile, Blue Nile and Atbara
rivers in the east, and savannah extends westward to the Chad border.
Sudan's large-scale mechanized rainfed farming schemes occupy 6 million
feddans of heavy clay soils mainly in the eastern part of the savannah
belt.  Further west smallholders culivate about 20 million feddans of
rainfed land, much of it having sandy soils and therefore being more
amenable to hoe cultivation.
1.2       Agriculture, including livestock production, provides a
livelihood for 80% of the population accounting for 40% of GDP and 95% of
exports. The country's economic growth during the half century prior to
1975 was brought about largely by increasing cotton production, much of it
on land irrigated from the Nile rivers. In the late 1970s a disastrous
fall in cotton yields on irrigated schemes led to a crisis in foreign
earnings. While in 1970/71 the area under cotton was 1.2 million feddans
and the yield 4.3 kantars per feddan, in 1980/81, the area diminished to
just under 1 million feddans and the yield fell to 2.3 kantars per feddan.
During that decade of the 1970s cotton lint exported fell from 235,000 tons
to 100,000 tons due to poor maintenance and operation of the units
providing irrigation water, and to low margins to farmers for cotton
growing which resulted in poor crop husbandry. The emphasis the Sudan
Government and IDA have placed on restoration of irrigated cotton
production has now started to bring about better yields; lint produced in
1982/83 reaching about 189,000 tons.
1/ The area of Sudan which was known at the time of the Appraisal
Mission's visit to Sudan (March/April 1983) as Southern Region was
divided by Presidential proclamation in June 1983 into three regions to
be known as Bahl el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria Regions. This
report has continued to use the earlier nomenclature as relevant data
is available only under those headings at the time of report writing.



-2-
1.3       Only recently has the interdependence of livestock and crop
production in farming systems in the irrigatedl schemes and in sedentary
farming systems in rainfed areas been acknowledged. While Government
research, extension and administrative services for crops and livestock are
located in one Ministry, historically they have been carried out by
agriculturalists and veterinarians in separate hierarchies. These
professionals have had little training in commnon and little interaction at
the farm level. The result has been a bifurcation of effort and use of
resources which has not maximized total farm outputs or maintained land
fertility.
1.4       In the past, most Government budgetary and staffing allocations
have been devoted to the irrigated areas. Outside the Nile corridor, there
is a dearth of physical infrastructure, particularly the absence of
all-weather roads, and an unreliable railway service has presented
logistical problems for the supply of farm inputs and the marketing of
produce. The harshness of living conditions with few basic or social
services makes it difficult to recruit Government service personnel,
compounding the problems of implementing development activities. As a
result, market forces and private sector initiatives have been the main
engine of progress in recent years in all aspects of rainfed agriculture,
including traditional crop and livestock production and large-scale
mechanized crop farming.
1.5       Prior to the last decade, land use in the rainfed areas of
central Sudan involved a clear division between pastoralists who were
mostly nomadic, and sedentary cultivators. Pastoralists followed the rain
moving north and south to find water and pasture and to avoid parasite
infections. Cultivators used shifting cultivation with fallow periods of
about 15 years following three or four seasons cropping. These sytems
worked well enough until the human population built up, which it did in an
irregular pattern influenced by communications, water supplies, rainfall
and soils. The increased density of human population in some areas has led
recently to disputes over land and water rights between pastoralists and
cultivators where the latter have settled on migration routes. More
intensive cultivation of the sandy (qoz) soils with shorter fallows has
reduced fertility and produced a great deal of wind erosion of soils.
Sedentary cultivators have seen the higher cash returns and financial
independence achieved by pastoralists and now many own livestock even if
only small ruminants. The pastoralists also have changed as they have
found the need to grow some grain, a food they previously purchased. These
changes in both dominant farming systems towards mixed farming are logical
and desirable movements leading to more efficient land use but little is
known of how best they can be applied in Sudan. It seems clear that the
expansion of production in these traditional livestock and cropping
subsectors will be heavily dependent on resolving complex inter-related
technical and social factors including land ownership. To this end,
Government has set up, with donor assistance including that of IDA, the
Agricultural Research Project to work on integrated farming systems in
Darfur and Kordofan; and the Western Savannah Project to address land use
and resource development in South Darfur where population pressure is
causing acute land deterioration. The Southern Region Agricultural Project
is a multifacet approach to agricultural development in a region totally
deprived of services and trade for fifteen years because of civil unrest



- 3 -
from 1956 to 1972. This project has funding from IDA, IFAD, UK and West
Germany. It has attempted to strengthen the Regional Ministry of
Agriculture's capacity in area development planning and to increase
production2of coffee, cereals and livestock. To do so over an area of 0.5
million km with about 4 million people and 5 million cattle led to a
complex project design and heavy reliance on large numbers of expatriate
staff. The project has had very limited success. By contrast, the Stock
Route Project would have a single clearly defined main purpose, to provide
water and animal health services to ongoing trading operations. The
Livestock and Meat Marketing Corporation (LMMC), which would support
project implementation, was set up by Government in 1976 and has received
donor support from IDA and ODA since 1979 through the Livestock Marketing
Project. That project provides for purchase of rolling stock to transport
livestock by railway, a corporation headquarters building in Khartoum,
livestock handling yards at railway stations, related livestock markets and
institutional support. LMMC's performance is discussed in paras. 1.16 and
1.17.
B. The Livestock Subsector
1.6       Ruminant livestock is made up of about 16 million cattle, 2-1/2
million camels, 21 million sheep and 13 million goats.  While camel numbers
have not changed recently, cattle have increased by about 20%; and sheep
and goats, by about 30% in the last 10-12 years. The meat supply has thus
grown somewhat faster than the human population. An export surplus of
meat animals has been created which is currently allowing Sudan to export
annually about half a million live sheep and some beef. Domestic livestock
populations in the main producing rangelands of Western Sudan have built up
in recent years to now exceed optimal carrying capacity. Hence, future
livestock population increases would not lead to more out-turn of meat.
The foreseen increase in the human population of Sudan is, therefore, not
expected to be matched by increases in livestock numbers or meat marketed.
That trend would limit export of livestock before the end of the decade
unless human population growth declines or improving livestock husbandry
produces better offtake percentages or heavier carcasses. Currently,
commercial offtake is estimated to be about 10% of cattle numbers and 18%
of sheep and goats, producing about 250,000 MT of beef, 65,000 MT of mutton
and 35,000 MT of goat meat. About 3 million cows will calve each year and
yield on average about 300 liters of milk each in excess of calf
requirements. Together with minor production from goats, total annual milk
yields are estimated to be 1.3 million tons. Production of meat and milk
from the subsector is, therefore, worth LSd 1,750 million at current market
prices in Sudan.
1.7       Sudan has exported sheep to Saudi Arabia for many years.  This
trade has increased as the wealth of Saudi Arabia has enabled that country
to import increasing numbers of sheep over the last decade. With rapid
urbanization and population growth, Saudi Arabia is not expected to be able
to satisfy the rising demand for meat from domestic sources in the foresee-
able future due to its small animal population. The main exporters of
livestock to Saudi Arabia are Somalia and Australia. Sudan's current
recorded annual exports of upwards of half a million sheep are about



-4-
10-15%of the sheep imported into Saudi Arabia.. Sudan has exported cattle
for slaughter, and recently some chilled beef, to Egypt and other countries
in the Near East but the live cattle and beef exported has been much less
in volume and value than the sheep exports as shown in Table 1.

1.9       Live sheep exported during the year 1983/84 are about 16% less
than the record number of 626,000 exported in 1982/83. This fall has been
brought about by drought in the producing areas preventing sheep reaching
export weight and quality, and by a temporary ban on imports of Sudanese
sheep into Saudi Arabia until Sudan conformed with that country's new
veterinary certification requirements. This re,duction in foreign exchange
earned from sheep exports has been almost entirely offset by an increase of
140% in live cattle exports and higher prices. The earlier rise in numbers
of sheep exported from about 200,000 five years ago is believed to have
occurred because the export tax, then 25% of the export price, has been
progressively removed. The resulting increase in recorded exports was most
probably due both to an increase in actual numbers of sheep exported and to
some sheep previously smuggled overseas now moving through recorded trade.
Government's opinion is that there are still sevreral hundred thousand sheep
smuggled to Saudi Arabia by boat across the Red Sea. Trade is stimulated
by the parallel exchange rate which is currently US$1 = LSd 1.8. Recurrent
almported inputs used in the subsector are drugs and small quantities of
fuel for veterinary services and fuel to transport sheep from Khartoum to
Port Sudan amounting in all to about US$2 million per year. The recorded

net foreign exchange earnings of livestock during the three years, July
1980 to June 1983, totalled about US$170 million. The present distribution
of animals by province is shown in Table 2.

1.11      The Southern Region carries about 35% of the cattle population,
20% of the sheep and about 18 percent of the goats. Practically all
breeds of these species are indigenous to Sudan. The livestock breeds
found in the south are considerably smaller than those in the north
especially the sheep. The desert sheep of North Darfur and North Kordofan
are about twice the weight of the sheep found in the Southern Region. It
is the big desert sheep which is favored for the export trade. Sheep of
the breeds indigenous to the Middle East are worth about double the price,
pound for pound, of European breeds currently supplied from Australia in
the markets of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. The local breeds have a



- 6 -
different carcass structure to the European/Australian breeds. While the
carcass contains about the same percentage of fat, much of the fat is found
within the muscles in European breeds while it is mainly located outside
each muscle, much of it on the rump or tail, in Middle East indigenous
sheep. The result is quite differently flavored meat.
C. Government Livestock Services
1.12      Government services to the livestock industry all fall within the
purview of the Minister for Agriculture (Chart B, page 47).Until recently,
good progress was made in livestock epidemic disease control and in
reducing losses from endemic diseases. During the last five years due to
shrinking funds and hence lack of transportation, equipment and vaccines,
veterinary services have deteriorated and outbreaks of epidemic diseases
have increased. The epidemic diseases which cause heavy mortality are
rinderpest and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and both only
affect cattle amongst domestic stock. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is the
other serious epidemic disease and like trypanosomiasis, which is
transmitted by tsetse and other biting flies in the extreme south of the
project area, also affects mainly cattle. Anthrax, blackquarter,
haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) and tuberculosis are present but of less
economic importance. Pneumonia and internal parasites, the most frequent
diseases of sheep and goats, are of greatest concern in the wetter south of
the area. Rinderpest was probably eliminated from Northern Sudan after the
FAO J.P.15 campaign of the 1960s, but insecurity in Southern Sudan at that
time prevented more than a token implementation of the J.P. 15 program in
that region. The Veterinary administration in Juba had recently agreed
with the Southern Region Agricultural Project's management to rebuild, with
project help, its operating capacity district by district. Vaccinations
and treatments carried out in Northern Sudan in recent years are shown in
Table 3. About 1 million doses of rinderpest vaccine is sent from Khartoum
to Juba annually for use in Southern Sudan. However, the logistics being
even more difficult and communications less well developed than in Northern
Sudan, MOAI staff say they are unable to estimate what proportion of this
vaccine is effectively applied. Several minor rinderpest outbreaks
occurred in the project area in the late 1970s but vaccination work was
sufficient to prevent spread until 1981. The 1981 epidemic started in
South Kordofan and 29 outbreaks were confirmed as the disease spread
through North Kordofan into North Darfur and last year into South Darfur.
The disease is expected to abate in 1984 as the vaccination program over
the last 2-1/2 years has again created a high percentage of immune animals
in the population (see Table 3). As rinderpest is a disease of bovines,
outbreaks have not affected the most important sheep export trade, however,
exports of cattle and beef have been disrupted several times in recent
years including a four month ban on bovine exports during the 1982/83
fiscal year. Fatalities to CBPP are reported to be lower than a decade ago
but the status of this disease is not clear. FMD is enzootic throughout
eastern Africa and while mortality is small, the disease is a threat to
marketing, particularly overseas marketing, and causes serious debilitating
losses. While vaccine is used on commercial herds, in most traditional
situations the disease can only be limited at present by control of
movement of infected animals. Trypanosomiasis while precluding domestic



-7-
stock from parts of the southern region only affects those herds in the
project area which migrate south to the Bahr El-Arab in the dry season.
Tick-borne disease are significant but do not cause heavy mortality in
Sudan as the climate does not support the species of tick which transmits
East Coast Fever in the higher rainfall areas of eastern Africa further
south.

Following the rinderpest outbreak in 1981/82 about 6.3 million doses of
rinderpest vaccine was applied in 1982/83.
1.14      Government livestock services employ about 800 university
graduates, predominantly veterinarians, about 700 technicians and
veterinary assistants and about 3,000 support staff. About 100 graduates
are engaged in diagnostic and research work and most others in field work
with Regional Administrations. Research includes that carried out on
livestock production and nutrition at Wad Medani and other Government
stations. The Government livestock sector recurrent budget for 1983/84
provides LSd 8.06 million, of which LSd 5.27 million is personnel costs.
All graduating students at degree, diploma or certificate level are offered
Government employment. This policy is producing a miasma of bureaucracy,
decreasing individual remuneration and leading to an ever shrinking
proportion of recurrent total budgets being allocated for operations and
materials. Therefore, despite a swelling budget on livestock services
which GOS is progressively less able to meet, services are declining. This
situation has been evident in the last few years when outbreaks of epidemic
diseases have increased and drugs to treat such diseases as trypanosomiasis



-8-
have become scarcer. As the country depends on livestock exports for
foreign exchange earnings to an increasing extent, it is essential that
this trade is not threatened by the spread of livestock diseases. It is
timely therefore for government to review its whole input into the
livestock industry and to focus particularly on the costs and benefits of
its services. Livestock keepers are well able to pay for essential
services and give every indication of being willing to do so if the
services are effective and reliable. For instance, they have frequently
paid exhorbitant prices for trypanocidal drugs brought into the country
through irregular channels. The mission proposes that the Government
employ consultants specifically to review, together with the staff of the
MOA, its services to the livestock industry and recommend how these
services could be made more cost effective and add protection to export
earnings from livestock. The cost of these consultant services are
included in the Stock Route project. Funding for veterinary services under
the project are discussed in Chapter 4, paragraph 4.17.
The Livestock and Meat Marketing Corporation
1.15      In the early 1970s, Government saw the need to facilitate the
marketing of livestock and livestock products in order to ease the growing
grazing pressure on the overstocked rangelands, increase the volume of meat
into the growing urban and periurban markets in and around Khartoum,
Omdurman and Wad Medani and to allow a significant expansion in exports of
livestock and meat to provide much needed foreign exchange. Consequently
in 1976, the Government established LMMC to promote and regulate this
livestock trade. The Livetock Marketing Project (LMP, Cr. 782-SU), which
was appraised in 1977, was designed to support the building of LMMC as an
institution, create livestock marketing and transport infrastructure and
establish a cadre of trained professional staff to support marketing
services. Specifically the project made provision for purchase of
locomotives and livestock railway wagons to be used as whole train units to
transport livestock only, and described as block trains; the construction
of railway holding, transit and terminal yards at strategic locations along
the railway to facilitate collection, watering, feeding, inspection and
vaccination of livestock during traders' marketing operations; the
improvement or construction of markets along the marketing chain primarily
to help channel livestock into the railway faciLlities; and the construction
of a headquarter's building for the Corporation. In addition to local
operating funds during the six year life of the project, provision was made
for technical assistance and staff training. ]?roject cost was estimated
atUS$57.3 million including an IDA Credit of US$25 million. Additionally,
UK agreed to provide the equivalent of US$3.1 million for technical
assistance and training. The Credit became effective on July 9, 1979.
1.16      LMMC does not undertake any trading operations, its mandate being
to provide services to the trade for which it levies fees on livestock
passing through markets and additionally on livestock destined for export.
Except for headquarter construction, implementation of other project
components show delays of up to two years. These delays were brought about
firstly by the time taken, of almost a year from credit signing, to get the
project effective, secondly by the failure of the Sudan Railways
Corporation to complete construction of railway infrastructure, and thirdly
by the country's deteriorated economic situation affecting availability of



- 9 -
local investment funds, supplies and staff. Considering the effects of
these factors, the Livestock Marketing project has fared relatively well.
LMMC as an institution began to show effect in 1977/78 largely by advising
the government to stimulate exports by removing export quotas and
progressively reducing and finally removing export tax on animals. The
Corporation has generated its own operating funds since 1979 thus
offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of the general economic
situation. LMMC has constructed livestock holding grounds and railway
wagon loading facilities at Kadero Station and Port Sudan, to cope with the
increasing export volume, from funds generated by export fees. In total
during the five fiscal years 1978/79 to 1982/83, LMMC collected LSd 1.66
million in domestic marketing fees and just over LSD 3 million in export
fees. These figures reflect a shortfall in projections of domestic fees
due to delays in project investment in market infrastructure making
increases in market fees unwarranted. On the other hand, LMMC's export
market fees have made up the shortfall because of export numbers exceeding
projections. Project railway rolling stock began operating in November
1982 and so, that had no effect on export volume prior to 1982/83.
However, it would be unwarranted to conclude that Sudan's impressive
livestock marketing and export statistics during the last four years had
been achieved without any causal link to the Livestock Marketing Project.
First, the project has provided financing to establish LMMC and is largely
responsible for its standing as a policy-making body. As such, LMMC has
been instrumental in the reduction or abolition of export taxes. It is
also most improbable that the increased trade volume could have been
handled without LMMC's activities in the markets facilitating veterinary
control, making possible the orderly holding of large numbers of livestock
in Kadero Quarantine and Port Sudan, and generally contributing to the
smooth flow of the livestock trade. Since November 1982, a most promising
start has been made in livestock block train operations. By March 1984,
531,000 sheep and 22,000 other animals had been transported, including 60%
of the sheep exported being moved from Kadero to Port Sudan.
D. Project Formulation
Project Origins
1.17      Trekking livestock across central Sudan from the producer areas
in the west to markets in the east has been a traditional and convenient
method of marketing livestock for many years. The main traditional stock
route is from Nyala through En Nahud and El Obeid to Omdurman. Trekking
along that route, called in this report the "Northern Stock Route" (NSR) is
limited by climatic factors which control the availability of fodder and
water, so that the bulk of the animals are moved between August and
November. By December, surface water has dried and stock turn to borehole
supplies which are meant primarily for the sedentary population. Yields at
many waterywards are decreasing as a result of ageing equipment and traders
have difficulty in buying water for their stock. Certain sectors of the
NSR are deficient in supplies because the underlying geological formations
contain little water. In the general area of the NSR there are about 200
wateryards distributed in a 5-50 km wide zone between Nyala and Omdurman, a
distance of 950 km. Each wateryard has one or more deep wells which are
designed to produce about 75 1/min, sufficient to water about 1,800 cattle



- 10 -
equivalents per day. Because most of these wateryards have old,
deteriorated machinery and equipment, brought about partly by lack of
maintenance, they no longer provide an efficient chain of water points to
service animals trekked along this route.
1.18      The Government has been aware for some years that in addition to
improving livestock transport by railway, there is a real need to improve
the NSR so as to extend the period of the year when it could be used for
trekking of animals. Currently, the seasonality of supplies to Omdurman
results in sharp price fluctuations to the local consuming markets and for
export animals. This in turn depresses prices to producers at the
beginning of the wet season because animals are in relatively poor
condition, and have to be sold within a short period. Traders then
frequently have to recondition cattle after arrival in Omdurman by stall
feeding.
Project Design
1.19      In June 1981, an IFAD Identification Mission visited Sudan and
among the projects identified for IFAD funding was the Stock Route
Project. The project envisaged the provision of wateryards at regular
intervals along the NSR and other facilities, including transport and
communication equipment, housing, fodder sheds, stores and technical
assistance. Subsequently, IFAD requested the FAO Investment Centre to
mount a mission to examine the recommendations of the Identification
Mission and prepare the project. The Mission concluded that improvement of
that route, as proposed by the IFAD Identification Mission, is not
technically possible because the availability of adequate water supplies
along the route cannot be guaranteed, either from boreholes or hafirs
(surface reservoirs). Furthermore, the Mission was less than fully
confident that at present the volume of dry season trekking would justify
investment in many permanent facilities along the route. For that reason,
they designed an experimental project which would use hafirs to store water
along a route running parallel with the railway line where more fodder
would be available in the dry season. The investment would be about US$7
million, of which US$3 million would be for hafir construction and could be
justified on other grounds. The Mission also identified the need to
rehabilitate several existing dry wells and veterinary services along the
traditional route at an estimated cost of US$1 million. Those estimates
provide for establishment of the southern hafir route and its operation
over four years.
Design Improvements
1.20      In January 1982, IFAD requested IDA to include appraisal of the
project in its work program for calendar year 1982. In February 1982 the
State Minister of Agriculture in Khartoum expressed to IFAD and IDA his
Government's very negative reaction to the suggestion of developing a
southern hafir stock route as proposed by the Preparation Mission.
Government's position remained that adequate water could be provided on the
NSR and that the proposed southern route would lead to clashes between
sedentary farmers and livestock traders. Following discussion between IDA
and IFAD staff in Rome in March 1982, IDA proposed to IFAD a compromise
solution which could overcome both social and technical objections to



- 11 -
earlier proposals. IDA felt then that the southern route proposal has
considerable merit mainly because it would alleviate the environmental
burden and make possible additional fodder production along the trek. The
combined use of the two routes together with livestock block trains from
El Obeid would also reduce water storage requirements, make best use of
block trains where they can be most effective and obviate the need to
transport bulk feed for use on trek. In July 1982 IFAD informed IDA that
following further discussion in Khartoum, they had themselves concluded
that the southern route alone was not a possible development option and
asked IDA to undertake a preappraisal mission to Sudan in November 1982 to
re-examine the route location issue and put together a project for IFAD
funding acceptable to GOS which could be appraised mid-1983.
1.21      The preappraisal mission concluded that there is a sound
technical basis for a Stock Route Project with adequate economic benefits
foreseen, and that in general boreholes are to be preferred to hafirs
because of their reliability during droughts. That mission also suggested
that the development of a Dry Season Route (DRS) in the south to extend the
trekking season is justified. Extension of the trekking season on the NSR
is impracticable as the range along that route cannot feed trekked cattle
later than November or December. Moreover, based on available data, the
capital investment and running costs could be recovered within a 20-year
operational period if charges for water are budgeted and collected
efficiently. The preappraisal mission stated its main concerns were to
ensure that the organization appointed to build the stock route facilities
had adequate capacity to do so, that facilities once built would be
operated and maintained efficiently and provision made for their eventual
replacement when needed. The mission was conscious of the risk in locating
adequate groundwater along the suggested routes, and proposed a project
design to minimize that risk by including funding for exploratory
boreholes. They would enable best yield sites to be identified in each
location where underlying geological strata indicate above average risk in
locating water. Additionally, provision would be made for a second well at
each wateryard where the geology suggests yield from one well may be
inadequate for the requirements of that particular route. Furthermore, the
preappraisal mission was concerned that facilities to be built under the
project should be operated and maintained more efficiently than in the
past. Government and the mission addressed this problem during appraisal
and now propose that a private company, to be known as the Livestock Route
Company (LRC), would be formed. That company would purchase the assets
built under the project and would operate them as a commercial venture.
The financial implications associated with formation of the LRC and the
schedule under which it would assume responsibility for the project is
described in paragraph 4.15.

II. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Physical Features
2.1       The project area extends from the White Nile river to the western
border of Sudan between latitudes 10°-16°N and occupies part of an
extensive flat, peneplained land surface common to much of northeast
Africa. Ground elevations rise from about 380 m above sea level at
Omdurman to 570 m at El Obeid and 670 m at Nyala. The highest points are
peaks of inselbergs (jebels) in the Nuba mountains which exceed 1,400 m.
Drainage is related to the Nile system, the White Nile forming the eastern
boundary of the project area. Most drainage is ephemeral except in the
Nuba mountains and surface flow occurs only during the wettest part of the
rainy season between July and September. Surface flows in the Bahr El Arab
flood plain in the south last until December. Shallow pools form in
silt-lined depressions between sand dunes but these become dry within two
months after the rains. A lake at Er Rahad and two small birkas (ponds) 40
km further west are the only permanent water.
2.2       The soils in the project area are irelated to both climate and
geology. Wind-blown sand (qoz) covers most of the peneplain north of the
Nyala--Kosti railway and forms stabilized dunes with crests aligned
approximately north--south. Cracking clays, known as black cotton soils,
cover several areas in the Nuba mountains and also in patches dispersed
between dunes further west in the Baggara basin. Fine-grained soils
comprising grey, non-cracking silty clays occur in wadis and in shallow
pools formed between dunes.  Thin, reddish brown lateritic soils overlie
crystalline rocks of the Basement Complex in the Nuba mountains.
2.3       Most of the area is semi-arid grassland interspersed with acacia
scrub. Denudation of range vegetation is particularly evident NE of El
Obeid especially where stock routes converge on Omdurman. North of Bara, a
3-year drought has caused rapid deterioration of the range and advance
southward of the desert.
2.4       The climate is characteristic for the tropical steppe and
controlled by latitudinal movement of the inter-tropical convergence zone
(ITCZ) which moves northward during the northern hemisphere summer bringing
rain during the period June-September. Precipation is almost entirely
convective and falls with tropical storm intensity, resulting in high
run-off. Isohyets traverse roughly east-west across Sudan and the annual
rainfall increases from 200 mm in the northern part of the project area to
about 600 mm on the Bahr El-Arab. Records show there is considerable
variation in mean annual rainfall, the length of the rainy season and the
number of rainy days but the peak of the wet season is usually in August.
The mean annual temperature is 27°C with mean maxima exceeding 40°C in the
north and 36%C in the south. The lowest temperatures are during the
northern hemisphere winter, from December to February, when overnight
values fall below zero in the open steppe. Relative humidity ranges from a
minimum of 20% in the dry season to an average of 75% in the wet season.
Prevailing winds in the winter are from the north and from the southwest in
the summer. Average wind speeds are less than 8 km/hr but speeds exceed 30



- 13 -
km/hr during short periods in the winter months. Evapotranspiration rates
are highest during the winter and are about 2,500 mm per annum.
B. Farming Systems
2.5       The stock routes project will directly service Darfur Region,
Kordofan Region, and White Nile province of Central Region. That area
contains 50% of the cattle in the whole country, or 78% of the cattle in
the Northern Sudan. The area also holds 50% of the sheep and 55% of the
goats in Sudan. There is no data showing how many animals move from
Southern Region northwards to market but numbers must be considerable,
because groups of trade cattle of the White Dinka breed numbering 1,000 or
more are seen moving north through South Kordofan during the early dry
season. Project stock routes are expected to carry about 10 percent of
Southern Region's annual cattle offtake or 50,000 head. The project's
southern feeder routes would serve that trade and facilitate extension of
it into the dry season.
2.6       Most of the project area lies within the two climatic zones of
semi-desert and low rainfall woodland savannah. The semi-desert with a
rainfall of 75-300 mm has some widely scattered trees, and browse is an
important constituent of the diet for camels and goats. The spread of the
desert southward has seen the gradual replacement of the trees Dalbergia
nelanoxylon, Acacia Senegal (gum arabic) Leptadenia pyrotechnica and
Commiphora africana by shrubs, such as Boscia senegalensis, Calotropus
procera and, further north, Acacia nubica. Grasses are annuals, Panicum
turgidum, Cymbopogon proximis and Arastida plumosa being common. The very
palatable Blepharis species have mainly disappeared under high grazing
pressure. Vegetation in the low rainfall woodland savannah lying to the
south of the semi-desert zone varies to some extent depending on soils.
The sandy (qoz) soils carry much of the Acacia senegal from which gum
arabic is collected and exported with a current annual value of about US$45
million. Grasses dominating these soils are Aristida pallida, Eragrostis
tremula and Cenchris biflorus. On dry soils, Acacia meltifera and
Balanites aegyptiaca are in association with the annual grasses Cymbopogon
cerventus, Brachiaria obtusiflora and Sorghum purpareo. Acacia seyel is
another gum producing tree found on the dark cracking clays in the South.
Grasses growing on qoz soils are deficient in salt but some much favored
grazing is found where the qoz soils meet the clays. Grasses found in
these areas include Sporobolus marginatus, Digitaria, Brachiaria and
Chloris species.
2.7       During the last 20 years, the cultivated area of western Sudan
has increased significantly and probably trebled. This was partly as a
result of the creation of the mechanized farming schemes, partly from
nomads undertaking some cultivation in locations in which they wish to
establish home areas, and partly the result of population increase in the
sedentary cultivating people. The consequence of the expanded cultivation
has been the loss to livestock owners of some of their best grazing land
which has led to disputes particularly on migration routes. The
concentration of cultivation has lead to a sharp reduction in fallow
periods in traditional farming systems. The Kordofan Region now contains



- 14 -
about 3-1/2 million people; and the Darfur region, slightly less. Sedentary
farmers make up 60% of the rural population, transhumant agro-pastoralists
30% and true nomads about 10%. Livestock raising is practiced by all
segments of the rural population but transhiumants and nomads own some 60%
of cattle, 80% of sheep and goats and practically all the camels in Sudan.
In the project area, the main transhumants and nomads are drawn from
Arabic-speaking Islamic tribes of the Baggara people (which means cattle
keepers). These tribes migrate between the Babr-el-Arab river basin, where
they graze in the late dry season, and the southern fringes of north Darfur
and north Kordofan where they go during the rains. Some traditionally
sedentary tribes, the Nuba, Bediria and Fur contain a few transhumant
households. Some of the transhumant Southern Region tribes, especially the
Dinka and Nuer, move north into the lands vacated by the Baggara when the
latter move north at the start of the wet season in July. This can lead to
conflict but also to trade. Baggara households, which normally live in
groups of three to four in the south, band together into larger groups on
the northward trek. Although the main objective of migrating is adequate
grazing and to get away from tsetse and other biting flies, during the trek
livestock are sold in small market towns anel women sell milk in some
locations, such as Babanusa, to local cheese factories.
2.8       Frequently transhumant households are entrusted with livestock of
sedentary farmers in the southern provinces. These animals are taken on
the trek north where they are thought to benefit from the changes of
pasture. Production parameters of nomadic cattle are certainly much better
than those of sedentary cattle, and pastures grazed heavily and then rested
under a nomadic pattern of grazing are less adversely affected by heavy
grazing pressure than where grazing is continuous. After spending about
three months in the northern rangelands, and depending on supply of grass
and water, transhumant herders begin migrating south about October. During
the migrations some members of most households will go to their cultivation
plots along the route, plant sorghum or millet at the beginning of the
rains and return to harvest them in October or November. A few members of
the group will stay on the cultivation sites to weed the crops and ensure
that they are not lost to unattended livestock. Amongst transhumant groups
each household is led by a male head who manages the livestock and each
transhumant camp has a titular leader. Tribal councils regulate relations
with settled farmers with whom conflicts arise over water use and when
passing livestock damage growing crops. Regional and local governments
become involved where disputes become violent or when petitioned by the
weaker side. Sedentary farmers live mostly in the southern and central
zones of the project area. They are found in either clustered or dispersed
types of farming communities and generally are the poorest and least
productive of the rural population. Livestock are raised on a small scale
by sedentary farmers who favor sheep and goats but keep some cattle for
milk and donkeys for transport.
2.9       Among Islamic groups in the northern provinces, land and animal
holdings are passed from father to sons in equal shares. Society is
stratified by wealth and land tenure more defined. Arable land being
scarce is bought, sold and rented. Further south, cultivated land is more
abundant, there is wider variations in customary forms of inheritance and
land is held through usufructory rights. The settled farming communities
of western Sudan provide seasonal labor to the irrigated cropping areas in



- 15 -
eastern Sudan. In the southwest of the project area, communal work parties
from within communities are the main form of supplementary labor during
peak cropping activities, such as land clearing, weeding and harvesting.
C. Water Supplies
2.10      Currently, groundwater is abstracted mainly from acquifers
occuring in four sedimentary basins which underlie approximately 60 per
cent of the NSR and about 50 per cent of the DSR. Elsewhere, small
quantities of water are obtained from the crystalline rocks belonging to
the basement Complex, but generally exploitation has been restrained by the
uncertainties of finding water in impervious rocks. Most of the Project
area is covered by a mantle of recently deposited sediments comprising
principally qoz sand and subordinate silts and clays. The qoz sands
sometimes contain shallow acquifers but yields are insignificant.
2.11      There are two main water-bearing formations, the older Nubian
Sandstone Formation and the younger Umm Ruwaba Formation occurring in four
basins in the Project area which are designated from NE to SW, the
Sahara-Nile, Bara, Nahud and Baggara. The Nubian Sandstone contains the
best acquifers in Sudan with thicknesses up to 75 m and yields up to 1,500
l/m.  The saturated zones are usually between 75 - 120 m deep except in the
SW around Ed Da'ein where they are 400 m or more.  The Umm Ruwaba Formation
occurs in the Bara basin and also in the Baggara basin where it forms a
relatively thin succession up to 200 m total thickness overlying the Nubian
Sandstone Formation. The top of the saturated zone is between 75 - 130 m
deep and acquifers are less productive than those in the Nubian, due to a
higher clay content. Nevertheless, yields are generally about 70 - 80
1/min except near the margins of the basins where zones are incompletely
saturated. Certain areas of the Bara basin do not contain acquifers due to
the absence of porous strata and these are known from previous drilling
experience.
2.12      There are more than 600 wells in the Project area, most
abstracting from sedimentary formations and although many currently yield
less than their designed production due to ageing equipment, the average
yield per well is between 70 - 100 1/m. Most wells are equipped with
diesel-operated reciprocating lift pumps which have a long record of proven
reliability in Sudan. Thus, the development of additional supplies in
those areas underlain by sedimentary formations does not create any
foreseen problems in the implementation of the Project.
2.13      Prospecting for groundwater in the Basement Complex was regarded
as ineffectual until, in recent years, UNICEF undertook a successful
program to develop village water supplies using narrow diameter wells.
About half the number of holes drilled are successful and although yields
are relatively low, these indicate that groundwater can be located and
developed in Basement Complex areas. Success is higher in the Nuba
mountains area where the rainfall is higher and the depth of weathering
somewhat greater than further north. On the DSR, 15 wateryards are
situated on Basement Complex in areas where conservation of surface
supplies have been shown to be impracticable, mostly on the northern



- 16 -
periphery of the Nuba mountains. The successes indicated by UNICEF as well
as preappraisal study data show that development of groundwater is feasible
provided adequate preliminary geological evaluation is done to select
optimum sites for drilling. Risks would also be reduced by sinking up to 4
test bores to identify water-bearing zones before production wells are
drilled and planning two production wells at each wateryard. Wells in
Basement Complex would usually be larger in diameter than those in
sediments but rarely exceed 60 m in depth so that the construction of two
wells per wateryard could be done for the saute overall cost as a single
deeper well abstracting from sediments.
2.14      There are no groundwater prospects at two of the proposed
wateryard sites in the Nuba mountains but conditions are suitable for the
construction of reservoirs (hafirs) to conserve rainfall. Groundwater will
be exploited at all other wateryards but in the unlikely event of failure,
recourse will be made to conserving surface runoff. Only three wateryards
are located on Basement Complex on the NSR and should failure occur there,
plastic lined impoundments would be constructed close to wadis. The
exploitation of subsurface groundwater in Basement Complex is regarded as a
practicable solution to the problem of providing stockwater particularly on
the DSR where the range is currently underutilized and the risks have been
assessed and are acceptable.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.1       The proposed project would support ithe government's policy of
stimulating meat production from the traditional sector to meet the needs
of a growing urban population and a ready export market. The present high
net foreign exchange earnings from export of animals and animal products
could be threatened in the medium term by the domestic demand generated by
a growing human population in Sudan. The aim of the project to minimize
trekking losses and maintain the growth in export volume will therefore
become of increasing importance with the passage of time. The project also
aims to provide some balance in regional deve]lopment as it will assist
those regions of Western and Southern Sudan less well endowed than those
having irrigated developments. Government has been obliged by economic
necessity to place development emphasis in the irrigated and mechanized
farming sectors in recent years in an attempt to boast yields of export
crops and grain. Kordofan and Darfur are rairifed regions which have become
of particular concern as population growth has increased pressure on land.
Sedentary farming rotations have been foreshortened by reducing fallow
periods resulting in severe wind erosion on sandy soils. Nomadic or
transhumant people are increasingly growing some grain, and sedentary
farmers carrying a few animals. The income from periodic sale of livestock
is the only source of funds for subsistence farmers to invest in crop
inputs, and in good husbandry practices to protect soils. In those areas,
the value of livestock is almost entirely dependent on there being a market
in the east, without which livestock would be worth very little. Animals
trekked to market along the existing and propcsed routes would be drawn



- 17 -
from a wide spectrum of farming systems in which producer incomes vary
between about US$100 and 200 per capita. While incomes of sedentary
farmers without livestock would be lower than those with livestock, the
project would nevertheless support development in a part of Sudan which has
not received much attention and where average incomes are well below those
in other parts of the country. The project is expected to generate a
positive return to investment and livestock traders and producers would be
strongly motivated towards efficient project facility operation and
maintenance.
3.2       In order to meet these objectives, the project would provide:
-    Stock drinking water for sale to livestock traders who trek
animals from the main livestock producing areas of western and
southern Sudan to the consuming areas in the Central Region and
for export.
-    Water for sale to people who live close to wateryards on the
livestock routes, or transhumants passing through those locations
on seasonal migrations, when the supply of water exceeds the
needs of livestock traders. Traders requirements for water will
be seasonal and tubewells and well head equipment will be best
maintained by extending their use over as much of the year as
possible even if only to supply low volumes of water.
-    Veterinary services along stock routes to vaccinate, screen,
quarantine and authorize movement of trade animals so as to
minimize impediments to trade caused by livestock epidemic
diseases and to reduce the risk of infectious disease being
present in exported animals. The vast majority of exports from
the livestock subsector are as live animals.
-    A botanical monitoring service along both existing and proposed
routes to permit judgments when best to switch the use of routes
during each year, to determine the status and trend of range
condition along the routes, and to initiate remedial action if
and when necessary.
B. Components
3.3       The project would be implemented over four years with the
following components:
3.4       Wateryards (LSd 18.5 M).  About 59 wateryards with about 83
tubewells would be constructed on two main and two feeder stock routes
which extend over a total distance of about 2,000 km. Twenty-four
wateryards would each be supplied by two tubewells and 35 wateryrds by one
tubewell. Wateryards would be equipped with water storage tanks and
selling facilities. The project would also provide housing for staff,
vehicles for delivery of supplies (fuel and spares) and radio equipment.
3.5       Veterinary Services (LSd 2.5 M).  Office buildings and housing
for staff would be provided by the project. To facilitate proper



- 18 -
services to be rendered at the Veterinary Centers, refrigerators for drugs
and specimens and four-wheel drive vehicles have been included. In the
first year of the project, initial vaccines would be provided and
subsequently, a revolving fund to replenish used up drugs would be
established from initial drug sales.
3.6       Project Administration (LSd 8.3 M),.  A project office and store
would be constructed at El Obeid as well as housing for incremental project
staff other than locally recruited personnel from El Obeid. Vehicles would
be provided to enable staff to supervise construction, operation and
maintenance of facilities and for purposes of range monitoring. Remote
sensing equipment for the project would be used to identify best locations
for well drilling sites. The project would also finance salaries and wages
for incremental staff which include the Project Director, senior technical
staff and general administrative personnel.
3.7       Technical Assistance (LSd 3.2 M).
(a)  Resident Staff:   An internationally recruited
Chief Hydrogeologist would be resident in Sudan for 24 man-months to advise
the Project Director on project start-up, assist project staff to plan
their work programs and, together with project range management staff,
identify drilling sites ahead of the main drilling contractor. An
internationally recruited Chief Engineer would be resident on the project
for 26 man-months to assist project staff to prepare, award, supervise and
make periodic payments for three construction contracts for offices,
stores, housing and stock handling facilties to be built along the stock
routes in Darfur, Kordofan and Central Region, respectively.
(b) Consultants: Provision is made for six man-months of
consultant time to prepare specifications, bidding documents and draft
contract for the stock route water supply contract. A consultant firm
would also be employed as Supervising Engineers for the water supply
contract. They would approve the quality and type of all materials and
equipment supplied, approve all installations, measure depth of wells
drilled and materials used, certify claims for payment under the contract
and issue contract variation orders if necessary. Provision is made for 42
man-months of work by the supervising engineers. Short-term consultants
would assist LRC for two man-months in each of the first four years of the
project for project monitoring and evaluation. These consultants would
design technical programs to assess botanical changes along the stock
routes and interpret their significance. Provision is made for 12
man-months for short-term consultants to review Government livestock
services and advise the Government on how it can improve the value of its
input to the livestock industry, and ensure that animal disease control
programs effectively protect Sudan's livestock export trade. In total, 68
man-months of internationally recruited consultant time would be provided.
A Sudanese consultant firm would provide two site engineers and three site
clerks of works to assist supervision of the three civil works contracts
which would be running simultaneously at a total of about 60 sites over the
three provinces. Provision is made for 72 man-months of local consultant
time.



- 19 -
3.8        Training (LSd 0.1 M).  A company secretary would be trained in
corporate administration. A Sudanese with a degree in accountancy would go
overseas for a further year's training in company administration. Water
pump and engine mechanics to operate project facilities would attend the
NWA training school in Khartoum. The NWA Training School provides
three-month and twelve-month courses for water, pump operators and engine
mechanics, respectively. The machinery to be purchased and operated under
the project would be of the same type as that which has been used and
proven successful in rural areas in Sudan for the last twenty years. The
training courses conducted by NWA adequately meet the needs of project
staff to be located at wateryard sites. The other professional expertise
which would be used in the project would be in hydrogeology and veterinary
services. As training in these disciplines is undertaken on a national
basis both at degree and diploma level and as there are more professionals
trained than can find gainful employment, it would not be appropriate for
the project to sponsor further training of this kind.
3.9        Details of items to be financed by the project' under each
component are presented in Annex II, Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5.
C. Cost and Financing
3.10       Project costs are estimated to be LSd 32.7 million (US$19.6
million) of which about LSd 18.6 million (US$11.2 million) or 57% represent
foreign exchange equivalent. Detailed cost estimates are summarized below.

similar facilities in remote areas of Sudan. Physical contingencies vary
between 5 and 20% depending on the type of expenditure and remoteness of
the location and amount to LSd 2.3 million (US$1.7 million). Price
contingencies account for about 18.5% of total baseline cost in U.S.
dollars. Assumed inflation rates for imported items, locally procured
materials and labor are shown in Annex VII, Table 2. Duties and taxes for
imported goods and services are estimated to amount to LSd 5.8 million
(US$3.5 million) or 17.8% of the project cost.
Financing
3.11      Under joint financing arrangements, IFAD would contribute a loan
of US$6.0 million and IDA, a credit of US$5.5 million. The IFAD loan would
be to the Government at 1% interest with 50 year repayment, including 10
year grace period. The Government would provide the equivalent in local
currency of US$8.1 million, including taxes and duties of US$3.5 million,
making a net Government contribution of US$4.6 million. The Government
would make available as a grant to the LRC the cost of technical assistance
and training in the project to the value of US$2.0 million. Government
would register a company, the Livestock Route Company (LRC), which would
own project assets, and in which livestock traders and producers would over
time purchase 80% of the equity. The Government would make available to
LRC project funds of LSd 15.7 million. The first LSd 5.0 million of these
funds to be used by the project would be Government's equity investment in
LRC. The balance of these funds (LSd 10.7 million) would be a loan from
the Government to LRC. This loan, the terms and conditions of which would
be laid down in the subsidiary agreement between the Government and LRC,
would be for up to 15 years, including a grace period of five years (the
principal being repayable from years six to fiEteen). Annual loan service
charges would be payable, calculated as 16% of the outstanding loan
balance. Inflation rates over the period 1980/82 increased substantiallly
to an average of 26% but are estimated to decline over the period 1984/86,
coming down to 15% in 1987. Therefore, while the proposed services charges
are not positive in the early years of the project, they are expected to be
positive after 1987. LRC would not incur any 'Liability for taxes and
duties on project related import costs incurred before January 1, 1990.
Signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and LRC
acceptable to the Association, and fulfillment of conditions precedent to
the effectiveness of the IFAD loan agreement including appointment of the
Association as cooperating institution to administer the loan would be
conditions of credit effectiveness.
D. Procurement
3.12      Recent experience in IDA projects with construction of water
supply facilities and civil works in the rural areas of Western Sudan
suggests that development of tubewells and wateryards would be successful
and completed within a given time period only if undertaken by a firm with
experience in operations in remote areas and with adequate financial and
technical capacity. Also close supervision of remote area work is
necessary to maintain quality and tempo. The project would construct about
83 new tubewells at 59 wateryards. The wateryaLrds would be equipped with



- 21 -
storage tanks and facilities to sell water to area residents and livestock
traders. The National Water Authority (NWA) already has work commitments
beyond its capacity in developing and maintaining both rural and urban
water supplies for the population of Western Sudan. A single water supply
contract is proposed, which is estimated to cost equivalent of about US$7.5
million to be awarded following tendering using ICB procedures in
accordance with World Bank Guidelines. The contractor would:
(a)  supply tubewell casing and screen, pumps, engines, drilling and
packing materials and materials to construct head works, water
storage tanks, livestock water troughs, standpipes, pipe
connections and fittings;
(b) drill wells and install all equipment and structures;
(c) test and commission each well and wateryard.
Firms would be prequalified before being invited to tender. To enable work
on this contract to start at the beginning of the dry season about
September 1985, it would be necessary to engage consultants prior to
negotiations to design the structures and prepare specifications and tender
documents for the water supply contract to be ready about December 1984. A
firm of consulting engineers would be appointed to supervise the water
supply contract. The firm would inspect and certify quality of work,
equipment and materials installed. The contract would provide for payment
by depth of tubewells, and length of pipe connections between well heads
and wateryards. The firm would inspect and certify these depths and
quantities.
3.13      Civil works to be done under the project would include the
building of a project office/stores and staff housing at El Obeid, staff
housing at each of 59 water yards and at 18 veterinary vaccination posts,
and a livestock yard and crush at each vaccination post. These structures
would be the same design as those being erected by the Western Savannah
Project at Nyala and at field stations in Darfur and would be sited by
project staff. The work would be contracted under local competitive
bidding procedures of the Ministry of Construction and Public Works (MCPW)
which have been used to award contracts for market construction in the
Livestock Marketing Project and found satisfactory. Additionally, firms
would be prequalified. These procedures allow participation by
non-Sudanese firms in joint ventures with Sudanese firms. Local firm
participation either alone or in joint venture is considered necessary
because of the location of the work and the need for liaison at field
level. Prequalified firms would be invited to bid for the work in one, two
or all three Regions. These works are estimated to cost in total about LSd
6.6 million.
3.14      Vehicles would be procured under ICB.  Equipment other than that
supplied under the water supply contract would be purchased in small
numbers of units inappropriate for ICB. This equipment would be procured
under Limited International Tendering procedures for contracts estimated to
cost less than US$200,000 equivalent each, or by prudent local shopping for
contracts for goods estimated to cost less than US$20,0000 equivalent. ICB
procedures would encompass about 65% of the goods and works to be procured
under the project, LCB about 29%. In the case of the water supply
contract, qualifying domestic contractors would receive a preference in bid
evaluation of 15% or the import duty, whichever is lower.

3.15      Procurement documents for the water supply contract, the civil
works contract(s) and the supply of vehicles contract would be reviewed by
IFAD and the Association prior to their being issued. Advertisements for
expressions of interest by contractors, pre-qualification questionnaires,
invitations to bid including draft contracts, bid evaluations and proposals
for contract awards, and major contract modifications would be the
documents requiring such prior review.

The selection of international recruited staff and consultants would be
made in accordance with World Bank Guidelines, and the consultants selected
would be acceptable to IFAD/IDA.
E. Disbursements
3.17      Disbursements would be made to meet 100% of the foreign exchange
costs to construct and equip tubewells, wateryards, project housing and
other buildings, overseas costs incurred by contractors to purchase and
position construction equipment and personnel, and foreign exchange costs
to purchase vehicles and veterinary equipment for the LRC. Disbursements
would also meet both foreign and local costs of technical assistance and
training and a study of the borrowers livestock services. IFAD and IDA
funds would be disbursed to meet each withdrawal in proportion to their
respective contributions to the project of 52:48. Disbursements would be
fully documented.
3.18       World Bank disbursement profiles covering ten years lending
(1971-81) indicate average disbursement periods of seven years for
Bank-wide agricultural credit projects, and over eight years for
agricultural projects in East Africa. The shorter disbursement period
assumed for the proposed Project is considered justified because: (1) the
main investments would be made under two, or at most four, construction
contracts; (ii) it is necessary to complete all the construction to fully
utilize any of the project facilities. The project has therefore been
designed to enable construction to be completed rapidly; (iii) technical
assistance, both expatriate and local, has been provided to help ensure
that the remote area developments are built rapidly and to acceptable
standards; (iv) the participation in project management by the users of the
facilities to be built will hasten facility completion.

F. Accounts and Audit
3.19      LRC would establish and maintain its accounts in accordance with
sound and generally recognized accounting principles and practices
satisfactory to IFAD/IDA. The LMMC Chief Accountant would act as financial
adviser to LRC. In addition, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that LRC's annual accounts would be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to IFAD/IDA and forwarded with the Auditor's Report to IFAD and
IDA not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year during the
life of the project. Following the end of each fiscal year since 1979,
LMMC's annual accounts have been ready for audit within four months.
Audits have been delayed by the Auditor General's office having an
excessive work load. Audit reports due six months after the close of the
fiscal year have been 4-7 months late, but have been received regularly.
In an attempt to overcome this delay, LMMC appointed independent commercial
auditors during 1983.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Development of Water Supplies
4.01      The locations of wateryards and hafirs which are proposed for
development under the project are shown on the maps attached to this
report. Project staff would determine the precise locations of well
drilling sites in the early stages of project implementation as each site
would require geological and environmental evaluation after consulting
villagers concerning local community rights. New wateryards would be
situated at a distance from existing facilities to avoid congestion. The
project would not rehabilitate existing deep wells as recent experience by
the National Water Authority (NWA) has shown rehabilitation to be
uneconomic and technically difficult. Wateryard locations have been chosen
on traders' recommendations and the majority were examined in the field at
preappraisal, others being assessed as technically feasible from available
data. Under the Unregistered Land Act of 1970, all land in the Project
area except urban sites is Government owned. Route locations and wateryard
sites to be developed under the Project would avoid any private urban
land. Regional Governments would allocate land for each wateryard site
before construction is started on that site. As the wateryard development
contractor would start field drilling operations about October 1985,
project technical staff would begin site idenification in April 1985.
4.02      A technical risk analysis has been compiled for each proposed
deep well location by assessing all available geological data and
hydrogeological records of the nearest existing wells, and where no wells
exist, on field observation at preappraisal or interpretation of geological
maps. These analyses are shown in Annex VIII. Sites are classified as
low, medium or high risk. Low risk are in areas of established groundwater
regimes in sedimentary basins where yields are about 75 1/m or higher. One
production well would be required at each location. Medium risk are in
areas of established groundwater regime in sedimentary basins but where
aquifers are known to be inconsistent; this group is subdivided into sites
which require several test bores to determine the position and thickness of
aquifers and sites where one test bore would give the necessary
information. One or two production wells would be sunk depending on
acquifer characteristics. High risk are in areas of relatively unknown
groundwater regime on Basement Complex or sedimentary basins where yields
are consistently less than about 75 1/m. Each site would require up to
four test bores and two production wells. The cost of a test bore is small
so that even if 50 percent additional test bores are required to locate
satisfactory production sites, the additional cost would only be 6 percent
of the cost of the water yard component.
Northern Stock Route
4.03      Watering facilities on the NSR would be improved by the
construction of 35 new water yards spaced at intervals between Nyala and
Omdurman and would be supplied from 41 new deep wells. A total of 18 water
yard sites on the NSR are classified as low risk. However, there is always



- 26 -
a possibility of unexpected failure even in the most assured circumstance
and it is important that full and accurate geological records are made of
every borehole, test holes as well as production wells. Records are of
vital importance, not only to decide the feasibility of drilling another
well following failure but also when future maintenance is required.
Eleven locations on the NSR are in areas of medium risk, of which four
would probably require two test bores and the remainder, one bore.
4.04      There are six sites on the NSR classified as high risk, three
underlain by Basement Complex and the others in sedimentary basins where
there is high probability of unsaturated zones. Existing wells in Basement
at Abu Haraz are located on a fault in the wadi and additional wells would
be sunk on the same fault. The proposed wateryard between Abu Rai and En
Nahud lies in an area of Basement Complex covered by qoz and test bores
would be sunk to locate faults predicted by earlier geophysical surveys.
There are no existing boreholes near Umm Kardos, E of Nyala and drill sites
would be chosen by careful evaluation of the geology and geomorphology.
The remaining sites are in areas underlain by sedimentary formations where
yields in nearby wells are less than 75 1/m.  At Umm Sidr, sedimentary
strata contain fewer aquifers as a result of attenuation against a Basement
high and the other sites, at Abu Shok and Gagomi are near the margin of
sedimentary basins where there is a risk of unsaturated zones. Wateryards
at high risk sites would be equipped with two production wells each unless
test bores reveal high actual yields. The estimated total production
drilling required on the NSR is about 8,200 m and about 1,200 m of screen
would be required.
4.05      In the unlikely event of failure to locate subsurface water on
the NSR where stock routes converge towards Omdurman, alternative methods
of providing stock water would be required. Conservation of surface runoff
is limited to areas of suitable topography and soils. The predominantly
sandy soils of the NSR would not retain water so bentonite-lined hafirs
would be used experimentally. The worst foreseen situation is that three
or four lined hafirs would be needed. Plastic-lined hafirs or brick tanks
would be expensive but as the numbers would be small, they could be used at
an estimated additional cost of LSd 30,000 per wateryard.
Dry Season and Feeder Routes
4.06      The DSR which includes feeder routes from Kadugli and El Abbasiya
would be developed by construction of 24 new wateryards supplied from 42
deep wells. There are 9 sites designated medium risk where test bores
would be sunk to check the depth and characteristics of aquifers in
sedimentary strata prior to sinking production wells. Six sites would
probably require only one production well to yield 75 1/m but three would
require two wells to give the same quantity. All medium risk sites are in
areas where current yields of existing wells are less than 75 1/m and low
yields at Abu Rukba are caused probably by unsaturated or thin aquifers
against a Basement high. Izz el Din is situated near the edge of the
Gimala high identified from gravity surveys and Makheita is on the edge of
the Bara Basin where there is a possibility of intercepting unproductive
aquifers.



- 27 -
4.07      There are 15 high risk sites on the DSR and feeder routes.  Six
locations between Kutna and Aloba south of the railway between Babanusa and
Rahad are on part of the DSR and underlain by Basement Complex where
careful geological evaluation would be required to select potential water
bearing locations. Up to four test holes would be used to find water and
each water yard would be supplied from two production wells. Nine water
yards are required on feeder routes from Kadugli and El Abbasiya and these
are situated on the northern margin of an extensive area of Basement
Complex forming the Nuba mountains. The depth of weathering is somewhat
greater than further north and groundwater would be abstracted mostly from
the weathered zone. It would be necessasry to sink test bores following
evaluation of the geology but not all locations would require four test
holes and savings on test bores here would be utilized in areas which prove
unexpectedly difficult. Water yards on feeder routes would also require
two production wells at each location. A total of 30 production wells
would therefore supply these 15 water yards and involve up to 60 test bores
to locate water.
4.08      The total meterage of drilling in all production wells on the DSR
is estimated to be about 4,240 m and about 950 m of screen would be
installed. Provision would be made to drill 103 test bores to be sunk at
high and medium risk sites on both stock routes.
4.09      Unfavorable hydrogeology at two locations on the feeder routes
from Kadugli and El Abbasiya prevents exploitation of groundwater, and
supplies would be obtained from surface storage. Two hafirs would be
constructed, one at Abu Dom, and the other on the provincial border between
North and South Kordofan, north of Abu Kashola. Existing hafirs at both
localities have insufficient storage to support the extra demand from trade
animals. The design and construction of hafirs would be undertaken by the
National Administration for Water, the only resident organization which has
the ability to undertake this work. The cost of constructing a hafir on
clay soil with no lining and of 30,000 m3 capacity is approximately the
same as sinking the average deep well. The design would include a
subterranean conduit to one or two masonry-lined wells from which
stockwater would be hand drawn and tanks and pumps would not be required.
All water channels would be covered to prevent damage. Hafirs would be
subdivided where possible and would have installed capacity to pump water
from one compartment to another. This design would enable the water
surface and hence evaporation to be reduced as stored water volume is
consumed.
Drilling Technique and Well Design
4.10      Accurate drilling records, precise depths of aquifers and
particle size measurements of acquifer material would enable final well
designs to be more effective. Wells would be sand-packed with materials of
optimum size and integrated with screens of the correct opening, and wells
would be pumped continuously for a set period until all drilling fluid and
fines are removed. Continuous slotted stainless screen is the most
effective filter in Sudan and screens would be telescoped inside permanent
casing to facilitate easy withdrawal during maintenance. A pump test would
be undertaken following development of each borehole to determine yield and



- 28 -
drawdown and tests would be made to determine plumb and alignment. Screens
would be used in all wells. Rotary mud-flush systems would be used for
drilling sedimentary formations and down-the-hole air hammer rigs for
Basement Complex. Standard well design for wateryards in Sudan calls for
6-5/6" OD steel casing, API grade J-55, 25 lb/ft or equivalent. Larger
diameter permanent casing and pumps would be required in low-yield
production wells, mainly in Basement Complex. Well head equipment would
comprise an 8 HP diesel-powered engine driving a reciprocating beam lift
pump adjusted for depth of well, static water level and drawdown
characteristics obtained from pump tests. This equipment is simple to
operate and maintain and has a long record oi- proven reliability in Sudan.
The design of engine/pump foundations would i'nclude features to withstand
the vibration inherent in this equipment, especially where installations
are on unconsolidated sand. Multi-V-belt drives are better than flat belts
and the distance between engine and pump wouLd be adjusted to give optimum
power transmission. All well-head equipment would be erected with
precision to ensure a long trouble-free operation. Water-cooled engines
would be used in preference to air-cooled as the latter are unreliable in
the dusty, hot environment in Sudan. Elevated head tanks are considered
unnecessary and reservoirs would be erected Eat ground level. Circular
galvanized tanks of about 60,000 liters capacity would be erected on
concrete bases.
Remote Sensing
4.11      Aerial photography and satellite imagery would be used in
selecting drill sites on Basement Complex. Most of the project area has
full stereoscopic cover flown since 1950 and negatives are kept by the
Survey Department, Khartoum. Since it takes about three months to print
the negatives, orders would be placed six months before the project is
foreseen to start. A map showing the areas for which prints are required
has been prepared. Satellite imagery is also subject to delays in
acquisition and orders would be placed six months ahead of project
implementation. Careful selection of scenes is necessary as some coverage
is poor quality.
4.12      In the unlikely event of a failure to locate groundwater mainly
in qoz-covered areas of Basement Complex on the NSR, geophysical methods
would be undertaken as a last resort in locations where geological methods
are unsuccessful. However, any surveys would be undertaken only when
ground conditions enable proper depth of penetration, normally during a
short period after the rains. The National Administration for Water and
the Geology Department, University of Khartoum, have suitable equipment to
conduct resistivity surveys which, it is foreseen, would be necessary at a
very small number of sites.
4.13      A radio communication network would be established by using high
frequency sets for long distance messages and VHF for local communication.
Some water yards and vaccination centers would have radio links with
headquarters to facilitate the supply of spares and vaccines and to monitor
the movement of trade animals, enabling water yards to have advance notice
of demand for water. Short distance VHF sets would be used by vaccination
and maintenance teams to liaise with their base stations.

B. Organization and Management
4.14      LMMC has been closely involved with the evolution and design of
the Stock Route Project and has the administrative capacity to add to its
present responsibilities. Government would cause LMMC to carry out the
nascent phase of the project and to enter into an agreement spelling out
support arrangements which LMMC would provide to LRC. LMMC had appointed
consultants to prepare specifications for the main water supply contract
prior to negotiations. LRC would be registered under the Sudan 1925
Companies Ordinance and the persons to be appointed as Chairman of LRC's
Board of Directors and Managing Director would be agreed with IFAD and IDA
prior to the presentation of the project to the Board of the Association.
Agreement was reached at negotiations that the initial Board of Directors
of LRC would include one representative each from the Livestock and Meat
Marketing Corporation (LMMC); the Animal Production Public Corporation
(APPC); the Ministry of Agriculture (Animal Resources); the Ministry of
Agriculture (Range Management); the National Water Corporation (NWC); the
Ministry of Finance ad Economic Planning (MOFEP), Planning; the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning, Finance; a non-Government representative of
the livestock traders; and a non-Government representative of the livestock
producers. The composition of the Board would be adjusted from time to
time to reflect changes in the composition of the LRC's shareholders.
4.15      Eighty percent of the Government's equity holding in LRC would be
offered for sale to livestock traders and producers by July 1, 1989, at
prices to be determined by valuation by LRC prior to share offerings.
Traders as a group would be able to buy up to 45% and any one individual up
to 3% of company shares. Producers as a group would be able to buy up to
35% and any one individual up to 1% of company shares. The Government
would retain 20% of LRC shares. The shares would not be traded in a free
market as the LRC would be registered as a private company. Shareholders
who wish to liquidate their holdings could sell their shares to other
shareholders in the LRC, including Government, at valuation obtaining at
that time. Traders would be given the opportunity to accumulate funds to
purchase shares by paying additional amounts to normal water charges on
stock using project routes. Similarly, producers could accumulate share
purchase funds by making additional payments in connection with LMMC
marketing fees enabling them to mobilize funds sufficient to purchase LRC
shares individually or as a group. Traders and producers would decide
individually if they wished to participate in share accounts and they would
be under no obligation to do so. The proceeds of each individual's share
account would be used to buy shares when they are offered annually. The
project would assist producers within sub-tribal groups or district
associations to form legal entities to buy and hold shares in the LRC.
Proposed share account savings rate for traders for stock using project
stock routes would be LSd 5 per head of cattle and LSd 1 per head of sheep,
and for producers for stock traded through LMMC markets LSd 2 and LSd 0.4
for cattle and sheep, respectively. At a mid term review to be conducted
by Government, IFAD and IDA during the third year of project implementa-
tion, in addition to considering physical achievements under the project,
the adequacy of LRC's corporate structure to achieve the aims of the



- 30 -
project would be evaluated. In particular, the review would consider if
LRC as a private company, which is limited to not more than 50 shareholders
but retains the right to restrict shareholding (in this case to livestock
traders, producers and Government), or alternatively a public company
without such restrictions, would then appear to be the more appropriate
instrument.
4.16      The LRC would have its own veterinary staff who would operate on
the stock routes from the Company's headquarters in El Obeid. The Company
veterinary staff would work in close liaison with veterinarians in Regional
and National Ministries of Agriculture but, being autonomous, would devote
all their time to animal health in trade stock. They would not be a cost
to the Government nor would their equipment and materials, but they would
use vaccines provided from the central laboratory at Soba and charge for
them at the usual Government rates which realistically cover costs of
preparation and administration.
4.17      The Chief Hydrogeologist of LRC would have primary responsibility
for location of drilling sites and would commence work three months before
the foreseen start of the water supply contract to identify the locations
of test bores and wateryards in consort with project range management
staff. The 'Chief Engineer would locate project housing, offices and
stores.  He would prepare tender documents including proforma contracts and
assist in bid evaluation. In supervising the civil works contracts, he
would be assisted by two site engineers and three clerks of works.
4.18      The Supervising Engineers would measure and certify work done
under the drilling and construction contracts. They would also inspect
all permanent materials and equipment used in wateryard and borehole
construction to ensure they conform to specification. Preparation of
tender documents and designs for the water supply contract would be carried
out by consultants before the start of the project.
C. Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.19      The LMMC's Research Division would be responsible for project
monitoring and evaluation. The Research Division currently collects data
on numbers, weights and prices of animals passing through the livestock
markets along the stock routes. It would be well placed, therefore, to
monitor facility development and use on those routes. The project range
monitoring unit would report to the Director of LMMC's Research Division.
Consultants would assist the range monitoring unit to design range trend
evaluation criteria and assess the work of the unit annually. In addition
to work on range condition and movement of trade livestock, the monitoring
unit would measure and record numbers and species of migratory animals
passing through the several locations on the stock routes which have very



- 31 -
fragile range conditions. The numbers of sedentary people and their
animals and areas of cultivation which impinge on these fragile locations
in the stock route corridors would also be recorded. This work would
provide a factual assessment of range trends, rank the reasons for
deterioration where it occurs, and indicate how deterioration could best be
reduced or reversed.
4.20      During project implementation, LRC would report progress
semi-annually to MOA, IFAD and IDA. LRC with assistance from LMMC would
prepare a project completion report summarizing project performance and
evaluating its impact. The strengths and weaknesses of the LRC and its
replicability would be fully discussed in this report as would the
environmental impact of the stock routes. This report would be submitted
to IFAD and to IDA not later than six months after the closing date of the
project.
D. Environmental Impact
4.21      The appraisal mission was made aware of the concern of everyone
involved with livestock marketing to protect the environment in Western
Sudan. Although the routes appear as quite narrow corridors when seen from
the air, the progression of the desert southwards is a stark reality seen
on every journey between Khartoum and Nyala either by air or overland.
Livestock traders are well aware of their dependence on production of
herbage along the routes, particularly when use of the routes is to be
extended into the dry season as the project proposes. The main reason for
constructing the dry season route (DSR) is to reduce the numbers of animals
using the northern stock route (NSR). Although the project will cause a
proportion of animals to traverse from west to east in the dry season, use
of the DSR will not threaten the vegetative succession as the dominant
grass species along both routes are annuals and those along the DSR will
have set seed before that route comes into seasonal use. While the NSR
will be in use at the critical time when grasses mature and set seed, the
numbers of animals using its eastern sections (the most fragile) will be
much reduced.
4.22      The project makes provision for monitoring and evaluation of
range conditions and trend along and adjacent to the stock routes, which
will define the status of the vegetation and seek patterns of use on the
routes to promote improvement in vegetative density and quality.

V. LIVESTOCK MARKETING
A. Volume of Trade in the Project Area
5.1       The major consumption area for meat is in and around the three
towns of Khartoum, Omdurman and Wad Medani. Most trade livestock moving
eastwards from the producing areas pass through Omdurman or Kosti. Small
numbers of cattle go west to the Central Africa Republic and a few camels
and sheep are thought to go north to Egypt and Libya without going through
any market or export recording procedure.
5.2       The national cattle herd of 16 million head is estimated to
produce about 250,000 tons of meat per year while sheep and goats account
for another 100,000 tons. These figures include the meat from animals
exported live for slaughter. Exports in 1983/84 are estimated to exceed
525,000 sheep and 31,000 cattle. The export fraction would, therefore,
represent about 16,000 tons of meat or slightly under 5% of total
production, but sheep exports practically alL of which are drawn from the
project area would represent about 30 percent of the offtake from that
area.
5.3       A large proportion of the long distance livestock trade and
particularly the live sheep export trade is handled by about twenty large
trading families. However, price movements iLn consuming areas are rapidly
reflected at markets in producing areas indicating that, while these
traders often cooperate in use of facilities at markets and on trek,
competition between them is strong.

Table 5 indicates a close correlation between price movements at Jeddah,
Khartoum and in producing areas, particularly considering that only a small
proportion of sheep marketed enter the export trade.
5.4       The majority of animals are trekked to the consuming areas on the
principal stock route from Nyala via Ed Da'ein and El Obeid to Khartoum, a
distance of 1,000 km. Animals spend 40 to 7C days or occasionally more in
traversing this route depending on species and time of year. There are no
reliable statistics for the numbers of animals moved along any stock
route. LMMC records market transactions in Nyala and Omdurman and at the
main towns between, where livestock join the stock route, but there is no
means of knowing what proportion of trade passes through the markets. In

order to calculate the volume of animal movement on the project routes, an
estimate has been made of the animals that enter the routes at various
points taking into account that other stock routes do exist and are used
for short periods of the year, such as the route from El Fasher to
Omdurman, and that a small number of animals travel on road transport.
Table 6 shows the present and forecast cattle and sheep slaughter trade
from Western Provinces to Khartoum and the estimated proportion using the
project stock routes. Livestock population surveys undertaken in Darfur
during the last ten years have indicated that sheep and goat populations
are increasing while cattle populations are decreasing. These population
changes are thought to be responses to deteriorating range condition under
existing communal grazing systems. This feature is being addressed by the
Western Savannah Project.

- 35 -
5.5       It is calculated that 50,000 cattle, 10% of the offtake, come
from the Southern Region into South Kordofan and South Darfur for marketing
and will use the dry season route (DSR) which runs from Nyala to Kosti
leaving the NSR northwest at Babanusa. The DSR has feeder routes starting
at Kadugli and at El Abbasiya. The stock routes are also used by camels,
horses, donkeys and goats. Livestock market sales and recorded movements
suggest that these species add 10-15% in terms of cattle equivalents.
Although the goat population is about 60% of the sheep population and
increasing, a far smaller number of goats are marketed as they are used
more for local consumption. The numbers to be moved from the west to
market is, therefore, about 490,000 cattle equivalents. Under the ongoing
Livestock Marketing Project, railway rolling stock has been purchased to
transport live animals to internal markets and for export. That rolling
stock is expected to result in an increase of livestock rail transportation
to markets from the present negligible level to about 600,000 sheep or
125,000 cattle equivalents per year. Subtracting that figure from 490,000
calculated above leaves 365,000 cattle equivalent to be trekked assuming no
incremental offtake effect of the Livestock Marketing Project or the
proposed Stock Route Project.
B. Marketing Costs
5.6       Information gathered from LMMC, traders and markets shows a range
of trekking costs on the NSR.
Table 7

(LSd)
Item                Favorable Conditions       Unfavorable Conditions
Cattle     Sheep          Cattle      Sheep
Labor                      7.35      2.50             7.35      2.50

Feed                      6.00       1.75            24.00      6.75
Mortality                  4.00      1.00            10.00      2.00

37.75      9.30            136.75    27.80
Thus trekking costs vary from LSd 38 to LSd 137 for cattle, and from
LSd 9.5 to LSd 28 for sheep, excluding cost of use of capital invested in
the animals.

The data in Table 9 is based on average prices of all types and c-lasses of
cattle sold in the respective markets with a constant time differential of
two months. Quality between and within species varies widely with time of
year which would give some bias to these figures. Nevertheless, the
variation in price differentials is impressive and apparently reflects
quite well the range of costs of trekking at various times of the year.
Furthermore, it is apparent that a trader can cover his costs and earn a
return for his labor, skill and capital even in unfavorable trekking
conditions.



- 37 -
5.8       Table 10 compares the cost of trekking with the cost of rail
transport.
Table 10
Comparison of Tekking Costs with Cost of Rail Transport
Trekking      Trekking
Favorable     Unfavorable
Conditions    Conditions      Rail Transport
Cattle             38.0          137.0             60.0
Sheep               9.5           28.0             11.5
Rail transport rates are based on extrapolation from the present rates
charged for Khartoum-Port Sudan plus a flat rate-of LSd 12 per head of
cattle and LSd 3.5 per sheep for feed cost, labor and fees. These are
rates introduced in 1982 by LMMC and were thought to cover costs and allow
a profit margin. However, recent cost accounting by SRC and LMMC indicates
that those rates are not covering costs in 1983 and will have to be
increased by 20-30% before the end of the calendar year. At present rates,
the cost comparison suggests a slight edge for trekking under the favorable
conditions to be created by the project, but this advantage appears more
clear cut when allowance is made for the impending rate increases to make
rates fully commercial. Morever, the railway track between Er Rahad and
Nyala is light and fragile; hence, trains are subject to derailment and
other track related delays. Sudan Railways Corporation plans to upgrade
its infrastructure in eastern Sudan where traffic is heavy but only make
inprovement to the western line at some future date. It would, therefore,
be unwise to invest now in rolling stock additional to that purchased under
the Livestock Marketing Project to transport livestock from western Sudan
to markets in eastern Sudan. The most economical use of existing rolling
stock will be by operating it eastward from El Obeid and Er Rahad to
Khartoum and Port Sudan. The proposed stock routes would dovetail with
that strategy.
C. Meat Supply and Demand
5.9       Meat demand in Khartoum remains relatively constant throughout
the year, but supplies have a considerable variation which creates price
fluctuations in the local market. Sheep prices at Omdurman market varied
from LSd 46 in October 1981 to LSd 70 between February and July 1982.
Cattle prices varied from LSd 225 to LSd 465 during the same period. The
variation in price would be even greater if the quality of animals were the
same throughout the year. Animals marketed at the end of the dry season in
June/July are in extremely poor condition compared to those marketed in
October after the rains.
5.10      The Government has deliberately encouraged exports of sheep by
progressively removing export tax over the last three years, resulting in
numbers of sheep exported through official channels increasing from 290,000
in 1979/80 to over 600,000 in 1982/83. Average retail prices for beef and
mutton in Khartoum during the CY 1983 were about LSd 3.6 and LSd 5.3 per
kg., respectively. It is foreseen that live sheep exports will continue to



- 38 -
expand faster than live cattle plus beef exports. That being the case
domestic demand will shift more into beef because of the price
differential, and the exportable surplus of cattle, currently estimated at
25,000 heads, would drop to zero in the mediuri term. Recorded plus
smuggled live sheep exports now thought to total about 1 million annually
could rise to 1.5 million in the medium term before starting to fall when
domestic consumption, particularly in urban areas, increases around 1990
and beyond (Annex V, Table 1 and 2). In order to foster maximum export
earnings the Government would study the probable stimulus effect on export
volume and foreign exchange earnings, and on dlomestic meat prices, of
variations in exchange rates. Government has restated its intention to
continue to stimulate export earnings from the! livestock subsector by
maintaining its policy of reducing or eliminating export taxes on livestock
or livestock products.
VI. BENEFITS JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Financial Benefits
6.1       The project would directly benefit livestock producers, traders
and consumers through livestock holding cost reduction, decreases in
trekking weight losses, and reduction in trekking mortality rate. The
project would enable livestock traders to supply meat markets in urban
centers with less fluctuation throughout the year. With producer marketing
spread more evenly over the entire year, average producer prices would
improve because uniform monthly offtake of animals would reduce producer
holding costs and seasonal gluts in supply which force prices down.
Consumer prices for meat would fall because of lower marketing costs
incurred by traders to hold and recondition animals in Khartoum prior to
slaughter and because of lower trekking losses. The project would also
provide water to the sedentary population along the stock routes and create
direct employment for about 360 people.
6.2       About 365,000 cattle equivalents2! are trekked annually to
market from western Sudan (Chapter 5, para. 5.5). Currently, most of these
animals are moved in the rainy season (August through November). The
project would extend the trekking period into the dry season by developing
the dry season route (DSR) complete with wateryards, hafirs and veterinary
services. Livestock feed would be provided and sold to traders by
sedentary farmers along the route. It is estimated 95,000 cattle
equivalents would be moved later in the year by this means and reduce
holding costs normally incurred for approximately two months in Omdurman/
Khartoum. These animals would now be held at the places of origin at much
lower costs. Annex VII, Table 9, compares holding costs in Khartoum and
Nyala and establishes that there would be considerable saving in costs with
project. The reduction in holding costs would be about LSd 0.9 million
annually when the project becomes fully operational in 1989/90.
2/ It is estimated that five sheep/goats are equivalent to a head of
cattle in feed and water consumption.



- 39 -
6.3       Currently animals trekked in the dry season between December and
March incur weight losses which could be reduced if water was located
strategically along the DSR where animal feed is relatively abundant.
Although marketed animals are not sold by measured weight, research at LMMC
has shown that butchers assess weight of live animals with almost uncanny
accuracy. It is estimated that about 80,000 cattle equivalents are trekked
during the dry season. The reduction in trekking losses would be about LSd
2.5 million annually at full development (Annex VII, Tables 13 and 14).
6.4       In addition to these benefits the project would reduce the
mortality rate of animals during trekking from the present level of 5% to
about 4%. The reduction in mortality rate because of the project is
estimated to be worth LSd 2.0 million annually (Annex VII, Tables 11 and
12). Project benefit calculations do not include benefits that could
result from increased offtake or the provision of water for sale to
sedentary farmers located along the routes.
6.5       Incremental benefits as a result of the project were adjusted
downwards to take into account the fact that trekked animals join the route
at different points and it is therefore estimated thit 60% of the livestock
would effectively use the entire route. The incremental benefit after this
adjustment is estimated to be LSd 3.2 million annually when the project is
fully developed in 1989/90 (Annex VII, Table 15).
6.6       The financial analysis for LRC was prepared with the following
assumptions:
5i) The GOS would invest equity of LSd 5 million in the first and
second years of project implementation.
(ii) The GOS would finance technical assistance and training for the
company (LSd 3.3 million) by a grant.
(iii) Through a subsidiary loan agreement, the company would borrow
from GOS LSd 10.7 million to supplement the equity contribution
in financing wateryard equipment, housing, operational buildings,
vehicles and equipment and operating cost. The long-term loan
provided by GOS would bear annual service charges of 16% of the
outstanding balance and be repaid over 15 years including
five-years grace period.
(iv) GOS would waive tax on imported items supplied under the
project. The value of fixed assets without duties and taxes was
used in the preparation of the proforma balance sheet.
(v) Water charges of 2.5 piastres per gallon during the first year of
the project and 3.0 piastres thereafter up to full development of
the project were used in the analysis when determining LRC sales
revenue. However, water charges should be adjusted annually to
reflect increases in the cost of operation and maintenance of
wateryards.
(vi). No corporate tax on profits was assumed.
(vii) The LRC would pay a dividend of 20% on equity following full
project development (1990).



- 40 -
6.7       The proforma income statement for LRC (Annex VII, Table 1) shows
the company would start with small net losses in the first three years of
the project and begin making a profit from year four which would
progressively increase from then on. Accumulated cashflow (Table 2) would
be LSd 3.2 million before starting to repay the long-term debt and
replacing vehicles and equipment in year six. The debt/equity ratio for
LRC would progressively improve after year five over the life of the
project and the company will have a sound liquidity position (Annex VI,
Tables 2 and 3).
B. Cost Recovery,
6.8       The cost recovery system proposed through collection of water
charges would enable LRC to recover fully wateryard costs and company
overheads incurred under the project. Water charges to be paid by
livestock traders and sedentary farmers would cover investment costs,
operating costs and financing charges.
6.9       Wateryards constructed under the project at full develo ment
(1988/89) will have the capacity to produce 286.7 million gallons_/ of
water. Assuming 80% efficiency, actual production would be 229.4 million
gallons of water. The cost of producing water includes operation and
maintenance of pumps, equipment, vehicles for delivery of supplies and
salaries and wages for staff. The annual operation and maintenance cost is
estimated to be LSd 2.8 million at full development. To determine water
charges, depreciation for capital investment, finance charges for long-term
debt and a return on investment have been included in the analysis (Annex
VI, Table 5). The LRC would charge 2.5 piastres per gallon for water sold
from its new yards during the first year of the project and 3.0 piastres
from the second year onwards. Cattle would consume 10 gallons (45 liters)
per day and sheep, 2 gallons. As at present, water would be sold to
sedentary farmers in 4-gallon tins, which are in abundant supply and
general use in Sudan. All water would be sold for cash. It would be
impractical to meter or measure water consumed by livestock; so cattle
would be charged 25 piastres and sheep/goats, 5 piastres per watering.
Water would be sold for household use to resident sedentary villagers only
when it is surplus to livestock traders' requirements. As water from
project wateryards would therefore not be a constant or guaranteed supply
to villagers, and as villagers would be far more impecunious than livestock
traders, the villagers would pay 6 piastres per 4-gallon tin or about 60%
of the rate to be paid by livestock traders.
6.10      The suggested prices are much above the current water charge of
0.4 piastres because of the high subsidy currently provided by GOS. Both
routes (NSR and DSR) have existing wateryards and it is estimated that
currently 29 wateryards provide water to livesitock trekked on these routes
from Nyala to Omdurman. After project implementation, 67% of the
3/ 1 gallon = 4-1/2 liters.



- 41 -
wateryards in both stock routes would be project yards. Because of the
greater reliability of water to be supplied by yards constructed under the
project, no detrimental competition from non-project wells is foreseen.
6.11      Livestock trader's income statement (with and without project) in
Table 11 shows an increase in net revenue on trading 300 head of cattle
from LSd 19,000 to LSd 27,000. Three hundred head of cattle assumed in the
analysis represent% the average size of a herd trekked at one time from
Nyala to Omdurman. / This scenario analyses costs and revenue associated
with export trade using the official exchange rate (US$1 = LSd 1.3). If
the free (parallel) market exchange rate (US$1 = LSd 1.8) were used, the
incremental net income to the trader due to the project would be higher
(LSd 11,200) for the same number of cattle. However, the effect of a
parallel market exchange rate on the traders' net income is enormous. In
the without project situation, the net income increases from LSd 19,000 to
LSd 54,000. A similar analysis for the internal market would generate a
net income of LSd 7,800 for the 300 head of cattle, assuming a head of
cattle sells at LSd 360 or a ton of beef at LSd 2,600 in urban centers
which are the main markets. In the actual situation traders sell most of
the livestock/meat in the internal market and about 5% goes for export.
Export volume is limited to some extent by demand and by tradition in
sources of local sheep being imported into Saudi Arabia. However Sudan's
three-fold increase in the last three years is impressive and margins
indicate the increase could continue. Some of the livestock are not
exported through official channels, hence the trader would convert export
earnings in the parallel market and receive a higher exchange rate. This
type of trade would translate into earning higher net incomes. The
increase in revenue due to the project is therefore an adequate incentive
to attract livestock traders to use project facilities, and if, as the
appraisal mission believes, there is real competition in the livestock
trade, some of this will be passed on to producers.
4/ 365,000 cattle equivalent are trekked annually (para. 5.5).

C. Economic Analysis
6.12      The economic rate of return for the whole project is estimated to
be 27%. The rate of return was calculated on a 15 year economic life for
the bulk of the capital cost. The life of vehicles and equipment was
estimated to be five years. Appropriate replacement cost at 1984 constant
prices for vehicles and equipment was included in the analysis after every



- 43 -
five years. Rate of return for individual routes (NSR and DSR) and other
project components were not calculated because of their interdependence,
and as such it was not possible to separate benefits associated with each
component.
Switching Values and Sensitivity Analysis
6.13      Cost overruns and delays in accrued incremental benefits could
occur notwithstanding built-in safeguards in the project. To estimate
effects on the project with possible changes in costs and benefits, some
sensitivity tests were performed as summarized below:
Test                                  ERR
(1)  Base case                                               26.8%
(2)  Total benefits down 20%                                 19.5%
(3)  Total cost up 20%                                       20.7%
(4)  Benefits delayed two years                              16.9%
(5)  Benefits delayed three years                            14.5%
(6)  Benefits down 10%                      )
Wateryard costs up 10%                 )
Veterinary services costs up 20%    )                   19.8%
Project administration costs up 10% )
Incremental trekking costs up 20% )
(7)  Wateryard costs up 10%                                  24.8%
(8)  Veterinary costs up 20%                                 26.4%
(9)  Project Administration costs up 10%                     25.9
(10)  Incremental Trekking costs up 20%                       26.1
The project is sensitive to reduction and/or delayed benefits but not to
the extent of reducing the economic rate of return below the opportunity
cost of capital, estimated to be 13.5%, even when total benefits are
delayed for three years. Switching values test shows that costs for
wateryards and Project administration (main cost components) would have to
increase by 96% and 201%, respectively, or benefits decrease by 36% for the
net present value of the project discounted at 13.5% to fall to zero.
6.14      The following assumptions were used in the economic analysis:
(i) Without Project Situation. The present trekking system is
expected to remain the same with no improvements in wateryard
facilities.



- 44 -
(ii) Incremental beef ascribed to the project was valued at export
parity price (Annex VII, Table 1) based on World Bank commodity
price projections revised and issued in January 1984 and
expressed in 1984 constant values adjusted for local handling and
transport. Sheep and/or mutton prizes are based on actual export
prices to Saudi Arabia which is the main market for Sudanese
sheep. Mutton prices are assumed to remain constant over the
life of the project.
(iii) Build-up rate. The full development stage of the project is
assumed to be reached in year five (1989/90) and the following
build-up rate has been used in the analysis of project benefits:
8% in 1985/86, 35% (1986/87), 70% (1987/88), 95% (1988/89) and
100% in 1989/90. These are cumulatLve rates and relate
approximately to the number of wateryards commissioned as
implementation progresses.
(iv) In the economic analysis all costs and benefits were based on
1984 constant prices, and as a resu:Lt price contingencies were
excluded from the rate of return caLculation.
(v)  All costs are net of tax and without subsidy as these are
transfer payments and have no direct positive effect on the
economy. Costs of imported items were valued at the exchange
rate of US$1.00 to LSd 1.3 and then adjusted by implementation
exchange rates which assume a declining value of the Sudanese
pound against the United States doLlar (Annex VII, Table 2).
Cost estimates for construction of deep wells and installations
were based on quotations from foreign firms doing similar work in
the Sudan. All untraded local goods and services were adjusted
by a standard conversion factor of 0.6 to convert them to boarder
prices. Labor was valued at market prices which were assumed to
be the same in both financial and economic terms reflecting a
full employment situation in the Sudan.
(vi) The cost of trekking animals from Nyala to Omdurman is expected
to decline in the long run with project situation from LSd 15.99
to 15.69 because of efficiency of water supply.  It was also
assumed the cost of animal feed and trekking labor would remain
the same in both situations (with and without project) because no
incremental offtake would arise.
(vii) Incremental costs for water used by sedentary farmers were
excluded from the economic analysis as associated benefits could
not be identified. These costs are estimated to be 10% of the
water yard operating costs.
D. Risks
6.15      The principal risk facing the project relates to the proposed
Livestock Route Company.  Project beneficiaries may not be motivated to
invest in the company as they may feel provision of water is a service



- 45 -
function best carried out by a national or regional authority. However,
unsatisfactory experience with Government supplied water services in remote
rural areas over the last decade and the successful self-help operations in
some of those areas have convinced the Government and most rural people
that the Government cannot continue to subsidize the expanding need for
water service nor can it efficiently recover costs. Company viability
would depend heavily on shareholders themselves paying prices for water
which generate a profit to their own company. This situation would
stimulate efficient facility operation but could give rise to disagreement
on water pricing policies between traders and other shareholders. However,
the company would sell between 10 and 15% of the water it produces to
consumers other than livestock traders.
6.16      The other main risk to the project is in the tubewell production
program.  Hydrogeological work carried out since preappraisal confirmed a
real risk of some wells not yielding adequately.  A technical risk
assessment has been made for each proposed drilling site which is shown in
Annex VIII. The project has been designed to minimize the risk by
providing for sufficient exploratory boreholes and additional production
wells at wateryards in potentially low yield locations.
VII   AGREEMENTS REACHED BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT,
THE FUND AND THE ASSOCIATION
7.1       During project negotiations assurances were given that:
(i) Government would provide to the Fund and the Association by
March 1986 the results of a study to review the Borrowers
livestock services and its input to the livestock industry,
including necessary measures to improve livestock exports
(Chapter V, para. 5.10);
(ii) Government policy is to encourage export earnings by reduction or
elimination of export taxes, that this policy applies to
livestock and livestock products as well as other exports, and is
expected to remain in effect (Chapter V, para. 5.10);
(iii) Government would cause the Livestock Route Company to establish
and maintain its accounting system in accordance with sound and
generally recognized accounting practices and principles
acceptable to IFAD/IDA (Chapter III, para. 3.19);



- 46 -
(iv) Government would cause the Livestock Route Company to appoint
commercial auditors acceptable to IFAD/IDA. The audited accounts
would be furnished, together with the auditors report, both in
English, to the Association within nine months of the end of the
financial year (Chapter III, para. 3.19);
(v) Government would offer for sale about 80 percent of its equity
holding in the Livestock Route Company before July 1, 1989.
(Chapter IV,para. 4.15).
7.2       Conditions of Board Presentation would be:
(i) Government shall have registered LRC with Articles of Association
agreed upon at project negotiations (Chapter IV, para. 4.14).
(ii) Government shall have agreed with the Fund and the Association
the name of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Livestock Route Company (Chapter IV, para. 4.14).
(iii) Government shall have agreed with the Fund and the Association
the name of the Chief Executive Officer of the Livestock
Route Company acceptable to IFAD/IDA (Chapter IV, para. 4.14).
7.3       Conditions of Effectiveness would include:
(i) Government and the Livestock Route Company shall have signed the
Subsidiary Agreement covering financial arrangements between
them, which would be acceptable to IFAD/IDA (Chapter III, para.
3.11).
(ii) All conditions precedent to the effiectiveness of the agreement
between the Borrower and IFAD shall have been fulfilled (Chapter
III, para. 3.11).
