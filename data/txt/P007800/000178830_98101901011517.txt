PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD POWER PROJECT (LOAN 948-PAN)
Preface
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Third Power Project,
for which Loan 948-PAN of US$30.0 million was approved on October 27, 1973 to
the Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion - IRHE.   The Loan Agree-
ment was signed on December 4, 1973, and the loan was fully disbursed by Novem-
ber 1980. The loan assisted IRHE to finance the interconnection of regional
electrical systems and the addition of generation capacity required to cover
demand growth.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office on the basis of information existing in the files,including the Project
Appraisal Report, President's Report, Supervision Reports, etc. Copies of the
draft report were sent to the Government and the borrower for comments, which
were taken into account in completing this report. They are attached as an
Appendix to the PCR.

PANAMA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD POWER PROJECT (LOAN 948-PAN)
Highlights
The project was intended to increase power capacity in Panama
to cover the demand growth of the years 1975 and 1976, prior to the commis-
sioning of the Bayano Hydro Plant, to construct transmission facilities to
interconnect Panama's isolated systems, and to meet the required expansion
of the distribution systems in several cities (para. 2.01). A component of
the loan was aimed towards personnel training and improvements in IRHE's
institutional organization.
The physical objectives of the project were substantially achieved.
A new 25 MW diesel plant was added to the system; transmission lines, sub-
stations anda modern load dispatch center were constructed; and distribution
systems were expanded (para. 3.01). Although with difficulties, training and
institutional improvements were achieved (para. 5.01) and later continued in
the subsequent Fourth Power Project (Loan 1470-PAN) (para. 5.02). However,
the project was completed 28 months behind schedule (para. 3.01) with a cost
overrun of 25% (para. 3.06). The delay in the installation of the power
plant resulted in power shortages in the period 1975-76 (para. 6.02).
Although the rate of return for the power plant is negative (para. 6.03),
IRHE's overall investment program continued having a high rate of return com-
parable to appraisal estimates (para. 6.04). Although energy sales grew much
slower than expected (para. 4.01), the timing of the project was not pre-
mature, as the new power plant has been used to meet peak demand in normal
hydrological years and to replace hydroenergy during dry periods.
Institutional performance under the loan improved since time of
appraisal. IRHE's financial situation in the period 1974-76 deteriorated
seriously as a consequence of cost overruns on the Bayano project, low
tariffs, and slower than expected energy sales (para. 4.02). Finances have
improved slowly since 1977, reaching the agreed rates of return in 1981
(para. 4.03). However, IRHE has continued experiencinR cash shortages
because of the high level of fiscal resources required to finance its ambitious
program of substituting hydroelectric enerRv from new Droiects for thermal
generation.
The principal lessons arising from the project experience are:
(i) the need of closer technical supervision to ensure the adequacy of
engineering documents and execution of works (para. 8.01); and the need of
having more detailed demand forecasts (para. 4.01) which should be conserva-
tive when used for financial forecases (para. 4.02).

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Bank Lending to the Power Sector
1.01      Loan 948-PAN is the third of five Bank loans made so far to the
Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IRHE), totalling
MUS$141.   The first, Loan 322-PAN, for MUS$4, was made in 1962 to finance
a rural electrification program. The second, Loan 661-PAN for MUS$42 was
made in 1970 and helped IRHE finance the Bayano hydroelectric plant (150
MW), 40 MW of additional capacity at the Las Minas steam plant,
transmission from these plants to Panama City, small diesel plants in
rural areas, distribution works and consulting services; the project was
successfully completed, although with substantial delays and cost overruns
(see Performance Audit Report No. 2508, dated May 15, 1979). Loan
948-PAN, the object of this report was made in 1973 and helped finance
the Third Power Project. The fourth loan, 1470-PAN, for MUS$42, was made
in 1977 and is financing the first stage of the Fortuna Hydroelectric
Project (300 MW), currently scheduled for completion by 1984 as well as
associated transmission lines and organizational improvement and training
programs. The fifth loan, 1778-PAN, for MUS$23, was signed in 1980 and is
helping IRHE finance the rehabilitation and expansion of its
subtransmission and distribution systems over a 3-year period. Finally, a
sixth power project, which would include, inter alia, the second stage of the
distribution project started under the Fifth Power Project,was appraised in
November 1982.
The Power Sector
1.02      The power sector is by now entirely controlled by the Government
through IRHE, an autonomous government agency created in 1961 and charged
with public service electricity supply in Panama, including the areas of
the former Canal Zone reverted in 1979. In 1972, IRHE had become the
major institution in the sector after the acquisition from Boise Cascade
(USA) of the Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz (FyL) which also held
concessions for operation of telephone and gas services in Panama City and
Colon; the latter activities were later separated from IRHE. Smaller
private power utilities were subsequently acquired by IRHE between 1973
and 1978. Such takeovers in a short period have resulted in IRHE's rapid
growth; as of November 1982, IRHE had a total installed capacity of 516 MW.
Project Origin and Preparation
1.03      The third power project was tentatively identified during a
January 1972 supervision mission for Loan 661-PAN (Bayano Hydro Project),
as part of IRHE's expansion program. A preappraisal of the project was
conducted in November of the same year followed by an appraisal in
February-March of 1973. Following a satisfactory improvement in Panama's
fiscal situation, which had been made a condition for further processing
of the loan, negotiations were held in September and the loan was approved
by the Board in November 1973. Signing followed on December 4, 1973 and
the loan was declared effective in April 1974, following the effective



transfer of IRHE's telephone operations to a new agency and the submission
to the Bank of a satisfactory training program.
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Original Project Description
2.01      The original Third Power Project consisted of:
(a) a diesel power plant of about 25 MW to be installed in the
Metropolitan Area;
(b) about 188 km of 230 kV double-circuit transmission line
(initially operated at 115 kV) between Panama Substation,
Chorrera, and Divisa;
(c) about 41 km of 115 kV single-circuit transmission line
between Chitre and Divisa, and about 25 km of 115 kV
double-circuit transmission lines in the Metropolitan
Area;
(d) substations with a total capacity of about 200 MVA (stepping
down from 115 kV and for switching) near Chitre, Aguadulce,
Chorrera, Cerro Viento, Tocumen, San Francisco, Maranon, and
at Las Minas and Panama substation, including two mobile
substations with a total capacity of about 40 MVA;
(e) about 110 km of subtransmission lines and related
substations;
(f) distribution system expansion 1974-76;
(g) a system load-dispatch center at the Panama Substation,
including a related communication system; and
(h) studies, engineering and technical training.
Changes to the Project
2.02       In general, the scope of the project remained as envisaged at
appraisal. Only minor changes were made, as follows:
(a) the original terminal substation for the 230 kV line was
displaced from Divisa to Llano Sanchez (7.5 km to the north)
to simplify the design and lower the costs;



- 4 -
(b) the proposed 115 kV taps from Panama City to the
Cement plant and the Tocumen airport were eliminated
as their load did not increase as forecast, and the
existing 13.8 kV connections were deemed sufficient;
(c) the proposed Colon-Free Zone substation (44 kV) was eliminated
since final engineering studies ruled out the need for its
construction; and
(d) the two mobile substations were not procured as they
did not prove to be necessary.
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Project Execution
3.01      All the major project items were coDipleted with some delays as
shown in the following table:

1/ Minor works still in progress at Las Minas and Colon II substations are
expected to be completed by 1982.
3.02      However, about 85% of all works had been completed by June 30,
1977, the original project completion date, and the long delays shown
above for substations and subtransmission components concern mainly minor
works whose completion delays did not hamper the operation of IRHE's
system.



3.03      Due mainly to initial delays in procurement by IRHE, the
installation of the San Francisco diesel groups was only completed in
early 1976, i.e., about seven months behind schedule; however, final
acceptance of the plant and full operation was postponed until September
1977 due to the series of technical problems which ocurred during the
initial operating phase (see para. 3.11).    Delays in transmission and
distribution works were partly due to the reorganization of IRHE's
technical staff (following the integration of FyL's activities), the
splitting of the works in too many items for procurement and, in the case
of the Panama-Cerro Viento 115 kV line, foundation problems. Late
completion of the load-dispatch center can be partly attributed to initial
delays in procurement (see para. 3.04). Except for the diesel groups
(para. 6.02), these delays did not affect IRHE's operations significantly
because of a lower-than-anticipated load growth (see para. 4.01).
Procurement
3.04      Procurement of Bank-financed items was carried out under the
usual consultation with the Bank and no significant problems were
reported in relation to bidding procedures and contract awards; in the
case of the load-dispatch center, the firm to which the contract was first
awarded, decided to withdraw its bid and the final award went to the
second-lowest bidder.
3.05      Countries of main contractors and suppliers are listed below:

Project Cost
3.06      Detailed breakdowns of the original and actual costs of the
project in current and constant (1973) prices are shown in Annexes 1
through 3. The local and foreign inflation indices used as deflators are
shown in Annex 5. A summary of project costs is shown in the table
below:

3.07      The 25% cost overrun (in current prices) can be attributed
essentially to a much higher than expected inflation during the project
implementation period: the appraisal estimate was based on inflation
rates of 5% p.a. and could not foresee the impact of the oil crisis on
local and world prices. In fact, measured at constant 1973 prices, the
actual project cost is 20% lower than estimated at appraisal, mainly due
to the above-mentioned changes in the project scope (para. 2.02), a
favorable price on the contract for the load-dispatch center, and lower
expenditures on distribution works, partially offset by higher
expenditures for engineering services.
Disbursement of the Loan
3.08      About 81% of the loan had been disbursed by June 30, 1977, the
original closing date. In order to allow IRHE to disburse the total
amount of the loan, the Bank agreed to extend the closing date until June
30, 1980 1/. A summary of the estimated and actual loan disbursements is
shown in Annex 6 and a comparison of the original and final allocation of
the loan proceeds is shown in Annex 7.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.09       IRHE contracted an Italian consulting firm to prepare bidding
documents for the 25 MW thermal station; IRHE's general engineering
consultants (USA) were kept in charge of the engineering, design and
supervision for all other physical project components. Both firms
performed satisfactorily. IRHE's administrative and financial consultants
(USA) prepared a diagnostic study of the company's organization; their
performance was adequate; this diagnostic study served as the basis for a
large-scale organization improvement program, subsequently carried out by
a different consulting firm, under financing from Loan 1470-PAN.
1/ In fact, the last disbursements were made in November 1980.

3.10      In spite of the serious technical problems that marred the San
Francisco diesel groups during the initial operating phase (see para.
3.11), the performance of the supplier was judged good as it made all
efforts to resolve promptly all of these problems.     Some of the civil
works for transmission lines carried out by local contractors were
considered somewhat deficient, due to the lack of proper experience.
Operating Performance
3.11      Following completion of the installation of the four 7 MW
medium-speed diesel groups in the San Francisco power station, several
problems appeared during the test period:
(a) intake valves presented excessive signs of corrosion, due
to high atmospheric humidity apparently not taken into
consideration for the design of the machines;
(b) frequent breakage of exhaust valves occurred , due to
failures in their forced-water cooling system and corrosion
due to high vanadium and sodium contents in the engine
exhaust system; and
(c) signs of deterioration of the engines' concrete base
appeared, resulting in engine misalignment.
3.12       These problems can be partly attributed to deficient equipment
as well as errors during erection and tests, and to IRHE's lack of
experienced personnel to supervise these activities; they were solved adequately
by the supplier at their cost, as they occurred during the guarantee period.
Final acceptance was finally agreed between IRHE and the supplier in
September 1977, and included provision for an indemnization payment of
about MUS$0.3 and special guarantees covering the exhaust valves on all
four units. The groups now operate satisfactorily. All other project
components have operated adequately.
4. MARKET AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Forecast and Actual Market
4.01      Actual sales have risen over the 1973-79 period at a rate
significantly lower than expected at appraisal (7.1% p.a. on average
instead of 15.6% expected), particularly in the earlier years of the period
(Annex 8).  This can be ilargerly explained by (i) the slower-than-expected
economic growth of the country as a result of the oil crisis; (ii) the
effect of the steep tariff increases implemented over the period (15%
p.a. on average between 1973 and 1978); and, to a lesser extent, (iii)
lower-than-expected sales to the Canal Authority (PANCANAL). The
breakdown of sales shows that growth was lowest in the
industrial and residential consumer categories (5.5% and 4.7% p.a. on
average versus estimates of 10.9% and 12.4% respectively). The actual
distribution of sales between various consumer categories as of 1979 was
not significantly different from the appraisal expectations, with the
commercial and residential classes each accounting for about 30% of total
sales.



- 8-
Operating and Financial Results
4.02       IRHE's estimated and actual financial indicators, summary
financial statements and balance sheets are shown in Annexes 9 thru 11.
They point out to a serious deterioration of IRHE's finances in the period
1974-76, as illustrated by a negative net internal cash generation in
those three years, a debt service coverage ratio of 0.6 in 1976 and rates
of return on assets of 4.5% in 1974 and 5.5% in 1976.     This deterioration
was largely due to (i) substantial cost overruns on the Bayano
Hydroelectric Project (Loan 661-PAN) 1/ and their financing under short
and medium-term commercial loans in the face of insufficient Government
equity contribution; (ii) the absence of sufficient tariff increases to
cover increases in operating costs other than fuel; (iii) IRHE's
difficulties in collecting arrears, particularly from the public sector;
and; (iv) the impact on IRHE's revenues of the slower-than-expected growth
in sales (para. 4.01).
4.03       IRHE's financial situation significantly improved starting in
1977, following the implementation of a financial recovery program agreed
with the Bank in the context of the preparation of the Fourth Project
(Fortuna Hydroelectric plant, Loan 1470-PAN); this program included, inter
alia: (i) gradual tariff increases to permit IRHE to reach the minimum
8.75% rate of return; (ii) Government contributions to cover part of the
costs of the Fortuna Project; and (iii) payment of the Government's
arrears. As a result, IRHE's rate of return on revalued assets was 7.9%
in 1978, only slightly short of the stipulated 8.75%, and its debt service
coverage ratio reached a reasonable 1.2; in that same year, IRHE could
self-finance 8% of its investment program (13% estimated at appraisal).
IRHE's financial recovery continued, in fact, beyond the projection
period, as its rate of return for 1981 was 9.25% with a self-financing
ratio of 48%.

5. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
IRHE's Organization and Management
5.01       In 1972 IRHE's role changed significantly when the Government
purchased all the assets of FyL. Due to the takeover of the activities of
FyL, IRHE experienced a growth which could not be foreseen at the time of
the appraisal in 1969.   IRHE was not prepared to absorb the burden of the
increased operations, and during the appraisal and negotiations of Loan
948-PAN, IRHE and the Bank agreed on the necessity of improving IRHE's
organization and establishing a comprehensive training program for IRHE's
personnel. As a result of this understanding, IRHE created the position
of Technical Director and, as a condition for effectiveness of the loan,
prepared, with the assistance of its administrative consultants, a
training program for its personnel. A large part of the program consisted
of training courses for IRHE's key personnel. The program was initiated
as expected but because of policy discontinuity due to considerable
personnel turnover in certain kev areas -- the Director General was
replaced in 1974 and there were three Financial Directors in the period
1974-76 -- IRHE suspended the program. However, there was training for
personnel on the basis of immediate requirements.



- 10 -
5.02      During 1975 and 1976 IRHE carried out several organizational
changes based on studies prepared by IRHE's own staff. The Bank's
position regarding these changes was that there was still room for further
organizational improvements and it recommended that IRHE should continue
improving its organization with the assistance of experienced
consultants. After extensive discussion during the preparation of the
Fourth Power Project, IRHE requested its administrative consultants to
carry out a diagnostic study of its organization. The study helped IRHE
to identify the organizational improvements and training required.      In
February 1978 IRHE hired a management consulting firm under financing from
Loan 1470-PAN, to implement the recommendations of the diagnostic study.
The program was completed satisfactorily in 1980.
5.03       In the earlier years of project implementation, Government
intervention arising to a large extent from the public's sensitivity to
sharply rising fuel costs, tended to affect adversely IRHE's institutional
performance, resulting in delays to act promptly on matters such as tariff
increases and organizational problems. However, in the context of the
preparation of the Fourth Power Project, the Government provided the Bank
in 1976 with a statement confirming IRHE's autonomy and commitment to
sound management policies. This statement has subsequently been adhered
to and has provided a sound basis for IRHE's operations.
Compliance with Main Covenants
5.04      Annex 12 lists the major covenants included in Loan 948-PAN.
Two of those were not complied with during the project implementation
period. First, IRHE and the Government failed to comply with their
respective obligations included in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements with
regards to the achievement of the minimum 8.75% rate of return on revalued
assets, particularly between 1974 and 1976 (para. 4.02); however, IRHE's
financial situation improved from 1977 onward and its rate of return fell
only slightly short of the covenanted figure in 1979 and 1980 (8.4% in
both years), while in 1981 it was 9.25%.
5.05       Second, IRHE failed to comply with the debt limitation covenant
in late 1975 by not seeking Bank's agreement, although its debt service
was below 1.4, before signing two large loans for the financing of the
Estrella-Los Valles Hydroelectric Project (90 MW), a project not
originally included in the expansion program discussed with the Bank.
This failure further strained relations between the Bank and IRHE at a
time when difficult discussions were being held on a possible financial
recovery program for IRHE, in the context of the preparation of the Fourth
Power Loan. As seen above (para. 4.03), these negotiations were
satisfactorily completed in mid-1977 with the signing of Loan 1470-PAN.
Since then, IRHE has always sought the Bank's agreement on new borrowings,
as its ratio still remains below 1.4.

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Least-Cost Analysis
6.01      The appraisal report mentioned that the interconnection of
Panama's regional systems, of which the transmission components of the
project were an integral part, was the least-cost solution for the future
expansion of IRHE's system, according to the Master Plan prepared by
IRHE's engineering consultants; subsequent updating of the Plan indicated
that this was still the case. Since its completion, the Load-Dispatch
Center has fulfilled its main objective which was to permit efficient
overall system control and continuous economic dispatch, while permitting
in-house training of IRHE's engineers.
6.02      The appraisal report mentioned that the main justification of
the prompt purchase of about 25 MW of thermal capacity for installation in
the San Francisco station, was to avoid power rationing in the twelve
months preceeding the commissioning of the Bayano Hydro Plant (i.e.,
between April 1975 and March 1976); however, this objective could not be
fulfilled due to the technical problems which prevented satisfactory
operation of the diesel groups until mid-1977, i.e., when the Bayano Plant
came into operation; as a result, the country did experience power
shortages in the period 1975-76.    The appraisal report mentioned that
medium-speed diesels working on Bunker Coil would be the least-cost
solution compared to gas turbines (using diesel oil), the next best
alternative, although no calculations were included. Based on the latest
forecasts for diesel plant operation, an ex-post comparison (Annex 4)
shows that medium-speed diesels are still by far the least-cost solution,
due to current high fuel prices (with an equalizing discount rate of
175%).
Internal Rate of Return
6.03      No rate of return on the total project or individual project
components was calculated at appraisal. An ex-post calculations was made
for the San Francisco diesel groups, indicating a negative rate of return;
this result, however, is not meaningful since it is based on a reduced
expected generation 1/, reflecting the fact that the groups are to be used
in large part as reserve capacity. However, without the diesels, IRHE
would have to engage in rationing or load shedding. The worth of the
output is the price customers would pay to obtain service, not the average
tariff.
1/ IRHE's latest load-dispatch projections show significant operation
only until 1984 when hydro energy from the new Fortuna project would
substitute the major part of IRHE's thermal generation.



- 12 -
6.04      The rate of return on    IRHE's overall investment program had
been estimated at appraisal at 13.2%.    Subsequent calculations indicate
rates of 17.7% (appraisal of Fourth Power Project, 1976) and 18%
(appraisal of Fifth Power Project, 1979), which compare even more
favorably with Panama's cost of capital, estimated at 11%.1/
7. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01      The Bank's role was difficult during the early years of
implementation of this project (1974-76) and was characterized by a marked
orientation towards institution-building aspects, such as IRHE's
organization and management and IRHE's technical and financial soundness.
During these early years, supervision of the project was carried out
simultaneously with that of the Second Power Project (Bayano Hydro Plant),
the execution of which was marred by significant technical problems.
These problems, together with the Bank's pursuance of the above objectives
in the framework of IRHE's fast-growing activities, accounted for the
difficult relations that prevailed between IRHE and the Bank during that
period.
7.02      Ultimately, the Bank's role proved helpful in a number of
areas, although most of the improvements were achieved after 1977, with
the added influence under subsequent loans (1470-PAN and 1778-PAN):
(i) Finances. Convincing the Government and IRHE to adopt
measures to consolidate the company's financial position
(para. 4.03).
(ii) Organization. Alerting and motivating IRHE to investigate
organizational improvements and training needs.
(iii) Expansion Program. Orienting IRHE's expansion program
towards the least-cost alternatives.
1/ This favorable comparison reflects use of current tariffs which must
cover the high costs of operating IRHE's thermal capacity.

8. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The serious technical problems which developed with the
medium-speed diesels point out the need for close monitoring of bidding
documents and final contractual arrangements. Such monitoring is
necessary to ensure the adequacy of foundations and other local works,
usually provided by local contractors, to meet the specific engine
requirements.
8.02      There is no other major lesson which can be drawn specifically
from this project, since its main problems were caused by factors largely
outside the control of both IRHE and the Bank (the 1974 oil crisis being
responsible for the project's cost overruns and deficient equipment for
the technical problems which affected the diesel groups); and the
unexpected growth of IRHE's operations which produced management problems.
8.03      More generally, it can be concluded that a close Bank staff
involvement and a substantial and continuous contribution to IRHE's
financing (rather than punctual operations) were the main factors which
permitted the ultimate achievement of a successful dialogue with IRHE and
the Government, and significant improvements in IRHE's organization and
finances.

Re.: Project Performance Report, Panama, Third
Power Project (Loan No. 948-PAN)
Sir:
With reference to your letter of September 3, 1982, I am pleased
to provide you with our comments on the Project Completion Report (Loan
No. 948-PAN-IBRD), as requested:
Comments on the-Project Completion Report (draft) prepared by OED
Section 2 Project Description
Changes to the Project (*)
In para. 2.02 (c) on page 4 the following change should be made:
The Colon-Free Zone substations was eliminated following more
detailed load and distribution studies performed for the
Colon system.
Section 3 Project Implementation and Cost
Project Execution (*)
Footnote 1/ to para. 3.01 on page 4 should be corrected as follows:
(1) Work on the 44 kV Bahla Las Minas substation, the 115 kV
Bahia Las Minas substation (alternations) and the Colon II
LCPE2 Note 1: Comments marked with (*) have been considered in the
revision of the PCR.

substation is expected to be completed by December 1982.
The following should be added to para. 3.07 on page 6:
Initial underestimation of project costs and change
in original plans due to new system requirements.
Operating Performance
The following should be added to para. 3.11 (a) on page 7: (*)
This was due to an error in the contractor's design, which did
not allow for the high relative humidity existing in the
environment where the engines were installed.
These problems were solved during the trial operation stage of the engines,
modifying the operating parameters for the water cooling system. All
costs were borne by the contractor.
The following should be added to para. 3.11 (b) on page 7: (*)
This was basically caused by the contractor's lack of experience
with the units sold to IRHE, which were of recent design, with
not enough experience in the use of high vanadium and sodium
residual fuels as used in Panama. These elements accelerated
the corrosion because of the high temperature in the exhaust
valve.
Because of this problem the trial operation period for the units
was prolonged, allowing the contractor to make a larger number
of trials before a solution was found.
The contractor had the full cooperation of IRHE's technical
staff for this work.
The following should be added to para. 3.11 (c) on page 7: (*)
(c) The solution applied by IRHE has been fully satisfactory. It
was implemented jointly with the electromechanical contractor,
taking advantage of his experience with similar units
installed in other countries.
The following amendments and additions should be made to para. 3.12:
These problems (points (a) and (b)) should not be attributed to
errors during erection and tests but rather to a design that
was not suited to site conditions.
Point (c) could be attributed to certain errors of construction
in the concrete foundations.
The problems with the generating units were not due to IRHE's
lack of experienced personnel, because the contractor himself,
despite all his experience in the manufacture of such equipment,
had to spend more than 18 months on site in order to resolve

the problems encountered.
Section 4 Market and Financial Performance
Forecast and Actual Market (*)
In para. 4.019 where it says:  "Actual sales have risen over the 1973-79     LCP2 Note 3
period at a rate significantly lower than expected at appraisal (8.2% p.a. Errors in
on average instead of 13.9% expected),   the following changes need to be    both PCR and
be made:  The percentage of actual sales in parentheses should read as       IRHE's com-
follows:                                                                     ments were cac-
rected in the
" expected at appraisal (7.0% p.a. on average instead of         final version
13.9% expected)."                                                 of the PCR
(para. 4.01
In line 10 of the same section where it says:                                and Annex 8).
"...industrial and residential consumer categories (4.0% and 5.9%
p.a. on average versus estimates of 11.8% and 10.8% respectively),"
the following corrections should be made:
"...industrial and residential consumer categories (4.0% and 4.7%
p.a. on average versus estimates of 11.8% and 10.8% respectively)."
In para. 4.04 the following should be added:
Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds (Annexes 9 and 10) (**)
The statement of sources and uses of funds was compared with the
audited financial statements for 1973 onwards and discrepancies
were found as follows:
Under "Sources of Funds" the entry for IBRD Loan 948 showed
discrepancies for 1975 and 1978; the item "Other Borrowings"
showed discrepancies in 1973, 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978,
as did the item for Government Contributions and Consumers
for 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1978 (see Annexes 9 and 10).
These discrepancies resulted in new totals for Sources of
Funds for each year from 1973 until 1978.
In "Uses of Funds" there were the following discrepancies:
Expenditures during construction showed discrepancies for the
Third Power Project and for other works between 1973 and 1978.
The variation in working capital (increase or decrease) showed
differences between 1973 and 1978. The total Uses of Funds
therefore showed discrepancies between 1973 and 1978 compared
to the total Sources of Funds, since we do not know what
criteria were used in preparing the Financial Statement.
LCP2 Note 2: Comments marked (**) were not considered in view of statement in
IRHE's follow-up telex of 12/14/82 (Appendix 2).

Balance Sheet    (Annex No. 11)
The balance sheet figures were compared with the audited financial
statements as from 1973, and discrepancies were found for 1975 and
1978 (see Annex 11). The discrepancies found for 1975 alter the
balance in this table. In 1978 there are discrepancies in the items
that make up the net current assets.
It should be pointed out that these balance sheets cover both IRHE's
electricity supply activities and also its hydro and gas operations.
Financial Ratios (Annex No. 9)
The financial ratios were obtained from the autidted financial
statements, with the discrepancies noted in the pertinent table
(see Annex 9).
The rate of return given in the audited financial statements relates
solely to the electrical side of IRRE.
Corrections have been made to the Completion Report as per the
attached table. 1/
We have no further comments on the rest of the report and are at your
service for any further information you might require.
Yours, etc.

Attn: Messrs. Linder, Vietti, Luzuriaga
In reference to your telex dated 12/11/82, we would like to inform you that
the financial information presented in our note DI-SCP-032-82 is only of an
illustrative nature, and does not reflect important differences with your
PCR; therefore, no changes are required. Our table of sources and uses of
funds is based on a different criteria than the Bank's, but does not show
errors in the report.
Sincerely,
