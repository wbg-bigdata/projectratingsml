APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRIFICACION
PANAMA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project forming part of the
1973-77 expansion program of Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion
(IRHE), an autonomous agency of the Panamanian Government, charged with coordinat-
ing and expanding electrical power generation and distribution throughout the
Republic.
ii.       This would be the Bank's third loan to IRHE. Loan 322-PAN, signed in
1962, was one of the Bank's first loans for rural electrification and assisted
IRHE in financing its expansion program in the Central provinces, including the
construction of a small hydroelectric plant at La Yeguada with an installed capacity
of 6 MW. The second loan (661-PAN), signed in.1970, assisted IRHE in financing
the foreign exchange for the first stage of the Bayano hydroelectric development
(150 MW) and associated transmission line and substations; a 40 4W steam unit
at Las Minas and transmission line; 6 MW of diesel in the rural areas; expansion
of its distribution systems; and studies, training and management consultants'
services. The bulk of the second project (Bayano) is about one year behind
schedule and the total project likely to cost some 35% more than the original
estimate of US$58 million. The cost and time overruns, which affect the two
main components of the project - Bayano and Las Minas - are due to variations
in foreign exchange rates since the appraisal in June 1969, to the poor quality
of the preliminary engineering studies and field investigations made by IRHE's
previous consultants, to difficulties in finding and quarrying suitable aggregates
for Bayano's civil works, and to additional civil works at Las Minas, which were
found to be necessary. Additional to the 35% cost overrun, the civil works
contractor for Bayano has recently submitted claims amounting to about US$6 million
due to basalt instead of limestone now being used as concrete aggregate. It is
expected that the loan will be fully drawn down by the original closing date of
April 30, 1976, even though Las Minas will not be in operation until September 1974
and Bayano in the first half of 1976.
iii.      In December 1970, under a UNDP grant, a contract was signed with
Chas. T. Main International Inc. of USA, for which the Bank was the executing
agency, to make a Hydropower Development and Feasibility Study for Panama covering
the period 1971-85. This Master Plan was finalized in January 1973 and proposes
a national power grid by 1982 based on a hydro-thermal generation installation
program. The Project, which is now proposed for Bank financing will be carried
out during 1974-76 and is estimated to cost a total of US$38.5 million equivalent.
It forms part of IRHE's expansion program in accordance with the Master Plan. IRHE's
total construction program during this period is estimated to cost US$110 million
equivalent.  It comprises ongoing works in the second Bank loan, the proposed Project,
the initial stages of future generation expansion and associated works, and other
expansion of IRHE's system.
iv.       The Project  includes IRHE's 1974-76 transmission and distribution
program and a system load dispatch center, as well as studies, engineering and
technical training. Due to the delay of the Bayano hydroplant to the first half
of 1976, 25 MW of generating plant needs to be added by Aprll975 to meet the projected
capacity shortage in 1975-76 before Bayano is in operation. This 25 MW of generating



*          ~~~- ii -
capacity would also form part of the Project and would represent about 10% of its
cost. The transmission would include the integration of isolated regional systems,
which is less costly than continuing to operate the systems separately; this, in
conjunction with the supply of additional load, following expansion of the distribution
systems, would produce a return on program investment of at least 13%, if benefits are
measured by incremental revenue attributable to the program and financial costs
are adjusted for taxes, inflation, and internal transfers.
v.        The loan would finance the foreign exchange component of the project
cost. International competitive bidding would be used to contract for other
work than consultants' services and training. Except for the engagement of
consultants for bid preparation for the 25 MW thermal generation and for the
proposed 115 kV lines and substations - for which retroactive financing to
March 31, 1973, to a maximum of US$300,000 is proposed - no contracts are expected
to be awarded before the signing of the loan. Nevertheless, the proposed loan
provides additional retroactive financing in an amount up to US$500,000, in case
IRHE is in a position to place the order for the 25 MW of generating capacity
prior to loan signing.
vi.       Following the "intervention" in June 1972 of Compania Panamena de
Fuerza y Luz (FyL), a subsidiary of Boise Cascade (USA) which had the concessions
for electricity, telephones and gas in the cities of Panama and Colon, the
Government bought FyL's assets and liabilities, and, on August 1, 1972 handed
them over to IRHE.  It has been decided by the Government that these telephone
activities will be transferred from IRHE by December 31, 1973, and that the gas
activities will be phased out by June 1974, leaving IRHE responsible only for
electric power.
vii.      With the acquisition of FyL's assets, IRHE is now the major electricity
undertaking in the Republic, owning, except for captive industrial plant, over
90% of the country's installzd generating capacity. The transformation of
IRHE from a small rural supplier into a national power company has naturally
brought its problems in organization and management; particularly, there is a
shortage of trained personnel in higher echelons. However, with the continued
use of consultants and a good trahing program, it is considered that IRHE will
overcome present difficulties and be able to execute its program satisfactorily.
viii.     IRHE's rapid and accelerated expansion has placed a heavy strain on
its finances, with the result that its financing plan will have to rely heavily,
during the years 1973-75, on Government contributions, which will be largely
utilized in ongoing projects. After 1975 the Govermment hopes that IRHE will be
able to raise some of the funds required for local expenditure by the issue of
bonds locally. During the draw down period of the proposed Bank loan (1974-77),
approximately 17% of the total cost of IRHE's expansion program would be financed
from internal sources, 54% from overseas loans, 14% from Governnent contributions
and 15% from local borrowings.
ix.       The Project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan to IRHE of US$30 million
equivalent, for a period of about 20 years, including a grace period of about
four years.



APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRIFICACION
PANAMA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Panama has requested the Bank to assist in the
financing of a Project which is part of the 1973-77 expansion program of the
Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IRHE), the autonomous
agency responsible for the installation of all new electric generating
capacity for public service and for most of the distribution system in the
Republic. During the five-year period, IRHE expects to invest about US$169
million in this program.
1.02      The Project proposed for Bank financing comprises the addition of
25 Mw of thermal generating capacity to IRHE's system, about 364 km of trans-
mission and subtransmission lines and related substations, distribution system
expansion, a communication system, a system load dispatch center at Panama
substation, studies, engineering and technical training. The estimated cost
of the Project is US$38.5 million equivalent, including a foreign currency
component of US$27.3 million, which, with part of the interest during con-
struction of US$2.7 million, would be financed by the proposed loan of US$30
million equivalent. The 25 Mw of new generating capacity (at a cost of about
US$3.3 million), together with 28 MW of diesel plant presently under con-
struction and, with purchases from Panama Canal Company (PANCANAL), will
provide for the system growth until the Bayano units come into operation in
the first half of 1976. The remainder of the project provides almost exclu-
sively for IRHE s transmission, distribution and other expansion requirements
for the three years 1974-1976.
1.03      This would be the third Bank loan to IRHE. The first, Loan 322-PAN
of US$4 million equivalent in 1962, was one of the Bank's first loans for
rural electrification and assisted IRHE in financing the construction of the
6 MW yeguada hydroelectric project and associated facilities; the installation
of 3 MW of diesel generation; and distribution rehabilitation - all of which
is now in operation. The Second Loan, 661-PAN of US$42 million equivalent,
signed March 16, 1970, is helping to finance the foreign exchange component
of the:first stage of the Bayano hydroelectric development (150 MW) and asso-
ciated transmission line and substations, steam unit No. 4 (U0 MW) at Bahia Las
Minas on the Atlantic coast and transmission line to Panama City, 6 MW of
diesel generating capacity in the rural areas, expansion of IRHE's distri-
bution systems, and studies, training and management consultants' services.
There have been significant cost overruns on this Project and the total cost
is now estimated at US$78.6 million against US$58.2 million at the time of
the appraisal. The increase of about 35% affects the two main items comprising
the project - the Bayano hydroelectric scheme and Las Minas 40 MW steam unit.



-2-
The increases in cost estimates are discussed in paragraph 4.03. The Govern-
ment has guaranteed to provide or cause IRHE to be provided with any necessary
funds to complete this Project. The first unit at Bayano is now expected
to be in operation in the first half of 1976 (originally the first half of
1975) and Las Minas No. 4 in September 1974 (originally September 1973).
However, it is still expected that the loan will be fully disbursed by the
original closing date of April 30, 1976.
1.04>     Now that it has taken over FyL 's responsibilities, IRHE is faced
with additional organizational problems but proposes to continue to use the
services of management consultants to help solve these probiems. The proposed
loan would assist IRHE in the financing of such services.
1.05      In December 1970, under a UNDP grant, a contract was signed with
Chas. T. Main International, Inc. of USA (MAIN) to make a Hydropower Develop-
ment and Feasibility Study for Panama covering the period 1971-85, for which
the Bank acted as Executing Agency. This study included a comprehensive
survey of the power market in panama and provided the basis for IRHE's 1973
to 1982 expansion program. The Project, now proposed for Bank financing, is
the initial phase of this program. As part of the study, MAIN finalized a
"Master plan" in January 1973, which proposes a national poier grid by 1982
based on the installation of: (i) the first 75 MW steam unit at Las Minas
in 1978, (ii) the Bayano hydro units Nos. 3 and 4 (150 mw) in 1979-80, (iii)
the first stage (2 x 85 mM) of La Fortuna hydropower plant in the Chiriqui
Province near the Costa Rica border in 1981, and (iv) a backbone 230 kV
double-circuit transmission system interconnecting the country. The ",Master
Plan' also provides for the addition of at least one 25 MW gas turbine in
June 1974 to cover IRMH's generating capacity deficiencies prior to Bayano
units Nos. 1 and 2 being commissioned. A companion UNDP study, also prepared
by MAIN, provided the basis for the feasibility of a communication system
and load dispatch center installation as part of the proposed project.
1.06      In January 1973, IRHE sent to the Bank a ten-year (1973 through
1982) forecast of its electric and telephone utility operating costs, revenues
and construction requirements prepared by IRHE's consultants, Stone and
Webster Management Consultants, Inc. (USA), and based, in part, on Chas. T.
Main's Master plan dated November 1972. A mission composed of Messrs.
Alan A. M. onslow and Helmut Wieseman visited panama in February/March 1973
to appraise the proJect and IRHE's power division. This appraisal report is
based on the reports of Chas. T. Main and Stone and Webster, and on the
findings of the Bank mission.

2.  TIE POWER SECTOR
General
2.01      Panama, with an area of about 7h,000 km2, has a population of 1.5
million (growing at 3.0% per annum), of which about one-half is rural. Most
of the urban residents live in the cities of Panama or Colon. Panama now
ranks fourth in Latin American nations in per capita income which is at the
US$820 level. Since 1968, when the present Government took over, the country's
economy has been growing at an average annual rate of about 8%. Present
expectations are that the economy will continue its recent pace of expansion
and the demand for electricity should therefore continue to grow near the
rates experienced in the recent past.
Sector Organization
2.02      The present sector organization, which originated as a number of
small privately-owned power companies and generating plants, is being
consolidated by IRHE, an autonomous state-owned government agency, original-
ly created under Law No. 37 of January 31, 1961, and charged with coordinat-
ing and expanding electrical power generation and distribution throughout
the Republic.  By 1973, following the acquisition of Compania Panamena de
Fuerza y Luz (FyL) (paragraphs 2.03 and 3.03) IRHE owned about 90% of the
country's installed generating capacity, except for captive industrial plant.
2.03      I3HE presently retails electricity in Panama province, in the
Central provinces of Cocle, Herrera, Los Santos and Veraguas, and in the
eastern provinces of Darien and San Blas, and will shortly supply at whole-
sale to  rvate compa,nies in the towns of Chorrera, Santiago;l and in the
Chiriqui_ province.   IRHE used to supply at wholesale the growth requirements
of FyL, a subsidiary of the Boise Cascade Company (USA), in Panama City and
Colon.  On June 1, 1972 the Government "intervened" FyL and on August 1, 197S,
IRHE acquired its assets and liabilities which include telephones and gas in
addition to electricity.
2.04      An agreement of 1969 provides for power and energy sales from IRHE's
Las Minas No. 2 unit to the Panama Canal Company (PANCANAL).  Another agreement
of 1970 between PANCLNAL and FyL provides for PANCANAL sales of power and
energy to FyL, and for emergency assistance. IRHE and PANCANAL are re-negotiat-
ing the latter contract and informally arranged for maximum mutual assistance
on a "when available" basis.  In order to relieve a projected capacity short-
age in the IRHE system, MRHIK'sales obligation under the 1969 agreement for 30 MW
and 210 GWh per year has been suspended for three years (from September 1, 1972).
Presently, IRIE and PANCANAL interchange power and energy,as agreed on a day-to-
day basis. PANCANAL has a generating capacity of about 160 MW (excluding 30 MW

-a -
floating plant of the US Army) and had a peak demand bf about 120 MW in 1972;
it has no present plane to add further generation capacity as its load is grow-
ing at only 4.5% per annum.
Regulati on
2.05      Until 1957, the power sector was operated exclusively by private
entities under franchises and without any other Government regulation. In
1958, the National Commission for Electric Energy, Telephones and Gas was
established to regulate those three industries. Later that year, Law No. 31
was passed establishing the standards for regulating the electric companies.
However, the provisions of the law were not enforced until Cabinet Decree No. 6
was passed in January 1969 to reform the regulatory Commission. Certain
amendments have since been made to the legislation, including one which
subjected IRHF to regulation. On June 30, 1970, Law No. 214 was passed
establishing standards for the regulation of telecommunications; no law has
been passed establishing the standards for regulating the gas industry, nor
is it the Government's present intention to pass any sucth law.
2.06      Law No. 31, as amended,(Annex 1) provides adequate regulation for
the electric industry and effectively guarantees a minimum rate of return on
net fixed assets in operation, plus working capital of three months' revenue;
the minimum rate in the case of IRFM is 8-3/4L%.  Since it is important that
IIUfS should remain financially viable, assurances have been obtained during
negotiations, as it was done for Loan 661-PAN, that the electricity legislation
will not be amended so as to affect materially and adversely the management
or operation of the Borrower.
Sector Facilities
2.07      The public electric supply comprises four regional systems and about
50 small and isolated diesel installations.  The regional systems are:
(a)  the Metropolitan System with a demand (December 1972) of about
140 MW atid a generating capacity of 176 MW;
(b)  the Wes-t Panama System with a demand of about 6 1W and installed
capacity of 7.5 MW of diesel generators;
(c)  the Central Provinces system (which was the subject of the first
Bank loan to IRH:E) with a demand of 11 MW and capacity of 20 MW;
and
(d)  the Chliriqui Province System of the private Empresas Electricas
de Chiriqui and the Chiriqui Land Company, with a combined load
of 17 MW and capacity of 22 MW.
The existing generating facilities of each of the four interconnected systems
are shown in Annex 2 and on Map ITBRD 10469.
Extension of the ElectricLty Supply
2.08      Over the 10 years 1962-1972, production of electricity in Panama
(excluding PANCANAL) increased by 265%, from 281 to 1,025 GWh. Generating



-5-
capacity, which totaled about 240 MW in 1972, has generally provided
adequate supply except for recent rationing due to forced outages in
IRHE's Metropolitan System (paragraph 5.02).
2.09      In 1970, Panama ranked sixth among Latin American republics, in
terms of per capita generation of electricity for public service. Consump-
tion of electricity by consumer category has evolved since 1962 as follows:
Category of Consumer                                Retail Sales
1962           1967            1971

234.0  100.0   409.2  100.0   716.2  100.0
2.10      The total number of customers in Panama increased by 70% to about
147,000 in the 10 years through 1972. Of the total, about 130,000 were
residential customers, indicating that about 48% of the total population of
Panama have electric service; however, in the Metropolitan Area it is estimated
that about two-thirds of the population have supply. In its 1973-78 expansion
program, IRHE hopes to increase its services so that about 80% of the total
population and about 90% of the Metropolitan Area would have supply.
Power Development Program
2.11      IRHE's 1973 to 1982 expansion program is based on the Master Plan
(paragraph 1.05) which proposes the installation by 1981 of the first stage
(170 MW) of the La Fortuna hydropower plant in the Chiriqui province near
the Costa Rica border (see Map IBRD 10469). The Master Plan assumes a backbone
230 kV double circuit transmission system in operation by 1981, but without
interconnection with Costa Rica's Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE)
system. As La Fortuna is located about midway between San Jose in Costa Rica
and Panama City (the two major potential markets for La Fortuna) the feasibility
of such an interconnection should be studied. The Panamanian Government has
indicated that it would initiate talks with Costa Rica at an early date with
a view to joint planning studies for coordinated expansion of the ICE and IRHE
systems on an interconnected basis. If the Costa Rican Government is interested
in the proposal, such studies would be a necessary part of any Bank appraisal of
the La Fortuna project. Paragraph 5.05 shows the planned generation additions 1974-84.
2.12      Expansion of the IRHE transmission system at 230 kV and 115 kV will
generally be westward from Bayano permitting transfer of Bayano's hydropower
and m4etropolitan Area thermal generation across the Panama Canal to the West
Panama, Central and Chiriqui provinces. As transmission ties to Chorrera,
Divisa, and later David are established, the presently isolated systems of
IRHE in the area, and the private companies at Chorrera, Santiago and Chiriqui
will become part of the national interconnected system and be incorporated
into the economic dispatch and remote control from IRHE's new dispatch center.



As interconnecting ties are established, most local diesel generation in the
provinces will be put on standby or relocated. Annexes 2 and 3 give the
capacities and loads, respectively, of the interconnected system as it is
extended year by year. IRHE's remote isolated systems are not expected to be
joined to the national system, but their generating capacity will be increased
mainly by the installation of small capacity diesel units released from other
parts of the IRHE system.  Additional details of the IRHE expansion program
are given in Chapter 5.

3. THE BORROWER
Legislation
3.01      The Borrower would be the Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y
Electrificacion (IRHE), which is an autonomous agency of the Panamanian
Government, charged with the task of developing the electric power resources
in the country.
3.02      IRHE was created by Law No. 37 of 1961, which assigned to it the
exclusive right to develop the hydro resources of the country, thereby restrict-
ing the expansion of the private companies.  In its early days IRHE was small,
inexperienced and subject to considerable political interference, which led
to mismanagement and an unfavorable financial position. During 1968-69
discussions were held between IRHE, the Government and the Bank to develop
new legislation to improve IRHE's organization and management. Consequently,
in July 1969, Law No. 235 was passed, which replaced Law No. 37, charging
IRHE, inter alia, with the exclusive right to construct and operate all new
sources of generation in the country. This new law gave IRHE a satisfactory
basis on which tocperate as an autonomous agency.
3.03      In mid-1972 IRHE's role again changed significantly when the Govern-
ment purchased the assets and liabilities of Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz
(FyL), a subsidiary of Boise Cascade (USA) and vested them in IRHE. Formerly,
FyL had concessions for the operation of electricity, telephones and gas services
in the cities of Panama and Colon. The Government and the Bank have agreed that
IRHE should be divested of the telephone and gas operations as soon as possible.
The Government has decided to create a new autonomous agency to take over the
telephone operations presently managed by IRHE by January 1, 1974. This timing
is consiuered to be realistic and accordingly, it is a condition   of
effectiveness of the proposed loan that the assets, liabilities, rights and
obligations relating to telephones presently vested in IRHE will be transferred
from IRHE.
3.04      The Government has not yet clarified its thinking on the future of
the gas activities, but it has decided to transfer the gas operations from IRHE
no later than June 30, 1974, and, in a letter dated February 28, 1973, has
given an assurance to the Bank to this effect. The gas operations are insig-
nificant - the net fixed assets being less than US$100,000 as at £ecember 31, 1972.
Organization and Management
3.05      IRHE's Board of Directors is composed of seven members.  At prasent
the Chairman is the Vice-Minister of Planning, and the Vice-Chairman is the
representative of the Industrial Association. Other members are representatives
of the Bankers' Association, Ministry of Commerce, Engineers' Society and
Ministry of Agriculture.  The seventh member, who is an electrical engineer,
is independent. IRHE's annual operating and capital budgets now have to be
approved by the Ministry of Planning, and, while this detracts from the
Institution's autonomy, the Bank has not objected since this procedure should
improve overall fiscal planning in the Republic.



-8-
3.06      Administration is entrusted to a Director General, presently a
capable and experienced engineer, well qualified for his pressnt appointment.
He has been with IRKE for many years and was Chief of IRHE's planning before
being appointed Director General in 1968 by the Revolutionary Government.
It is essential to the Bank's interest that IRHE remains competently managed,
and, during negotiations, the Government confirmed that, on the basis of a
commitment already given under Loan 661-PAN, it will consult with the Bank
prior to any new appointment to the position of Director General.
3.07      IREE's technical operations are presently organized as shown in                  U
Annex h with planning, engineering, operation, maintenance, financial and
administrative functions at division and department level headquartered in
Panama Gity. The Metropolitan Division is located in Panama City also and
an operating section in the Central and West Panama provinces. IRHE employs
about 1,800 people in its electrical activities (this includes former FyL
personnel); this is a reasonable size of staff.
3.08      Prior to 1969 IRHE was deficient in suitable staff in its higher
echelons but, during the last three to foul years, has managed to build up
an adequate team. However, its capacity has been severely strained with
the absorption of FyL, because of the departure of several of FyL's personnel
in higher positions. Added to this has been the need to fully integrate the
power operations of the two companies. IRHE has started to tackle the problem
but there still remains much to be accomplished in this field; it has had a
contract for management consulting services with Stone and Webster of USA
since 1965 and is continuing to use its services. The take-over has substantially
increased system planning requirements and IRHE's present organizational arrange-
mrent and staffing does not provide for effective and experienced system planning.
In order to complete the integration and reorganization, IRHE agreed during
negotiations to continue to use management consultants, acceptable to the Bank
to the extent considered necessary by IRHE and the Bank.
3.09      IT-rE has recently appointed a Director of Administration and Finance
who reports to the Director General and who is responsible for the coordination
of general administration, finance and administration of procurement; he appears
to have the appropriate qualifications for the job. It would be of great benefit
to IRuE if, similarly, a Technical Director were put in charge of the engineering,
construction and operating divisions and of system planning. During appraisal,
the Director General agreed with this view in principle, but is experiencing
difficulty in finding someone who is capable and willing to fill the job, and
he says it would not be feasible to appoint a non-Panamanian. During negotiations,
IRHE. agreed to create the position of a Director of Technical Operations and
fill it with a qualified and experienced person not later than March 31, 1975,
unless,following a study to be made by its consultants, the terms of reference
of which will have been approved by the Bank, IRHE and the Bank are satisfied
that IRilEts technical management is being carried out efficiently without such
a position. The proposed loan would assist in the financing of this study.
3.10      The management and staffing problems mentioned above can be resolved,
or ameliorated through training and by the use of consultants. The execution of
the Project should not be affected by these weaknesses, as IRHE has agreed to
use consultants and enlarge its training program.



-9_
Tariffs
3.11      Tariffs in the Rural (former IRHE) Area are substantially higher than
those in the Metropolitan (former FyL) Area, (see Annex 5 for details). IRHE
intends to make a complete study of its tariffs When it has consolidated its
position following the absorption of FyL, and of the power companies in
Santiago and Chiriqui province in the near future, with a view to revising
them so that there would be similar tariffs in all areas. Making tariffs
more uniform in the country would represent a socially progressive step, but
would require careful investigation to insure that there is no undue emphasis
*          on uniform rates in the different areas and categories.
Insurance
3.12      Insurance is carried against losses arising from a variety of risks,
including civil liability, motor vehicle claims) fire, lightning, etc.,
(specified plants, stores and buildings) and explosion. During negotiations
assurances were received that IRHE will continue to maintain insurance against
such risks and in such amounts as shall be consistent with sound public utility
and business practices.
Accounting and Audit
3.13      Over the past few years, Stone and Webster has revised IREfts
accounting system which is now satisfactory. .FyL's system of accounting is
being revised by Stone and Webster and integrated with that of IRHE. In the
past IRHE's accounts have been audited by Arauz, Hermida y Pazmino, a Panamanian
firm of public accountants associated with the New York firm of Deloitte,
Plender, Haskins and Sells. The auditors are acceptable to the Bank, and
assurances were ootained during negotiations that IRHE will continue to employ
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and will forward certified copies
of the annual financial statements to the Bank within four months of the end
of each financial year, together with the auditors' detailed reports.

4. THE PROJECT
IRHE's Expansion Program
4.01      IRHE's expansion program for the period 1973-1977 comprises the
completion of ongoing works of the Second IBRD Project financed under Loan
661-PAN; the proposed Project (see paragraphs 4.06 and following); other
miscellaneous extensions and additions to the systems; and construction
of future generation facilities and associated works. The program is es-
timated to cost US$169.3 million, as shown below:

61,483        107,860        169,343
4.02      The balance of the Second IBRD Power Project consists of:
(a) the initial Bayano (150 MW) hydro development and transmission
line (to be commissioned in the first half of 1976);
(b) the Las Minas steam electric unit No. 4 (40 MW) and
transmission line (September 1974);
(c) distribution system additions; and
(d) studies, training and management consultant services.
Total Second Project cost is presently estimated at about US$78.6 million
equivalent compared with US$58.2 million estimated at the time of its apprais-
al. The breakdown of the cost overrun, which is expected to be covered by
Government contributions, suppliers' credits and IRHE's own resources, is
as follows:

4.03      The revised cost estimate for Bayano is about 33% higher than its
appraisal estimate.  The increase, which is mostly in the civil works and primarily
affects the local currency component, is due to higher unit prices, to a larger
volume of work than originally expected and to a delayed start of the work. This
in turn has been caused by inadequate preliminary engineering studies and field
investigations prepared by IRHE's previous consultant before the appraisal.
Since then, IRH.3 has replaced this consultant by Montreal Engineering Company
(Canada) who has substantially redesigned the project. Difficulties in locating
a suitable quarry for aggregates for Bayano's civil works have also caused further
delay. Additionally, the civil works contractor for Bayano (Energoprojekt of
Yugoslavia) has recently submitted claims to IRHE amounting to about US$6 million
as basalt instead of limestone is being used as concrete aggregate. The remain-
ing amount provided in Loan 661-PAN for contingencies is presently considered
adequate for a negotiated settlement of Energoprojekt's claim. The revised cost
estimate of Las Minas No. 4 and associated transmission line is about 59% higher
than its appraisal estimate due to escalation in equipment prices and to an
additionally needed cooling water intake channel. Part of the cost overruns is
also due to currency realignments since the time of the appraisal in June 1969.
4.o0      Future generation and associated work (to be commissioned after the
proposed Third Bank Project) would require about USZ175 million (through to
completion) of which about US$115 million would be in foreign currency.  The
projects would include:
(a)  one 75 MW steam electric unit at Las Minas (to be commissioned in
October 1978);
(b)  150 MW addition at Bayano (units Nos. 3 and 4) (October 1979 and
October 1980), associated transmission lines and substations;
(c)  studies and training; and
(d)  the first stage construction of La Fortuna's hydro development ( 2 x 85 Md)
(January 1981) with a 230 kV line Divisa-David-La Fortuna and associated
substations.
4.C5      Other IRHER expansion in the 1973-77 period, at a total cost of about
US$31.4 million, will provide (through suppliers' credits and IRHE's own resources)
for: (i) the purchase of about 28 MW of diesel capacity, of which 15 MW of pack-
aged units are for the Metropolitan Area with a December 1973 in service date,
(ii) the detailed engineering of La Fortuna project with associated 230 kV systemss,
(iii) subtransmission and distribution system additions, and (iv) general plant



- 12 -
consisting of office, laboratory, communication and transportation equipment,
and buildings, including a main office building.
Thex Bank Project
4.06      The Third Power Project, which is proposed for Bank financing and
which is more fully described in Annex 6, would consist of:
(a) a thermal power plant of about 25 MW to be installed in the
Metropolitan Area;
(b) about 188 km of 230 kV douible-circuit transmission line (initially
operated at 115 kV) between Panama Substation, Chorrera and Divisa;
(c) about 41 km of 115 kV single-circuit transmission line
between Chitre and Divisa, and about 25 km of 115 kV
double-circuit transmission lines in the Metropolitan Area;
(d) substations with a total capacity of about 200 MVA (stepping
down from 115 kV and for switching) near Chitre, Aguadulce,
Chorrera, Cerro Viento, Tocumen, San Francisco, Maranon, and
at Las Ymnas and Panama substations, including two mobile
substations with a total capacity of about 40 GVA;
(e)  aboub 110 km of subtransmission li.nes and related substations;
(f)  distribution system expansion 1974-76;
(g) a system load dispatch center at the Panama Substation,
including a related communication system; and
(h)  studies, engineering and technical training.
The Project would be completed by June 30, 1977.
4.07      Because of recently accelerated load growth (paragraph 5.02) and
delay of Bayano into the first half of 1976 (paragraph 1.03), the 25 MW of
thermal capacity is needed by April 1975 if extensive power rationing is to
be avoided during at least one year. As steam electric plant cannot be
installed in the short time available, the additional 25 MW will have to be
either gas turbine or diesel. The least-cost solution would be medium-speed,
residual fuel oil burning diesels, if such diesels are available at recent
prices for quick installation; if not, IRHE will have to purchase a packaged
gas turbine.
4.08      The 230 kV double-circuit transmission line between Panama Substation,
Chorrera and Divisa will form the first stage of the backbone transmission system.
The Panama Substation - Chorrera section will cross the Canal with provisions
for future addition of a second 230 kV double-circuit transmission line. IRHE,
MtAIN and PANCANAL have defined and reached agreement on the routing of the crossing.
To improve reliability of 115 kV supply from the Las Minas power plant, its
115 kV switching station will be rehabilitated and relocated as part of the
project, which would release space for more thermal units at Las Minas site
(paragraph h.11).



- 13 -
4.09      Since most of the existing 60 Nfd generating facilities in Panama City
and Colon are old and inefficient, 6 MW at Colon will be retired and the balance
of 54 MW will provide peaking or standby service, after the commissioning of
Bayano No. 1 and 2 units. This change in operation will require bulk supply
of the Metropolitan System from Panama Substation through about 25 km of 115 kV
double-circuit interconnecting lines; about 100 MVA of transformers and
distribution switchgear, and related subtransmission and distribution lines.
To provide for more flexible operation and construction of facilJties, the
Project also incluaes one mobile step-down substation for the Metropolitan
Area (about 25 MVA) and one for the Central provinces (about 15 MVA). The
Project provides also for IMHE's distribution system additions during 1974.,
1975 and 1976.
4.10      The communication system and load dispatch center at Panama Substation
will incluce facilities required by the integration of existing and new generation
sources, and provide safe, reliable and efficient central control of IRHE's
interconnected system operation.  It will also facilitate frequency regulation
of the system interconnected with PANCANAL.
4.11      viith FyL now  integrated with IRHE, the two contiguous Las Mlinas steam
plant sites should be developed as one site, since the combined site, with a
second fuel oil line from the nearby refinery, might accommodate a total of
650 BMW, instead of the 350 MW assumed in the Master Plan. In order to advance
proJect preparation, IRHE has submitted to the Bank satisfactory Terms of
Reference for consultants' feasibility studies of the Las Minas 75 MW addition
(which include investigation of the ultimate maximum utilization of the Las
Minas site) and of the Bayano units Nos. 3 and 4 additions.
Technical Training
4.12      In view of the good results obtained, IRH{ will continue to send its
technical personnel to the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority for training
in maintenance. However, as IRHE's power development program provides for
large additions of high voltage transmission which will require a radical
departure from present operating practices, the proposed loan provides for the
foreign exchange cost of a balanced program which would include training of:
Ci) management personnel; (ii) engineers in the execution of construction
projects; and (iii) operating personnel in interconnected system operation and
maintenance of related equipment. During negotiations, IRHE agreed to prepare,
as a condition of loan effectiveness, (and subsequently to implement) a training
program for its present and future requirements which would be acceptable to
the Bank.
Project Cost Estimate
4.13      The costs of the Project were estimated by IRHE's consultants, MAIN,
and Stone and Webster (both of USA) in the second half of 1972 before the 1973
currency realigruaents. The cost estimates were revised during the appraisal
in conjunction with IRHE and both consultants and adjusted to current levels.
in addition to allowances for physical contingencies at about 159 of direct
construction costs, allowances for price escalation on both local and foreign
costs are included at 5' per annum compunded.



- iL -
4.14      The estimated Project cost totals US$38.5 million as shown below.
Included in the proposed loan is US$2.7 million, to cover the inTerest and commitment
fee on the Bank loan payable to Jme 1976, when about E5% of the loan would be disbursed.

Engineering and Construction
4.15      Since IRHE and the Govnement wish to avoid power rationing it is essential that the
order for the 25 MW thermal plant should be placed as soon as possible
(paragraph 5. 10).  IRHE has therefore contracted with Electroconsult of Italy, who has
prepar ed bidding documents on a supply and install basis for a 25 MW packaged
gas turbine with alternative offers for 25 M1 of medium-speed, residual fuel
oil burning, diesel engines. As the plant should be in operation by April
1975, time of delivery is important, and this factor will be taken into account
in the seJection of type of plant and evaluation of bids. To proceed quickly
with the ordering of other urgent items, required for commissioning in 1975,
IRTE, and its consultants (MAIN) are presently preparing engineering and bid
documents for 115 kV lines and substations.
4.16      IRHE's designs for transmission, subtransmission and distribution
lines and substations are being standardized with the assistance of MAIN.
Once standard substation types have been engineered, repeat installations will
use the same specifications.



- 15 -
4.17      In April 1973, IRHE contracted MAIN's services for the engineering
and design of La Fortuna and the 230 kV La Fortuna - Panama Substation
double-circuit steel tower line; these services will be partly financed by
an .Export-Import Bank loan and are not part of the Project. For the engineer-
ing of the Project's 115 kV lines and substations, IRHE has separately
contracted for consulting services with MaIN, which would be eligible for
retroactive financing under the proposed loan (paragraph 4.22). Supervision
of constructing the 115 kV transmission lines and substations will be carried
out mainly by former FyL personnel, who have had previous 115 kV construction
experience; consultants will assist when and where necessary.  IRaE has retained
MAIN to provide the consulting engineering for the communication system expansion
and the installation of the load dispatch center.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.18      Procurement of goods and services to be financed out of the loan,
other than consulting, engineering and training services, would be on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. Contracts for equipment and materials for generation, transmission
and subtransmission lines and substations, load dispatch and communication
system would be let on a "supply and install" basis whereas those for distrib-
ution materials and equipment would be on a "supply" basis only.
4.19      The equipment and materials to be financed by the loan are not presently
manlufactured in Panama. However, there is a possibility in the future that local
industry might be able to manufacture a small amount of the equipment and/or
materials required.  Accordingly, a margin of preference of 15%, or the actual
custom duty, whichever is lower, would be allowed for the purpose of comparing
bids for equipment manufactured in Panama. No country enjoys preferential tariff
rates on any gooas to be procured for the Project as Panama is not a member of
any group with regional trading arrangements.
4.20      Panamanian law requires IRHE to allow a 20% preference for domestic
supplies, but the Government agreed during negotiations to take the necessary
measures to permit IRHE to comply with the margin of local preference described
in paragraph 4.19.
h.21      Disbursements would be made only for the foreign currency cost of
training, services and imported m.aterials and equipment, except for materials
ana equipment which might be produced in Panama in the future for transmission
lines, substations and electric utility distribution systems if procured under
international competition in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. A schedule
of quarterly disbursements under the proposed loan is shown in Annex 7. Any
fundsremaining undisbursed on completion of the Froject would be cancelled.
h.22      In order to be able to meet the estimated demand, IRHE has already
contracted for some engineering studies and services (paragrapqs 4.15 and 4.17).
It has been assumed that the proposed loan will be signed by November 30, 1973,
and on this basis IJS$300,000 retroactive financing for consulting services and
training is recoTmmended for expenditures incurrod after Flarch 31, 1973; (bid
pre~paration and studies for 25 Md thermal genpration, 115 kV lines, substations
and training).  If IRHE should be in a position to place the order for tlle 25 MW
thermal generation before loan signing, it is recommended that the proposed loan
provide additional retroactive financing in an amount up to US$500,000.  IRE! does
not expect to make any other payments under the proposed loan prior to its signing.

Project Coordination
4.23      IPIE intends to appoint a Program Supervisor and Coordinator, who
would serve as a normal channel to the Bank; this should improve on the quality
of progress reports to the Bank and speed up their submission.
Environmental Aspects
4.24      The generating plant provided under the project (gas turbine or
medium-speed diesels) would be equipped with appropriate silencers, filters
and cooling systems designed to abate noise and water pollution.

5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
5.01      During the five years 1967-71, energy consumption in the Republic
of Panama has grown at an average annual rate of about 14%. As part of the
Hydropower Development and Feasibility Study for Panama, MAIN has prepared
a load forecast for the 1973-82 period. This forecast is based on two inde-
pendent forecasting methods and on certain assumptions about the economic
growth of the country in future years (see Annex 8). The rate of growth of
energy consumption is predicted at 13.5f annually during 1973 to 1975 and
at about 12% annually thereafter, or slightly lower than the past five
years. These growth rates appear reasonable.
5.02      MAIN's forecast for IRHE's interconnected system, excluding sales
to PANCANAL (paragraph 2.04), provides for new loads not envisaged during
the Second Power Project appraisal and is, consequently, about 28 MW higher
on the average during 1973 to 1976. The result of the faster load growth
has been: (i) substantial rationing of load by IRHE and PANCANAL during
1972/73, (ii) IRHE's emergency purchase, under a supplier credit (paragraph
4.05), of 15 MW of diesels (burning expensive distillate) for 1973 instal-
lation, and (iii) PANCANALts emergency purchase of a 22 MW gas turbine.
5.03      The power expansion program proposed in the Master Plan (paragraph
5.05) is tailored to fit the projected increase in power and energy require-
ments as shown in Annex 3. This Annex indicates that, until Bayano comes into
operation in the first half of 1976, the IRHE interconnected system would
lack generating capacity to carry out essential and indispensable maintenance
of its 40 MW steam units and would have to rely for this purpose and during
other emergencies on PANCANAL's spare generating capacity, even with the
installation of the 25 MW thermal generation included in the Project (para-
graph 2.04).
5.04      Annex 3 also shows actual 1972 and forecast generation requirements
and power and energy balances on the IRHE Interconnected System for the period
up to 1982, net of the relatively small existing demand met by the presently
isolated companies' own generating plants. It is expected that these compa-
nies will continue to use their generating facilities after interconnection,
by making optimum use of their hydro facilities and by operating their diesels
during peak demand or as standby. Some old diesels would be retired.
Least Cost Solution
5.05      The opportunity cost of capital in Panama is in the range of 10 to
12% and a discount rate of 11% was used to select the most economic alterna-
tive for the Master Plan. The minimum margin used for generating capacity
reserve was the size of the largest unit in the system. MAIN's recommended
Master Plan proved the feasibility of La Fortuna hydroelectric project for
initial operation after 1980 and included a detailed economic comparison with
alternative hydro and thermal power sources. MAIN's studies for the Master
Plan indicated that the generation addition program for IRHE's interconnected
system, as shown below, would cost less than any other practicable expansion
pattern, including the development of thermal capacity only:

The proposed 25 MW thermal capacity addition, estimated to cost about 10  of
the proposed Project, is an integral part of the above program.
5.06      In accordance with the Master Plan, IRHE intends to expand the inter-
connection of its system over the next ten years as follows (see Maps IBRD
1o469 and 19470):

As anintegrl part of the above program the proposed Project provides for the incor-
poration of the Central provinces into the interconnected system. The associated
transmission and subtransmission facilities, including Load Dispatch and Com-
munication System, represent about 550 of the cost of the proposed Project.
5.07      The Master Plan recommends, as the least cost solution for long-term
development of the three regional systems of West Panama, Central provinces
and Chiriqui province, their successive interconnection with the Metropolitan
Area during the 1973-79 period; these systems are located about 40 km, 190 km
and 400 km from the Metropolitan Area system. MAIN compared the cost of long-
term supply of these presently isolated systems with local generation versus
importing power from IRHE's presently interconnected system assuming generation
expansion without La Fortuna. The successive integration was found to be the
least cost solution for discount rates up to 20% for the interconnection of
West Panama, up to l5c' for the interconnection of the Central provinces and up
to 125 for the interconnection of Chiriqui province.
5.08      The Master Plan also reviewed the economics of 115 kV, 230 kV and
345 kV for the regional integration and for interconnection with La Fortuna.
230 kV is the most economic voltage in the long-term, but initial operation
(during the first 5 years) at 115 kV, of lines built for 230 kV, results in
the least cost solution; MAIN's analysis was based on the transmission capacity



- 19 -
necessary for full use of La Fortuna's ultimate power potential of 255 MW.
The subtransmission voltages for the Metropolitan Division and the Central
provinces had been previously established at 115 kV and 34 kV, respectively.
5.09      The "Communications and Load Dispatch Feasibility Study" prepared
by MAIN under a UNDP grant, with the Bank acting as executing agency, esta-
blished a computer directed system as the least cost solution to provide
interconnected system dispatch. The proposed system permits modular expan-
sion of the dispatch center with equipment of the required high reliability.
The two computers of the system, in addition to system control and continuous
automatic economic dispatch, allow for off-line engineering calculations
and system planning studies and thus for in-house training and more efficient
use of IRHEts engineering talent.
5.10      As mentioned in paragraph  4.15, no decision can be taken on the
selection of the type of 25 MW thermal plant until the bids are evaluated.
However, both the very high load factor of the interconnected system (72d1
on an annual basis and 771 in July - see Annex 8, paragraph 7) and the very
high base load, favor generating plant additions with inherently low fuel
and production costs; the system also requires dependable production faci-
lities and higher reserves of generating capacity than is usually justified
for systems with lower load factors. Under these circumstances, medium-
speed, residual fuel oil burning diesels would be the least cost solution
for the next thermal capacity addition; but it may not be possible to install
such diesels quickly enough in order to meet the demand, in which case IRHE
would have to purchase a packaged gas turbine (paragraph 4.07). In either
case (with a gas turbine or with medium-speed diesels) the thermal generation
provided under the Project would defer requirements of new generation in
future years and firm up: (i) Bayanots capacity in the dry season after
units No. 3 and 4 are installed, and (ii) La Fortuna's operation in its
first stage with two units, when it would provide, during 1981 to 1985,
essentially peaking capacity with only a monthly storage reservoir.
5.11      A month by month analysis indicated that in the 12 months prior
to commissioning of 3ayano, with the largest unit out for emergency repairs
and no assistance available from PANCANAL, power rationing could amount to
45 MW, or 207 of the load if additional thermal capacity is not added now.
To minimize prospective rationing IRHE and the Government, therefore, con-
sider the 25 MW addition as a minimum measure to prevent industrial and
commercial users from installing small, higher fuel cost generators.
Return on Project and Program Investment
5.12      As the Project provides substantially for transmission which will
be fully utilized only after 1983, the return on the program investment,
rather than on the Project, has been calculated. In estimating the benefits
of such investment (required to meet the increase in demand forecast during
1972 to 1984), it was assumed that the economic value of the electricity
supplied is at least equal to the price paid by the ultimate consumers.
On this basis, benefits are measured by incremental revenue attributable
to the program while financial costs are adjusted for taxes, inflation and
internal transfers. As shown in Annex 9, the rate of return on program



- 20 -
investment is at least 13.2%. However, the incremental revenue understates
the benefits consumers will receive from the program investment since the
level of tariffs is, and has been, low and increases in tariff level, which
will be needed to cover the full costs of the incremental supply, would not
result in a significant reduction in the projected demand. Also, as the
25 MW of thermal generation in the Project will: (i) help reduce electricity
rationing during 1975/76, and (ii) firm up future hydro generation (paragraph
5.10) - neither of which can be fully quantified - the return on the Project
itself would be somewhat higher than on the program.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.o0      IRHE's growth, since the Bank made its first loan to it in 1962
for rural electrification, has been dynamic.  During the last two or three
years its financial strength has grown, but so, too, have its financial
requirements. It has had to rely heavily on Government contributions for
its capital expansion program and will have to continue to do so at least
through 1975, after which time IRXE should be able to finance most of the
local currency for its expansion program from its internal cash generation and by
the issue of Bonds, and thus reduce its dependence on Government contributions.
Past Record and Present Position
6.02      Income accounts for 1969-72 are summarized in Annex 10.  The accounts
for 1972 include the results for five months of the Electricity Department of
the former FyL. The gross revenues of the "old"t IRHE have increased from
US$3-5 million in 1969 to US$8.7 million in 1972; and in 1973, with a full
year's operation in the Metropolitan Area, it is estimated that IRHE's total
electricity revenues will be some US$27.6 million.  This demonstrates graph-
ically IRHE's metamorphosis from a small rural power supplier to a national
authority. The net operating income of the 'told" IRHE has increased three-
fold during the four years, which is outstanding by any standards. IRHE made
substantial increases in the amount of its payroll at the end of 1972. This
was due in part to the placing of FyL and IRHE employees on the same basis as
regards wages, overtime and fringe benefits, and also in part to an overall
pay increase. These increases have been projected in the forecasts. The
estimated operating ratio of 63% for 1973 is reasonable for a nearly all-thermal
system with about 11% of its sales coming from low density areas.
6.03      The following summarizes IRFE's Balance Sheet as at December 31, 1972,
(Annex 11) insofar as it relates to electricity.

6.04      01;t of the total electricity accounts receivable of B 7.26 million,
about B 3.08 million is due from the Government, for which notes, payable
over a period of three years at 6% p.a. interest,have either been issued,
or are in the process of baing issued. Additionally, the Government's 1973
budget failed to make adequate provision for full payment of its 1973
electricity accounts, and it is estima;ed that there is a shortfall of
about B 900,000. The Government has said it will include any unpaid balance
of 1973 accounts in its 1974 budget or, alternatively, issue two or three-
year notes: full provision would be made for payment of its 1974 accounts.
The remainder of accounts receivable, US$L.16 million, represents about
59 days billings; while tnis is not a cause for undue concern, every effort
snould be made to reduce it as much as possible.  IRHE's past depreciation
policy ras been considered adequate, but the Government had thought FyLts
depreciation to be too low - hence it paid less than FyL's book value for
the assets acquired. IPRE has included the FyL assets in its books at the
lower value, but it has recently requested Stone and Webster to make a study
of the rates of depreciation which IRHE should adopt on all its assets,
and, during negotiations, IRHE agreed to afford the Bank an opportunity to
review this report. The liabilities which IRHE took over from FyL included
long-term debts, the portion of which attributable to electricity being
US$114 million. The terms of these debts were of medium duration, and, as
a result, hive increased IRHEts debt service substantially, although, of
course, internal cash generation will also be increased.

6.o5      The estimated sources and applications of funds of IRHE for the six
year period 1973-78 are shown in Annex 12.  After taking into account the
additional cash which will be generated in order to achieve the minimum rate
of return, (paragraph 6.09), :iRFl's financing plan for the four years 1974-1977,

including a grace period of about four years.  Semi-annual repayments would
commence in the first half of 1978. The loan would be guaranteed by the
Panamanian Government.
6.07      Compared with the financing plan for the Bayano Project, IRHE's current
forecasts show a marked improvement, reflecting its increase in size. Net interna:
cash generation will be 15%, whereas it was previously estimated at 3%, and, with
IRHE now in a position to rely more on outside borrowing and less on Government
equity contributions, the latter are now only 14%, most of which will be for
thie Bayano Project.
6.0       Of the various loans shown in paragraph 6.05, apart from the proposed
Bank- loan, tl-e IRRE Bonds and the future foreign loans have yet to be arranged.
Those two sources of funds total US$39 million during 1974-77 and would be
needed for future projects, i.e. La Fortuna and associated projects (expenditure
during the same period is estimated at US$36 million), and do not affect the
financing of the proposed and current Bank Projects. It is therefore not considere
essential to obtain firm financial commitments at this stage. For the purpose
of the financial forecasts, it is assumed that IREE will be able to issue its
own Bonds, with Government guarantee, carrying an interest rate of about 8% and
maturing 10-15 years after issue.  Local banks have made a commitment to grant
overdrafts which are estimated to reach US$13 million, without a commitment fee,
and it is expected that they would be partly refinanced out of the Bond issue.
The amount of the Government equity contributions and the terms on which the



- 24 -
Bonds would be issued, have been proposed by the Panamanian Government.
However, in order to insure that the Project, once commenced, is not
frustrated through lack of funas, the Government agreed during negotiations
to arrange, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, the financing
of any sums necessary to enable IRig to complete the Project.
Financial Forecasts
6.09      The forecast income accounts (Annex 13) are based on IRHE's current
level of tariffs and other assumptions mentioned in the Annex. From Annex 13
it will be seen that IRHE's net revenue falls short of the 8.75% permitted by
Law for the years 1975 onwards. Income will have to be increased or expendes
reduced.  Whatever method is adopted, B 3.6 million additional cash would have
to be generated in the period 1975-78. IRHE agreed during negotiations to
continue to set its tariffs at a level sufficient to yield the rate of return
provided in the electricity legislation, and the Governnent agreed not to
amend the electricity legislation so as to adversely affect IRHE's finances.
It may, however, be possible to increase tariffs in 1975 so that more than
8.75% is earned, which would reduce IRHE's borrowings.  Following the
cancellation of a 10% co-efficient of adjustment (see Annex 1) in favor of
the consumer in April 1973, and an increase in the fuel surcharge due to
increased fuel costs, it would be politically unacceptable to the Government
to raise tariffs during 1974 above the 8.75% level, subsequent to its comparatively
recent acquisition of FyL.
6.1O      During the six years 1973-1978, the net fixed assets in operation
are expected to increase from B 61 million at the beginning of 1973 to
B 203 million at the end of 1978 (Annex 14). Interest coverage is low, but
sufficient, (1.4 - 1.9 times net operating income) - see Annex 15. Similarly,
debt service coverage is low but adequate; annual debt service being covered
between 1.3 and 1.5 times by internal cash generation. Debt/equity ratio
increases from 47/53 in 1972 to 55/45 in 1978, reflecting IRFE's added reliance
on borrowing instead of Government contributions. Nevertheless, the ratio
is satisfactory. To insure that its future financial position will not be
impaired, IRH3 agreed during negotiations to a covenant similar to those in
existing loans, whereby it will not borrow without prior approval of the Bank,
unless it is able to meet a l.4 debt service test.

7.  AGREKENTS REACHED AID RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  with the Panamanian Government that it will:
(i)  not amend the electricity legislation so as to materially
and adversely affect the Borrower (paragraphs 2.06 and 6.09);
(ii)  make it possible for IRHE to comply with the Bank's 15%
local preference limit (paragraph 4.20); and
(iii)  provide IRHE with any funds necessary to complete the
Project (paragraph 6.08),.
(b)  with IRHE that it will:
(i)  continue to use management consultants acceptable
to the Bank to the extent considered necessary by
IRHE and the Bank (paragraph 3.08);
(ii)  create the position of Director of Technical Operations
and unless the Bank agrees otherwise, fill it by
March 31, 1975 (paragraph 3.09);
(iii) continue to maintain insurance coverage (paragraph 3.12);
(iv)  continue to employ independent auditors and to
send the Bank the auditors' report and audited accounts
within four months of the end of its fiscal year
(paragrapa 3.13);
(v)  implement a training program acceptable to the Bank
(paragraph 4.12);
(vi)  afford the Bank an opportunity to review the report on
valuation and depreciation of its fixed assets
(paragraph 6.0o4);
(vii)  continue to set its tariffs in accordance with existing
legislation (paragraph 6.09); and
(viii)  agree to a 1.4 debt service test (paragraph 6.10).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan are that:
(a) the assets relating to telelphones presently vested in IRHE
will be transferred from IRiiE (paragraph 3.03); and



- 26 -
(b)  IRHE will prepare a training program acceptable to the Bank
(paragraph 4.12).
7.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$30 million (equivalent) for a term of about 20 years, including a
4-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRIFICACION
PANAVIA
LEGISLATION
A. DECREE LAW NO. 31 OF SEPTENBER 27, 1958 (AS AMENDED)
Decree Law No. 31 lays down the standards for the control of generation
and distribution of electricity over 50 kilowatts and requires undertakings engaged
in the industry to obtain a concession. All future generation is to be undertaken
by IRHE. A concessionaire whose contract comprises distribution services, will
be compelled to supply annually up to 1.1 times the amount of power supplied
the previous year for public service.
The National Commission of Electricity, Gas and Telephones has the
right to determine the value of the assets within certain rules and with certain
rights of appeal. Concessionaires are entitled to a rate of return on net
fixed assets and working capital of three months' gross revenue, varying with
their capital structure and annual sales, as follows:
Percentage of capital                       Sales in kWh
in bonds, preferred         over          15,000,001 -         under
stocks and loans        25,000,000       25,000,000        15,000,001
15% or less              9-1/2%             10%             10-1/2%
15.1% to 30%             9-1/4%           9-3/4%            10-1/4%
30.1% to 50%               9%             9-1/2%              10%
over 50%                 8-3/h%           9-1/4%             9-3/4%
Capital should not be more than 60% in bonds nor more than 62%
among bonds, preferred stocks or loans. Depreciation is allowed as an expense
but rates are undetermined other than "not exceeding as a whole, that indicated
by the normal operation of the industry of electricity for companies similar
in size and type of generation."
The difference between the actual and permitted amounts of return
will be registered in a stabilization account and carried forward. This
procedure effectively guarantees the return. However, in the case of IRHE,
if the year's operations result in a credit balance in the stabilization
account it may charge the income tax it would have paid if it were not tax
exempt, as an operating expense, thus increasing the permitted return to
about 15%. The Regulatory Commission is authorized to suspend application
of th.e price reduction (see (c) below), if, in the Commission's opinion,
IRISE has insufficient intarnal cash generation for its construction
program.
The law lays down the following timetable to be followed by con-
cessionaires and the commission.
(a) Accounts and financial and technical data are to be furnished by
the concessionaire within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year.



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 3 pages
(b) The commission should, if necessary, contest such accounts and
information within 120 days of presentation.
(c)  An adjustment in the price per kilowatt hour shall be deter-
mined by the debit or credit in the stabilization account
and applied to sales from the first day of the third month
following the end of each fiscal year.
(d) The commission must give its decision on a tariff revision
within 60 days (90 days if complex) of receipt of the request.
The decision can be appealed to the commission for reconsideration
within 15 days of it being communicated to the. concessionaire
and the appeal must be decided within 30 days.
A concessionaire is required to invest in the  expansion  of his
services, increase the working capital or both, an amount equivalent to at
least 25% of the net gains which are available to common stockholders as
dividend, plus the amount allocated during the last year to reserve for
depreciation, after making the necessary reimbursements for the amortiza-
tion of bonds and other capitals.
B. DECREE LAW NO. 235 oF JULY 30, 1969 (AS AMENDED)
Decree Law No. 235 charges IRHE with planning, expanding, diver-
sifying and rationalizing the generation, transmission and distribution of
electric power throughout the Republic, with the exclusive competence to
construct and operate all new sources of generation, with certain trans-
sitory exclusions.  Functions relative to irrigation, flood control and
maintenance of river navigation, which were previously assigned to IRHE
have now been transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and Industry.
IRHE is exempt from all taxation, other than Social Security taxes.
The law provides for a Board of Directors consisting of seven
members appointed by the President of the Republic with the approval of the
National Assembly. Three members are ex-officio: one representative each
from the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry
of Commerce. These members hold office so long as they are employees or
officials of the respective ministries or state agencies. The other four
members are appointed for a period of seven years and are eligible for re-
appointment, the terms are staggered so that not more than one of these four
directors retires at the same time. One represents the Banking Association;
another, the Federation of Industrialists; the third is a Civil Engineer, who
must be a member of the Panamanian Society of Engineers and Architects; and
the fourth an electrical engineer. The Comptroller General of the Republic,
or his representative, may attend Board meetings with the right to speak but
not to vote. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman are elected by the Board. The
Board controls the broad policy of IRHE, and authorizes, inter alia, salary
scales, expenditures over 325,OOD, and electricity tariffs.



A  Xl
Page 3 of 3 pages
The Director General, who is the legal representative of IRHE
and its Chief Executive Officer, is appointed by the President of the
Republic, subject to the approval of the National Assembly. His term of
office is for a period of six years, with eligibility for reappointment. He
may be dismissed from his post only by a court judgment because of an
offense or because of failure to comply with certain requirements specified
in the Decree, or he can be dismissed for manifest incapacity by the Executive
with full cabinet approval.
The Director General is responsible to the Board for the day to day
operation of IRHE under the broad policy of the Board.  He has the right to
attend Board meetings and to propose motions and to speak, but not to vote.
He appoints and dismisses subordinate personnel, submits for approval budgets,
investment plans, tariffs, etc., and authorizes expenditure of amounts of less
than $25,000. IRHE's annual budgets must be approved by the Minister of Plan-
ing and are subject to amendment by him.
Decree Law No. 235 provides IRHE with the following financial contri-
bution from the Government:
(1)  "A State subsidy of B 100,000 a month, which shall be delivered
to the Institute by the Office of the Comptroller-General of the
Republic or the Ministry of Finance and the Treasury7, from funds
of the National Treasurey, within the first five days of each
month. The necessary appropriations to comply with this provision
shall be included in all national budgets with effect from the
year 1970. This subsidy shall diminish by B 120,000 a year with
effect from 1980.t
(2)  "An additional capital in cash, contributed by the Nation for
purposes of investment, in accordance with the National Electri-
fication Plan, of not less than B 20,000,000 or more than
B 30,000,000, which shall be delivered to the Institute within
the next seven years,(i.e., before July 30, 1976) in such annual
contributions as shall be required for the National Electrification
Plan."

APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRIFICACION
PANAMA
DESCRIPTION OF IRHE'S THIRD POWER PROJECT
Summary of Project
1.        The proposed Third Power Project would include:
(a) A thermal power plant of about 25 MW to be installed at the
site of IRHEts existing San Francisco thermal power plant in
Panama City;
(b) About 188 km of 230 kV double-circuit transmission line Pan a
Substation - Chorrera - Divisa, with substation facilities 1
at Chorrera (40 MVA) for initial 115 kV operation;
(c) About 41 km of 115 kV single-circuit transmission line Chitre-
Divisa, and about 25 km of 115 kV double-circuit transmission
lines in the Metropolitan Area, with related substation faci-
lities l/at Chitre (15 MVA), Aguadulce (15 MVA), Cerro Viento
(15 MVA), Tocumen (2 x 15 MVA), San Francisco (25 NVA), Marafnon
(25 MVA), Las Minas (switchyard rehabilitation), and two mobile
substations with a total capacity of 40 MVA;
(d) About 110 km of subtransmission lines and related substations
(12.5 MVA);
(e) Distribution plant for IRHE s Metropolitan and Rural Operating
Divisions;
(f) A system load dispatch center at the Panama Substation, includ-
ing a related communication system; and
(g) Studies, engineering and technical training.
/ All transformer ratings are OA (self cooled).

25 MW Thermal Generation
2.        IRHE's Third Power Project includes 25 MW thermal capacity without
which substantial power rationing in IRHEts Metropolitan Division would be
necessary in 1975/76. As steam plant cannot be installed in the short time
available, gasturbine or diesel capacity has to be added.  Medium-speed,
residual fuel oil burning diesels would be the optimum choice from a least-
cost solution consideration. However, as timing is critical and such diesels
may not be available for quick installation, IRHE may have to purchase instead
a packaged gasturbine of about 25 MW. This self-contained generation capacity
would be installed at the site of IRHE's existing San Francisco power plant
on the Pacific coast in the eastern part of Panama City on simple foundations
and would be connected to the existing 13.8 kV system.
3.        The purchase order for the 25 MW thermal generation would be
awarded as soon as possible. For this reason IRHE has contracted Electro-
consult of Italy and prepared bid documents for a 25 MW packaged gas turbine
and also for 25 MW medium-speed, residual fuel oil burning diesels. To
avoid power rationing IRHE intends to award the contract only for such
equipment that will meet the April 1975 in-service date. If suppliers
of both types of generating plant guarantee to meet this deadline, IRHE will
purchase the plant which results in least evaluated owning cost. The rules
for the evaluation have been established by the consulting firm in the bidding
documents. To allow for quick installation IRHE plans to make the award
under a "supply and erect" contract following international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
Transmission and Distribution Plant Expansion
4.        The Master Plan, prepared by MAIN, recommends that by 1982 IRHEts
system embrace two major hydroelectric developments - at Bayano (1975) in
the east and at La Fortuna on the Chiriqui river in the west (1981) - connected
by a backbone double-circuit 230 kV transmission line, with major substations
at Panama City (1975), La Chorrera (115 kV in 1975 and 230 kV in 1979), Divisa
(1979), and David (1979). The regional substransmission systems would receive
power for delivery at Chitre and at Aguadulce in the Central provinces (1976).
On this basis, the Project provides for the installation of about 188 km of
230 kV double-circuit transmission line (to be operated at 115 kV until 1979)
and to be installed by July 1975 between Panama Substation and Chorrera and
by October 1976 between Chorrera and Divisa. The Panama Substation - Chorrera
section will cross the Panama Canal Zone and the Canal (the latter between
Cerro Paraiso and Cerro Luisa with the required minimum clearance for the
Canal shipping). Provisions will be made in the Canal Zone and in the
Canal crossing for the future construction of a second 230 kV double-
circuit transmission line. IRHE, MAIN and representatives of PANCANAL
have defined and reached agreement on the routing of the crossing and MAIN
has been contracted by IRHE for the design of the 230 kV Panama Substation -
Divisa line. Stepdown substations will be connected to this line at Chorrera
and Aguadulce and a 115 kV single-circuit line Divisa-Chitre (41 km) will
connect a stepdown substation at Chitre to the interconnected system by
October 1976.



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 4 page8
5.        To improve reliability of 115 kV supply from the Las Minas power
plant, its 115 kV switching station will be rehabilitated as part of the
project.  For this purpose, a new bus will be built, using existing breakers,
switches, etc. to provide for an operating reliability comparable to that
to be expected from the breaker-and-a-half design at the Panama Substation.
The relocation of the bus will release space required for the addition of
possibly up to four 75 MW units at the Las Minas plant.
6.        IRHE's 1973-78 transmission and distribution construction program
for its Metropolitan Division is based on 1972 load predictiorBby areas.
Most of the existing Panama City and Colon area generation is old and in-
efficient. For this reason, 6 MW (at Colon) will be retired in 1976 and
the balance of 54 MW will only provide peaking or standby service after
the commissioning of Bayano No. 1 and 2 units; as a result, bulk supply
from Panama substation by double-circuit 115 kV lines to Maraiton, San
Francisco, Cerro Viento and Tocumen stepdown substations will be required.
The Project provides for this purpose about 25 km of 115 kV double-circuit
lines, transformers (with about 100 MVA total capacity) and distribution
switchgear at the mentioned stepdown substations, and related subtransmis-
sion and distribution lines. To provide for more flexible operation and
construction of facilities the Project includes one mobile stepdown sub-
station for the Metropolitan Area and one for the aentral provinces of 25 and
15 MVA, respectively. The project provides also for IRHE's distribution
system additions during 1974, 1975 and 1976.
Communication System and Load Dispatch Center
7.        with the incorporation of the former FyL system ^s the IRHE
Metropolitan Division, IRHEts personnel has become responsible for opera-
ting the IRHE-PANCANAL interconnection. The physical interconnection is
between PANCANAL and former FyL. The PANCANAL system operates continuously
in parallel with IRHE and is maintaining and controlling system frequency.
The parallel operation is expected to continue but as IRHE's system becomes
larger in the future, each system will have to assume responsibility for
its share of load-frequency control. To accomplish this and to provide
for integration of existing and new generation sources as well as for safe,
reliable and efficient system operation and to permit central control of
the IRHE interconnected system (which by 1978 will extend over 1/3 of
Panama from Bayano to Santiago) a modern dispatch system will become
indispensible. The Project provides therefore for the construction of
a reliable communication system and for a new load dispatch center at
the Panama Substation, to be linked to all power plants and major sub-
stations. Communication system and load dispatch center equipment to
be financed under the proposed loan is based on the recommendations of
the UNDP financed "Communications and Load Dispatch Feasibility Study".
These recommendations have considered the equipment already provided under
Loan 661-PAN for the Bayano, Las Minas and associated transmission project.
In line with modern practice, a computer based dispatching system will be
used. Remote automatic stations at major generating plants and substations



ANNEX 6
Page U of 4 pages
and a central master station at the load dispatch center will provide for
data logging, supervisory control, telemetering, primary and back-up communica-
tion, on-line economic dispatch and automatic gEaneration control.  The latter
will be applied to the major thermal and hydro units in the IRHE system
and to the control of power flow in the interconnection with PANCANAL.
In order to make maximum use of the new load dispatch and communication
facilities under the proposed loan extensive training and interconnected
system operation will be provided for IRHE operating staff.
Studies
8.        As IRHE contracted MAIN in April 1973 for the engineering and
design of La Fortuna, the proposed Bank loan provides for project prepara-
tion of the Las Minas and Bayano 1978-80 additions only. Because of IRHEEs
takeover of FyL, the two contiguous Las Minas steam plant sites can now be
developed as one site to maximum physical possibility. Based on the existing
fuel oil line capacity from Las Ninas Bay refinery and former uncoordinated
uses by FyL and IRHE of the sites, however, MAINts Master Plan was prepared
before IRHE owned both sites and assumed an ultimate 350 MW capacity only.
As it appears that the combined site, with a second fuel oil line might
accommodate a total of 650 MW, IRHE agreed that the maximum potential of
the combined site should be established as an integral part of a project
preparation study included in the proposed Project.
9.        As IRHE is facing organizational problems due to taking over FyL's
responsibilities (paragraph 3.08) and in order to provide for more effective
coordination of technical activities (paragraph 3.09), IRHE intends to retain
the services of its present management consultants for preparing an organiza-
tion study. After negotiations IRHE has submitted draft terms of reference
for such study for approval by the Bank. The proposed loan would assist in
the financing of this study.
Technical Training
10.       For technical maintenance training, IRHE presently bends its
personnel to the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority with good results,
and will continue to do so. In addition, IRHE personnel is and will continue
receiving on-site and in-factory training for generation and transmission
plant additions as part of the purchase contract of the plant. However,
as IRHEis 1973-1978 power development program includes large additions of
transmission and generating plant and represents a radical departure from
present operating practices, the proposed loan would provide for the foreign
exchange cost of a balanced training program, especially in load dispatch
and interconnected system operation. The program would cover training:
(i) of engineering management; (ii) of engineers in the preparation of
specifications and bid evaluations, design, and supervision of construction;
and (iii) of operating engineers and personnel,in interconnected system
operation and maintenance of dispatching, communication, protection, trans-
mission, distribution and generating plant.

NOTES ON THE POWER MARKET SURVEY FOR
PANAMA
AND INTERCONNECTED SYSTEM LOAD FORECAST KCR 1972 - 1982
1.        Panama extends over 650 km from Costa Rica in the -est to Colombia
in the east, and occupies a relatively narrow isthmus roughly bisected by the
Panama Canal Zone.  Except for the Metropolitan Area consisting of the Canal
Zone, Colon, Panama City and the transisthrnian highway area, the eastern
half of the country is mainly an undeveloped jungle (Darien gap). West of
the Canal the Atlantic side is tropical rain forest with 4,000 mm of rain
annually and a small population along the coast. The Pacific side of the
continental divide has a rainfall averaging up to 2,000 mm a year and a well
defined dry season; it is the agricultural and grazing area of Panama.
2.        Panama is a relatively small country of 74,000 km2 with a population
of *bout 1.5 million. The population lives close to the Inter-American
Highway with Puerto Armuelles, Chitre, Las Tablas and Colon as exceptions.
Within the country the population distribution is uneven, with about 50%
concentrated in the Metropolitan Area. The population rate of growth is about
3.3% per annum but the rate of growth of over 4.5% in the urban areas exceeds
this average and has been taken into account in the preparation of the load
forecast.
3.        During the 1960 decade Panama had the fastest growing economy in
the Americas. Panama's per capita income of US$820 is one of the highest in
Latin America trailing only Venezuela, Argentina and Uruguay.
14.       The load forecast prepared by MAIN is based on two independent
load forecasting methods and assumes a continued average annual economic
growth in Panama of between 7% and 8%, which is reasonable in view of recent
trends (about 8%). The two independent methods consist of:
(i) a model for correlating economic and electric demand growth; and
(ii) a trend analysis by consumer classes of the power demand in Panama.
A Markovian model, which MAIN developed for the Panama UNDP financed Power
Market Survey, indicated a high degree of predictive accuracy for the
correlation model and since the correlation was based on data as of September
1972, it offeredthe best available forecast of future electric energy
requirements. The forecast is summarized on page 1 of this Annex.
5.        In developing the forecast Panama was treated as one entity on the
basis of an integrated pow-er system, including PANCANAL. To achieve an
integrated system, however, generation and transmission facilities will need
to provide adequate and reliable service. On this basis, existing and
committed thermal generation facilities in IRHE and PANCANAL are expected






ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 4 pages
to be scheduled for optimum economical hydro-thermal operation which could
lead to substantial sales of Bayano power and energy. However, for this
appraisal a maximum sale of only 30 MgI and 210 GWh was assumed after
September 1, 1975 from IRHIE to PANCANAL on the basis of an existing contract
(see Annex 3 and paragraph 2.o4).
6.        MAIN has also, as part of the UNDP financed Power Market Survey,
examined the characteristics of the load of the four areas of the system
and prepared load duration and integrated energy curves for the various
areas of the power system and for the combined system as a whole, assumed
to be interconnected by 1982, to provide the basis for power requirement
forecasting, production costing and reliability calculations.
7.        The hours of use of electric generating capacity in the interconnected
system exceed that of all other Latin Amnerican nations. This very high utili-
zation is caused in part by the load characteristics of PANCANAL and in part
by the high load factor in Panama City and Colon, due to extensive use of
airconditioning. In 1970, when there was no rationing during peak load, the
annual load factor of the Metropolitan Area was slightly above 72% (over 77%
in July) and is estimated for the combined system at 70.6%, 69% and 67.14% for
1970, 1975 and 1980, respectively. Also, the base load energy for the combined
system in respect of total energy represents a very high 65% and 64% for 1970
and 1980, respectively. Such characteristic of the load favors generating
sources with inherent high energy producing ability and requires dependable
production facilities, including higher reserves of generating capacity than
usually justified for systems with lower load factors.
8.        During 1967 to 1971 the annual electricity consumption in Panama
increased 14% each year. MAIN estimated that the average national growth
rate in energy consumption will be about 13.5% during 1972-75 and about 12%
thereafter. The regional requirements and sales by consumer category were
calculated by Stone and TAebster by adding to MAIN's basic requirement forecast
more recently projected loads of Cemento Atlantico and the water supply system
(IDAAN) in the Metropolitan Area and a sugar mill on the Central Provinces
System. System losses have been provided for at 12% for the Metropolitan
Area and between 25% and 15% in IRHE's rural areas and bulk delivery losses
of 5%. IRHE's own use was assumed at 0.3% of retail sales in the Metropolitan
Area and at 0.5% in other areas.
9.        S&W obtained the detailed sales estimate by breaking down total
energy sales by consumer classifications in accordance with estimated growth
rates and average use per customer for the various categories.
10.       In its 1973-78 expansion program IRHE hopes to increase its service
so that up to about 80% of the population would be reached and, as the
population is growing at more than 3% annually, there is a large potential
residential market for electricity. The rate of development of this market
will depend on the reinforcement and extension of the transmission and
distribution systems in the populated areas, the future average domestic
income levels and the future tariff structure after an eventual revision.
The residentia] growth is estimated at about 13% annually throughout the
period (1972 to 1978).

11.       The rate of growth of the commercial component is estimated at
about 11% throughout the period, reflecting the trend in Panama towards
urbanization with many banks, office buildings, stores, apartment houses,
and hotels being built, mainly in the Metropolitan Area.
12.       The forecast for the industrial component includes the effect in
the period of 1972 to 1978 of known major bulk loads, such as Cemento Panama,
a sugar mill in the Central Provinces, Cemento Atlantico and diversified
light industries.  Growth in the industrial component is estimated to average
about 15% annually in this period.
13.       The forecast of sales to Government and other miscellaneous sales
are estimated to grow at about 19% in the forecast period, mainly because of
the large increase in the Metropolitan Area water supply load of IDAAN and
airconditioning of Government offices.
14.       Projected bulk sales to electric power companies (less than 5% of
IRHE's total sales) are based on recent trends of increase in energy requirements
and appear reasonable. In view of the ongoing negotiations between PANCANAL
and IRHE to revise the existing interconnection contract between PANCANAL and
FyL and because of the present suspension of the IRHE sales to PANCANAL
(paragraph 2.o4) the forecast of sales to PANCANAL assumes only 30 MW and
210 GWh annually after September 1975; but IRHE intends to sell ntas much as
possible on a when available basis't. The summary of energy sales for the
1973-1978 period is given on page 1 of this Annex.
15.       Some significant potential loads have not been taken into account:
(i)  an inter-ocean oil pipeline requiring substantial amounts of power
for pumping;
(ii) development of newly discovered copper deposits (requiring up
to 150 MW);
(iii)  construction of a second canal at sea level (with a load of about
50 MW and 200 GTWh per annum during construction).
All this could amount to a total of about 250 MW by 1982. These loads would
require additional generating capacity, since the estimated 1982 excess
capacity in IRHE's system is only 178 MW (Annex 3) and because La Fortuna's
capacity may not be fully available during the dry season as it has, in its
first stage, only a small reservoir with monthly storage.

RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT
1.         The Project includes substantial expenditures for transmission
facilities which will be fully used only after all generation has been added
under IRHE's power projects during 1972 to 1984. iIt is for this reason that
the return on the program (and not the Project) investment has been determined.
The return was estimated by discounting the net cost/benefit stream attributable
to the program and finding the discount rate at which the present worth of the
stream becomes zero.
2.         The cost and benefit streams for the time slice of invegtments required
to meet the increase in demand during the 1972-1983 period are given below. The
estimated share of the revenues attributable to the program are considered to
represent the minimum benefits.  This share was calculated by reducing annual
projected total revenue by the 1971 consolidated IRHE and FyL revenue which
excluded inter-company transfers.
3.         Construction costs are based on current (1973) equipment prices
and exclude taxes and custom duties.
4.         Operating costs (excluding depreciation) are at current levels and
include fuel, maintenance and general administration expense.
5.         No shadow pricing has been considered necessary for foreign exchange
or labor costs.
6.         Revenues attributable to the time slice of investments have been
derived at current tariffs (based on IRHE's projected sales) and exclude
surchar6es due to fuel cost increases after 1971.
7.         Some of the projects included in the time slice of investments
will remain useful at the end of the period of study. This is taken into
account by the construction cost credit in the year 2000.

9.        The calculation shows a rate of return on the investment of 13.2%.
10.       More optimistic assumptions with respect to operating costs in
1975 to 1978 would increase this rate to 13.4%.  An approximate calculation
of the rate of return on the Project indicated a somewhat higher rate than
on the program.

NOTES ON FINANCIAL FORECASTS
Revenues
1.        See Annex 7 for the basis on which the sales of electricity in kWh
are forecast. The average seUing price is based on the current tariffs in
the two areas. It is assumed revenue will be increased during the period
' 1975-78 to earn a minimum of 8-3/4%.
2.        "Other income" is shown with a base of BllO,OOO and small annual
increments.
Operating Expenses
3.        Fuel costs were projected utilizing the heat rates adopted in
Ghas. T. Main's Master Plan for existing units and at assumed heat rates for
new units. The prices for Bunker C and diesel were escalated at 3% per annum
from a 1971 base, and 5% added for transportation for generating plants on
the Paeific side. Any increases above these rates should be recovered by
the operation of a fuel clause. The existing fuel adjustment clause is not
uniform but this should be taken into account in the revision of the tariffs
and any increase in cost in excess of 6.75 mills per kWh should be fully
recovered.
4.       Other operating expenses have been estimated as follows:
(a) Steam generation. 1971 expenses have been updated to take into
account known changes in 1972 costs and escalated at 5% p.a.,
from 1974 but making allowance for decreased operation on the
commissioning of Bayano.
(b) Diesel generation. Increasing in accordance with additional
generation in 1973, 197h and 1975 and subsequently decreasing
with the expansion of the interconnected system.
(c)  Transmission and distribution have been increased by about 9%
in 1974 and by larger rates in later years to take into account
expected further wage increases and expansion of the system.
(d) Other expenses such as customer services, administration, etc.
have been increased at 3.5% in 1974 and at higher rates in later
years to reflect anticipated higher administration and general costs.
