INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEOIPMENT
REPORT AND RECONIENDATION OF TIHE PRESIDENT
TO ThiE EXECU'TIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE INSTITUTO DE
RECURSOS HIDRAULICGS Y ELECTRIFICACI'N
WITH ThE GUARANITEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A THIRD POVER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IREE) with
the guarantee of the Republic of Panama for the equivalent of $30 million to
help finance a third power project.   The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including a 4-year grace period, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECON'OMY
2.        In 1972, the provisional Governnent of General Omar Torrijos - which
came to power in October 1966 - became the constitutional Government of Panama.
After ratifying a new constitution, the constitutional convention declared
General Torrijos Head of Government and elected provisional President Demetrio
Lakas constitutional President.  Since it took office, this Government has under-
taken a strong public expenditure effort to both attack a backlog of public
inrestment projects, mostly a9fecting urban areas adjoining the Panama Canal
Zone, and expand the scope and quality of public services available to the poorer,
rural citizens.  An economic report dated November 13, 1973 which is being distri-
buted to the Board, provides the Bank's analysis of the nation's economic perfor-
mance and prospects.
The economy of Panama has traditionally depended on the provision
o.. services to the Canal Zone and on the international commerce generated by
the Canal, by Panama's geographic location, the absence of restric-iive trade
waws and its use oL the U.S. dollar currency.  While these advantages led to
fast real growth at an average of 8 percent yearly during 1955-66 as world trade.
travel and capital flows expanded, the benefits of this growvth ;.ere unequally
shared.  By 1970 the per capita personal incomes in Panama City and Colo3n had
reached $8&5 while the rest of the colntry had average personal incomes of only
$270.
4.        Since 1966, GDP has continued to grow at almost 6 percent per year
in real terms.  The most rapid output growth has come from the internationanlr
orlented urban service sectors. Because of Panama's use of the U.S. dollar cur-
rency it is fast becoming a Latin-dollar center. Foreign deposits in the banking
system increased almost nine times between 196& and 1972 and totalled $1.1 billion
at the end of 1972.  Although most of these funds were onlent abroad, about $'227
million, representing a third of dormestic credit granted in 1972, remained in



- 2 -
Panama. In the past three years the domestic credit extended by the banking
system Inas grown at an annual rate of 31 percent. This rapid credit expansion,
along with rapid urban growth, has augmented residential construction, the
n-unber ofr business visitors, and commercial activities, thus increasing the
need for public utilities and transport facilities.   Electricity consumption
has grown 14 percent yearly.
Mostly because the production and exports of bananas stagnated after
1969, agricultural output has growJn only 3.7 percent yearly since 1568.   During
1971/72 a drought affected some crops adversely.   Since most of the presently
accessible good crop land in the country is already under cultivation, the
countr-'s best prospects for future agricultural output and income growth will
re:2uire the more intensive use of its limited good crop land, an expansion and
imirovement of cattle production on lower-valued land, and - in the longer run -
the clearing of some new land now in forest. The Government has recently
undertaken an institutional reorganization designed to improve the coordination
o- all public agricultural institutions.   The latter have been directing their
maAar efforts to organize and assist the poorer farmers.   Manufacturing, which
used to be a leading growth sector, has grown in real terms at about the same
rate as GDP since 1968. Because o lf Panama's highi wa,,es, small markLet, and
relatively open economy, future manufacturing growth may come from selected
malor capital-intensive export projects and asseirbly operations   as economic
import suibstitutioni alternatives decrease. The Government is now considering
ouablic assistance to artisans as well as promoting large projects in non-manufac-
ir-ing industr-ies, such as mining., tourism, and international commrierce.
6.        The objectives of the present Government's development policy are
directed towards continuing the rapid growth of urban service-oriented acti-ities
in Panama City and environs, and integrating the rest of the country more closely
with this major urban area.   TIcreasing public revenues from the urban area
could be tapped to finance a more balanced growth in tne rest of the Republic.
Thiis woul:I include both raisingJ the level of social services available to the
rural population as well as exploiting the possibilities for economic diversi-
fication.  Be,ides a large investment program designed to support the urban
rrvth and improvfe the rural public social services, tUe Government has taken
a mlore active role in economic management, especially in favor of urban workers.
Government policies increased real wages moderately during 1571 and 1972, although
their rapid implemen'tation created some business uncertainty.  Agrarian reformi
has also been accelerated since 1968;   350,0CC hectares of land (corresponding to
9 percent of the land in farms) have been acquired by the Government, mostly
for non-paymeent of taxes, and 200 agrarian cooperatives and collectires have been
estab-_isnhe  for about 7,900 smrall farm Lanilies.
7.        The Government has concentrated its past efforts on expanding public
expenditures.  Much of the increased current outlays went for social programrs.
In 1972, forty-three percent of the Goverrment's current outlays were for educa-
tion and health. Civil service salaries, especially those for school teachers
and medical personnel, have beer raised.   At the same time, major investments
have begun in highways, a suZar mill, airports, school buildings. health, power
and agriculture.  As a result, puolic current expenditures rose from 16.7 percent



-3-
of GDP in 1968 to 21.6 percent in 1972, and public capital expenditures for
fixed and financial investments rose from 4.6 to 7.4 percent oF GDP during the
same period.
8.        The domestic public resources for financing this expenditure growth
have not been sufficient. Consolidated public sector savings remained at about
2-3 percent of GDP during 1969-71, but fell to only 1.4 percent during 1972 when
a government tax reform failed to produce the expected new revenues. As a
result of this savings performance, public borrowing has been used to fill pub-
lic sector deficits, which averaged 4.3 percent of GDP during 1969-71 and rose
to 6.1 percent in 1972. Uninhibited by balance of payments constraints - Panama
uses the dollar and has no central bank - the fiscal gap was covered mainly
through "external' borrowing, which basically differs from "internal" borrowing
only by the creditor's nationality.  However, the fiscal constraint - i.e., the
Government's capacity to pay its own debt service which weighs heavily in
determining its creditworthiness - is dictated by the limits of public revenue
growth. By 1972 the ratio of government debt service to government revenues had
risen to 29 percent, compared to 12 percent in 1968.
9.        The Bank and the IMF have maintained a close consultation with the
Panamanian authorities on ways to improve the fiscal performance. The Govern-
ment budget for 1973 implied a strong effort to limit the growth of current expen-
ditures to under 5 percent and to increase revenues by 16 percent. The mid-year
results are encouraging. The Government's control of its current expenditures
has been even stronger than that envisaged in its budget; actual expenditures
were 5 percent below the budget, a reduction in real terms over 1972. The reduc-
tion of some excessive sales taxes in the unsuccessf'ul 1972 tax package has had
a positive fiscal effect; but more importantly, a vigorous collection effort has
been successful. The Government plans to continue this collection effort and
current expenditure control throughout the year. If successful, this would
increase central government current account savings from a negative B/8.5 million
in 1972 to a positive B/15 million in 1973 and raise total public savings to over
3 percent of GDP.
10.       For the longer term, the Governrient agrees that it will need to limit
the growth of its current expenditures as well as to raise some taxes and selec-
ted tariffs of public agencies. The Government's goals in agriculture and rural
education and health, which require increased current outlays, can only be
reached within its expected fiscal resources if the growth of government ex-oen-
ditures on other current items is slowed. To increase the domestic resources
available for the large ongoing investment program, the Government is considering
both a tightening of the present tax regime in 1974 and a major tax increase in
1975. Combined with the Government effort will be a program to reduce the
dependence of revenue-producing public entities on Government transfers for
their expansion programs.
11.       By the end of 1972 the consolidated total public debt, both internal
and external, including undisbursed, was $595. 9 million.   About one-quarter of



- h -
the public debt was owed to domestic creditors. Of the remaining $458.1
million, 12 percent was owed to the Bank by the Government and all public
agencies. The Bank's proportion of the public external debt service fell
from 12 percent in 1968 to 3 percent in 1972 as medium-term borrowing in-
creased. By 1975 it is expected to return to about 12 percent of the public
external debt service. During 1973 the Government borrowed $65 million at
10-year terms from private external sources to finance the purchase of a power
company, repay some debt obligations falling due in 1973 and finance some
counterpart requirements for investments. In a successful effort to reduce
its debt burden, the Government contracted in October 1973 to refinance $115
million of its outstanding short- and medium-term debt. Since the 10--year
terms include 4-l/2 years grace, the government debt service ratio (government
debt service/government current revenues) is expected to drop to 21 percent in
1974. In view of the improved fiscal performance,successful rescheduling of
medium-term external debt and the Government's tax and expenditure plans,
Panama merits the continued support of credit agencies for its aggressive
development program.
PART II -- BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PANAMA
12.       From 1953 to 1962 the Bank made five loans totalling $18.0 million,
including two (totalling $13.1 million) for road construction, two relatively
small loans for agriculture, and one for electric power. All five loans have
been fully disbursed and three have been fully repaid. Because of lack of
development-oriented policies and because of political interferences in the
operation and management of key public entities, the Bank was unable to extend
loans between 1962 and 1970. Since then, the Bank has lent $42.o million for
power (Bayano), $20 million for an airport, $3.4 million for fisheries, and
$4.7 million for a livestock project. Implementation of these loans has fallen
behind schedule but steps are being taken to overcome the causes of delay. In
FY71, IFC made its only investment in Panama, a commitment to acquire $0.3
million of equity in the Corporacion de Desarrollo Hotelero, S.A., and lent to
it $1.2 million to build a new international hotel. IFC is not presently consi-
dering any further operations in Panama. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans and IFC investments as of September 30, 1973 and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.

AID, has, in recent years, concentrated on social services through a sector
loan to education, water and sewerage loans, family planning assistance, and
some small loans for subsistence farmers; it has also helped finanlce a new
convention center in Panama City.   IDB has provided support for vocationel
and university education, general agricultural credit for small- and medium-
size farmers, and secondary road construction.
ll.       Because of its geographical location, cosmopolitan population and
use of a dollar currency, Panama's best economic prospects, both for income
and employment generation, will continue to remain in service industries.   Its
limited supply of good land reinforces the need for rapid urban growth to ab-
sorb the expected migration from rural areas. The Bank is helping the Govern-
ment's efforts to make up for past neglect of infrastructure investments
required for rapid growth. Projects in this class are a new fishinr port
and the first portion of the Panama City-Colon highway, both of which are under
preparation.  Although we are also exploring the possibility of assisting pro-
jects directed towards increasing the output and income alternatives of the
rural population, we believe that, taking into account the present and planned
activities of the other lending agencies in rural areas, our assiEtance to
Panama will be more effective if it is mainly focused on projects designed to
promote urban and service-related job creation.   Finally, we intend to continue
the ongoing constructive dialogue with the Government regarding the size,
timing, and priorities of its large investment program.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
15.       The generation and retailing of electric power in Panama originated
with a number of privately-owned companies.   The autonomous state-owned agency,
Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IRKE) was created in 1961
to coordinate and expand the generation and distribution of electric power

throughout the Republic. IREE now operates in most of' the country's pro-
vinces and will shortly sell electricity to private companies in Chiriqui
Province and the towns of Chorrera and Santiago.   Tn August 1972, IRHE acquired
from the Government most of the assets and liabilities of the Compania Panamena
de Fuerza y Luz (FyL), a Boise Cascade (USA) subsidiary previously purchlased
by the Government. Presently, IRHE owxns 90 percent of the counitry's installed
generating capacity, excluding captive industrial plants.   By the acquisition
ITRE also received FyL's telephone and gas concessions.   IRHE plans to divest
itself of telephone operations by January 1, 197h. Gas operations, which are
insig,nificant, are also to be transferred to another company or phased out

are not yet interconnect'ed, and 50 small isolated sy-stems. TLhe regicual
s-,stems are:

connecting the regional systems into a national systen; as a first, stage in one
imnple7nentation of the recently completed Master Plan for Powjer Development in
Panama.
16.       Agreements under negotiation between IRHE and the Panama Canal
Company (PANCANAL) are expected to provide for reciprocal emergency power
supply assistance on a "when available! basis.  Because of IRiAd's high
dem!and for power in its own region, IRhE and PANCANAL have agreed to suspend
for three years, to late in 1975., a contract under whichl IRHE was sellinrr 30 MW
power to ikrJIAAAL.



7-
19.       In the decade 1562-72, production of electricity in tanama (exclu-
ding -A14CANAL) increased by 265 percent to about 1 milliorn kiwh.  Generating
capacity, wihich totalled 240 14V in 1272, has generally met demand except
during recent outages in IXHE's metropolitan system when supply had to be
rationed. The total number of customers increased by 70 percent during the
decade to 147,GOC. Of the total, about 130,000 were residential customers
indicating that about 48 percen-t of Panama's populationl hpve electric service,
with 65 percent of the metropolitani area population and 30 percent of the
rural population receiving supply.  flhi-Es five-year expansion program would
increase services so that by 1978, eighty percent of the country's popula-
tion, ninet- percent of the metropolitan area and 67 percent of the rural
population could have electricity, During 1262-67 consumption of electricity
grew by 12 percent annually and from 19Q67 to 1571 at 14 percent per year.
flHE's consultants forecas-t a 13.5 percent annual increase to 1975 and 12 per-
cent per year thereafter.
Ezapansion Program
20c       TIHEis expansion program for the period 1973-77, a part of Panamna's
Mvaster fower Development Plan which calls for major investments tnrcugn Iyo,
coraprises (a) the completion of the Second IBRD Project, partly financed by
Loan 661-PAN, (b) the proposed Project, (c) extensions to existing systems not
financed by the Bank, and (d) construction of other generation facilities and
associated works for projects which will be commissioned after 1977.
21 .      The balance of the Second IBRBD Project to be completed by 1577
consists of:
(a) the Bayano (150 MW) hydro-development and transmission line
(scheduled for comple-tion in the first half of 1X76):
(b) Las Minas Steam Unit No. 4 (h0 14) and transmission line
(scheduled for September 1-74);
(c) additions to the distribution system; and
(d) studies, training and management consuiltant services.
Several diesel units financed by the Bank loan under the Second IDRD Project
have already been coimissioned and several distribu-tion systems expanded.
The total cost of the Second IRID Project is presently estimated at $78.6
million compared with the $58.2 million appraisal estimete.  Despite the cost
overrun, this project remains the least cost alternative.  The 35 percent
cost overrun is due to (i) currency realignments, (ii) poor auality of preli-
minary engineering studies which necessitated considerable redesign of the
Bayano hydropower project, (iii) difficulties in locating suitable aggregates
for Bayano civil works, and (iv) the need for an additional cooling water
intake channel for the Las linas project. The engineering difficulties have
been resolved and the overruns will be covered by Government contributions
and other resources.

22.       Extensions to existing systems througflh 1'-77r not included in the
Bank's projects and to be financed by suppliers' credits ErK Ai!Els o.- resou.rces,
will provide (i) additional 28 MM diesel capacity,mostly in pre-assembled units,
(ii) subtransmission and distribution additions, (iii) office buildings,
laboratories, connmnication and transportation equipment, and (iv) detailed
engineering of the La Fortuna project with the associated 230 kV transmission
system.
23.       Initial construction phases of other generation facilities and
associated works also not financed by the Bank would cost ~36.2 million
through 1977 and an additional $139 million to completion. These items would
be initiated during the Project period and would include:
(a)  a 7'5 Mvs steam eiLectric unit at Las Minas (to be commissioned in
October 1'78);
(b)  two additionll 75 144 hydroelectric units at Bayano (Units 3
and 4, fcr operation in October 1575 and October 19CC);
(c)  transmissioni lines and sabstations related to (a) and (b);
(d)  the first stage construction cf La Fortuna's hydro-development
including tw 05 14'd units (for January 1iC1 operation) with a
230 kV line Divisa-Lavid-La Fortuna and associated substations;
and
(e) studies and training0
As La Fortuna is loca'ed about; midway between San Jose in Costa Rica arid

EiART I - THE PROJECT
The Third II1D Power Proiect. wi]l help to interconnect the regionai.
systems and also help meet the regular increase of PanaTna2s power needs.   A
report entitled 'Appraisal of ahe Third Power Project" (No. 222a-Pan) is being-
distributed separately; Annex III contains a loan and project sui.ar-,.   The
Pro,eot would consist o..:
(a)  a thermal power plant oL' about 25 MW to be installed in the
metropolitan area;
(b)  about lbo km of' 230 kV double-circu z transmission lines
betlween Panama Subs tation, 'Chorrera and Divisa:
(c)  about L41 km OL '11 k\ singLe-circuit transmission lines
betweor. Citre and Divisa, an, about 25 k. of 11   ' dojble-
circtrit transmis,sion lines in the metropolitan area;



- 9 -
(d)  substations with a total capacity of about 200 MVA for
transforming from 115 kV and for switching: near Chitre,
Aguadulce, Chorrera, Cerro Viento, Tocumien, San Francisco,
Maranon, Las Ninas and Panama, including two mobile sub-
stations with a total capacity of about 40 MVA;
(e)  about 110 km of subtransmission lines and related sub-
stations;
(f)  expansion of distribution systems in both urban and rural areas;
(g) a system load dispatch center at the Panama substation,
including a related communication system; and
(h)  studies, engineering and technical training.
The project would be completed by June 30, 1977.
25.       The 25 14 of thermal capacity is needed for the metropolitan area
by May 1975 because demand has been growing faster than anticipated, and the
Bayano hydro-power plant is delayed by about one year. As a steam electric plort
cannot be installed in the short time required -io avoid severe rationing, the
additional 25 MflI will have to be either gas turbine or diesel.
26.       The 230 kV double-circuit transmission line between Panama substation,
Chorrera and Divisa will form the first stage of the country's backbone trans-
mission system and will be initially operated at 115 kV. The Panama Substation-
Chorrera section will cross the Canal with provisions for future addition of
a second 230 kV double-circuit transmission line. IRHE and PANCANAL have
reached agreement on the routing of the crossing.
27.       Since most of the existing generating facilities in Panama City and
Colon are old and inefficient, a small part will be retired and the balance
used for providing peaking or standby service after the commissioning of
Bayano No. 1 and 2 units. This change in operation will require bulk supply
for the metropolitan system from Panama substation by double-circuit 115 kV
lines, about 100 MVA of transformers and distribution switchgear, and related
subtransmission and distribution lines. To provide for more flexible
operation and construction of facilities, the project includes two mobile
step-down substations. The Project also provides for additions to IRHE's
distribution system.
28.       The communication system and load dispatch center at Panama Sub-
station will provide for more reliable and efficient system operation following
the integration of existing and new generation sources and will permit central
control of IRHE's interconnected system.
29.       Supervision of constructing the 115 kV transmission lines and
substations will be carried out mainly by former FyL personnel, who have
had previous 115 kV construction experience; consultants will assist when and
where necessary.

30.       The project is estiimated to cost $38.5 million with a foreign
exchange component of $27.3 million (both excluding interest during construc-
tion). The Bank would finance the foreign exchange component of the Project
cost plus an amount of $2.7 million which would cover interest during construc-
tion and commitment fees on the Bank loan through June 1976, when most cons-
truction would be completed.   I.HE's finances are greatly affected b,r its
rapid transformation from a small rural power company to an enterprise with
national scope.  As such, it is in the process of making heavy investments
which will generate revenues only several years hence. By financing a rela-
tively high proportion of the Project cost, the Bank will alleviate the strain
which the large construction program imposes on the enterprise, especially
as the size of the investment progran is now incre,-sed further by the higher
than expected costs ofn the Bayano projects (see para. 21).  The Government has
already committed a substantial capital contribution to IRHE and IREE itself is
making a significant contribution to its expansion program irom internal cash
generatulion.
Procurement and Disbursement
31.       Procurement of goods and services to be financed out o- the loan,
other than consulting, engineering and training services, would be on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. In order to meet power demand IRHE had to contract consulting
services for the 25 M); thermal generation plant before Loan signing; it is
therefore recommended that the proposed loan rrovide $300,000 for consulting
and training expenditures incurred after March 31, 1973.   In IfHlE should be
in a position to place the order for the 25 MW of generating capacity prior
to loan signing, it is further recormmended that the proposed loan provide
additional retroactive financing in an amount up to US$500,000. The goods
to be financed by the Loan are not presently manufactuired in Panama.  However,
there is a possibility in the future that local industry might be able to
manufacture a small amount of the equipment and/or materials required.
Accordingly, a margin of pre'Lerence of 15 percent, or th-ie actual custom duty,
wlhichever is lower, would be allowed for the purpose o" comparing bids for
equipment manufactured in Panama.
32.       Disbursements under the loan would be made only for the foreign
currency cost of training, services and imported materials and equipment,
except for materials and equipment which might be produced in Panawa in
the future for transmission lines, substations and electric utility
distribution syste!ms if' procured under international comnlpetition in accor-
dance with the Bank's guidelines.   It is expected that disbursement oi the
loan will be completed by 1'77, as shown in Anne) III.



Financial Aspects
33.       Since the Bank made its first loan to IRHE in 1962 for rural elec-
trification, IRHE's growth has been impressive.   During the last several years
its financial strength has grown 'but so, too, have its financial requirements.
It has had to rely heavily on Government contributions for its capital expansion
program and will have to continue to do so for the next two to three years,
after which time IRHE should be able to finance from internal cash generation
and by the issue of bonds most of the expansion program's local expenditure.
"Old" IRHE's gross revenues have increased from $3.5 million in 1969 when it
was still a small rural power supplier to $8.7 million in 1972; and in 1973,
with a full year's operation in the metropolitan areaj it is estimated that
IRHE's total electricity revenues will be some $27.6 million.
34.       Based on current tariffs and projected costs, IRHE's net revenues
after 1974 would fall somewhat short of the 8.75 percent rate of return
authorized by law and referred to in covenants of the previous loan agreement
(661-PAN) and the proposed draft loan agreement. To reach the net revenue
level permitted by law, tariffs will have to be increased by about 3 percent
or expenses reduced by about 3 percent during the period 1975-78. IRHE intends
to make a complete study of its tariffs with the objective of making them more
uniform between the Rural (former IRHE) Area and the Metropolitan (former FyL)
Area. Since tariffs in the Metropolitan Area are substantially lower than in
the Rural Area, a revision would benefit the rural population.
35.        IRHE's financing plan for the four years 1974-77, which cover the
disbursement period of the proposed loan, are summarized below:

In addition to a small transfer prescribed by law, the Government has indicated
that it intends to contribute $9 rillion and $8 million in 1974 and 1975 respec-
tively to IRHE's equity; these contributions are needed to complete the Power II
project. In view of IBJE's progressively stronger financial position which
enables it to finance an increasing share of investment requirements fror inter-
nal cash generation and to have access to the capital market, the Government
proposes to phase out its transfers to IRHE after 1975. Given the emergence of
Panama as an important financial center, IRPE should be able to borrow long-term
resources on favorable terms.
36.       Of the financing requirements during 1974-77 shown above, the finan-
cing for the proposed and current projects has been secured. However, the
placement of IRHE bonds in the internal market and the huture foreign loans,
both of which will be needed to finance future projects such as La Fortuna,
have yet to be arranged. It is expected that IRHE will be able to issue its own
bonds, with Government guarantee, carrying an interest rate of about 8 percent
and maturing 10-15 years after issue. local banks have agreed to grant over-
drafts which are estimated to reach $13 million; of which a part would be re-
financed out of the bond issue. In order to ensure that the Project, once
commenced, is not delayed by lack of funds, the Government agreed during nego-
tiations to arrange on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, the finan-
cing of any sums necessary to enable IRHE to complete the Project.
37.       Assuming a net operating income corresponding to the 8.75 percent
rate of return, interest coverage in the period 1973-78 would be low, but suf-
ficient; interest payments would be covered 1.4-1.9 times by net operating
income. Similarly, debt service coverage would be low but adequate; internal
cash generation would vary between 1.3 and 1.5 times debt service. [he debt/equity
ratio would increase from 47/53 in 1972 to 55A5 in 1978, reflecting MHE's
added reliance on borrowing instead of Government contributions.    To ensure
that its future financial position will not be impaired, IR.HE agreed during
negotiations to a covenant similar to the one in existing loans, whereby it will
not borrow without prior approval of the Bank, unless it is able to meet a 1.4
debt service test.

Justification
38.       Since the Second IBRD Power Loan was appraised, a UNDP-financed Master
Plan has been prepared by Charles T. Main International (U.S.A.) with the Bank
acting as executing agency. This Plan, which has taken into consideration th-e
recent acquisition of .yL, reconurends the interconnection of Panama's four main
power systems for a more efficient use of installed capacity and generation of
energ-. The integration of Panama's major systems - without taking advantage of
additional economies from large hydroelectric schemes - was found to be the least
cost solution for discount rates up to 20 percent for the interconnection of West
Panama, up to 15 percent for the interconnection of the Central provinces and up
to 12 percent for the interconnection of Chiriqui Province. The proposed Project.
provides mainly for building the transmission lines, load dispatch system and
svitching sutstations to interconriect the country's power systems.
39.       The Master Plan provided for a thermTal generating capacity addition
of at, least 25 11MW which is included in the Project.  Compared with the project-
ions during appraisal of the Second Power Pro-ect, IE1LE's load is about 26 Nd
higher, e.g., developing about two years fLaster and due to the Bayano construc-
tion delay, MHE would develop substantial capacity deficiency in 1975-76 without
this addition.  Including the proposed 25' IMWv addition, IRhE's 197T firm capacityr
(excluding the largest urnit, equivalent to the required minimum reserve), is
projected to be 223 Mi and demand at 226 I@. For performing essential maintenance
of generating plant IRHE would therefore have to rely on assistance from the
interconnection with PANCA1vAL (see paragraph 18).  In view of IRHg's very high
load factor, medium-speed residual fu.el oil burning diesels should be the least
cost solution; but if it is not possible to install such units blv April 1975, a
gas turbine would have to be purchased to meet tihe demand.
Lo.       As the Project provides substantially for transm-ssion wi ch will be
fullv utilized only after I 9L3, the retuirn hias beon calculated on tie 1p72-b_
long-range investment program. (referred to in  ragraphs 20-23) rather than on
the project.  In estimatinn tlhe benefits of such investment (required to meet
the increase in demand forecast during 1572 to 1984)', it was assumed that the
economic value of the electricity supplied is at least equal to the price pa:id
by the ultimate consuners. On this basis, benerits are measured b,y- incremental
revenue attributable to the progran. while financial costs are adjusted -'or
taxe,, inlation and internal transf ers. The rate oA' retur:l on! progratim invest-
ment is at least 13.2 percent. iHowqever, the incremiental revenue understates
the benefits consumners will receive from the progran investr.ent since nhe
increases in tariff level, which will be needed to cover thje full costs of
the increnental supply, would not result in a significant reducct on in the
projected denea-nd. Also, as the 2? MW of thermal generation in the Project
will:  (i) help reduce electricityr rationinr during 1975/76, and (ii)) serve
as stand-by to future hydro-generation units - benefits whilch cannot be fully
quantified - tthe return on the Project itself womld be somewhat higher thla
on the program.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONl
Ln. No. 661    Second Power Project; US$42.0 Hillirn Loan of
lfarch 16, 1970;  Closing Date: April 30, 1976
The Project is about one year behind schedule because of
difficulties in finding suitable aggregates for concrete and fill material for
the dams of the project, and because of delayed contracting of Bayano civil works
resulting from change of consulting engineering firm. Present estimates indicate
that the project is likely to cost at least $78&.o million, 35 percent more than
originally estimated.  The project was originally justified as the least cost
alternative to help meet the electric power demand ol tle couwtry. The power
demand has growni ahead of forecasts and the project remains the least cost alter-
native, even with the current time and cost overruns, particularly in view of"
substantial increase of thermal plant and fLuel costs.
Ln. No. 783    Tocumen International Airport Project: US$20.0 Million
Loan of August 2, 1971: Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Physical execution on the runway grading is proceeding slowly
and is behind schedule. The delay has, in part, been caused by rains and the
contractor's failure to provide suitable equipment and supervision. Progress
on completion of design work for the terminal building, is behind schedule;
this problem is receiving serious attention by the Bank. Introduction of the
new financial and management systems is proceeding smoothly.
Ln. No. 784    Fisheries Project; US$3.4 Million Loan of
August 2, 1971; Closing Date: September 30, 1976
The project, which is designed to increase efficiency of the
Panamanian shrimp industry consists of (i) purchase of 40 shrimp trawlers;
(ii) captains' training program; and (iii) fishing port feasibility study.
Progress in (ii) and (iii) is satisfactory. But part (i) of the project was
delayed when inadequate bids were received for the first lot of 10 shrimp
trawlers.  Revision of specifications will make retendering, scheduled for
December, more attractive. No delay in closing date is expected.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects/investments in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 901    Livestock Project; US$4.7 Million Loan of
June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This loan was declared effective on November 2, 1973.
D.  INVESTMENTS IN EXECUTION
Corporacion de Desarrollo Hotelero - 1971
The investment in the Corporacion de Desarrollo Hotelero has
delayed considerably because some original lenders and equity investors with-
drew from the venture and had to be replaced. Construction has now begun.

Procurement Arrangements:
Procurement of goods and services to be financed out of the Loan, other
than consulting, engineering and training services, would be or the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
In order to be able to meet the anticiDated demand for power, IFJH has already
contracted for some engineering studies and services.   It has been assumed that
the proposed loan will be signed by November 30, 1973, and on this basis
US$300,000 retroactive-financing for consultin   services and training Is
recommended for expenditures incurred after March 31, 1973; (bid preparation for
25 1W thermal generation, 115 kV lines and substations,and training). If IRHE
should be in a position to place an order for the 25MW of generating capacitjr
prior to loan signing, it is recommended that the proposed loan provide
additional retroactive financing in an amount up to US$500,000.
For the purpose of evaluating bids, a 15 percen-t preference, or the actual
custom duty, whichever is lower, would be allowed for goods manufactured in
Panama.
Consultants:                2:RHE has already contracted with Charles T. Main
l:nternational (U.S.A.) for some studies and service,.
Other consulting contracts will be negotiated after
signing.
