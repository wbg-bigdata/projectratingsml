SECOND POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the Second Power Project for Papua New
Guinea and aims at helping PNG to strengthen and localize ELCOM. The project
consists of two main items: a) technical assistance for ELCOM's in-service
training program during the period 1974-79, and b) expansion of ELCOM's
distribution network in 13 different centers. The project will also include
financing to cover the cost over-run under the first power project (Loan
737-PNG) which is attributable to exchange rate adjustments. The estimated
total cost of the project is US$17.25 million equivalent. A loan of US$10.8
million is proposed.
ii.       The loan was requested by the Commonwealth of Australia (Guarantor)
on behalf of the Government of Papua New Guinea (Borrower) and the Papua New
Guinea Electricity Commission (ELCOM) (Beneficiary).
iii.      ELCOM was established in July 1963 as a statutory corporation, with
adequate powers to conduct its affairs in accordance with sound public
utility practices. It was responsible to the Commonwealth Minister of External
Territories through the Administrator, but the Minister and the Administrator
have de facto transferred their powers relating to ELCOM to the cabinet of
the newly formed PNG Government, and ELCOM now reports to the PNG Minister
of Mines and Energy. PNG achieved self-government on December 1, 1973. It
is expected to become independent in December this year.
iv.       The country's economy is based essentially on primary production.
GNP growth declined from a previous annual rate of 11% between 1969 and 1971
to 2.1% in 1972. ELCOM's power market, being susceptible to changing and
uncertain economic conditions, is projected to grow at a reduced rate of 8.6%
as against 21% forecast in 1970 for the period 1969 through 1978. The factors
contributing to the recession are the transient political situation and the
uncertainties of the future. Because of this ELCOM has eliminated all add-
itional generation expansion projects from its 1974-1980 investment program,
since available capacity will meet forecast demand. Its expansion program,
therefore, includes only the Upper Ramu No. 1 Hydro Project under construction
(financed by Loan 737-PNG) and modest distribution facilities.
v.        ELCOM has a good record for reliable supply and service.  Although
the recession is affecting its growth, ELCOM's forecast financial position
would continue to be satisfactory with an operating ratio varying between 59%
and 65%; a net debt/equity ratio improving from 76/24 in 1976 to 73/27 in
1980; and internally generated funds after debt service financing 35% of
capital requirements during 1974/79.



- ii -
vi.       ELCOM presently supplies power to 10 centers of population.  It
has a generating capacity of 70 MW consisting of 37.6 MW of hydroelectric
plant and 32.4 MW of diesel. ELCOM is also responsible for the operation and
maintenarnce of generating and distribution facilities at 142 centers owned
by the PIG Government with a total capacity of 8.9 MW. Three of these centers
situated in the area of the Upper Ramu hydroelectric project will be trans-
ferred to ELCOM in 1976 and incorporated into the system.
vii.      ELCOM's management is able, and its staff is competent.  It was
the first organisation in PNG to appreciate the need to train local staff
and it has had a training program in operation since 1964. At June 30, 1973,
its operating staff totalled 1,247 of which 264 were expatriates. In
addition it had 365 local apprentices, trainees and cadets under training.
The degree of indigenisation (excluding apprentices, etc.) is now 79% as
against 64% in 1970, with a target set for 1980 of about 98%. By then
most of the 25 expatriates still considered essential would be in the more
senior positions.
viii.     The proposed project would be a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$10.8 million equivalent for a ?eriod of 20 years including a 5 year
grace period.



PAPUA NEW GUINEA
PAPUA NEW GUINEA ELECTRICITY COMMISSION
SECOND POWER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia on behalf of the
Government of Papua New Guinea and the Papua New Guinea Electricity Commis-
sion (ELCOM) has requested a Bank loan of US$10.8 million equivalent to
finance the off shore cost element of salaries of expatriates exclusively
engaged in training local staff (44%) modest distribution investments (21%);
and the foreign exchange short-fall on Loan 737-PNG resulting from recent
currency adjustments (35%). The principal element of the proposed loan
would support a soundly conceived training program which would otherwise
have to be curtailed since no alternative financing is in sight.
1.02      Under the UN Trusteeship Agreement (New Guinea) and the Common-
wealth's Papua New Guinea Act, the Commonwealth was responsible for govern-
ing and developing the Territory up to December 1, 1973. An Administrator,
appointed by the Commonwealth Governor-General, administered the Territory
with the assistance of an Executive Council (AEC). Originally self-
government was anticipated in the mid 1970's and independence in the 1980's.
The Commonwealth has accelerated the time-table, and self-government was
achieved on December 1, 1973.  Papua New Guinea is expected to become indepen-
dent in December this year. A legislature has been elected, a Government
formed, and the functions of the AEC have been taken over by the Cabinet.
1.03      ELCOM was established as a Statutory Corporation on July 1, 1963,
when it took over the functions of the Administration's Electrical Under-
taking Branch. On establishment, nine separate electric supply systems,
each serving a center of population, were transferred to ELCOM. The
present number of 10 will increase to 13 when the Supply Systems at Mt.
Hagen, Kainantu and Kundiawa are transferred to ELCOM in 1976 on the com-
missioning of the Upper Ramu No. 1 Hydroelectric Scheme (Loan 737-PNG).
ELCOM also operates and maintains generation and distribution facilities
at 142 other centers owned by the Government, with funds provided by
the Government. In time these would be transferred to ELCOM, if transfer
does not impose any financial burden on ELCOM.
1.04      As a result of the present transient political situation,
business and industrial activity has appreciably slowed down throughout
the country. Current power market growth is predicted at an average annual
growth rate of only about 8.6% over 1974-1980 as against 21% forecast in
1970 over 1969-1978. Actual results in 1973 were about 25% below the 1970
forecast. Business is waiting for the situation to stabilize and for the
new Government to clarify and publish its economic policies. This climate
of uncertainty, the declared policy of the new Government to replace
expatriates with indigenes, and the announcement of its intent to issue its



- 2 -
own currency, is expected to result in the departure of a great number of the
non-indigenous population.
1.05      Progress on the Upper Ramu No. 1 Hydroelectric Project financed
through Loan 737-PNG is satisfactory. The present estimated A$ cost of the
project still corresponds to the original estimate althougn it exceeds the
original est mated US$ costs by 27% at today's exchange rates. This
corresponds to a shortfail in the foreign currency elenent financed by
Loan 737-PNG of about US$3.8 million equivalent or about 16%. The project
is still economically justified even with the changed economic situation
(paras 6.01 - 6.06).
1.06      This report was prepared by Messrs E. A. Minnig (Power Engineer)
and S. S. Scales (Financial Analyst) from information prepared by ELCOM,
economic data provided by the Territory Office of Programming and Co-ordination,
and information obtained during a supervision mission in June/July, 1973.
II. THE ECOhsOMY AND THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and its Economy
2.01      Papua New Guinea extends over 800,000 sq miles of tropical seas
north of Australia. The eastern half of New Guinea and the three largest
islands - New Britain, New Ireland and Bougainville - comprise most of the
land surface of 180,000 sq miles (about 475,000 km2). It is an area of
unusual diversity with extremely rugged mountain ranges, wide valleys, large
river systems, extensive jungles, and vast swamps.
2.02      Population in mid-1972 was estimated at about 2.58 million, of
which 2% or about 50,000 are non-indigenous. The rate of growth of the
indigenous population between 1969 and 1972 has been 2.7% p.a., but
growth of the non-indigenous population, because of changing economic
conditions and forthcoming independence, changed from net increases of
2,026 in 1969; 4,478 in 1970; and 3,024 in 1971, to a net decrease of 5,286
in 1972 accelerating to a decrease of 5,485 for the first six months of
1973. Population density averages 14.3/sq mile (5.4/sq km) but ranges from
1.5 to 60 according to district.
2.03      At the time of appraisal of Loan 737-PNG in 1970, the Gross
Monetized Sector Product (GMSP) was forecast to increase on average at
10% for 1969-1973 compared to an average growth rate of 12% achieved since
1966. In 1970, however, self-government was not expected before 1975
and independence not before the early 1980's. Papua New Guinea has now
achieved self-government and it is expected to become independent at the end
of this year. Because of the transient political situation there is a
general slowdown of business and industrial activity, since prospective
investors found that they had to deal with two governments, one in Canberra
and one in Port Moresby. Together w-ith this, but also because of the uncertainty
of the PNG Government's future plans, plus the Government's intention to



drastically reduce the number of expatriate public servants and to
issue a PNG currency, an increasing exodus of expatriates is anticipated.
2.04      Faced with these uncertainties GMSP projections are continually
being revised. The Bank's May 1972 Economic Mission forecast a growth
rate of 9% p.a. from 1973 to 1978; a revised forecast prepared in September,
1972, by the Territory Office of Programming and Coordination estimated a
growth rate of 6.7% p.a. for the same period.
2.05      Papua New Guinea has a dual economy; a large indigenous subsistence
sector based on traditional agriculture (41% of GNP) and a modern monetized
sector which includes export oriented plantation agriculture, Government
operations and services and lately, mining (58.0% of GNP). GNP which
had grown at the rate of 11.1% per anntm between 1969 and 1971 declined
to a rate of 2.1% in 1972. Per capita GNP rose from US$217 in 1969 to
US$295 in 1971 and then receded to US$293 in 1972. Since mid-1971 the
economy has in fact, been passing through a recession, and real GNP declined
by 4%. This slowdown is attributable to the political factors already mentioned,
a general decline in world market prices of PNG's major export crops (copra,
cocoa, rubber, palm oil and coffee) and to a sharp drop of investment outlays
after the completion of the Bougainville Copper Mine. However, export prices
have started to recover, and when the political situation has stabilized, long
term prospects for PNG's economic development will be more favorable; one
indication is the obvious interest shown by other countries and industries in
the development of the country's natural resources (hydro and copper).
2.06      The recent economic recession is reflected in ELCOM's energy
sales which have fallen substantially below predictions. Historic growth
rates during the period 1964 to 1970 were 25.4% for the Upper Ramu Service
Area (to be served by the project financed under Loan 737-PNG) and 19.2% for
its other service areas. In 1970 these were forecast to continue at the
high rates of 25.8% and 18.9% respectively during the period 1970/78.
However, the latest forecast (June 1973) projects growth rates of only
8.6% for the period 1974/80. In 1973 per capita consumption of electricity
amounted to 322 kWh, which includes the energy produced by Bougainville
Copper Ltd. Excluding this enclave project, per capita consumption would
have been about 100 kWh. Further details on the economy and the power
market are given in Annex 1.
Energy Resources
2.07      Papua New Guinea has a vast hydro potential totalling some 11,000
MW at sites each capable of producing 300 MW or more. Recent investi-
gations have concentrated on two rivers (i) Purari River flowing into the Gulf,
of Papua (potential 7,200 MW, 6,100 MW firm; and about 53,000 GWh per annum) and
(ii) Musa River flowing into Oro Bay in NE Papua (potential of 400 MW and
about 2,800 GWh per annum). Japan and Australia have shown an interest in
developing and utilizing some of this energy potential to support power
intensive industry, mainly metallurgical, but it is unlikely that any devel-
opments will materialize before the late 1980's. The changing world energy
situation may accelerate the development of PNG's hydro resources.



- 4 -
2.08      There are no known economic deposits of coal.  Prospects for oil
and gas of commercial value are considered favorable following an off-shore
gas strike in the Gulf of Papua and further prospecting is under way.  Fuel
imports in 1972 totalled about A$ 12.8 million, of which ELCOM's share for
electricity generation was about 5.7%.
Tae Power Sector
2.09      Virtually all power facilities were destroyed during World War II.
The Commonwealth Department of Works (COMWORKS) was made respDonsible for
reconstruction, and in 1957 the Territory Administration accepted this
responsibility by creating the Electrical Undertaking Branch. On July 1, 1963,
ELCOM was established and assumed full responsibility for nine centers.
ELCOM was also required to provide services at 128 other centers owned by
the Administration.
2.10      The centers presently served by ELCOM and their population
(1970) are: Port Moresby (56,200); Lae (24,300); Rabaul (20,300); Madang
(11,200); Goroka (7,900): Samari (2,200); Wewax (8,945); Kavieng (2,140);
Kokopo (537). In October 1972, Kieta-Arawa (755), which is the headquarters
for the Bougainville Copper Ltd., was added to ELCOM's system, and on com-
pletion of the Upper Ramu Hydroelectric Scheme (45 MW) in mid 1976, Kundiawa
(1,590); Kainantu (1,200); and Mt. Hagen (3,315) will be transferred to
ELCOM by the Government. The locations of these centers together with the
Administration centers are shown on the attached map.
2.11      Outside the centers served by ELCOM (now 10) and by the Administra-
tion (now 142), private generating equipment is generally installed by
missions and plantations. The largest private generating facility is owned
by Bougainville Copper Ltd. (135 MW in three oil-fired steam units), which
also sells power to ELCOM for distribution in Kieta-Arawa. A small hydro
plant with an installed capacity of 5.5 MW is owned by Placer Development Ltd.
near Baiune to the south of Lae. This company, previously engaged in gold
mining operations, has virtually ceased mining activities and now sells about
two-thirds of its output to ELCOM for distribution in Lae with which it is
connected by a 66kV transmission line. !
2.12      As of June 30, 1973, the installed capacity and generation in
1973 in Papua New Guinea were as follows:
Installed Capacity (MW) Annual Generation   % of Total
Hydro    Thermal    Total         GWh          Generation

Of all power generated in the Territory in 19;?3, ELCOM's share amounted to
about 24%.
III. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The Borrower would be the Government of Papua New Guinea, the
Guarantor Australia, and the Beneficiary ELCOM. A Guarantee Agreement would
be entered into between the Bank and Australia, a Loan Agreement between the
Bank and the Government of PNG, and a Project Agreement between the Bank and
ELCOM.
3.02      Various Ordinances governing the use of water for agriculture,
forestry, mining, conservation, water supply and power generation contain
conflicts which neither the Commonwealth nor the Territory Administration
wanted to change while the Territory was moving rapidly towards self govern-
ment as they considered the changes should be made by the newly elected
Government. In the interim, and as a condition of Loan 737-PNG ELCOM was
provided with all the rights to use land and water necessary for its
operations.
3.03      To safeguard ELCOM's interests a default condition was negotiated
under Loan 737-PNG whereby the Bank could suspend or cancel the loan should
legislation be enacted which would materially and adversely affect ELCOM.
This default condition has been incorporated in the loan documents of the
proposed loan.
ELCOM's Management and Organisation
3.04      ELCOM has an able management, and its staff is competent in both
operation and planning. It is governed by a full-time Commissioner and
five part-time Associate Cormissioners who were appointed by the Commonwealth
Minister of External Territories. With self-government, the Commissioners
will in future be appointed by the PNG Cabinet on the recommendation of the
PNG Minister of Mines and Energy. Senior staff are appointed by the Commis-
sioners, and their terms and conditions of employment are determined by the
Minister. However, in the present transitionary period, ELCOM is required
to consult with the Public Service Board (PSB) before renewing expatriate
contracts. Although empowered to process ELCOM's proposals the PSB submits
them to the Cabinet for decision because of implications on other statutory
authorities. As contracts expire and the terms of new contracts remain
undecided the Commission risks losing staff essential to operations, and
because of this, it was agreed during appraisal that the Cabinet would
consider ELCOM's proposals expeditiously. As a result ELCCM was permitted to
extend existing contracts by two years. Nevertheless, ELCOM lost 56 ex-
patriates during the past 6 months and has been unable to recruit replacements.
Recruitment efforts for operational staff are currently underway in Malaysia
and the Philippines. Contracts to be offered to new staff will, however, be
subject to the Public Service Board's guidelines.

3.05      Wnen the last loan was considered in 1971, assurances were
obtained that ELCOM would consult with the Bank before making appointments
to the positions of General Manager, k.ss stant General Manager (Finance and
Administration) and Assistant General Manager (Engineering). This covenant
has been repeated.
3.06      At June 30, 1970, ELCOM's staff totalled 1,556 of which 388 were
expatriates, 677 local staff and 491 iocal apprentices, trainees and cadets.
At June 30, .973, staff totalled 1,612 of which 264 were expatriates, 983
locals, ana 365 local apprentices, trainees and cadets. Of the local staff
221 were seconded by ELCOM to administration owned Centers. The degree of
indigenisation (excluding apprentices, trainees and cadets) is now 79% as
against 64% in 1970, with a target set for 1980 of about 98%. By then,
only about 25 expatriates are expected to remain. Annex 2 shows ELCOM's
present organisation chart.
3.07      ELCOM was the first organisation in Papua New Guinea to appreciate
the need to train local staff.  It built and staffed its own Training
School and provided courses in power plant operation for mechanics, electri-
cians, linesmen and also for clerical staff. It is currently sponsoring 97
high school graduates as cadets to the University of Papua New Guinea (Port
Moresby) and to the Technical University of Papua New Guinea (Lae) to receive
education as lawyers, economists, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers,
and as surveyors. At the peak in 1972, 517 locals were under training. The
cost of training reached a high of A$ 670,000 in 1970 (US$750,000 at then
prevailing exchange rates) representing nearly 15% of revenues. During
negotiations of Loan 737-PNG the Administration agreed to proviile ELCOM
with at least A$ 90,000 annually up to 1978 towards the cost of training,
because after completion of their courses some trainees find employment in
the private sector, whilst others are seconded to Administration owned
Centers. This covenant in the Loan Agreement of Loan 737-PNG has been
repeated.
3.08      ELCOM's foresight in training has given it a good start towards
implementing the government's policy of accelerated indigenisation.
Existing Facilities
3.09      To serve its present centers, which are not interconnected because
of the transmission distance involved, ELCOM had available at June 30, 1973
a total of 70 MW of generating capacity of which 38 MW was hydro and 32 MW
diesel. Annex 3 lists the individual power plants with their installed
capacity. Annex 4 lists ELCOM's transmission and distribution facilities
and Annex 5 provides supply point transformer statistics whilst Annex 6
gives distribution substation statistics.
3.10      Existing facilities are adequate, and because of the rapid drop
in the growth rate, generating facilities, especially in Port Moresby, are
at the moment excessive. Plant is generally well maintained and service
interruptions are few and not related to design defects or poor operations.

Future Development Plans
3.11      Investigations are proceeding on a continual basis to ensure that
when the need arises, new generat:ing facilities can be built economically
and with the least possible delay.   ELCOM's consultants, Commonwealth
Department of Works (COMWORKS), are currently investigating several alter-
native hydro sites which could supplement the Upper Ramu Project should
ELCOM be called upon to serve the demand of potential mining developments.
Further details of ELCOM's future development strategy are given in Annex 7.

4.02      The current sales growth projections average 8.5% per year for the
period 1974/80 as against 20.9% forecast in 1970 for 1969/78. Actual results
in 1973 were about 25% below the 1970 forecast. In view of this, ELCOM has
eliminated all generation expansion projects from its 1974/80 investment
program since available capacity would meet forecast demand.
4.03      The loads associated with certain projects presently under dis-
cussion have not been included in the forecasts because of uncertainty
whether they will be constructed before 1980. Inclusion of such loads
could increase ELCOM's demand by 3 MW (8%) in 1974 and about 10 KM (17%)
by 1976. These could be served by the Upper Ramu Project financed through
Loan 737-PNG, investments would be minimal, consisting mainly of extensions
to existing transmission facilities presently under construction.



- 8-
4.04      When ELCOM was established in 1963, it was serving 7,410 consumers,
and arnual consumption per consumer was about 6,270 kWh. At June 30, 1973,
the number of consumers served had increased to 22,853 and consumption
averaged 9,050 kWh/consumer. Thus the average annual growth rate of con-
sumers was 13.2Z for the period and of consumption per consumer about 4.2%.
By 1980 it is estimated that ELCOM would serve about 33,700 consumers
including consumers at Mt. Hagen, Kundiawa and Kainantu centers presently
served by the Administration but scheduled for takeover by ELCOM on December
31, 1975. Average consumption per consumer in 1980 is estimated at 11,800
kWh, which is high reflecting the low degree of electrification (only about
7% of the population presently benefit from the use of electricity). Thus
the forecast average annual growth rate of consumers from 1973 to 1980 is
only 5.8% (despite the takeover of the three additional centers by ELCOM) and
of consumption per consumer about 3.8%.
4.05      In 1973, of total sales of 204.8 Gwh, 26.5% were for domestic purposes;
56.2% for commercial and small industrial enterprises, 17.0% for larger
industries, and about 0.3% for public lighting. In 1980 with forecast sales
of 356.8 Gwh, 29% would be for domestic purposes; 55.6% for commercial and
small industrial enterprises; 15% for larger industries; and about 0.4% for
public lighting.   The share of domestic load thus increases whilst that of
commercial and industrial enterprises decreases reflecting again the changed
political and economic situation.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The proposed project aims at helping PNG to strengthen and
localize ELCOM and consists of two main items: a) technical assistance
for ELCCt's in-service training program during the period 1974-79, and
b) expansion of ELCoM's distribution network. The project would also
include financing to cover the cost over-run under the first power
project (Loan 737-PNG) which is attributable to exchange rate adjustments.
5.02      In-Service Training.  ELCOM's objective is to accelerate in-service
training of local staff to permit an early and rapid reduction of expatriates.
To achieve this two alternatives are possible: (i) the counterpart system,
whereby a particular establishment function would be filled by a local and
an expatriate. The duties of the expatriate, in addition to his functional
duties, would be the training of his local counterpart: and (ii) the transfer
of full responsibility to the local with one expatriate supervising and
providing in-service training to more than one local. The first alternative
is considered not only costly but ineffective, because locals are generally
reluctant to press for responsibility and expatriates seldom take the time
or the patience to properly train their local counterparts. The more effective
their training, the sooner they lose their jobs. The second alternative
has the advantage of clearly establishing the function and duties of the
expatriate trainer, his term of employment is clearly defined, and the more
effective he is, the greater the possibility of contract renewal.  The effect
on the local is also positive, because of increased motivation and pride.
ELCOM rightly selected the second alternative; its foresight in having an



- 9 -
intensive training effort underway allows it to do so. The diagram attached
as Annex 15 shows its past manpower development, its forecast manpower
requirements, and its targets for indigenisation. Annex 16 describes in
detail its Training Center, the type of training provided and its future
training plans.
5.03      ELCOM's plans for in-service training and the utilisation of
expatriate staff can be summarized as follows,
Locals Receiving
Expatriate Staff                In-Service Training

1974                    141       99/a    240            98         64      162/a

1976                     89       91       180          112         95      207
1977                     25       75       100           96         101     197
1978                     25       50       75           105         116     221

/a   Six months only.
5.04      The in-service training envisaged would cover a period of five
years. The program provides for 385 trainer man years and 1038 trainee
man years involving a total of 528 locals. Thus, by 1980 about 1/3 of local
staff will have benefitted from this in-service training program. The ratio
of trainers to locals would be about 1:3. Promising local tradesmen already
trained or in training would be selected for in-service training as super-
visors (Senior Artisans, Senior Power Station Operators, Technicians).
Qualified technical and commercial officers would be promoted to more senior
positions. Graduate cadets (engineers, accountants) would be given immediate
responsibility at smaller centers. The necessary supervision and training
would be provided by selected expatriates relieved of operational responsibility
and administratively attached to the Education and Training Branch. To
supplement and complement this effort it will be essential for ELCOM to
continue its classroom training program. Accordingly ELCOM has agreed that
(a) the Hohola Training School will continue to operate to meet ELCOM's
requirements; and (b) any subsequent appointment to the position of Principal
of the Hohola Training School be made only after prior consultation with the
Bank. (The present Principal is well qualified, dedicated, and competent).
5.05      The technical assistance program will cost about US$7.8 million
of which the Bank would finance the off-shore element of expatriates'
salaries (US$4.7 million) which is basically the difference between the ex-
patriate and local salary of equivalent grade and represents about 60% of
the gross salary. It also corresponds to gross salaries including benefits
reduced by expected expenditures in PNG for subsistence, housing, local
taxes, etc. Since training provides long-term benefits, costs can reasonably



- 10 -
be termed long-term capital investments and depreciated over a reasonable
period (10 years is proposed). The costs associated with this program
total A$ 5.26 million or about $5000/trainee tian year, a not insignificant
amount, but justified in view of the subsequetit benefits to be realized.
5.06      Distribution Expansion.  The modest distribution program covering
the 13 new centers ELCOM will be servicing after 1975 is sufficient to meet
ELCOM's needs through 1979. The program consists of 150 distribution trans-
formers totalling about 15 MVA; 47 km of 11 kV and 22 kV primary distribution
lines; 119 km of secondary distribution lines; about 8000 service connections;
about 900 street lights; and about 9,000 meters (Annex 13 gives further
details). The total cost of the distribution program is estimated at
US$5.7 million of which the Bank would finance US$2.3 million.
5.07      Foreign Exchange Shortfall of Loan 737-PNG.  The Upper Ramu
Hydroelectric Scheme is presently under construction in the Highlands by
ELCOM. The project consists of a run-of-the-river underground power station
with an initial installed capacity of 4.5 MW. Included in the project are
320 miles of transmission lines linking centers previously served by small
diesel units. At the beginning of 1976 the project will provide electricity
for the favorably endowed Highland regions and constitute a major element
in ELCOM's plan to establish a national transmission grid. Construction
of the project is proceeding without any major difficulties. The project
financed by Loan 737-PNG (US$23.2 million equivalent) is still within the
original cost estimate as expressed in current A$ or in US$ using pre-March
1971 exchange rates. However, foreign exchange requirements expressed in
US$ at current exchange rates are now estimated at US$27.1 million
equivalent (Annex 14), an increase of about US$3.9 million of which about
US$3.8 million is directly attributable to exchange rate variations. The
existing loan agreement contains the usual covenant requiring the Administra-
tion/Government to cover project cost overruns but the level of assistance
to be given by Australia will be limited and diversion of funds to
the Ramu Project would mean a shortfall elsewhere. Because the shortfall
is not attributable to cost overruns but to other circumstances not
foreseen (exchange variations) at the time of appraisal, the inclusion of
US$3.8 million in the proposed loan to cover the shortfall would be
reasonable.

The physical contingency of 10% on estimated distribution costs is ample
to allow for increased quantities and unestimated items. The price increase
contingency is based on an escalation of about 5% p.a. for local costs and
for the cost of imported materials. Engineering and overhead represents about
20% of total costs, which given the large area served by ELCOM, is not un-
reasonable. The proposed Bank loan would cover the off shore cost component
of the project amounting to US$10.8 million equivalent. If there are any
savings in the project, such savings would be cancelled.
5.09      Procurement and Disbursements.  All procurement, except services,
would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines dated April 1972. Disbursements for technical
assistance would be on a reimbursement basis equal to 60% of expenditure by
ELCOM on gross salary and benefits of expatriate trainer staff and would
include retroactive financing for payments made after January 1, 1974
equivalent to about US$300,000. Disbursement of the distribution element
would be made only for the actual c.i.f. cost of equipment and materials
and for the off shore cost of services. Disbursements of the foreign ex-
change shortfall of Loan 737-PNG would be made against contracts already
approved and awarded.
5.10      Construction Schedule.  Construction of the distribution system
extension would be carried out in 1975 to 1979 by ELCOM's own force, which
is capable of carrying out work of this nature.
5.11      Consulting Services.  No consultants are required for the dis-
tribution element of the project. ELCOM staff is capable and adequately
trained for design, construction and supervision of transmission and
distribution work.

VI. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
6.01      As the project contains three separate and distinct items, an
overall economic evaluation has not been attempted. Each item is dealt with
separately.
In-Service Training
6.02      Accelerated indigenization is a government policy introduced to
enable the local population to play a greater part in the economy and to
encourage greater self reliance, independent of any financial advantages
which this may involve. The benefits are difficult to quantify. The
justification of this item of the project is based on the financial savings
due to the salary differential between expatriate and local staff of equiva-
lent grade and responsibility. To test this a discounted cash flow analysis
was carried out over a period of 20 years of two cost streams, one representing
ELCOM's cost without the proposed training (continued employment of expatriates)
and the second representing ELCOM's costs with in-service training reducing
the number of expatriates over time as local staff accept full operational
respons.bility. The discount rate which equalized the two streams was found
to be in excess of 48%.
Distribution Expansion
6.03      This modest expansion covers the five years through 1979.  Rehabil-
itation, strengthening of existing systems and expansion are involved. A
rate of return on this element of the project has not been estimated due to
the problem of allocating incremental revenues to existing and new facilities.
Foreign Exchange Shortfall of Loan 737-PNG
6.04      The Upper Ramu Hydroelectric project was planned for two stages:
No. 1, a 45 MW run-of-the-river plant and No. 2, installation of two additional
15 MW units plus the construction of a storage dam to provide regulation for
a firm output of 60 MW at the system load factor.
6.05      A probability analysis comparing the project to the most
economical thermal alternative was made at the time of original appraisal.
Three values were introduced for the variables: load forecasts, capital costs
for the hydro and thermal alternative, and fuel prices. The resulting mean
value of the discount rate which equalized the present value of the cost
streams was 17.6%. This analysis was repeated based on information available
in July 1973. The resulting mean vaiue of the discount rate was 18.8%. If
today's fuel costs were introduced into the analysis the discount rate would
be at least 25%.
6.06      This surprising result is attributable to three factors:
(a)  .he basic cost estimate of the Upper Ramu Hydro Project
expressed in Australian dollars made in 1970 proved to be



- 13 -
accurate; thus a probability of I could be assigned to the
hydro capital costs in the revised analysis;
(b)  fuel costs for the thermal alternative were, already in
July 1973, higher than the most probable value assigned
in the 1970 analysis;
(c)  because of the lower load forecast there is now no immediate
need for existing diesel equipment to firm up output, thus
saving fuel expenses in the earlier years which originally
had to be allocated to the hydro cost stream.
VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
7.01      ELCOM has a good record for reliable supply and service and
its financial position has been sound. However, since 1971 ELCOM's
market has suffered from business and industrial activity slowdown due
to the transient political situation (para 2.03). ELCOM's financial
forecasts have therefore been proje:ted conservatively.
Past and Present Earnings
7.02      When ELCOM was established in July 1963 it became responsible for
nine central supply systems. Its revenues were based on a tariff structure
which remained unchanged until 1968. At that time the structure was revised
to remove certain inequities and as a result revenue per kWH sold declined by
about 7%. Partly for this reason, but mainly due to a substantial increase
in expatriate staff for operations to cope with the rapid expansion of
facilities (a growth of 3MW/year in the past increasing to about 14MW/year).
ELCOM's rate of return fell from 8.4% in 1968 to 4.7% in 1969. This low
return continued until a 5% tariff increase became operative in November 1970.
On the basis of forecasts which incorporated this tariff increase, ELCOM
agreed in 1971 in connection with the Loan 737-PNG to maintain tariffs suf-
ficient to produce an annual rate of return of not less than 9% on its averaged
net fixed assets in service in 1972 through 1976 and not less than 10% there-
after. The slowdown in business and industrial activity starting in 1971
resulted in a rate of return of 7.3% for 1972 and 8.5% for 1973, compared
to the 9% required by the Loan Agreement.
Present Financial Position
7.03      ELCOM's financial position at June 30, 1973 was sound with net long
term debt representing 73% of capitalisation; the value of current assets
exceeding by four times the value of current liabilities; the Sinking Funds
and Insurance Funds sufficiently liquid to meet the purposes of the funds;
and internal cash generation covering debt service for the year by 2.3 times.
7.04      Condensed balance sheets as at June 30, 1970, through 1980 are
shown in Annex 19. The estimated 1973 balance sheet shows ELCOM's current
financial position. Gross plant of A$ 37.4 million consists of the original



- 14 -
fixed assets transferred froa the Administration for a net value of A$ 5.8
million when ELCOM was estab;ished, subsequent additions at historic cost
and plant taken over from the Administration during 1973 having a net value
of A$ 0.9 million. Work in progress of A$ 13 million includes A$ 10.5 million
in respect of the construction of the Upper Ramu hydroelectric Plant No. I
and the Rouna hydroelectric Plant No. 3.
7.05      Tne current ratio of 4.1/1.0 (Including current maturities of
long-term debt) is satisfactory. Cash on hand is adequate to meet normal
working capital requirements.
7.06      ELCOM's capitalization at June 30, 1973 is sunnarized as follows:

7.07      Total equity represents 27% of capitalization.  The Administration's
equity represents the agreed value of the original assets transferred together
with the value of A$ 0.9 million for plant at Kieta and Keravat transferred
during 1973.
7.08      Long-term debt is detailed in Annex 20.  The Administration's 1/
loans carry interest rates of between 5-1/8% and 7-3/4% and are repayable
after periods of 20, 25 and 40 years. The IBRD loan of A$ 4.5 million is
that part of Loan 737-PNG drawn to date to finance the Upper Ramu hydro-
electric project. The loan should be fully withdrawn by the end of 1975.
Other debt consists of supplier credits which will be repaid by 1977.
Sinking Fund
7.09      Sinking funds have been established to repay Government loans
upon maturity. As they complicate unnecessarily the servicing of debt,
1/   As from December 1, 1973 the Government of PNG took over the former
Administration's equity and loans.

future Government loans should require normal level debt service. ELCOM
may desire to go further and substitute a similar method for servicing
existing Government debt. In such an event, the arrangements made between
ELCOM and the Government woull be discussed with the Bank.
Insurance
7.10      ELCOM is accumulating an Insurance Fund to cover various risks
from fire, explosion, and other damage and loss. The annual premia assessed
by ELCOM's insurance consultant are properly charged as an operating ex-
pense. The fund amounted to A$ 1.75 million, or US$2.6 million equiv-
alent as at June 30, 1973. Apart from possible catastrophic loss, the
forecast annual premia together with interest on the Fund's investments
exceeds the forecast annual claims. However, after independence and the
creat:ion of a new PNG currency, the Fund may not provide foreign exchange
to pEy for replacement or repair of plant. The Borrower has therefore
undertaken to use its best efforts to convert funds held by ELCOM in its
insurance fund into currencies freely usable by ELCOM to replace or repair
assets in the event of loss or damage.
Audit
7.11      The existing Project Agreement requires annual audits by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and audited statements within
4 months of the end of the financial year. This covenant has been
repeated. The last audit was made by the Auditor General for the Common-
wealth of Australia. This arrangement will likely cease when Papua New
Guinea achieves independence. The new PNG Government is expected to
establish a PNG Auditor General's Office to undertake, inter alia, ELCOM's
annual audit as required by Sec. 23 of the Electricity Commission Ordinance.
This was discussed during negotiations and it was agreed that, in the event
the PNG Auditor General should not have personnel with the necessary
qualifications to carry out the commercial audit, ELCOM would employ an
independence firm of professional accountants to either assist the Auditor
General in the audit or alternatively to provide the Bank with an independent
commercial audit.
Proposed Financing Plan
7.12      Annex 21 presents sources and application of funds for 1973-80.
It is based on sales forecasts discussed in Chapter 4 and the income state-
ments in Annex 23. A summary of .he proposed financing plan covering the
six-year period 1974 through 1979 is shown below:

7.13      Net internal cash generation would finance 35% of ELCOM's capital
requirements.  Borrowing detailed in Annex 20 would finance the remaining
65%, and would consist of the balance of Bank Loan 737-PNG, the proposed
Bank loan of US$10.8 million equivalent or A$ 7.2 million, local loans of
A$ 9.8 million of which A$ 8.8 million represents loans which the Admini-
istration has already agreed to provide and estimated advances of A$ 1.1
million from consumers. A short-term bridging loan of A$ 3 million would
be required in 1974 repayable in early 1975, and an additional A$ 1 million
later in 1975 repayable in 1976. ELCOM has indicated that these funds would
be made available by either the Government or the Bank of Papua New Guinea.
Additionally ELCOM's present undertaking to provide a financial plan satis-
factory to the Bank before committing itself to any future construction
project costing in excess of A$ 10 million has been repeated in the proposed
loan agreement.
Future Financial Position
7.14      Revenues are based on forecast sales growth of 8.5% through 1980
(para 4.01). Projected operating expenses (Annex 23) assume that the
cost of those expatriates wholly engaged in training during the five-year
period from mid-1974 through mid-1979 would be deferred and written off
over 10 years. On this basis, the 9% return required by the existing



- 17 -
loan agreement would be achieved in 1974 and 1975. Subsequently, returns
of 8.4%, 6.9%, 7.4%, 7.6% and 7.9% for 1976 through 1980 are forecast,
which would be below the targets of 9% until 1976 and 10% thereafter set
forth in the existing covenant. This forecast failure to meet the agreed
returns results principally from the low rate of market growth adopted for
this report; the agreed returns would be met should the additional load
described in para 4.03 maternalize. Paradoxically, the financial situation
is forecast to remain sound even with low market growth: the operating
ratio would vary between 59% and 65%, the net debt equity ratio would
improve from 76/24 in 1976 to 73/27 in 1980 and internal cash generation
net of debt service would cover 35% of capital reuqirements during 1974-1979.
Given these circumstances, the existing earnings test covenant has been
continued in the proposed Project Agreement, recognizing that it may be waived
for some years after 1975 provided ELCOM's financial situation for the year
in question remains satisfactory to the Bank. The existing covenant preventing
payment of dividends before July 1978 without the Bank's approval has also
been continued.
7.15      The Administration agreed in connection with the last loan that
in transferring any of its assets to ELCOM it would: (a) accept in payment
therefor a suitable form of equity corresponding to the agreed value of
such transfer; and (b) make available annually to ELCOM amounts sufficient
to cover the losses on any power systems transferred. These undertakings
were repeated in the proposed Loan Agreement.
7.16      Estimated gross assets in service are forecast to increase from
A$ 40 million (US$59 million equivalent) at the end of 1974 to A$ 83 million
(US$123 million) by 1976 after the Rouna No. 3 hydroelectric plant and the
Upper Ramu hydroelectric plant No. 1 are commissioned (Annex 19). Sub-
sequently investment in distribution accounts for the increased plant value
to A$ 90 million (US$133 million) by the end of 1980.
7.17      Long-term debt net of sinking funds represents 77% of total
capitalization in 1974 rising to 79% in 1975 then declining gradually to
76% in 1980. The current ratio drops from 4.1 in 1973 to 1.2 in 1974 due
to the short-term bridging loan of A$ 3 million. Subsequently the ratio
rises to 3.5 by 1978. The reduction to 3.2 in 1979 and 1980 reflects the
beginning of the payment of dividends.
7.18      ELCOM's internal cash generation would cover annual debt
service 1.9 times on average, a satisfactory coverage on a year to year
basis. However, the existing covenant of Loan 737-PNG provides that ELCOM
shall not incur any long-term debt, except as the Bank may otherwise
agree, if its net revenue for the fiscal year next preceding the date of
such incurrence shall be less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirement for any successive year-on all the debt of ELCOM including the
debt to be incurred. The 1.5 times coverage, which is strict, was based
on ELCOM's previously provided high market growth and high earnings. It
cannot reasonably be achieved in the next few years unless loan growth
(para 4.03) and increased revenues (para 7.14) materialize. ELCOM's net
revenues would then exceed 1.5 times the maximum debt service for any
succeeding year. In the circumstances the covenant was continued.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECONKENDATION
8.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the fo}lowing
points and appropriate covenants included in the legal documents for the
proposed Loan:
(a) an earning test (para 7.14);
(b) debt control (para 7.18); and
(c) training program (para 5.04).
8.02      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$10.9 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years including a grace period of five years.

FUTUREu DEVELOPMENT PLANS
Port Moresby
Lower than anticipated load growth in this area has indefinitely
postponed the iouna No. L (9 M{) hydroelectric plant on the Laloki River
-riginally scheduled for commissioning in 1976. Rouna No. 3 (12 MW) is
presently under construction and scheduled for commissioning in 1974.
Because developments on other rivers are too large or too far away from
the service area ELCOM's intention was to establish a large diesel power
station (30 NW) at Baruni of which the first phase (12 MW) would be
(oommissioned in 1976. This project has also been deferred into the 1980's.
The Musa diver 1gjdroelectric Scheme
This hydro project which could serve a large industrial load
is located in North East Papua and has a potential of 400 MW and about
2300 Gdh annually. Various developments are possible ranging in size
f um u3-400 INW with costs from A" 50-125 million. The cost of energy
-varies from about 0.9 A cents/kWh to about O.45 A cents/kWh depending on
"he size of the installation.
Upper Uamu Area (New Guinea)
With the Upper iRamu No. 1 hydro project (15 MW) presently under
construc-tion and scheduled for commissioning in FY 1976 no further
g,enerating facilities will be required in this area to serve the present
load forecast. As load increases, the construction of the dam to firm
up amu No. 1 output and the installation of two additional 15 IL units
would be the next stage of development.  This would be undoubtedly the
ra)st economic solution and would require an investment of about A$ 14
,nillion. Additional transmission would be unnecessary. The next step
would be the construction of a second Rlamu hydro plant (75 MW) below
"lo. 1, costing about Aki23 million also benefiting from the storage
provided. fRamu No. 3 of 100 NW downstream of No. 2 costing about A$ 32
,illion including transmission would -,hen follow thus fully utilising
the potential of the Upper Ramu River (250 IW).
Ai potential industrial load that M1COM could be required to
zirve is for the OK Tedi Copper Developmen-t near the border with West
irOlLan ir Papua.  Prospects that this development T-ill materialize are
good.  Unfortumately a possible hydro development on the OK Tedi river
near the development, is both costly and requires standby diesel power
La firm up output.



Annex 7
page 2 of ? pabze<
An alternative would be to connect thiis load (29 MW) to the itamu sa2teu
at Mt. Hagen, but because of the lon! transmission required system
stability problems could arise.  ELCDM's consultants have therefore
nvestigated other hydro sites.  One possible development exists on the
Waga river, a tributary of the Kikori river which flows into the Gulf
of Papua.  The scheme itself is about 35) km west of Mendi and would lend
itself to a staged development with an ultimate capacity of about 500 li.
The first phase as presently envisaged would consist of a 75 MW run-of-
the-river plant with a firm output of about SO MW. Geological difficuli;ies
exist, however, and field investigations are underway. The investments
required for a first stage development are tentatively estimated at
A$ 28.0 million of A.T 375/KW installed Transmission facilities to connect
this scheme to the amu system now under construction, would re(quire a
further A$ 7.5 million. Should the Frieda iRiver Copper Development to
the North of OK Tedi but on the New Guinea side eventuate, the
incremental costs to connect this additional load of about 25 Mv would
be about AD 2.0 million.
Purari River Development
Investigations of the hydro potential of this river which flows
into the Gulf of Papua have identified six sites with a possible installed
capacity of 7200 MW of which o100 MW would be firm.  Annual energy
generation would be about 53,000 GWh. One particular site -- the Wabo
site -- has been the subject of detailed investigation.  A 110 m high  n
would create a storage of about 13,500 million ml of which 5,300 million m
would be active.  Firm discharge would be 100 m3/sec, 15L0 NW could be
installed and firm output would be 1320 MW with 11,000 GWh generated
annually. The cost of this scheme has been estimated at about US'.330
million (1972 price and currency exchange levels) and the cost of energy a-t
about US mills 3.5/kwh.
The new Government of Papua New Guinea has taken an active
interest in this developaent and is seeking power intensive industries to
absorb the available energy. Japan and Australia have shown some interest
and investigations are proceeding but construction is not an-ticipated
before the early 1980's.  With a construction period of 5 - 5  years
commissioning of such a plant would be in the late 1980's.

RISVIE  OF EC0NaC TREiNTD" A"D PROSP94CTS TN THE
AREA TO BE SERVED 3Y THJ UPP&E R UJ HY-DROELTKIPIC PROJECT
Papua New Guinea is scheduled to achieve self-government on the
1st December, 1973, or soon thereafter and the date of independence is
expected to follow very closely. In the present transient political
situation there is a general slowdown of business and industrial activity
throughout the country. Prospective investors find. they have to deal withi
two governments, one in Canberra and one in Port Moresby. Everybody is
waiting for the situation to stabilise and for the new Government to
publish its investment guidelines. This climate, coupled with the Papua
New Guinea Government's declared policy of indigenisation, is expected to
result in th.e departure of at least half of the non-indigenous population.
It is expected that activities will start up again once the above changes
have taken place. In the past ten years there has been an increa.se in the
use of air conditioning and night time security lighting, resulting in an
increased night load and a greatly improved load factor. The evening peak
is expected to decrease due to the expected reduction of domestic cooking.
LAE
This is the main town served by the Ramu Scheme and the size of
the town and its industry is second only to Port Moresby. Half of the
population of Papua New Guinea is connected to Lae by the Highlands Highway,
thus it is a very important service centre.
In 1970 the total number of inhabitants was 2)4,339 including
4.G75 non-indigenous.  The total inhabitants increased to 31!,,99 by 1971,
of whom 6,205 were non-indigenous. 52 GWh were sold in Lae in 1972/73
(lst May, 1972 to 31st May, 1973) compared with 23.8 GWh in 1958/69,
representing an average annual increase of 21.6%. The maximum demand in
1972/73 was 8.63 MW as against 4.15 MW in 1968/59, an increase of 18'.
The largest increase in consumption in the next two or three
years is expected to come from the expansion taking place at the Papua
New Guinea University of Technology.  There are plans for the establishmen_,
of a wood pulp mill at Finschhafen.  This prospective load of 10 to 1, FE
would also be supplied from the Ramu Scheme.  If the extensive prospecting
results in the discovery of crude oil, it is expected that a refinery wil')
be established in Lae. There are good signs that the town's serious land
problem will be solved as a workable leasing arrangement has been proposed
by the indigenous owners.
MADANG
Madang has the advantage of an excellent deepwater harbour, that
is regarded to be the best on the northern coast of the mainland. In
addition to the Japanese owned chip mill and sawmill that is scheduled t(o
begin operation in February, 197)4, a New Zealand company has establisned
a sawmill which will be augmented by the addition of a chip mill early
next year.

Annex 11
page 2 of 3 pales
Recently it has been announced that a flou.r mill will be
established in Madang and there are hopes for the establishment of a fish
cannery.  The good harbour mentioned above is expected to attract a
Joint Forces base/naval base.  The confidence of Madangrs tourist
potential is being demonstrated by the present expansion of its leading
hotel.  The access road to be built for the transmission 'ine construction
will be gradually upgraded and this connection of the town to the inland
areas is expected to increase commercial activities in Madang.
Electricity generated in 1972/73 was 14 GWh compared with 8.': GvJhn
in 1968/69, representing an average annual growth rate over the period of
13.7%. Maximum demand rose from 1.79 M to 2.21 MW during the period, an
average increase of 5.4% per annum.  The total population in 1971 was
15,751 persons, including 2,279 expatriates.
G0R0OKA
The further development of Goroka is likely to be restricted by
the lack of suitable land for building purposes. This town will most
likely be the centre of a basically agricultural community with some
cottage industries. Its electricity requirements will come from the
commercial and service establishments and from a number of coffee factories
located five to ten miles from the town.
Power requirements have increased from 4.5 GWh in 1968/69 to,
10.h GWh in 1972/73, an increase of 23.4%.  Maximum demand rose from  T.V) 14d
to 2,025 MW in 1972. Population in 1971 was 10,75; persons, including
1,518 expatriates.
MOUNT HAIGEN
The population in 1971 was 9,609 persons, of which 1,211 were
non-indigenous. In 1972/73 6.1 GWh had been generated in Mt. Hagen
compared with 1.8 GWh in 1968/69 representing an average annual growth rat.e
of 35.7% while the growth rate of the last twelve months was 27%.
KAINANTU AND KUNDIAWA
These towns have very little industrial activity and they will
appear to remain service centers apart from the coffee factories. A
continuing high growth rate therefore appears unlikely.  There are a
number of prospective loads, some of them at a distance from the towns,
which may be connected to the Ramu supply provided the charges will be
acceptable. Both towns have 3 x 100 kW generating capacity and supply is
available for 24 hours a day.
In 1971 the population of Kainantu was 1,2!5 persons (17.
expatriates) and that of Kundiawa was 2,055 persons (245 expatriates).

PROSPECTIVE MAJOR LOADS
(a)   Ok Tedi Copper Project maximum demand 29 MW, yearly energy
requirement 180 GWh expected in 1980.
(b) Frieda River Copper Project maximum demand 25 MW, yearly
energy requirement 150 GW4h expected in 1982.
(c)   Bundi Mining Project estimated maximum demand 20 MW,
yearly energy 120 GWh - possible connection date 1985.
(d)   Paper Pulp Project in Finschhafen (listed previously under
Lae) 3 MW for construction from 197h and 10 - 15 MW' for 197,,.
The above loads are expected to be connected to the Ramu trans-
mission system and studies are presently being made to determine the most
economic alternative of generation expansion (i.e. Yonki Dam and itamu 2 or
another power station on the Lower Waga River, near Mendi).

TRAINING
Historical
1.        After its formation in 1963, ELGOM's first major step to improve
training was the establishment of a Training Center at Hohola near Port
Moresby. In 1965, the Center catered for 40 trainee power station operators
and 40 trainee linesmen who lived and trained at the Center.
2.        In-1966, the Apprenticeship Board agreed to recognize power
station operators, linesmen and commercial trainees as apprentices. Soon
after, when additional dormitories, classrooms, and a workshop were
completed, new courses for commercial and technical apprentices were drawn
up. By February 1967, the Training Center offered continuous courses for
apprentice power station operators, linesmen, clerks, electricians, diesel
mechanics and draftsmen.
3.        The first Commission sponsored cadet to the Institute of Higher
Technical Education in Lae (now Technical University of Papua New Guinea
(Lae)) began his studies the same year. A Commission cadetship entitles
the holder to free education at a tertiary institute, allowances for text-
books, food and accommodation) pocket money, free air travel to and from
the Institute on leave, employment during holidays at full pay, and a
rewarding career on graduation.
4.        An expert on technical education was brought to the Territory by
ELCOM to examine the existing scheme and recommended directions for future
operations. As a result of this assessment eleven extra overseas training
officers were recruited, two additional workshops, extensions to other
workshops, and three new dormitories were completed and detailed plans for
a mess-kitchen with a 260 man capacity were drawn up.
5.        The 1969 apprentice intake totalled 185 (electricians, diesel
mechanics, linesmen, clerks, welders, motor mechanics, printers, and
cooks). 21 cadets began courses at the University of Papua New Guinea (Port
Moresby) and the Technical University of Papua New Guinea (Lae), while 23
trainees started at Lae Technical College.
6.        New courses for apprentice electricians, diesel mechanics and
clerks, and extra general courses in the use of handtools were added to
the curriculum.
7.        In 1970 a new mess-kitchen and dining hall building, library,
study room and recreation room were added and in 1972 an assembly hall and
theatrette together with additional dormitories were completed.

Education and Training Committee
8.        The Education and Training Committee comprises the following
members: Assistant General Manager (Administration and Finance); Chief
Engineer (Operations); Power Production Engineer; Chief Administrative
Officer; Engineer/Manager (New Guinea); Principal Hohola Training Center;
and Master of Apprentices. The Committee meets regularly to plan and discuss
the Commission's training policies. Its decisions are placed before the
Commissioners for approval.
Recruitment
9.        Each year an officer of the Commission's Training Branch visits
every center in the Territory to inform students about the Commission and
the careers available to them through the Hohola Training Center. The
officer again visits students who apply for apprenticeships or cadetships.
All applicants undergo extensive aptitude tests which are given to all
applicants - local or overseas.
Apprenticeships
10.       The Commission's Apprenticeships offer students a way in which to
train to become qualified tradesmen. To qualify as a tradesman, a person has
to undertake training usually from three to four years. Apprenticeships
in the following trades are offered:
1.   Electrician;
2.   Diesel Mechanics;
3.   Clerk (Commercial Apprenticeship);
4.   Linesman; and
5.   Cook/Caterer.
11.       To become an Apprentice a good pass at either Form III or Form IV
level (Intermediate or School Certificate) in Maths, English and Science is
required. The first two years are spent in full-time training at the
Hohola Training Center studying such subjects as Trade Theory; Trade Practice;
Maths; Science; Technical Drawing; First Aid. The following two years are
spent on in-service training.
12.       Upon completion of Apprenticeship, the following promotion opportu-
nities are available:

While training, apprentices are also engaged in correspondence courses in
general subjects to improve their standard of education.
Traineeships
13.       The Commissioner's Traineeships provide courses for Trainee
Technical Officers and Trainee Commercial Officers at the Lae Technical
College.  The courses for Trainee Technical Officers last four years and
for Trainee Commercial Officers three years. The Trainee attends a course
of 14-20 week's duration each year with the remainder of the time spent
on "in-service" training. Trainees are periodically transferred to provide
for the greatest variety of job experience.
14.       On completion of his studies, a Trainee will receive either a
Certificate of Commerce or a Certificate of Engineering and is then known as
either a Technical Officer or Clerk Grade C depending on whether he is a
Technical or Commercial Trainee.
15.       A graduate Trainee Technical Officer may specialize in either
Electrical or Mechanical Engineering as a Draftsman or a Station Controller.
The initial appointment of a Technical Officer, Electrical, could be as an
assistant to a Branch Manager or to an Electrical Engineer. A Technical
Officer, Mechanical, could initially be appointed as an assistant to a Branch
Manager or to a Mechanical Engineer.

Situation at June 30, 1973
22.       The Hohola Training Center employs 21 overseas officers and 27
locals. 310:locals were in training as of this date (6/30/73) of which 175
at the Center and 135 in-service. In the year 1972/73, 123 trainees graduated
increasing the number of qualified graduates to 617. A total of 84 locals
trained by the Commission left the services of the Comaission to take up
employment with private firms, other statutory authorities, the Administration,
and Local Government.
Future Training Plans
23.       Training will continue to be given high priority by ELCOM. The
number of persons receiving training at the Rohola Training Center will,
however, be reduced in line with ELCOM's presently forecast needs. Thus
apprentices and trainees will be gradually reduced to about 150 by June 30,
1976 and maintained at this level thereafter.



ANNEX 16
Page 6 of 10
24.       With cadets graduating in increasing numbers a change in emphasis
of training will result. Graduated cadets will be given immediate and full
responsibility, thus reducing expatriate operational staff. Of the ex-
patriates freed, qualified individuals will be retained by ELCOM to provide
training services. It is foreseen that such selected expatriate would
supervise two or more locals and provide for guidance and training.
25.       Under more normal circumstances the "counterpart" system would
have been adopted whereby one local would work with and receive training
from his expatriate colleague. The duration and success of such training
is, however, dependent not only on the capability of the local and his
willingness to accept responsibility, but also on the attitude and capability
of the expatriate as a trainer. The costs involved would also be high,
because of the virtual doubling of staff.
26.       Because of the appreciable slowdown in construction activity the
approach outlined in paragraph 24 is not only feasible but also less costly.
There is no doubt that a certain risk, insofar as system reliability is
concerned, would be involved. Nevertheless, given the circum tances, the
proposed plan is not only justified, but in the long run will prove to be
more beneficial.
27.       Technical cadets presently in training are scheduled to graduate as
follows:
Fiscal Year      1972   1973   1974    1975    1976    1977
Surveyor                     -       1      -       -        -       1

Electrical Engineer          1       -      5       6       12       6
Mechanical Engineer          1       1      1       3        7       8
Total                  3        2     6       11      19       15
28.       Technical Trainers presently envisaged can be divided into the
following categories and numbers:
Fiscal Year    1974    1975   1976    1977    1978    1979
Engineers Grade 3           4       10      20      20       20       10
Senior Tech. Off. 3        40       50      30      15       15       5

Total                 58       60     50       35       35      15
29.       The primary training functions of Engineers Grade 3 would be to
supervise, provide guidance and train graduate technical cadets. On the
assumption that a three year in-service training period is appropriate,
cadets receiving training would be as follows:

30.       Whilst the above ratio for 1974-1976 indicates an apparent excess
of trainers, this is not the case since an additional function of these trainers
would be the supervision of Senior Technical Officer Trainers during the
three years to ensure satisfactory execution of the proposed program.
31.       The situation with regard commercial staff in similar.  Commercial
cadets would graduate as follows:

32.       Commercial Trainers presently envisaged can be divided into the
following categories and numbers:

33.       The primary training function of commercial professional staff
would be the provision of supervision, guidance and training of commercial
cadets and local commercial officers. The number of these receiving in-service
training is summarized below:
Fiscal Year    1974    1975   1976    1977    1978    1979

34.       As in the case of technical staff, the ratios 1974-1977 indicates
an apparent excess of trainers. Again this is not the case since an addi-
tional function of "professional" trainers is the supervision of the train-
ing provided by "sub-professional trainers and the in-service training of
clerks of which 131 are currently receiving classroom training at the
Hohola Training Center.
