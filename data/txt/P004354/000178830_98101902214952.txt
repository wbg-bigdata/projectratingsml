INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO PAPUA NEW
GUINEA WITH THE GUARANTEE OF AUSTRALIA FOR A SECOND
POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Panua New Guinea with the guarantee of Australia for the equivalent
of UJSS10.8 million to help finance a second power project. The loan would
have a i-erm of 20 years including 5 years of grace with interest at 7-1/4%
per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to the Papua New Guinea
Electricity Commission (ELCOM) on the same terms as those of the Bank loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report "Recent Trends, Problems and Prospects of the Economy
of Papua New Guinea" was circulated to the Executive Directors on March 3,
1973. Countrv data for Papua New Guinea are included in Annex I. A basic
economic mission is presently in the field.   Recent political and economic
develoDments are discussed below.
3.        New Guinea, a UN Trust Territory and Papua, an Australian depen-
dencv which were administered by Australia under an Administrator as one
political and economic unit called Papua New Guinea (PNG), achieved internal
self-vovernment on December 1, 1973. It is expected to become independent on
D)ecember 1, 1974.
4.        In recent years constitutional changes have progressively
increased the political responsibilities of the local population and given
wider power to their representatives. After the general elections in
March 1972 a National Coalition Government was formed, headed by Michael
Somare, the leader of the progressive Pangu Party, who became the counitry's
first Chief Minister.  The new Government has asserted its widened consti-
tutional powers vigorously and has for the first time established an effec-
tive national leadership. Responsibility for public institutions and
agencies has been transferred from Australia to the PNG Government. The
Government has reorganized public administration and localized high-level
positions. At the same time it is making considerable efforts to complete
a PNG constitution, to establish a national monetary system independent of
Australia's and to prepare a five-year development plan to coincide with
the beginning of independence. The Australian Government, now represented
by a High Commissioner in PNG, will continue to be responsible for PNG's
external relations and defense until achievement of independence. However,
the National Coalition Government has already begun to formulate its own
defense policy and to establish first diplomatic contacts with other
countries in the Asian-Pacific region (Indonesia, New Zealand and Japan)
and to find new bilateral aid sources to diversify its foreign relations
and future development partners. PNG has become a member of ADB and ECAFE.



-2 -
5.        The Government's task to prepare PNG for independence and nation-
hood is formidable. Geographic, cultural and ethnic fragmentation of PNG's
ponulation contributes to regional differences. Expansion of transportation
and cornunications is a slow and costly process, impeded by the country's
rugged topography and its multi-insular character. Although the use of
Pidgin ,nglish is increasing, the majority of the people still speak only
one of the 700 local vernaculars. Literacy is very low and the number of
skilled workers, technicians and university graduates has been insufiicient
to replace the numerous expatriates who still dominate both the public and
private sectors of PNG's economy. Hence, PNG's political future and
stability will very much depend on the Government's success in winning
not only the confidence of the various PNG ethnic groups, but in particular,
in localizing public administration in an orderly and gradual fashion and in
providing a favorable investment climate.
6.        Economically, Papua New Guinea approaches independence with a
basically dual structure consisting of (i) a large indigenous
subsistence sector based on traditional agriculture and (ii) a rapidly
expanding modern sector, with emphasis on export oriented plantation agri-
culture, Government operations, services and, lately, also mining.     The
economy as a whole has grown satisfactorily during the 1960's. GDP rose by
almost 8% a year during 1960/61-1965/66, and more recently by almost 11% a
year, owing partly to the implementation of the large Panguna copper mining
project on Boougainville Island. This growth was also sustained by a 15%
average annual increase in the export-oriented modern agricultural sector,
by favorable trends in private non-mining investments and by sharply
rising Governmient expenditures, especially for economic development. Since
growth has been virtually limited to the monetized sector the share of the
traditional subsistence sector, from which the vast majority of the local
population still derives the main part of its living, fell from about two-
thirds to less than 40% during the sixties. Per capita GNP in Papua New
Guinea in 1971 was around US$300, including the high-income expatriate
sector: the per capita income of the indigenous population representing
98% of the total population was probably around US$160, or only 14% higher
than five years before, underscoring the problems of the country's dual
economic structure.
7.        Since mid-1971 the economy has been passing through a recession;
real GNP has declined by 4%. Main factors were the readjustment of private
investment to previous levels after the completion of the construction of
the Bougainville copper mining project, and declining world market prices for
most of the country's agricultural export commodities (copra, cocoa, rubber
and palm oil) as well as temporary marketing difficulties for coffee. In
addition, an understandable atmosphere of uncertainty before self-government
and independence was also a factor in causing the slowdown.
8.        Notwithstanding the temporary recession, the long-term prospects
for PNG's economic development are favorable. Export prices for PNG's
major tree crops have lately started to recover significantly and are
expected to stay at reasonable levels. Furthermore, the country has rich



-3
mineral resources, the exploitation of which has just begun with the
Bougainville project. Equally important will be the Government's effort to
foster development in all regions of the country through the implementation
of its Development Plan.
9.        The Government is currently preparing a Second Five-Year Develop-
ment Plan for the period 1974-79. A provisional Interim Development Plan
for 1973/74 was issued in June 1973. It provides for a greater role of the
local population in the economy, greater attention to rural development in a
broad sense, more balanced development of the various regions and greater
national self-reliance. These objectives reflect to some extent a shift of
emphasis as compared to the First Five-Year Development Plan (1969-73) which
concentrated on the build-up of infrastructure and the development of the
modern sector of the economy. It is, however, recognized that these efforts
were necessary to lay the basis for further progress.
10.       While there seems to be broad consensus among the new PNG leaders
about the necessity to redirect PNG's development priorities, the above-
mentioned objectives and in particular the specific measures and ways of
how to implement them are still being discussed and are not expected to be
finalized before the middle of this year.
11.       Government spending is heavily dependent on external sources of
finance, mainly Australian assistance. Although tax revenues have almost
doubled in the last three years, they and other internal receipts financed
onlv about 43% of total AdministratLon outlays (about US$237 million) in
1972. Australian grant assistance (US$83 million) covered about one-third,
while the rest was financed through increased borrowing in the Australian
capital market and from multilateral aid institutions (IBRD and ADB). In
addition, the Australian Government has in the past been directly responsible
for certain non-administrative outlays - civil aviation, defence, and some
public works, involving gross expenditures in Papua New Guinea of about
US$62 million in 1972. The emphasis in the past on basic social and economic
infrastructure facilities has resulted in rapidly rising current expendi-
tures for maintenance and operations, thus laying a heavy burden on thte
Government's current budget.
12.       The country's tax base rests on the expatriate community and tax
revenue from the local population is still small. Tax rates are fairly low,
about half of the Australian level, to attract foreign capital and expertise.
Currently tax revenue amounts to 16% of GNP in the monetized sector and about
10% of total GNP. The entire revenue system is presently under review with
the aim of imposing higher rates and introducing new taxes. Greater mcobili-
zation of internal resources will, in fact, be the most important fi.ancial
problem the new Government will have to solve if it wants to balance gradual-
ly its current budget with its own resources and make a contribution to public
investment financing.
13.       PNG's external position depends to a great extent on private and
public canital inflows. In spite of a rapid growth of exports during the
latter half of the sixties, there continued to be a large deficit in PNG's



- 4 -
external account which was covered by Australian assistance and private
capital inflows mainly for the construction of the Bougainville copper mine.
Besides the import requirements for this enclave project, the current
account has been affected by increasing import prices, a general rise in
inrorts of capital goods, due to stenped-up development works, and a growing
demaid for consumer goods imports. The services account has lately been
affected by the sharp increase in international shipping freight rates.
14.       Petroleum imports accounted for about 4% of PNG's total imports
in 1972/73 and are estimated to have increased recently to about 10% due
to the rise in petroleum prices. However, the commencement of large copper
and gold exports from the Bougainville copper mine and the favorable
export prices for these products have more than offset these increases.
In fact, the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments is
being reduced significantly. The Bougainville copper mining project, the
second largest of its kind in the world, produced about 183,000 tons of
copper ore in 1973 representing net profits of about A$ 158 million. Since
the company under the present contract enjoys a fairly generous tax holiday
and depreciation concessions, the benefits for the Government budget will
remain rather limited until 1980. It is expected, however, that the
Bougainville copper agreement will be renegotiated so that the Government
will receive greater benefits at an earlier date. Total external public
debt outstanding as of December 31, 1972 amounted to US$177.6 million of
which US$56.3 million (or 31%) was owed to the Bank Group. Debt service
payments in 1972 represented 3.9% of exports of goods and non-factor
services. Debt payments to the Bank Group were very small amounting to
only 6% of total debt service payments. Because of the many uncertainties
any projection of PNG's future debt service situation is very difficult to
make. Neither the amounts nor the terms of future borrowing from bilateral
as well as multilateral sources can at present be forecast with precision.
15.       Australia has given an assurance of continuing aid over the
three year period beginning in FY1975 for a total of A$ 500 million. Other
new bilateral sources (Japan and New Zealand) are also expected to make aid
funds available in the near future. ADB has so far extended two loans to
PNG from its Special Fund: a US$4.8 million loan to the PNG Development
Banl in 1971 (3% interest, 15 vears repayment, including 3 years grace) and
a US$9.8 million loan for two road projects in 1972 (3% interest, 24-1/2
years repayment, including 4-1/2 years grace).
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PNG
16.       The Bank Group's association with Papua New Guinea began with
a general survey mission in 1963. Its report provided the framework for
the country's First Five-Year Development Program, 1969-73. In 1972 the
Bank acted as executing agency for a study, financed by UNDP, to advise
on possible strategies for the Second Five-Year Development Program.



-5-
17.       The Bank has made four loans to PNG for a total of US$44.7 million
and i:he Association four development credits amounting to US$25.2 million.
The largest single loan was US$23.2 million for a hydroelectric project,
which was needed to provide power for one of the most rapidly developing
areas of the country. The remainder of Bank Group lending has been for
telecommunications, highways, ports and agricultural development. These
projects were selected for their high economic priority in helping to open
up the country, to provide basic infrastructure facilities and to bring the
local population into the cash economy. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank' loans and IDA credits as of March 31, 1974 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects.
18.       The IFC has made no investments in Papua New Guinea but is explor-
ing the possibility of doing so.
19.       UJntil the new Papua New Guinea Government has formulated its
development policy in the Second Five-Year Development Program, the appropriate
size and nature of future Bank Group assistance cannot be determined with
precision. However, it is likely that agriculture, education and training
will become the priority sectors in future lending.   Since Government's capa-
city to identify and prepare projects will probably remain limited in the
forseeable future, the Bank will help the Government to prepare projects and
strengthen new public development agencies either in the course of its lending
operations or acting together with other aid donors.
PART III - THiE POWER SECTOR
on.       Virtually all power facilities were destroyed during World War II.
The Australian Commonwealth Department of Works (COMWORKS) was made respon-
sible for reconstruction, and in 1957 the Territory Administration accepted
this responsibility by creating the Electrical Undertaking Branch. Since
1963, planning and coordination of the electricity supply is performed by
the Paptua New Cuinea Electricity Commission (ELCOM). ELCOM has specific
responsibility for the generation, transmission and distribution of elec-
tricity in and to major townships (now 10). In addition, it operates 148
minor center power stations owned by the Administration. Established as a
Statutory Corporation, ELCOM was directly responsible to the Australian
Minister of External Territories before achievement of self-government on
December 1, 1973. Since then, ELCOM reports to the Minister of Mines and
Energy and its Ordinance was changed accordingly. Outside the centers
served by ELCOM private generating equipment is generally installed by
missions and plantations. The largest private generating facility is owned
bv the Bougainville Copper Company (135 MW), which also sells power to
ELCOM for distribution in Kieta. As of June 30, 1973, total installed
generating capacity in PNG amounted to 223 Mega Watt (MW) (43 MW hydro-180
NW thermal), of which about one-third (70 MW) was owned by ELCOM.



- 6 -
21.       A major power project - the Upper Ramu Hydroelectric Scheme -
is presently under construction in the Highlands (New Guinea) by ELCOM.
Total cost of the first phase of this project was estimated at US$33.4
million, of which the Bank financed US$23.2 million or 68% of the total
(Loan 737-PNG). The project consists of a run-of-the-river underground
power station with an initial installed canacity of 45 MW. Included in
the project are 320 miles of transmission lines linking centers previously
served bv small diesel units. At the beginning of 1976 the project will
provide electricity for the favorably endowed Highland Regions and constitute
a major element in ELCOM's plan to establish a national transmission grid.
ITnplenentation of the project is proceeding without major difficulties.    All
contracts have now been awarded and it is expected that construction will
be completed by the end of 1975. However, total project cost, when
expressed in US$ are presently estimated to be about 28% higher due to
recent currency exchange rate adjustments. (See # 31).
22.       Reflecting the rapid growth of the modern sectors of PNG's economy,
ELCOM's power generation and sales rose substantially, recording annual
average growth rates of 17% and 18% respectively during the period 1963/64-
1972/73. The booming power market was also reflected in the tripling of
ELCOM's consumers during the ten year period of its existence. In fact,
when ELCOM was established in 1963, it was serving 7,410 consumers, and
annual consumption per consumer was about 6,270 kWh. At June 30, 1973,
the number of consumers served had increased to 22,853 and consumption
averaged 9,050 kWh/consumer. Thus, the average annual growth rate of
consumers was 13.2% for the period and of consumption per consumer about
4.2%'. In 1973, of total sales of 204.8 Gigawatt hours (Gwh) 26.5% was for
domestic purposes; 56.2% for conmmercial and small industrial enterprises,
17.0% for larger industries, and about 0.3% for public lighting. To meet
the ranid increase in demand, ELCOM almost doubled its generating capacity
during the period reaching 70 MW in 1973, of which 36 MW was hydro and
34 MJ diesel. With the completion of the Upper Ramu Hydroelectric Scheme
in 1976 flcom's generating capacity will reach 115 MW of which 34 MW diesel
and 81 MW hv7dro. Considering the rapidly rising fuel prices the greater
reliance on hydro-electric power will have a favorable impact on Elcom's
cost structure.
23.       Growth rates achieved during past years are not expected to
continue during the coming years. In fact, as a result of the recent
slowdown In business activities, ELCOM's energy sales have substantially
fallen below projections. ELCOM's current sales growth projections
average 8.5% per year for the period 1974-80 as against 20.9% forecast
in 1970 for 1969-78. Actual results in 1973 were about 25% below the 1970
forecast.  The revised projections of ELCOM's power market reflect mainly
PNG's transient political situation and the uncertainties of the near future.
It is ik-;elv, therefore, that once the political situation has stabilized,
power cenmand will step up again during the second half of the seventies.
24.       Because of this situation ELCOM has eliminated all generation
exnnnsion projects from its 1974-80 investment program since available
capacitv will meet forecast demand.   Its expartsion program, therefore,
includes only the Upper Ramu No. 1 project under construction and distribu-
tion requirements. However, investigations are proceeding on a continual



- 7 -
basis to ensure that when the need arises, new generating facilities can be
built economically and with the least possible delay. ELCOM is currently
investigating several alternative hydro sites which could supplement the
Upper Ramu Project should ELCOM be called upon to serve the demand of poten-
tial mining development in New Guinea.
25.       Papua New Guinea has a vast hydro potential totalling some
11,000 MW at sites each capable of producing 300 MW or more. Recent
investigations have concentrated on two rivers: (i) Purari River flowing
into the Gulf of Papua (potential 7,200 MW firm; and about 53,000 GWh per
annum), and (ii) Musa River flowing into Oro Bay in NE Papua (potential
of 400 MW and about 2,800 GWh per annum). In addition, prospects for oil
and gas of commercial value are considered favorable following an off-shore
gas strike in the Gulf of Papua. Exploitation of these considerable energy
resources, offers favorable prospects for the long-term development of
PNC's economy. Supply of low cost power will not only allow the establishment
of energy based industries, but in the long run also foster the development
of all sectors of PNG's economy.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       Since the early 1970's the Bank has assisted PNG in developing
its power sector by providing financing for ELCOM's investment program
(Upper Ramu Hydroelectric Project, Loan 737-PNG) and advising on organiza-
tion and management problems. The proposed loan reflects our continuing
involvement in the development of this sector. The loan has unusual
features in that the main component of the project provides financing for
training of ELCOM staff. The project was appraised in July 1973. Loan
negotiations were held in March, 1974 with a delegation led by Mr. K. Woodward
(PNG Treasury). A loan and project summary is included in Annex III. The
Appraisal Report No. 327-a dated April 8, 1974 is being circulated separately.
Description
27.       The proposed project aims at helping PNG to strengthen and localize
ELCOM and consists of two main items: (a) technical assistance for ELCOM's
in-service training program during the period 1974-79, and (b) expansion of
ELCOM's distribution network. The project would also include financing to
cover the cost over-run under the first power project (Loan 737-PNG) which
is attributable to exchange rate adjustments.
28.       ELCOM has an able management and its present staff is competent.
The training part of the proposed project is designed to maintain this level
of competency, while substantially increasing the degree of localization.
ELCOM was one of the first organizations in PNG to appreciate the need to
train local staff. It has had a training program in operation since 1964.
At June 30, 1973, its operating staff totalled 1,247 of which 264 were
expatriates. In addition, it had 365 local apprentices, trainees and cadets



Linder training.  The degree of indigenization (excluding apprentices, etc.)
is now 79% as against 64% in 1970, with a target set for 1980 of about 98%.
To achieve this objective which is in line with the new Government's policy
of accelerated localization, ELCOM wants to establish an in-service training
program o' local staff to provide assistance to local graduates during their
first years of practical working life. ELCOM has, in fact, decided to give
graduate engineers, for instance, full responsibility of operating small
diesel centers with an expatriate supervising and providing guidance and
training at more than one such center for a limited period of time,
29.       The in-service training envisaged under the proposed project would
cover a period of five years.   The program provides for 385 trainer man-
vears and 1,038 trainee man-years involving a total of 528 locals. Thus,
bv 1980 about one-third of local staff will have benefitted from the in-
service training program. The ratio of trainers to locals would be about
l 3. The necessary supervision and training would be provided by selected
expatriates administratively attached to ELCOM's Education and Training
Branch.  The training _would be completed by July 1980 and only 25 expatriates
would then remain in ELCOM's service in senior positions.
30.       The modest distribution program covering the 13 centers ELCOM
will be serving after July 1975, is sufficient to meet ELCOM's needs through
1979. This element of the project is for rehabilitation, strengthening of
existing systems and expansion. Because any allocation of incremental
revenues to existing and new facilities would be entirely arbitrary no rate
of return on this investment was calculated.
31.       The Upper Ramu hydroelectric project financed by Loan 737-PNG
(US$23.2 million equivalent) is still within the original cost estimate
as expressed in current A$ or in US$ using pre-March 1971 exchange rates.
However, foreign exchange requirements, expressed in US$ at current exchange
rates, are now estimated at US$27.1 million equivalent, an increase of about
US$3.9 million of which about US$3.8 million is directly attributable to
exchange rate variations. While the existing loan agreement provides that
any funds needed to complete the project would be provided by Australia,
application of this undertaking would create difficulties for the new
Government since the level of assistance given by Australia is limited and
diversion of funds to the Ramu Project would mean a shortfall elsewhere.
32.       Despite increased construction costs (expressed in US$) of the
Upper Ramu project, its differential rate of return (18.8%) is higher than
that calculated three years ago (17.6%) comparing it with the most eco-
nomical thermal alternative.   This result is mainly due to the fact that
fuel costs for the thermal alternatives in September 1973 were much higher
than the most probable value assumed in the 1970 analysis.    In addition,
because of the lower load forecast, there is now no immediate need for
existing diesel equipment to firm up output, thus saving fuel expenses
in the earlier years which originally had to be allocated to the hydro
cost stream. If today's fuel costs were introduced into the analysis the
rate of return would be at least 25%.



-9-
Financial Position
33.       ELCOM has a good record for reliable supply and service, and
its financial position has been sound. When ELCOM was established in
July 1963, it became responsible for nine separate systems. Its revenues
are based on tariffs whose structure closely reflects the costs at each
center. Due to substantial increases in expatriate staff for operations
and local staff training, ELCOM's rate of return fell from 8.4% in 1968
to 4.7% in 1969. The cost of training, for instance, reached a high of
A$ 670,000 in 1970, representing nearly 15% Df revenues. This low return
continued until a 5% tariff increase became operative in November 1970.
On the basis of forecasts which incorporated this tariff increase, ELCOM
agreed, in connection with the Loan 737-PNG, to maintain tariffs suf-
ficient to produce an annual return of not less than 9% on its average
net fixed assets in service in fiscal years 1972 through 1976 and
not less than 10% thereafter. However, the slowdown in business and
industrial activity starting in 1971 resulted in a rate of return of
7.3% for FY 1972 and 8.7% for FY 1973, compared to the 9% required by the
IJpper Ramu Loan Agreement (737-PNG).
34.       Future revenues are based on forecast sales growth of 8.5% per
annum through 1980. Projected operating expenses assume that the cost of
those exnatriates whollv engaged in training during the five year period
from mid-1974 through mid-1979 would be deferred and written off over ten
years. On this basis, the 9% return required by the existing loan agree-
ment would be achieved in FY 1974 and FY 1975. Subsequently, rates of
return for FY 1976 through FY 1980 would be slightly below the targets of 9%
in FY 1976 and 10% thereafter as set forth in the existing covenant.
Primarilv, this is due to the projected low market growth. However,
since ELCOM's financial position is forecast to remain satisfactory with
internally generated funds, after debt service, financing 35% of capital
requirements during FY 1974-79, the achievement of the 10% rate of return
for FY 1977-80 is not essential. Under present PNG circumstances it is
very difficult to provide a clear assessment of ELCOM's investment needs
and to forecast additional loads associated with the implementation of
new industrial projects. The existing rate of return covenant has, there-
fore, been repeated in the new project agreement. However, the Bank would
review ELCOM's financial results each year and would be willing to waive
the covenanted target for a certain year provided ELCOM's internally
generated funds would be maintained at a satisfactory level, i.e. to meet
its annual debt service and a reasonable proportion of its investment program.
35.       ELCOM's capital requirements covering the period FY 1974-79 would
amount to about A$ 45.5 million. Net internal cash generation would finance
about A$ 16.1 million or about 35% of these requirements while borrowing
would finance the remaining A$ 29.4 million or about 65%. Loan funds would
consist of the balance of Bank Loan 737-PNG (A$ 12.4 million), the proposed
Bank loan of A$ 7.2 million (equivalent to US$10.8 million) and local loans
of A$ 9.8 million    (25 years at 6.55% interest.)   ELCOM has agreed to
seek Bank approval before incurring any further debt if by doing so actual
net revenues would fail to provide 1.5 times coverage of future maximum debt

service. ELCOM must also obtain the Bank's agreement of financing plans for
Drojects estimated to cost over A$ 10 million. Furthermore, ELCOM has
agreed not to pay dividends before July 1, 1978.
Project Cost
36.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.3 million of
which the Bank would finance the off-shore component1/ of US$10.8 million
or 62.6%. Local expenditures of US$6.5 million will be covered by ELCOM's
own resources and Government loans. The technical assistance component
will cost about US$7.8 million, of which the Bank would finance the off-
shore element of expatriates' salaries (US$4.7 million). This off-shore
element is about 60% of gross salary including benefits and corresponds to
that part of gross salaries and benefits that would remain in expatriate
hands after expenditures in PNG for subsistence, housing, local taxes, etc.
The total cost of the distribution element including physical contingencies
(10%) and price increases of 5% per annum for local expenditures and imported
materials is estimated at US$5.7 million, of which the Bank would finance
US$2.3 million. The Ramu project shortfall amounts to US$3.8 million.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       All procurement for equipment and materials (distribution component)
to be financed under the proposed project would be on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Distri-
bution construction would be engineered and carried out by ELCOM whose own
work force is capable of carrying out work of this nature. All contracts
in respect to the Upper Ramu Hydroelectric Project (Loan 737-PNG), tendered
under international competitive bidding, have already been awarded. Finan-
cing of the shortfall in foreign exchange of US$3.8 million for the Ramu
Project would cover civil works (US$2.1 million) and transmission equipment
(TJSS1.7 million). Disbursements for the above and the distribution element
of the proposed project would be made only for actual c.i.f. cost of
equipment and materials and for the off-shore cost of services. The number,
qualification and selection of technical assistance personnel for the
training part of the project will be by mutual agreement between ELCOM and
the Bank. Sixty percent of expenditures on gross salary and benefits of
expatriate trainer staff, including a similar proportion of such payments
made after January 1, 1974, up to US$300,000 equivalent, would be reimbursed
from the Loan.
Economic Evaluation
38.       The proposed project will allow ELCOM to meet modestly projected
increased power demands during the next five years and provide for satis-
factory and acceptable staff localization. The loan will provide funds
1/   The term "offshore comDonent" includes payments in Australia.    Once PNG
has established its own currency, expected during next year, expenditures
in A$ for goods and services procured in Australia will be foreign
exchange expenditures.

necessarv to support ELCOM's expenditure plans, funds which the new Govern-
ment does not have and which Australia could not provide without curtailing
its aid to Papua New Guinea earmarked for other vital purposes. On the eve
of independence, PNG is faced with numerous problems and constraints on
its future development. Among these, the lack of skilled manpower and
professional training is probably the most important one the new Government
will have to cope with. The main purpose of the proposed loan is to help
alleviate this problem in a vital sector of PNG's economy and, thus, by
assisting the country in developing its human resources, contribute to its
independence and future economic and social development.
39.       Accelerated localization is, in fact, a prime objective of the
new Government to enable the local population to play a greater part in
the economy and to encourage greater self-reliance. While the economic
benefits of this policy are difficult to quantify, the rapid localization
of ELCOM staff has distinct financial advantages. Indeed, the financial
justification for training is based on savings due to the salary differen-
tial between expatriate and local staff of equivalent grade and iesponsi-
bilitv. To test this a discounted cash flow analysis of two cost streams
was carried out over a period of 20 years: one representing ELCOM's cost
without the proposed training (continued employment of expatriates) and the
second representing ELCOM's costs with in-service training which reduces
the number of expatriates over time as local staff can accept full opera-
tional responsibility. The discount rate which equalized the two streams
,'as found to be in excess of 48%, reflecting the advantages of the training
scheme.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Papua New Guinea Government
and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Australia and the Bank,
and the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and ELCOM, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are heing distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreee-
ments conform to the pattern normally used by the Bank for power projects.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 2/
Credit No. 175 Agricultural Development Bank; US$5.0 Million Credit of
January 30, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The project's objective is to encourage coconut, palm oil and cattle
production through an agricultural credit program administered by the PNG
Development Bank. The livestock and oil palm components of this project are
nearing completion. Private ranchers have taken up less of the Credit than
anticipated and the coconut component has not been utilized at all due to
lack of interest by plantation owners. Proposals for the re-allocation of
the resulting savings for other activities are being prepared.
1/   Prior to exchange rate adjustments.
2/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedv them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II

The first oil palm plantings have come into bearing and the yields are
above appraisal estimates.
Loan No. 737 tlpper Ramu No. 1 Hydroelectric Project; US$23.2 Million
Loan of May 26, 1971; Closing Date: September 30, 1976
The project consists of a run-of-the-river underground power
station and 320 miles of transmission lines linking centers previously
served by small diesel units.   The project is progressing satisfactorily
and the geological problems which have arisen are being resolved. The
present estimated A$ cost of the project still corresponds to the original
estimate although it exceeds the original estimated US$ costs by 27% at
todays' exchange rates. This corresponds to a shortfall in the foreign
currency financed by Loan 737-PNG of about US$3.8 million equivalent or
about 16%. The project is still economically justified even with the
changed economic situation.
Loan No. 852 Second Telecommunications Project; US$10.0 Million Loan of
December 28, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1976
The project provides for (a) installation of 13,000 lines of
automatic switching equipment; (b) provision of UHF/VHF radio systems;
(c) installation of multiplex equipment to provide 650 additional circuits
and extension of long distance automatic exchanges and (d) consultant
services. The project which is at an early stage is presently being
reviewed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (P&T) in light of an
expected temporary lower growth rate for telephone services during the
transition of self-government through to independence for PNG. P&T has
concluded that it would be desirable to spread out the investment program
over four vears (1973-76) instead of three years.
Credit No. 326 First Ports Project; US$9.2 Million Credit of July 21, 1972;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
The project consists of extending port facilities at Lae and Kieta,
land reclamation for new storage facilities at Port Moresby, a new port
development at Alotau, and consultant services. Early progress of this
project has been satisfactory, although the Government is encountering
difficulties in acquiring land leases reauired for the implementation of the
project. The Association approved letting of tenders for all civil works
in M1ay 1973; bids were under appraisal estimates. Work is proceeding at
Port Moresby and Lae and was started at Alotau and Kieta in September 1973.
rne present estimated total cost of the project is A$ 7.95 million compared
with A$ 9.35 million appraisal estimates. Foreign exchange requirements,
however, remain unchanged at US$9.2 million equivalent, reflecting exchange
rate adiustments.

Credit No. 348 Smallholder Livestock Credit Project; US$5.0 Million
Credit of January 4, 1973; Closing Date: December 31 1976
The project provides for smallholder beef, pig and poultry produc-
tion through an agricultural credit program administered by the PNG Develop-
ment Bank.  This project, which is at an early stage, is progressing satis-
factorily but is somewhat behind schedule because of staffing problems
and administrative delays in loan identification and processing. However,
measures are being taken by the Government and PNGDB to correct the situation.
