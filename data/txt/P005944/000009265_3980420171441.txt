NMEORANDUM AND RECOMNENDATIONS OF TIHE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTIECTION AND DEVEWPFEWI
TO THE IZECU(IVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA
FOR A BAHIA BLANCA I PORT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Government of
Argentina for US$50.0 million is submitted for approval. It would help to
finance the Bahia Blanca I Port Project. The proposed loan would be on
standard Bank terms to be repaid over 15 years, including three years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.        Background.  The transport sector plays an important role in the
economic development of Argentina, representing about 6-8% of GDP and around
18-20% of public sector investment. Most of the foreign trade and about 50
million tons of domestic traffic are handled by the port system, the
efficiency of which is crucial to the competitiveness of Argentina's
exports. Grain exports constitute a major component of Argentina's trade and
one which is subject to severe competition in the world market. Such exports
averaged about 22 million tons in 1983-1985. The port of Bahia Blanca is
mainly a grain export port, and due to its draft advantages over the
remaining ports in the country, plays a fundamental role in that traffic. In
1985, a serious accident at Bahia Blanca put one grain elevator out of
service considerably reducing the grain terminal export capabilities. The
accident only confirms doubts about the inadequacy of safety conditions of
grain silo facilities in the country. The proposed project would
rehabilitate the existing infrastructure including reconstruction of the
damaged elevator, and would assist in implementing a silos safety program in
the country. The main agencies involved in the project are: (i) the General
Port Administration (AGP) under the Secretariat of Merchant Marine (SMM),
which is responsible for the construction, maintenance and administration of
shore facilities but port operations are concessioned to private stevedoring
companies; (ii) the National Directorate of Port and Navigable Waterway
Construction (DNCPVN) also under the SlMM, responsible for planning and
carrying out waterway and port dredging; and (iii) the National Grain Board
(JNG) under the Secretariat of Agriculture of the Ministry of Economy
responsible for domestic and foreign grain trade, and for administration and
management of public grain elevators and storage facilities. General and
cost accounting, planning and management of the first two agencies need
strengthening and the proposed project addresses these issues.  Maintenance
services and efficiency of DNCPVN and JNG would also be improved through the
technical assistance component of the proposed project.
3.        Project Objectives.  This would be the first Bank involvement in
the port subsector. The proposed project would provide grain export capacity
for the medium term (until 1993) while a proposed follow-on project would
address the long term grain export needs at Bahia Blanca. The project would
contribute to the Government's efforts to enhance the competitiveness of its
grain exports by: (a) the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure of the
Bahia Blanca grain terminal; and (b) strengthening port management, adminis-
tration and operational systems through technical assistance to AGP and
DNCPVN for cost accounting, planning, and management information systems, and
to DNCPVN and JNG for maintenance services.



- 2 -
4.        Project Description:  The proposed project comprlses: (a) civil
works and equipment for the rehabilitation and modernization of the
grain-handling systems, including emergency works; upgrading silo safety
systems at selected grain terminals and complementary maritime and railway
works; and (b) technical assistance to streugthen port management,
administration and maintenance systems; and completion of engineering studies
for a proposed expansion of the Bahia Blanca grain terminal, initiated under
the Loan 1521-AR.
5.        Project Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$71.0 million including US$4.3 million of taxes and duties
with a foreign exchange component of US$50.7 millicr  (71%).  A Bank loan of
US$50.0 million equivalent would cover 100' of the foreign exchange cost
component of items to be financed by the Bank. Counterpart resources to the
proposed loan amounting to US$16.7 million equivalent will be provided by
Government, AGP and JNG contributions of US$11.5 million, US$1.5 million and
US$3.7 million respectively. The Government contribution includes
US$1.3 million corresponding to the funds required by PA to implement the
railway component.  Retroactive financing of payments made between
November 1, 1985 and loan signature, amount to US$2.3 million equivalent.
Costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement and
disbursements of the proposed project, a timetable of the key project
processing events and status of Bank group operations in Argentina are given
in Schedules B, C and D, respectively. Two maps showing the proposed items
to be financed under the project are also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 5528-AR is being distributed separately.
6.        Onlending.  The Government as the proposed Borrower will onlend
US$12.3 million, US$0.8 million and US$1.1 million to JNG, FA and AGP,
respectively, under the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's objective is to support
Government efforts to reactivate the economy through export-led growth,
increase the availability of foreign exchange and stabilize the economy; thus
it should support country's efforts to enhance its international
competitiveness, to increase domestic resource mobilization and to improve
public sector management. The proposed project would help reduce shipping
costs, rationalize port tariffs, improve the operation of export corridors,
and promote efficient operations.  Bank assistance is of high priority, given
the current unsatisfactory conditions of the port of Bahia Blanca, its
importance in the national system, and the vital role it plays in handling
cargo onto large vessels unable to get full load in other Argentine ports due
to draft limitations.
8.        Agreed Actions:  The Borrower, AGP and JNG agreed to the following
main actions:
The Borrower confirmed the inclusion of the necessary counterpart
funds required for the project, including those for the Argentine
Railways (FA), in the national budget, and agreed to enter into
on-lending agreements with AGP, FA and JNG; there will be
appropriate audit arrangements satisfactory to the Bank; DNCPVN's
and AGP's annual investment programs will be prepared according to
criteria satisfactory to the Bank and these agencies will consult
with the Bank on any new investment project over US$10.0 million;
MOSP through the National Architectural Services (SNA) wili retain



- 3 -
appropriately qualified consultants for the supervision of the
construction and modernization of the grain-handling systems, prior
to the award of the construction contracts and will establish a
Project Coordination Unit with terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank; and It will review at least once a year the costs and
tariffs of tugboats operations and forward for the Bank's comments
the proposed new arrangements by mid-1991 for tugboat operations
after 1991.
DNCPVN will implement commercially based general and
cost-accounting systems and develop a mechanism satisfactory to the
Bank to recover dredging costs by December 31, 1989; prepare a plan
of action for implementation by December 31, 1990 and commence
implementation of such action action plan by June 30, 1991; and
carry out appropriate audit arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.
AGP will introduce the necessary tariff increases and cost-saving
actions to ensure that in 1987-1990 working ratios will be
declining annually from 0.85 to 0.80; revalue its assets not later
than December 31, 1989 and incorporate the results in its books
from January 1, 1991; ensure that the working and operating ratios
in 1991-1994 will be no more than 0.84 and 1.23, respectively,
taking into account the results of the above mentioned asset
revaluation; implement appropriate cost-accounting systems by
December 31, 1989; formulate cost-related tariff structures,
satisfactory to the Bank, by June 30, 1990, develop an action plan
for its implementation by December 31, 1990 and start implementing
it by June 30, 1991; and carry out appropriate audit arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank.
JNG will carry out the silo safety plan of action; implement the
necessary actions to reorganize its maintenance services by
December 31, 1990; and take all necessary actions to achieve the
operational targets such as ship loading and reception unloading
rates.
9.        Justification and Risks . The proposed project yields an estimated
overall economic rate of return of about 45%. In aidition, the institutional
measures are expected to improve the overall efficiency of the management and
operations of the agencies involved In the handling of grain exports.
Possible implementation delays would be minimized by intensive project
supervision and the establishment of a Project Committee and a Project
Coordination Unit.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
