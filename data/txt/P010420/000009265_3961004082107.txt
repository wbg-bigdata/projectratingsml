MEMORANDUM AN4 RECOIOENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNAi'ORAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A COLONBO URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
for SDR 14.4 million (US$20.0 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years to help finance a Colombo Urban Transport Project.   The
proposed credit would be passed on from the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to the
Ministry of Transport and Highways (MTI), Colombo Municipal Council (CNC), Sri
Lanka Railways (SLR) and Central Environmental Authority (CEA) on a grant basis.
The Government will bear the foreign exchange risks on the credit.
2.        Sector Backaround. The Greater Colombo Metropolitan Area (GCNA) contains
about four million inhabitants, comprising a quarter of Sri Lanka's total
population. Although not reflected in official statistics, which do not count
suburbanization of Colombo as urban growth, the a:nual population growth rate for
the GCMA during the 1980. is estimatGd at 5Z. As a part of GGSL's liberalized
growth strategy, two large Export Processing Zones outside Colombo were established
in 1978, reinforcing the primacy of the GCMA. Agglomeration economies, including
the presence of Goveranent offices and the country's only international port
contiguous to the city center, have fueled demand for urban transport, acting both
as traffic generators and attractors.   With expanding industrial activities,
growing population and rising incomes, traffic volumes in GCNA are increasing at
6-8Z per annum. This growth has led to severe strain on already run-down transport
infrastructure and the emergence of traffic bottlenecks and acute congestion in
Central Colombo. However, funding constraints have deterred new infrastructure
investments that are needed to keep pace with rising urban travel demand, and also
have adversely affected the maintenance and rehabilitation of roads, railway lines,
buses and other related service facilities.  The road surfaces are in a poor state
of repair, sidewalks almost non-existent and traffic movements constrained by
infringement on road space by shops, slow moving push-carts, teaming pedestrian
flows, inadequate intersection designs, primitive traffic control devices and
disorganized bus passenger loading and discharging. The railway could play a
larger role in providing efficient commuter services in the GCMA, thereby reducing
the pressure on road passenger services if it could shed its cuimbersome
bureaucratic management structure and modernize its archaic operating methods.
3.        In Central Colombo, traffic congestion has greatly increased travel
times, vehicle operating costs and accidents. The increase in traffic density has
also raised air pollution levels in the city, posing a potential threat to public
health.   Transport bottlenecks impose high costs on commercial and industrial
establishments located in the GCMA, reducing their competitiveness and productivity
in relation to units located in other major production and export centers of Asia.
Because the GCMA generates about 421 of the country's GNP, and the GOSL's export-
oriented industrial strategy reinforces the pro-eminence of the GCMA, the
limitations of the transport sector have large economic and social cost
implications for the country as a whole. Thus, the rehabilitation of existing
deteriorated infrastructure and implementation of well-conceived traffic management
schemes require immediate action for short-term relief. In the long-term, GOSL
needs to formulate a viable urban transport strategy in order to avoid Colombo's



- 2 -
traffic congestion reaching the levels experienced in cities like Bangkok or
Manila. IDA's strategy is to support these actions through the proposee project
which is an important first step.
4.        Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Operations.  The proposed project would
be the first IDA-financed urban transport project.   Howevers IDA has financed
operations in both the urban and transport sectors."1 The relevant lessons from
these projects are: (a) detailed engineering and designs should be completed for
all relevant project components to avoid large cost overruns, and ensure sufficient
funds for completion of works; (b) the project design and procurement methods
should not be overly complex in order to prevent a long implementation period and
delays in procurement; and (c) the establishment of a clear functional,
organizational and management structure with adequate autonomy is a prerequisite
for encouraging operational efficiency and improved performance in the transport
sector. The proposed project has been designed with these lessons in mind.
'i.       Prolect Objectives.   The main objectives of the project are to: (a)
remove transport bottlenecks and traffic congestion in Central Colombo that impose
high costs on commercial and industrial establishments; (b) develop long-term
transport plans for the GCMA and strengthen institutions concerned with urban
transport; (c) strengthen the managerial capabilities of the National Transport
Commission (NTC); (d) increase the efficiency of the STR; and (e) promote adequate
air quality standards and emission control measures.
6.        Prolect Descrintion.   To achieve the above objectives, the project
includes: (a) Immediate Action Plan. (i) Transport System Management (TSM) Program
for three areas: Fort, Pettah and Olcott Mawatha. Implementation of short-term,
cost-effective measures of the TSM program comprising junction improvements
(signals, channelisation), bus passenger facilities (terminal improvements), bus
lanes, sidewalks, footbridges and off-street parking and rehabilitation of road
pavement in the Pettah and adjoining Olcott Mawatha areas where traffic conditions
are most chaotic; (ii) Maradana Junction Improvements. Construction of a gyratory
consisting of an additional bridge, parallel to the existing bridge over the
railway tracks, improvements of the approach roads to the new gyratory and the
provision of inter-linked signalization to increase capacity and reduce vehicle-to-
vehicle and vehicle/pedestrian conflicts at this intersection where severe
congestion and delays occur, with a daily traffic volume exceeding 44,000 vehicles
and large passenger flows from the nearby railway station; and (iii) Implementation
Support.   Consultancy services  to supervise the TSM and Maradana Junction
improvement schemes; (b) Lona-Term Urban TransDort Planning. Consultants to: (i)
carry out the Colombo Urban Transport Study to address the transport
infrastructure, service and management deficiencies and prepare comprehensive
policy actions and associated investment plans for the long-term period; and (ii)
provide on-the-job training of the counterpart staffs from the agencies involved
in urban transport planning. Personal computers, office equipment and software
would be procured as part of this component; and (c) Institutional Strengthening.
Completed projects: Road Maintenance I (Cr. 900-CE, PCR No. 8000, 8/89); Road
Passenger Transport (Cr. 994-CE, PCR No. 8011, 8/89); and Roads II (Ln. 2517-
CE, PCR in draft).  Ongoing projects: Municipal Management (Cr. 1697-CE);
Roads III (Cr. 2183-CE); and the Economic Restructuring Credit (Cr. 2128-CE)
under which the publicly owned bus industry is being privatized.



(i) Transport Regulation. Consultancy services to train the NTC and the Provincial
Councii±l (PC) staff in the regulation of the bus industry; (ii) Restructuring of
the Sri Lanka Railways. Consultancy services to assist SLR with implemantation of
the restructuring plan agreed with IDA, which is intended to initiate the process
of reform to improve its operations, and evaluate different options and suitable
timing for privatization of certain aspects of railway operations and assets in
preparation for the next phase of reform.  Management information and service
costing systems would be installed and personal computers and software packages
would be procured;  and (iii) Air Quality Monitoring and Management Study.  The
procurement of air quality testing equipment and consultancy services for the
preparation of a comprehensive air quality control program for Colombo and the
training of the CEA staff to strengthen their capabilities to monitor and enforce
air quality standards.
7.        The project cost is estimateca at US$25.3 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$15.3 million equivalent (611), including the
Project Preparetion Facility (PPF) Advance of US$1.2 million, and taxes and duties
estimated at about US$2.0 million equivalent. The PPF advance was expended to
carry out various studies in preparation of the project.   The total financing
required is US$25.3 million, of which the Association would finance US$20.0 million
equivalent (952 of the foreign exchange and 551 of local costs, or 691 of local
costs excluding taxes and duties). UNDP would provide US$0.5 million equivalent
to strengthen the NTC and PC staff under a co-financing arrangement. In addition,
CIDAA1 would cofinance US$0.5 million equivalent to assist with implementation of
the SLR restructuring plan.   For expenditures incurred after March 1, 1993,
retroactive financing of US$0.5 million (2.52 of the credit) would be provided to
permit advance procurement of services, works and goods which must begin before
credit effectiveness in order to meet target dates for implementation of critical
project activities.
8.        Proiect Imolementation.  The TSM, road rehabilitation and the Maradana
Junction components would be executed by the CMC, assisted by consultants. The
Colombo Urban Transport Study and the urban institution training component would
be managed by the Transport Studies and Planning Center (TSPC). The air pollution
management component would be administered through the CEA.   The technical
assistance for the bus regulation and management and railway components would be
implemented by the MTH and NTC/PCs, assisted by consultants. Project coordination
and monitoring of progress would be provided by the Project Monitoring Committee,
composed of CMC, UDA-, NTC, TSPC, TPY' and CEA, chaired by Secretary, MTH. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka are presented in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Two maps are also attached (IBRD No. 24659 and IBRD No. 24660). The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11375-CE, is being distributed separately.
Vi Responsibilities for the issuance of route permits, registration of vehicles
by type and management of bus terminals have been devolved to the Provincial
Councils.

9.        Proiect Sustainabilit,.  To ensure the project's sustainability, the
project has been designed in line with the absorptive capacity of the implementing
agencies and adequate technical assistance would be provided. The introduction of
the TSZ concept under the project would demonstrate the effectiveness of the low-
cost TSM schemes in achieving greater utilization of limited road space,
segregation of pedestrians and vehicles and smoother traffic flows. To ensure that
the TSM schemes function efficiently, a traffic law enforcement program would be
implemented in parallel.  The experience g1ined from implementing the immediate
action plan for the GCMA would also provide a sound basis for preparing a
sustainable long-term program.
10.       Environmental Aspects.  The project includes an environmental component
that addresses the emerging problems of air pollution. While not yet as serious
as the problems observed in Bangkok, Bombay and other major Asian cities, the rapid
increase of motorized transport in the GCMA :ould cause levels of emissions of
harmful gases to arise if left unabated. The main sources of air pollution in
Colombo are vehicle exhaust emissions and to a lesser extent, industrial
enterprises. Control of the former will be critical as vehicle ownership increases
in the GCMA. Therefore, under the project the necessary first steps will be taken
to measure air quality, set up standards to identify the major causes of the
problems, formulate an appropriate regulatory policy, and monitor compliance. The
environmental impact of the TSM and Maradana Junction components included in the
pr4ject would be positive as they are designed to enhance traffic and facilitate
traffic flows, thereby reducing congestion and idling of vehicles.
11t       Aareements Reached. During negotiations, agreements were reached on the
following: (a) GOSL to allocate sufficient counterpart funds needed to implement
the project; (b) TSPC and CMC to establish their project accounts and appoint the
heads of their respective project accounts departments; (c) an Operational Action
Plan; and (d) GOSL to hold a mid-term project implementation review with IDA in
December 1995.
12.       Linkage with Country Assistance Strateav.  In Sri Lanka, IDA's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) includes: (a) promoting non-traditional export-led growth
by enhancing the country's external competitiveness; (b) creating an environment
conducive to expanding private sector participation and attracting foreign
investment through increased liberalization of economic and trade policies; (c)
reforming public enterprises which cannot be privatized immediately; (d) reducing
public expenditures by eliminating over-sambitious and unproductive investments; and
(e) providing good infrastructure (transport, telecommunications and power) so
critical to the successful commercialization of the economy.   The components
included in the project are intended to implement IDA's transport sector strategy,
which is consistent with its CAS, by: (a) eliminating major transport bottlenecks
in the GCGA where the majority of export industries are located; (b) implementing
low-cost traffic management concepts and road rehabilitation before embarking on
large new investments; (c) formulating a long-term urban transport investment
program to determine priorities and staff training to strengthen planning
capabilities; (d) promoting bus industry deregulation and privatization to increase
private  sector involvement;  and  (e)  initiating railway  reforms  to improve
operational efficiency.
13.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Development of an efficient transport
sector in Sri Lanka has long been an objective of Government policy which IDA has
supported. To accomplish this objective, IDA has been taking the lead in assisting
GOSL in implementing the strategy elements outlined above, and major reform



initiatives in the transport sector for which no other donors have shc-m interest
in providing leadership. Through IDA's active involvement, the Government is in
the process of completing bus privatization and initiating railway reforms. As a
result, progress is being made in improving sector efficiency.   The proposed
project offers an additional opportunity to continue this progress.
14.       Benefits. Traffic management and Maradana Junction improvement measures
will reduce the economic costs of congestion and delays by speeding up the flow of
goods and passengers on the major corridors. The weighted economic rate of teturn
(ERR) on these improvements is estimated at, 262.  In addition, traffic safety
improvements, to be implemented under the project, would reduce accident rates.
Furthermore, monitoring of air quality and emission control, combined with improved
vehicle speeds made possible under the project, would impact positively on the
environment by reducing pollution from vehicle exhaust fumes. The reform of the
railways should increase efficiency and modestly improve the Government's fiscal
situation.
15.       Risks.   The main risks of tbe project are:  (a) expected capacity
increases and decreased level of congestion may turn out to be smaller than
anticipated; (b) a delay in completion of the project may increase investment
costs, (c) ineffective scheduling of works may lead to excessive congestion during
construction; and (d) the institutional strengthening and reform objectives to be
accomplished with technical assistance provided under the project may fall short
of expectations. The risks of delay and ineffective scheduling are mitigated by
the fact that detailed engineering and designs have been completed for all project
components, bidding documents have been prepared, the main investment components
are relatively easy to implement as they are based on well-established
technologies, and the CMC has already completed similar works successfully on Galle
Road and the Prince of Wales Road. Possible cost overruns, reduced benefits and
increased congestion during construction have been quantified in the economic and
sensitivity analyses which still yielded satisfactory ERRs of 17% or higher.
Moreover, a continuing intensive policy dialogue with GOSL, phased reform measures,
training programs formulated in accordance with absorptive capacity of the
executing agencies, close supervision of civil works, studies and the
implementation support provided under the project to the executing agencies would
also substantially reduce the possible risks mentioned above.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
