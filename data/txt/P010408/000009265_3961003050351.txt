NEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR BIHAR PLATEAU DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on the proposed Development
Credit of SDR 80.7 million (US$ 117.0 million equivalent) to India is
submitted for approval. The IDA credit would be on standard terms, with 35
years maturity, to help finance the Bihar Plateau Development Project.
2.    Backaroud:  India is the world's second most populous country with a
population exceeding 850 million, and growing at an average rate of 2.0% per
year. About 70% of the labor force is employed by the agriculture sector.
Agriculture accounts for about 37% of GDP and 25% of exports. Agriculture
production increased steadily at an annual rate of about 2.5% from 1971 to
1984, but lower than the GDP annual growth rate of 4.5% over the same period.
Despite these impressive growth rates, there has been only marginal reduction
in the high incidence of poverty and under-employment, especially in the rural
areas. To attain India's long run objective of 6% overall GDP annual growth
and improved incomes in the rural areas, accelerated agricultural growth will
be an essential element, most notably in the irrigation sector which has much
potential for improvement. Irrigation, particularly water use efficiency and
proper maintenance of infrastructure, is receiving increased attention,
because of its importance in food production. A key element of the Government
agricultural strategy, as set forth in the Eighth Five Year Plan (1990-95) is
to alleviate poverty, including in rural areas targeting mainly the Tribal
people of the poorest states of Eastern India.
3.    Investments by the government would continue to be directed towards
projects aimed at increasing incomes of the poorest of the poor. The Bank has
supported this strategy since the early 1950s. Up to now 130 projects have
received IZRD/IDA financing amounting to US$ 10.2 billion equivalent (81% IDA
and 19% IBRD). Of these projects, 52 were for irrigation and command area
development (US$ 4.9 billion equivalent or 50* of total agricultural lending).
The remaining 78 projects can be sub-divided as follows: (a) 34 for
agricultural support services (credit, research and extension) at US$ 2.3
billion equivalent; (b) 24 for commercitl agriculture development (fisheries,
livestock, tree crops and agro-industry) at US$ 1.6 billion equivalent; (c)
ten for forestry at US$ 500 million equivalent; and, (d) ten other projects
including sector, area development, drought assistance and cyclone emergency
projects at about US$ 950 million equivalent.
4.    The basic thrust of Bank assistance has been to: (a) increase the area
irrigated and improve water use efficiency; (b) develop the institutions
responsible for providing agricultural support services; (c) increase
agricultural production and improve marketing facilities; and (d) afforest
degraded areas to reduce soil erosion and increase production of fuel wood and
timber. Most recently innovative watershed and state forestry projects have
also been supported. These are demonstrating promising low-cost technologies
and are supporting new approaches to help resolve implementation problems.
Additionally, the Bank has supported free trade and pricing policies.
5.    In Bihar state, the Bank Group has supported 22 agricultural and rural
infrastructure projects of which 6 were in the project area including: Bihar



-2-
Agricultural Extension and Research Project (Cr. 761-IN), National
Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 855-IN), a follow-up National Agricultural
Research project (Cr. 1631-IN), Subernarekha Irrigation Project (Cr. 1289-IN),
National Seeds Project (Cr. 885-IN) and Bihar Rural Roads Project (Cr. 1072-
IN).
6.    Lena2as  Learned.  Most of these projects have experienced implementation
problems causing delays in disbursement and completion, although there has
been improvement in disbursements recently. Problems include: delays in
project mobilization and procurement; poor quality construction and
maintenance of infrastructure (irrigation, rural roads, etc); institutional
weaknesses; inadequate local financial support by the state government; and
inadequate preparation and implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation
of plans for affected families. Some projects have also faced staff
constraints. Some others have provided for only limited participation of
beneficiaries in planning and implementation.
7.    The proposed project has been specifically designed to overcome such
problems: designs for each year's program will be more thorough and advanced
than before; effective beneficiary participation is being sought through the
assistance of NGOs; reliance on government involvement in service delivery and
implementation will be minimized; and priority is being given to training,
monitoring and evaluation.
8.   Rationale for _ank Thvolvment.  The Bank's assistance strategy to India
is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth
and poverty alleviation in a context of macro economic stability. The
emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the
public sector and appropriate targAting and delivery of support systems to the
poor. An increasingly important element of the strategy is to promote
sustainable programs, especially in agriculture, that will help to alleviate
poverty in the most backward areas of the eastern states of India.
9.    The proposed project fits well within this framework, targeting the
poor, predominantly tribal peoples in Bihar. It would bring about general
improvement on the quality of life for the rural people. The project area has
a high incidence of poverty and contains considerable agricultural potential.
By carefully evaluating past performance experience, initiating pilot
activities in new locations which appear promising, and encouraging
innovations in participatory management, the project would help identify an
approach to development that is effective and sustainable in Bihar and eastern
India in general.
10.   Because the proposed project intends to address development constraints
of the tribal people, precautions have been taken in its design to ensure that
social and economic benefits from the project are consistent with their
cultural preferences. The process of planning and implementation of project
activities assures full beneficiary participation and ownership of most assets
created under the project. The project design, and the planning and
implementation process is also consistent with the Bank's Operational
Directive (OD 4.20) which deals with indigenous people (tribals).
11.  ePriect Objective. The main objective of the project is to increase
rural incomes and alleviate poverty of the tribal people in the underdeveloped
southern plateau of Bihar st4te. This would be achieved through: (a) making
investments in critical areas of infrastructure needed for improved delivery



-3-
of agricultural services for increasing production and easing mtrketing
problems, (b) strengthening the planning, coordination and monitoring of the
local admihistration, (c) significantly expanding the involvement of
beneficiaries and introducing an integrated approach to planning and
implementation of multi-sectoral activities, and (d) promoting environmentally
sustainable activities. To sustain assets created under the project, cost
recovery would be introduced, at least to cover their operation and
maintenance expenses. Beneficiaries would also be expected to contribute
towards the cost of creating project assets and would own them ultimately.
12.  Proglet 2scrir,tion.  The project would finance the follow:ing
components:
(a) A)arigotural X vrlpmg9MM (5.5 of base cost). Because of the low
level of technology applied in farming in the project area, crop yields are
generally low. Production of fruits and vegetables has not improved despite
the increasing demand for such products. Soils are acidic with low levels of
nutrients and drain easily; livestock productivity is also low. .Small
livestock, particularly goats, pigs and chickens, are poor producers, but
through the natural selection process, have adapted to the harsh environment,
which includes high incidence of disease, poor nutrition and inadequate animal
husbandry practices. To address these problems, the project would focus on
the institutional development aspects associated with applied agricultural
research and transfer of technology. It would help Birsa Agricultural
University test and improve crop varieties and animal species suited for the
area. The project would also support adaptive research through on-farm
trials, demonstrations, and training. To expedite the release of promising
crop varieties, the adaptive research would also include testing of existing
improved seed of lowland rice, sorghum and millet. Because NGOs would be
involved in the promotion of the improved technology, the University would
support and equip them to properly carry out this responsibility. The support
would include training and field demonstration. The project would also
provide funds for incremental operational expenses on a strictly declining
basis. In addition, the project would support environmental protection
against soil erosion and conserve moisture, particularly in those catchment
areas associated with irrigation schemes under the project. The process would
also increase the productivity of dryland farming.
(b) Minar Irrigation and Drainaae (32% of base cost). There is need to
provide assured water for irrigation to extend the cropping season for
increased crop production. Priority would be to develop irrigation facilities
in areas where there is strong farmers interest in and acceptance of the major
responsibility for operation and maintenance of the schemes. Increasing
farmers rights and responsibility, through water user groups promoted by the
implementing agencies and NGOs, would be an important innovative feature in
the project. The project would also strengthen the Minor Irrigation
Department (MID) in design and quality control of irrigation schemes. To
ensure the component is implemented properly, the Minor Irrigation Department
(MID) would be strengthened to collect and analyze hydrological data, monitor
ground water, design and ensure quality of construction and establish proper
procedures for monitoring operation and maintenance activities. The component
would also include: (a) rehabilitation of existing gravity schemes (5,000 ha),
construction of new gravity schemes (7,000 ha), rehabilitation of lift
irrigation schemes (2,500 ha) and construction of new lift irrigation schemes
(500 ha); all with comnand areas of 30 ha or more, (b) construction of smaller
gravity irrigation schemes (below 30 ha panchayat schemes) for about 1,500 ha,



-4-
(c) construction of about 4,000 dug-wells (4,000 ha), (d) construction of
about 690 water harvesting tanks (3,500 ha., (e) construction of a design
office and a materials testing laboratory for MID at Ranchi, (f) provision of
engineering equipment, (g) transport and incremental operating funds, and (h)
technical assistance to support MNID in its preparation and supervision work,
and training of staff. Because of inadequate hydrological data base for
determining the potential for irrigation during rabi and summer seasons, and
the erratic unreliable power supply from the grid, implementation of lift
.irrigation schemes would be subject to confirmed hydrological data showing
adequate post-monsoon river flows and guaranteed power supply.
(c) BUneLl       (49% of base cost). Because rural roads in the project
area are almost impassable during the rainy season making it difficult to
access markets, the project would upgrade about 1,200 km of intermediate
roads, tracks and bridges. It would also provide funds for road mainteniance
during the project period; consultant services for road survey, design and
preparation of civil works contracts and supervision of construction;
equipment and vehicles for survey, materials testing and quality control;
institution building in the Rural Engineering Department including training of
staff in the construction and maintenance practices appropriate for rural
rot%ds; and office building, stores, laboratory and a mechanical workshop.
(d) frinking Water (12% of base cost).  The project would accelerate
.implementation of Bihar's existing program to provide one hand pump for every
150 individuals in rural areas. The project would finance: (a) boring wells
and instal'ing 13,060 hand pumps, (b) equipment and chemicals for the existing
water quality testing laboratory, (c) transport to the Engineering Department
of Public Health to ensure effective supervision of construction, repairs and
maintenance of water facilities, (d) pump spare parts, and (e) training user
groups and rural artisans in pump repair and maintenance.
(e) ImDl.ntat ion * W2nnort  (1.5* of base cost).  Because the present
administrative arrangement for implementing programs for the tribal people is
weak and inadequately funded, the project would strengthen the Regional
Development Commissioner's Office by proving funds for training and
recruitment of incremental staff, vehicles and equipment, and incremental
funds for their operation and maintenance. Funds would also be provided to
support KOO activities and for innovative schemes which could be developed
during implementation. These futids would also be used for short term
consultants to prepare a suitable training program for project staff and an
appropriate monitoring and evaluation system and for conducting a base line
social survey. At the state-level, the Development Commissioner's office in
Patna would be provided with vehicles, office equipment and incremental funds
for their operation and maintenance, to coordinate project activities between
government departments and for conducting studies intended to develop
innovative activities in the project area.
13.   A breakdown of costs and financing plan are in Schedule A.  Procurement
categories and disbursement percentages and projections are in Schedule B.
14.   Pro*-it- * T     an E artio. A separate Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
would be created in the Regional Development Commissioner's office at Ranchi
which would be headed by a senior level officer designated as Project Director
(PD) who would be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project,
includings reviewing plans prepared by line departments, approving these
plans, allocating funds and monitoring implementation of approved plans. PIU



would have three Cells to support the general administration of the project,
which include: (a) Planning and Monitoring and Evaluation, (b) NGO amd
Environment Protection Activities, and (c) Accounts and Audit. However,
implementation of individual activities lnder the project would be undertaken
by line departments and the district and block development administration.
NGOs and beneficiaries in the form of user groups would be encouraged to
participate in the planning and implementation of these activities.
15.  Aoreed Actiolmn. Agreements were reached at negotiations that GOB would:
(a) establish a Project Implementation Unit and delegate both administrative
and financial powers to the Regional Developmwnt Commissioner, Ranchi who
would be the Chief Executive of the project, (b) make adequate arrangements
for land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation of affected persons
by project investments, satisfactory to the Association, (c) cause
implementing department/agencies' staff to consult with beneficiaries and
agree on the choice and location of activities supported by the project, (d)
transfer ownership and responsibility for operation and maintenance of
irrigation schemes to panchayats and water users associations during the
project period,(e) not implement minor irrigation programs that are highly
subsidized in the selected blocks implementing similar schemes supported by
the credit, (f) transfer the responsibility for repair anA maintenance of
drinking water facilities to panchayats and villages as soon as the
construction is completed, and (g) introduce cost recovery to cover part of
the investment cost and operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes and
drinking water facilities created under the project.
16.   Creation of a Project Implementation Unit and appointment of consultants
to prepare an appropriate monitoring and evaluation system and for conducting
a base line social survey are conditions of effectiveness. Preparation of a
road maintenance policy and an implementation plan acceptable to the
Association is a disbursement condition for expenditure on rural road repair
and maintenance.
17.   Unviomantal *rare.  The environmental classification for the project
is category "B". Possible negative environmental impact of the project
activities could be: loss of agricultural and forest land, soil erosion, and
possible increase in the incidence of malaria. To minimize these, the project
has been designed with appropriate mitigating actions including: sensitizing
government staff and user groups; minimizing and, in some cases, avoiding land
acquisition; avoiding road sub projects with negative environmental effects;
monitoring of incidence of diseases and destroying vector breeding areas; and
recruitment of an environmentalist in the NOO and Environment Cell with
responsibility for environmental clearance of project activities. The project
would also include treatment and protection of degraded catchment areas
associated with irrigation works.
18. Imoact on Women. Women do a significant amount of manual work including
road construction, fuelwood collection, marketing farm produce and household
chores. Therefore, investments under the project such as improvements in the
infrastructure (rural roads, and drinking water) and fuelwood production from
treated watersheds would benefit women. The involvement of women
beneficiaries in the planning process of the project, including selection of
activities and their location, would give women an opportunity to express
their views on those issues that affect them most. Also, women in the project
area would save traveling time to the market and time spent in collecting
water for the family which could be deployed for



other productive purposes. Women would also benefit from increased incomes in
mall livestock production. In general, women laborers would benefit from
enhanced employment opportunities.
19.   Esn£fA. The project would increase crop production, employment
opportunities, incomes and installation of sustainable production assets. A
network of 1,200 km of rural roads would be constructed, upgraded and
maintained; water would be made available to irrigate 24,000 ha of land or
32,900 ha of cropped area; the health of the rural population would be
improved by the construction of about 13.000 drinking water wells; soil
erosion prevention and m-isture re.ention measures would benefit about 10,000
ha of arable and non-arable land; and agricultural production would be
improved by providing quality seeds and seedlings and improved small
livestock. The project would help to alleviate poverty in the tribal area.
Specifically, it would benefit about 3.7 million people by directly increasing
their average annual net income from farming alone by about 70* from Rs. 1,200
to 2,050.1/ In addition, considerable seasonal and non-farm employment would
be generated through the road and irrigation infrastructure provided under the
project. As a result of increased cropping intensity, higher yields, and
forestry activities, annual employment in the project areas would increase by
about 2.25 million man-days at full development.2/ The project would also
introduce an integrated management system for planning and imp'lementation,
promote user group and NGO involvement in the development process, and
sensitize people to environmental issues.
20. Biaka. The weak management of government departments and poor budgetary
support, which have been common problems for Bank-assisted projects in Bihar,
pose a risk to implementation of the proposed project. To minimize the risk,
the project is designed to be managed with minimal government involvement. To
bring about project "ownership" by the people, user groups would be actively
involved in project planning, implementation, evaluation and maintenance of
project facilities. All project activities would be guided by various
committees set up at different levels with representatives from local
bodies/NGOs. Sensitizing project officials to the necessity of people's
involvement would be part of this main approach. Beneficiaries through water
users associations and village panchayats would specifically assume ownership
of assets and responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the
irrigation and drinking water facilities. Before these proposals go forward,
their clearance would have to be apprc ed by beneficiaries.  Other mi_igatory
measures include: the advanced state of preparation of the project, a mid-term
review, and an extensive monitoring and feedback system built into the
project. With GOB support, and with built-in safeguards for sustaining
operations such as beneficiary involvemer.c, the project has a good chance of
succeeding.
