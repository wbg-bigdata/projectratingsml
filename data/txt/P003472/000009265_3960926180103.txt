ProJect
Description: This will be the Bank's fourth involvement in the railway
subsector. The proposed project would support the Government's
objectives of increasing railway capacity and improving its
operations and efficiency. It would also further develop MR's
technical and managerial capabilities and contribute to the
overall economic growth of the country. The project will con-
sist of four components: (a) double-tracking and partial elec-
trification of the 492 km single-track line between Yueshan in
Henan province and Xiangfan in Hubei province; (b) expanding
capacity and improving quality of manufacture in three locomo-
tive and rolling stock factories, one near Beijing (February
7), and the others in Sifang and Qiqihar; (c) a study to
develop a strategic plan in the areas of telecoemunications and
computerization, to be pilot-tested on the Beijing-Shanghai
railway corridor, in order to improve operational amnagement
and transportation capacity; and (d) training and technical
assistance related to the Factory Modernization component and
to the Strategic Plan Study. The line upgrading works involve
proven technology that is already in wide use in China; tech-
nological risks are therefore small. MR has successfully com-
pleted similar projects for a number of years; risks from
inadequate project implementation and operation are therefore
negligible. The factory modernization carries little risk,
since there is satisfactory experience with similar components
in the three previous railway loans. The strategic plan study
and related modernization measures for the Beijing-Shanghai
line present some risk, but it will be controlled through close
collaboration with major railways in Europe ard North America,
who have extensive experience in the technology involved. The
potential gains, on the otLer hand, are considerable in terms
of further improving operational efficiency and enabling MR to
increase line capacity at lower cost.

I. THE TRANSPORr SECI
1.1      The structure of China's eoonomy, which for three decades emphasized
heavy industry at the expense of light industry and the service sector, is
still inherently "transport-intensive," despite recent reforms of the sectoral
priorities. Chinese policy statements repeatedly identify transportation and
energy shortages as the two most crit-cal bottlenecks in the economy. Coal is
at the heart of both problems, because coal is simultaneously the most .impor-
tant source of energy (about 72% of total energy output in 1986) and the larg-
est user of transport capacity (about 32% of total ton-km (tkm) in 1986). This
dual problem with coal is exacerbated by China's high level of energy consump-
tion per unit of GDP. However, the need to ship large volumes of coal is not
the sole cause of the transportation bottleneck.
1.2       The rapid growth of China's economy in recent years has naturally
entailed a growing demand for the shipment of comnodities of all sorts, and for
passenger travel as well. Efforts to reduce waste within the transport system
(for example by increasing the processing of raw materials before shipment) are
certainly desirable. More fundamentally, however, the Government's strategy
for solving transportation shortages will have to rely on an expansion of the
system's capacity, primarily by increasing the productivity of existing facili-
ties wherever possible, and secondarily by building new facilities where need-
ed.
1.3       Freight Traffic. Domestic freight transported in 1986 reached almost
1,400 billion tkm, more than an 18-fold increase since 1952, or an average an-
nual growth rate of about 9%. Since 1980, freight traffic has also grown at
about 10% a year, while the Gross Value of Industrial and Agricultural Output
(GVIAO), corrected for price inflation, has grown at 12%. Thus, the growth
elasticity of demand for transport (that is, the ratio of the two growth rates)
is 0.85. If this elasticity remains stable in the next few years, and if GVIAD
grows at the rate targeted by the Government (7.2%), then the traffic level in
the year 2000 will be about 3,200 billion tkm.  The modal split on a thm basis
has moved toward a more balanced use of modes, but the railways still handle
63% of the traffic versus 82% in 1952; this predominance is expected to con-
tinue for quite some time.
1.4      Passenger traffic reached 459 billion passenger-km (pki) in 1986, an
18-fold increase since 1952 and an average annual growth rate of almost 9%.
Since 1978, growth has averaged 13% p.a. This illustrates the potential demand
for travel as income grows. It is likely that this growth would have been even
more rapid if it had not been constrained by the limited capacity, particularly
of the railways, to offer more passenger services. The modal split has shifted
more rapidly than for freight, and the railways now handle 56% of the traffic
versus over 80% in 1952. Despite the rapid growth of passenger traffic in
recent years, the mobility of people in China is still much lower than in coun-
tries of comporable inr.Wiie levels. Average per capita travel in India is about
800 pkm p.a., much more than China's average of about 450 pkm p.a.  By the turn
of the century, passenger traffic may well reach about 1,500 billion pkm per
year or more than three times current levels.



- 2 -
1.5      Investments.  Over the period 1953-86, some V 178 billion, or 14% of
all new investments under central government control, went to transport (Table
1.1). Transport's share in national investment spending has fluctuated rather
widely over the years, falling as low as 9.1% in 1981. In the years since,
however, the share has risen rapidly, and total central government investment
has also grown significantly, with the results that the absolute nomunts allo-
cated to this sector each year have increased nearly five-fold since 1981.
These recnt investments have improved, but not cured, the transport bottleneck
problem in the economy. Fcr example, .cosl production in shanxi continues to be
bampered by inadequate rail capacity. Rural areas throughout the country are
short of transport, both for crops and for local light industry. In the ports,
lack of proper handling facilities is hampering trade of bulk oannodities such
as fertilizers, cement and grain. In the future, a continuing investment ef-
fort on a vajor scale will be needed if these constraints to economic growth
are to be overcome.
1.6      Port traffic has grown at 12.4% since 1976, reflecting China's more
open economic policies. Domestic coastal shipping and inland water transport
also increased substantially. As a result, ports became congested despite
cor endab'e efforts to achieve high productivity. A major effort to modernize
ports started in the early 1970s and continues with particular emphasis on
container and bulk terminals, the latter mainly for coal.  The Bank's first
transport operation in China was the Three Ports Project (Ln 2207-CHA, 1982),
which includes container terminals at Huangpu, Shanghai, and Tianjin, and a
ooal berth at Huangpu. Three more port projects, for additional facilities at
Tianjin (Ln 2689-CHA, 1987), Huangpu (Ln 2877/Cr 1845, 1987) and Dalian (1988),
respectively, have been approved.
1.7      The highway network comprised about 942,000 km in 1985, of which
about 20% was asphalt paved, about 56% were gravel or sand paved, and the re-
mainder were earth roads. Despite impressive expansion of the road network
since 1949, when only some 80,000 km of roads suitable for motor vehicles ex-
isted, the roads in China today are inadequate because: (a) pavement strength
and quality are poor; (b) there are many thousand kilcmters of extremely rough
nacadam surfaced roads with traffic in excess of 300 average daily traffic
(ADT); (c) congestion is severe near cities, due to mixed slow and fast moving
traffic; and (d) there are gaps of about 4,000 km on major national roads link-
ing large cities and provincial capitals. The road network and road transport
in China today can therefore be characterized as underdeveloped. Road main-
tenance, however, is well organized and currently absorbs munh of the attention
and resources of the provincial and other local road authorities.
1.8      Except for western China, the highway network is still very much a
system of feeder roads to the railways. Nevertheless, motor traffic has grown
at a very high overall annual average of 15% on the national highways since
1978. The Bank Group's First Highway Project (Ln 2539-CIA/Cr 1594-CHA, 1985)
involves the construction or improvement of about 290 km of national roads and
about 1,400 km of rural roads. fThe second highway project, for the Beijing-
Tanggu-Tianjin Expressway (Ln 2811-CHA/Cr 1792-CHA, 1987), has been approved,
and construction is expected to begin early in 1988. Two provincial highway
projects have been negotiated recently and two others are now in various stages
of appraisal.



1.9      Transport Issues and ObJectives. The transport system has been se-
verely taxed by the recent rapid economic growth, and capacity constraints are
evident in all modes. On the railways, capacity enhancement on several key
outes (through electrification, double-tracking, and other types of upgrading)
is under may, with work on other bottleneck routes scheduled to begin over the
next several years. Improved rolling stock technology and other operational
improvements could also contribute to capacity increases. China will also need
to expand substantially its port and waterway facilities for domestic and fo-
reign trade. Considerable efficiency gains could be made in the entire trans-
port system through better intermcdal coordination, which has thus far been
impeded by the vertical and self-contained organization of transport and other
sectoral agencies. Through container transport from origin to destination is
still the exception. Changes in policy, pricing and management of the system
are needed to maximize the benefits of intermodal transport.
1.10     The problems of the transport sector have been the subject of an in-
creasingly vigorous and constructive dialogue between the Bank and the Govern-
ment. Several important studies of strategic questions of a broader nature
have been completed or are currently in progress. The Bank's report on Inland
Water Transport is being circulated for discussion within China. The initial
phase of the Guangdong Provincial Transport Study, which takes a comprehensive
view of the sector and examines the appropriate role of the different modes,
has recently been completed; subsequent work jointly with the Bank will focus
on identification of priority investments and policy development issues. A
report on the modernization of railway operations is now being prepared. Most
recently, an inter-agency study of the complex question of coal price reform
has been completed. Moreover, consideration i3 being given to another study on
the closely linked questions of increased transportation demand as a result of
coal price reform and of optimai. investments in expansion of transport capa-
city. From the Governari.t's point of view, reforms of pricing and of spatial
production patterns in coal and transport are matters of great importance and
sensitivity.
II. THE RAILWAY SUEBECIYgI
Organization and Management
2.1      The principal agency in the subsector is the Ministry of Railways
(MR), with a staff of some 3.2 million, which administers a nationwide, inter-
connected system of 52,000 route-kim. Other railroads are administered by the
Ministries of Coal Industry, Forestry, and Communications for uses associated
with their own operations, and by provincial governments for limited services
within their own jurisdictions. The Chinese system is the fifth largest and
carries the second highest freight and passenger traffic in the world.
2.2      Five Vice-Ministers and a Chief EIngineer support the Minister of
Railways in administering 24 bureaus and offices concerned with specific func-
tional aspects of MR's work and 12 regional administrations which are respon-
sible for operations. MK's organization chart is presented as Annex 1. The
regional administrations are organized in the form of State-owned enterprises,
which are self-accounting and have authority over their own retained earnings;
they also have contractual capacity and the right to hire and fire staff.
However, total staff numbers and payroll amount are still under MR's oontrol.



- 4 -
Each administration is headed by a general manager, and is typically divided
into a number of subadministrations, each of which controls the basic units
(stations, workshops, etc.) that are responsible for day-to-day operations
within its territory.
2.3      MR also controls a number of factories, which together provide the
greater part of MR's requirements of looomotives, passenger and freight cars,
ties, fishplates, etc., and 14 construction bureaus which carry out mOst of the
civil works. Design, engineering and architectural services are also carried
out "in house" by a number of specialist design institutes and bureaus. In line
with the recent Government pronouncement in favor of financially independent
enterprises, a number of MR bureaus have been restructured as companies with
limited financial independence. These incluce the Railway Signal and Communica-
tion Company, Civil Engineering Company, and Industrial Company. All their
managers report to the Minister (Annex 1). Under the Industrial Company, three
major locomotive and rolling stock factories (paras. 3.7 to 3.14) will be bene-
ficiaries of the proposed loan through capacity expansion and quality improve-
ments in manufacture.
2.4      Until recently the management of the railways was highly centralized.
Although the administrations carried responsibility for day-to-day operations,
strategic decisions were taken by the Ministry, or by other agencies of the
central Government on representations made by the Ministry. All development
*         projects above a relatively small value were subject to approval by SPC; fi-
nancing for capital expenditure was controlled by MOF, to whom all operating
profits were returned; tariffs were set and staffing levels monitored by agen-
cies external to the railways (planning and tariff mechanisms are described in
paras. 2.9 and 2.20, respectively).
2.5      In 1986, in furtherance of Government's policy to devolve respon-
sibility for the operation of certain state enterprises to their own manage-
ments, the Government entered into an "Economic Contract" with the Ministry of
Railways in which certain operational parameters were set for a five-year pe-
riod (concordant with the national Seventh Five-Year Plan, 7FYP), within which
the railways were to be given substantial discretion to manage themselves. The
contract was primarily financial in nature, and provided that MR's operational
cash flow (after debt retirement and special fund appropriations) could be
retained and applied to capital ir.vestment; further details are at paras. 5.12
and 5.13. Within these parameters the railway was encouraged to maximize pro-
fits, subject to the state's prerogative to require it to carry unprofitable
traffic and operate unprofitable lines.
2.6      Along with these realignments of responsibility for the strategic
management of the railway, a number of administrative reforms were also intro-
duced, including in particular payroll bonuses based on traffic growth in each
administration and distributed according to individual performance evaluations.
This package of reforms represents a very significant change in the railways'
remit from the state; its success will invol'-e substantial adjustments in man-
agers' attitudes and ways of working which will take time to accomplish and
longer to evaluate. In the meanwhile, MR has sought the Bank's advice and
assistance in the development of appropriate new management systems (pera.
5.21).



-5-
Education and Research
2.7      In coordination with the State Education Coamission, MR operates 11
universities, 20 staff colleges for in-service training, and more than 2,000
schools with 100,000 teachers and staff. Eight of the universities provide
technical courses, two provide medical courses, and one is a teacher training
college. Most of them now offer graduate programs. For high school graduates
unable to enter university, MR operates more than 60 vocational schools wnich
trair. locomotive drivers and other operations staff; MR's other schools provide
primary and secondary education for an enrollment now exceeding one million.
Graduates of MR's schools proceed exclusively to employment in MR, but grad-
uates of MR's universities may be employed elsewhere.
2.8      The Ministry also operates the ten research institutes which comprise
the China Academy of Railway Scienoes. Mostly, the institutes are concerned
with applied research and acceptance tests on new products procured locally and
abroad, but the institutes also provide instruction at Masters and Doctorate
levels.
Planning and Investment
2.9      On the basis of national production plans and origin/destinar cn
tables for key products and of its own observation of passenger movement pat-
terns, MR develops five-year traffic forecasts by principal routes throughout
its network. At the regional administration level, these forecasts are trans-
lated into traffic density patterns and compared with existing line capacities.
From these comparisons are derived the railway's requirements in motive power
and rolling stock and in route capacity enhancement. Production schedules and
work programs are developed for MR's own factories and construction companies,
and the total investment plan is submitted to the State Planning Commission
(SPC) for approval; SPC may indicate the need for some adjustment, and further
iterations of some or all of the process may be required, but finally a total
plan is evolved which is consistent (and integral) with the national economic
plan.
2.10     From this plan, various subsidiary plans are derived, including a
manpower developsent plan and a schedule of material requirements (in particu-
lar, rails and other steel products) from external suppliers. At present,
there is no detailed financial plan corresponding to the network's physical
investment needs mentioned above.  The recently-instituted economic contract
between MR and the Government provided simply a set of five-year aggregate
financial targets which MR is to fulfill (para. 5.14). SPC still controls MB's
overall capital expenditure on a year-to-year basis.
2.11     All major projects are subjected to substantial engineering, economic
and financial feasibility analyses. Attention is also given to determination
of economic priorities under a situaticn of severe capital budget constraints.
However, in the view of the Bank the specific methodologies employed do not
give adequate attention to the losses to the national economy stemming from
under-investment in transportation, and are therefore not suitable for deter-
mining the most economic level of ov.erall investment in the railways. A dia-
logue with MR's Planning Bureau has been initiated to improve methodologies to
determine the overall scale of investment and also ensure that highest priority



needs are met despite the constraints which wili remain regardless of any like-
ly increase in resource availabilities.
2.12     After falling to V 1.4 billion in 1981 during a period of budgetary
stringency, railway investments were increased from V 2.6 billion in 1982 to V
8.5 billion in 1986 (Table 1.1). A total of about V 40.0 billion has been
allocated for the 7FYP (1986-1990). The focus will be on upgrading existing
facilities; the anticipated traffic growth (paras. 2.18 and 2.19) will be car-
ried primarily by the existing system.
Buduets. Accounts and Audit
2.13     The expense of MR's bureaus forms part of the Central Government bud-
get, and is not recovered from railway revenues. Operating costs of the re-
gional administrations are controlled by annual budgets compiled at the sub-
administration level. Accounting is likewise focused at the subadministration
level, although some basic procedures such as cash collection and disbursement
are decentralized to the operating units. Consolidation of budgets and finan-
cial statements is routinely carried out only up to the administration level;
consolidation at the overall system level (all administrations combined) is
generally confined to income statement items (para. 5.9). The accounting sys-
tem is double entry, on the accrual basis, and accounting rules and procedures
are uniform between administrations.
2.14      In common with all ministries whose responsibility includes the
supervision of enterprises, MR contains an Audit Bureau, whose principal func-
tions are to monitor compliance with accounting rules and to evaluate the effi-
ciency of operations. MR's Audit Bureau was established as recently as 1985,
and its procedures are being developed with a pilot administration. The Indus-
trial Transport Bureau of the Audit Administration (AAPRC) also carries out
test audits of parts of M' s operations selected randomly. In particular,
AAPRC aidits the accounts of subadministrations which are beneficiaries of Bank
loans and IDA credits. The audit reports have generally been received in a
timely manner and have been of a standard aoceptabl- to the Bank; the few que-
ries raised by the Bank have been promptly answered. During negotiations, it
was confirmed that AAPRC will be responsible for audits under the proposed
project, and it was agreed that the project accounts and the audit report
thereon will be sent to the Bank for review not later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year.
Railway Facilities and Rolling Stock
2.15     China's railway network more than doubled in size between 1949 and
1986, from 21,800 to 52,500 route-km. The network now includes 10,000 route-km
of double track and 4,400 route-km of electrified track. Further double-track-
ing and electrification works are in progress as the present line capacity is
insufficient to meet traffic demands. The rail network is served by a fleet of
about 12,300 locomotives, 314,500 freight cars and 22,100 passenger coaches.
At present, 61% of tractive power is still steam, 33% is diesel and 6% is elec-
tric. Rolling stock includes large numbers of older wagons and coaches, many
in poor condition and with high operational and maintenance costs. Traffic
growth has outstripped production of new units and the fleet is far from ade-
quate (for detailed data on the railway system, see Table 2.1).



- 7-
Operational Perfonmance Standards
2.16     Despite the limitations of the network and the locomotives and roll-
ing stock, rail operations utilize track and equipment intensively and effi-
ciently (Table 2.1). Freight traffic density averages about 17. 1 million net
tkm per route-Ian which is the highest freight density in the world after the
Soviet Union, and 50% higher than freight density in the United States.
China's passenger traffic density of about 5.0 million pkm per route-km is also
the second highest in the world, this time after India. Passenger traffic
density in the Soviet Union is roughly the same as in China. Despite this
heavy traff-.c density, track and other fixed installations are carefully main-
tained, although the labor-intensive methods now used are now becoming ina-
dequate for the maintenance of trunk lines and will soon become inadequate
elsewhere under the traffic planned for the future.
2.17     As the freight car turnaround time of 3.5 days and  se other perform-
ance indicators of Table 2.1 make clear, MR already uses its assets quite effi-
ciently, especially considering the vintage of much of the technology. While
agreement is being sought with MR for regular updating of these standard oper-
ating statistics, significant productivity increases are likely to be achieved
only through rather sophisticated changes to the overall operating system,
involving longer trains, heavier axle loads, closer headways, computerized
management of rolling stock, etc. Field trials and pilot projects to be under-
taken on the Beijing-Shanghai corridor under the Strategic Plan Study (pars.
3.15) promise to make an important contribution to the resolution of these com-
plex issues of system modernization.
Traffic
2.18     Freight traffic on the railways has grown from about 100 million tons
in 1950 to about 1.3 billion tons in 1986. Because of an increase in the aver-
age length of haul, rail freight traffic volume in tikm has grown even faster,
from 39.4 billion in 1950 to 534.5 billit  in 1978, averaging 10% p.a.  After
1978, growth slowed to around 4.5% p. a., but rose again to near 10% in the past
three years. In 1986, 876 billion tkm were carried. Three quarters of all
freight traffic involves ten important basic commodities (including coal, iron
and steel products, grain and construction materials), and the shortage of
freight capacity has emerged as one of the key constraints on economic growth
(Tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4). The Seventh FYP envisions an annual growth rate of
4.9%, leading to a rail freight traffic of 1.6 billion tons by 1990.
2.19     In 1950, the railways carried about 150 million passengers; in 1986,
they carried about 1,075 million (Table 2.5). The growth of rail passenger
traffic has been particularly rapid since 1978 - that is, since the introduc-
tion of major economic reforms. In just the eight years from 1978 to 1986,
rail passenger traffic increased from 109.1 to 2b8.2 billion pkm, an average of
11% p.a. This rapid growth shows the high priority afforded to personal travel
out of the extra income generated by the economic reforms. However, there is
still an acute shortage of passenger coaches, and on crowded lines passenger
trains compete for space with freight trains. The Seventh FYP envisions an
annual growth rate of 6.8%, leading to a ridership of 1.4 billion passengers
by 1990.



-8-
Tariffs
2.20     In comon with other sectors, the railways have changed their tariffs
very little since the early 1950s. Freight rates were increased in late 1983,
the first change since 1967 (at which time they had been reduced), but passen-
ger rates remained at the 1967 level. The 1983 freight rate reform doubled the
minimum chargeable distance to 100 km, and increased rates for 75% of the com-
modities (including coal, cement, oil and fertilizers) by 23% on average. To
discourage short-haul traffic further, the Government introduced the following
rate increases effective June 1, 1985: (a) 36.8% for passenger trips of less
than 100 km; (b) 50% for monthly suburban season tickets; and (c) V 4.00 per
ton for freight transport up to 200 km. While the effect of freight tariff
increases on transport patterns was not obvious, that for passenger traffic
caused a slight drop of passengers traveling by rail (from 1.12 billion in 1985
to 1.07 billion in 1986). As of end-May 1986, the average freight haul of 661
km yielded a gross revenue of Fenl 1.98 per tkm, while the average passenger
journey of 240 km yielded a gross revenue of Pen 1.94 per pkm. Freight, pas-
sengers, and other revenues combined yielded an averege revenue (after business
tax) of Fen 2.00 per traffic unit, which is 63% above operating costs.  MR is
beginning to take a closer interest in the profitability of individual route..
and services, and the costing system now being developed (para. 5.20) will be
an essential first step in such an examination.
Government Objectives and the Role of the Bank
2.21     The Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) allocated V 40.0 billion for
investment in railways, an 80% increase in nominal terms over the 6FYP. These
resources will facilitate considerable development of the railway network, to
keep pace with China's rapid economic growth.   Thie Bank's strategy for the
subsector is to support the aoceleration of railway expansion and technological
modernization, and the further improvement of operational efficiency. It will,
in addition, assist MR in modernizing its technical and management capabili-
ties. The first part of the strategy is thus to be responsive to the imnediate
material needs of China's railway system as they arise; the second part is to
help better equip the subsector with the technology and expertise it needs to
mnnage the future development of the railway system.
2.22     The first project (Ln 2394-CHA, July 1984) contained components to
alleviate bottlenecks on two key routes, and to increase electric looomotive
production; the second tLn 2540-CHA, November 1985) focussed on further -oute
capacity improvements and the expansion of passenger coach manufacture; the
third (Ln 2678-CHA/Cr 1680-CiA, October 1986) continued with further route
capacity improvement and the modernization of signalling equipment manufacture.
2.23     On the software side, the first project initiated the design of a
traffic costing system, and a study team from MR has now examined railway cost-
ing systems il Europe and in the USA and has reported on its main conclusions
and recommendations. Under the second stage of the study (supported partly
from the first loan and partly from the third), system specifications were com-
pleted and implementation has started on a pilot basis. The second railway
project provided for the start-up of a major menagement information system
study, and MR is presently preparing a master plan for its implementation at a
pilot subadninistration.



-9-
2.24      In the context of ongoing project work, the Bank has also begun a
dialogue with MR on aspects of overall system planning and control, and has
presented a seminar (with the assistance of senior railway executives from the
U.K.) to demonstrate approaches to system management better tailored to MR's
needs in the new era of economic reforms. MR has recently requested the coope-
ration of the Bank in examining a number of aspects of its financial management
(para. 5.21) in the light of current practice in other parts of the world, and
the dialogue will continue in the context of project supervision and new pro-
ject preparation.  By such means, the Bank hopes to be of assistance to China's
railway subsector in its organizational development and technological modern-
ization as well as the expansion of its capacity.
2.25     All three projects are being implemented in a relatively satisfactory
manner, although the training anid technical assistance oomponents included in
the ongoing projects are not progressing well. While MR is willing to spend
what it takes to acquire modern machinery and computers, which give immediate
and tangible results, it is extremely reluctant to spend loan money on what it
considers excessive expatriate salaries and living expenses. Also, preparation
of tender documents for ICB, bid evaluation, and contract negotiations are
taking an inordinate amount of time. As a result, some components are delayed
by up to two years and disbursements are far behind schedule. To date, about
US$417 million (over 60% of the total value of the loans) is still uncommitted
in the three loan accounts combined, pending contract awards, and both the
State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance are increasingly com-
plaining about having to pay commitment fees for funds MR does not use in a
timely manner.
2.26      To reduce the delays mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in March
1987 MR created a new central department, which is now responsible for coordi-
nating the various stsges of procurement for all components sattered through-
out the network. Some improvement is already taking place, although much re-
mains to be done. As a further guarantee that procurement work will improve
under the proposed project, in October 1987 the Bank proposed (with the concur-
rence of SPC and MOF) that prior to negotiations, MR should submit to the Bank
acceptable tender documents for the goods to be procured during the first year
of implementation of the new project. Since many of the goods concerned are
similar to goods tendered for under previous projects, there was not much new
work involved and MR has willingly accepted this provision. However, the
documents were still not ready by the time of negotiations, and they are now
expected to be submitted before Board presentation.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin
3.1      In October 1986, MR provided the Bank with documents outlining the
objectives of the proposed Fourth RailwaIr Project and a description of its
various components. The cost estimates for all major components were based on
final engineering to within 5%. During a visit to Washington in November 1986
by a delegation headed by the Chief Engineer (Vice Minister), the project was
discussed in broad terms and it was agreed that the proposal provided a sound
basis for further consideration by the Bank. During preappraisal in March/
April, 1987 the Government withdrew two components earmarked for the project
and proposed two new components instead, which were preappraised in July 1987.
Appraisal of all components took place in October/November 1987, but the last
two components were withdrawn by the Government in late February 1988.
B. Project ObJectives and Relation to the Sector
3 2      The project reflects the three main thrusts of the Government's
development strategy for railways in the 7FYP: (a) increasing the capacity of
key routes and terminals; (b) enhancing the productivity of existing assets by
raising the level of technology used in different activities within MR, e.g.,
in train operations, maintenance, administration, and manufacturing; and (c)
expanding rolling stock manufacturing facilities.  The components have been
chosen in such a way as to provide a bridge to possible sector lending. In
particular, the third component consists of a Strategic Plan Study and related
measures designed to test the strategic plan on the Beijing-Shanghai railway
corridor in modernizing the systews of telecommunications, train operations and
operations information management. These measures are being introduced to
China for the first time, and MR considers them as an example of innovation
for other major rail lines in the country.
3.3      The orientation of the Strategic Plan Study toward efficiency and
modernization represents a significant departure from the mostly facility-
oriented compohfents in the previous railway loans to COina. The Bank has paid
special attention to this component and has sent a team of several specialists
to work on its detailed design. The component is intended to help promote a
broader-based dialogue between the Bank and MR. In another effort, the Bank
has already initiated a dialogue with MR on its investment planning and priori-
tization. These activities are also intended to prepare for sector lending ir.
the rail subsector in the future.
C. Project Description
3.4      The four components of the project are:
(a) the double-tracking and partial electrification of the Yueshan-Xiang-
fan section of the Jiaozuo-Zhicheng (Jiaozhi) line, in the Beijing-
Guangzhou rail corridor (peras. 3.5 and 3.6);
(b) the expansion and modernization of three locomotive and rolling stock
factories (paras 3.7 to 3.14);



- 11 -
(c) a Strategic Plan Study in the areas of telecommunications and com-
puterization, to be pilot-tested on the Beijing-Shanghai railway
corridor, in order to improve operational management and transporta-
tion capacity (para. 3.15); and
(d) training and technical assistance related to the Factory Moderniza-
tion component and to the Strategic Plan Study.
Yueshan-Xiangfan Line Double-Tracking and Partial Electrification
3.5      Under the proposed project, the 492 km line from Yueshan in Henan
province to Xiangfan in Hubei province will be double-tracked and the 113 km
northern section, from Yueshan to Luoyang, will be electrified. This has been
aocorded high priority by both MR and the Bank, since this line is among the
railway's highest density routes. Part of the line runs through difficult
montainous terrain. In 1985, total traffic was 15.9 million net tons (at) of
freight between Jiyuan and Luoyang (10.6 mt southbound), and 25.4 mt between
Luoyang and Baofeng (16.1 mt southbound), plus six daily pairs of passenger
trains. This is already much in excess of normal operating capacity for a
single-track line with steam traction.
3.6      After track doubling and partial electrification, line capacity will
be between 64 and 87 mt of freight p.a., depending on the sections, exclusive
of passenger traffic. Traffic levels in the year 2000 are projected to be
between 61 and 85 mt (48 and 64 mt southbound) plus 15 pairs of passenger
trains daily. Coal will account for about 50% of the freight traffic, the rest
being iron ore, lime3tone, cement, other construction materials, etc. Construc-
tion is being phased over several years and should be completed in 1995.
Modernization of Three Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factories
3.7      The Bank has already financed one factory modernization scheme in
each of the three previous railway projects. These included specific modern-
ization components as well as import of technology, and allowed the Bank to
familiarize itself with the manufacturing sector of MR. Fonmulation of the
factory modernization component included in the proposed project has esta-
blished a project preparation procedure that will be further developed and
extended to other locomotive and rolling stock factories, for the preparation
and documentation of their investmnt and modernization program for the 8FYP.
3.8     The February 7 Locomotive Works (F7LW), near Beijing, was founded in
1901, originally for steam locomotive repairs. Aggregate revenues in 1986
amounted to about V 94 million. The factory has a work force of about 7,530 em-
ployees, of which about 5,300 are directly production-related. Since 1958, F7LU
has produced diesel locomotives, now principally of two types:
(a) Beijing, a 2,700-hp BoBo diesel-hydraulic mainline passenger
locomotive; and
(b) Dongfeng 7, a 2,000-hp CoCo diesel-electric shunting locomotive
(with a down-rated version of the Beijing's engine).
Production in 1986 was 33 new Beijing and 12 new Dongfeng 7, plus major over-
hauls for 32 Beijing.



- 12 -
3.9      There are several quality problems with the locomotives built by
F7LW, such as engine block cracks, cylinder head leaks, bearing failures, and
camshaft lobe spalling. These problems arise because the machine tools and
other equipaent at the factory are obsolete and often entirely worn out. The
project will provide high-precision machine tools that will reduce or eliminate
many of these problems, thus significantly reducing fuel consumption and main-
tenance costs, while also permitting more locomotives to be built each year.
The project will also address the problems of process engineering (the effi-
ciency of work flow within the factory) and of pollution control. In combina-
tion with a plan to move most of the heavy overhaul work to another workshop in
LuoyarAg, the project will permit F7LW to achieve production of 30 Beijing and
70 Dongfeng 7 locomotives in 1990.
3.10     The Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works (SLRSW), at Qingdao,
was also founded in 1901 for the repair of steam locomotives. Aggregate reve-
nues in 1986 amounted to V 93 million. The factory's work force totals about
11,000 employees, of which about 7,700 are directly production-related. The
factory currently produces four main products:
(a) Dongfeng 5, a 1,650-hp CoCo diesel-electric shunting locomotive;
(b) Dongfanghong 3, a 2,500-hp BoBo diesel-hydraulic mainline passenger
locomotive;
(c) a 25.5 m hard-berth sleeping coach; and
(d) a 23.6 m soft-berth sleeping coach.
3.11     Production in 1986 was 42 new locomotives and 30 locomotives over-
hauled plus 254 new coaches and 220 major coach overhauls. The Dongfeng 5 is a
new model, and thus does not yet have a history of failures, but the Dongfeng 4
-- a related model produced at Dalian -- has many of the same quality problems
that the Beijing and Dongfeng 7 exhibit. (Problems with the Dongfanghong 3 can
be disregarded, since this model is being phased out of production.) Serious
problems, particularly with corrosion, oocur for the coaches as well. Under the
proposed project, the existing factory will be modernized and devoted exclu-
sively to locomotive production, while a new facility will be built outside the
city for coach production. By providing modern machine tools and streamlining
the flow of work in the factory, the project will permit SLRSW to produce 800
coaches and overhaul 100 annually by 1992 and to increase locomotive production
to 150 units annually by 1994. In addition to these quantity increases, quality
improvements will also result from the project, thus leading to lower fleet
maintenance and operating costs. As at F7LW, the modernization at SLRSW will
bring about a significant improvement in pollution control.
3.12     The Qiqihar Rolling Stock Works (QRW) was founded in 1935 and is
China's most important freight car manufacturer. Total revenues in 1986 amount-
ed to V 363 million. QRSW has a work force of about 12,000 employees, of which
about 8,000 are directly production-related. Main products at present are:
(a) C62A, a 60-ton gondola car with side unloading; and
(b) P62, a 60-ton box car with center side slide doors.



- 13 -
3.13     In addition, QRSW manufactures a variety of specialized freight cars,
as well as air brake equipnent, wheel sets, and bogie components. Production in
1986 was 7,253 new freight cars and 1,900 freight car overhauls. The major pro-
blem with the freight cars is corrosion (due to inaccurate fabrication, impro-
per welding, and inferior painting), resultini in a service life of only five
years between major overhauls. With the project, output at QRSW will be in-
creased to about 9,000 cars a year, and product quality will be improved so
that the major overhaul interval becomes 7 to 10 years. The project will also
addhess questions of process engineering and pollution control.
3.14     Training will be provided for factory staff in operating and main-
taining new equipment, new manufacturing processes, and also for personnel
whose skills will become redundant after modernization (para. 3.16).
Strategic Plan Study
3.15     In order to help MR to better fulfill its transportation function in
general, a study will be carried out to develop a strategic plan in the areas
of telecomunications and computerization, so as to improve operational manage-
ment and transportation capacity. The study will be carried out by a project
team composed of MR staff, with the support of internationally recruited spe-
cialists satisfactory to the Bank. A study outline, shown in Annex 2, contains
a proposed plan of action including a program to pilot-test the cost-effective-
ness of the strategic plan on the Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor. Agreement
was reached during negotiations on the plan of action and related performance
measures for monitoring and evaluation.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.16     Training of staff in new technology and management is included in the
Factory Modernization and the Strategic Plan Study (paras. 3.7 and. 3.15). The
Factory Modernization will also be supported through the financing of visits to
similar plants abroad, and visits by foreign experts to factories in China,
with a view to assisting the factory planning teams in deciding upon specific
technological issues. Retraining of staff whose skills will be redundant after
modernization will be financed domestically. The corresponding technical as-
sistance and training program totals 366 man-months, of which 210 man-months
are for training Chinese staff abroad and 156 man-months are for technical
assistance by foreign experts in China. During negotiations, it was agreed
that the program will be carried out according to the outline shown in Annex 3.
Cost Estimates and Financing
3.17     Detailed designs have been prepared by MR's engineering bureaus for
all project works. Quantities were derived from final engineering, and unit
prices are based on current world market prices for equipment to be imported.
The cost of equipment and materials to be procured locally and not to be fi-
nanced by the Bank was estimated on the basis of current domestic prices. The
estimated project cost, expressed in April 1988 prices and including training
and contingencies is US$600.0 million, of which US$273.1 million represents
direct and indirect foreign exchange costs. Cost estimates are given in Tables
3.1 to 3.12 and are sumnarized on page 15. The Government has requested a loan
of US$200.0 million which would cover about a third of the total project cost
and 74% of the estimated foreign exchange cost. The Government will finance
other materials, equipment and construction costs from its own resources. The



- 14 -
foreign Cost of the Strategic Plan Study (US$2.5 million) is expected to be
oofinanced partly by the Japanese Yen Grant Facility (US$1.5 million) and part-
ly by the reallocation of US$1.0 million of unallocated funds from the Third
Railway Project (Cr. 1680-CIA/Ln. 2678-CHA).
3.18     An average of 7.6% physical contingencies was included in estimated
project costs. Annual price escalation rates were applied to local and foreign
costs, as follows: 6.5% and 1.0% respectively from 1988 to 1990, and 4.5% and
3.5% respectively from 1991 to 1995. The April 1988 exchange rate of V 3.70 to
the US dollar was used for the translation of the foreign exchange costs.
The total cost of technical assistance and training is estimated at about
US$5.8 million, including contingencies. The costs per man-month, including
travel and subsistence and based on an average duration of one month per per-
son, are estimated at US$6,000 for Chinese staff abroad and US$10,000 for fo-
reign experts in China.
3.19     The proposed Bank loan would finance:
(a) for the Yueshan-Xiangfan line, basic materials, and construction
and electrification equipment (US$163 million); and
(b) for the three factories, mainly modern machine tools and training
(US$37 million).
A list of items to be financed by the proposed loan is given in
Tables 3.13 to 3.21. A summury breakdown of the project costs (in April 1988
prices) and of the proposed loan is shown on page 15 and in Section R, page 16.
D. Project Implementation
3.20     Double-tracking and partial electrification of the Yueshan-Xiangfan
line will be carried out by the railways' own forces. This is common practice
with work on lines with heavy traffic. The Ministry of Railways is well
equipped and has a long experience in this type of work. In this case, the
Fourth Design and Construction Bureau will be responsible for track, station
and yard upgrading and the Electrification and Automation Bureau for installing
electrification equipment.  Similar works have been implemented in this manner
under the three previous projects, with good results. Implementation of the
other components of the project will be carried out by MR with the help of
consultants as needed. The expected implementation schedule is shown in Table
3.22.  The proposed project is expected to be oompleted by December 1995, and
the Closing Date of the proposed loan would then be June 30, 1996.
E. Procurement
3.21      Procurement of all materials and equipment will be subject to Inter-
national Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guldelines for pro-
curement, except for a number of small items worth less than US$150,000 per
order and totalling less than US$4.0 million, which would be purcmhased cm the
basis of quotations received from at least three potential suppliers. All bid
packages valued at over US$500,000 will be subject to the Bank's prior review
of procurement documentation. In bid evaluation, Chinese manufacturers will be
allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the CIF cost of competing imports, or
the relevant prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is lower. Technical
assistance, including the portion expected to be financed by the Japanese Yen

Grant Facility for the Strategic Plan Study (para. 3.17) will be contracted in
accordance with the Bank guidelines for the use of consultants.
3.22      One of the objectives of the proposed project is to raise the level
of technology used in different activities within MR, e.g., in operations,
maintenance, administration, and manufacturing (para. 3.2). Given the size of
MR and the magnitude of its needs, there is unquestionably a domestic market of
sufficient size to sustain economic levels of production, and the Bank supports
the Government's policy of importing not only modern goods, but (for those
needed in large quantities) also the technology to produce them, so that in the
longer term some of these goods could eventually be made locally. Under the
proposed project, telecommunication and other equipment specialized to railway
functions will be procured, and preliminary consultation with potential sup-
pliers indicates that it is reasonable to expect that sufficient numbers of
manufacturers would be willing to sell technology rights to ensure adequate
competition in the tendering. To support such technology transfers, an amount
of US$5.0 million has been allocated in the proposed loan for the purchase of
licenses and computer software.

Note: Figures in parenthesev are the respective amouts
to be financed by the Bank.
3.23      For items not financed by the Bank, Government procurement procedures
will apply. Such items comprise civil works, various local materials, and
miscellaneous equipment. The civil works involved in this project are not



- 17 -
suitable for ICB. They include a large number of small conorete foundations
for the catenary masts all along the lines to be electrified, and clearance
adjustments on a few bridges; these works have to be carried out under heavy
traffic. Other civil works include lengthening a number of crossing loops by
200 m each and modifications to existing workshops at the three factories.
Delivery of major materials such as rails, other steel, timber and cement is
independently arranged by the owner and supplied to the construction bureaus.
In this case, some of these materials are to be procured through ICB and will
be financed by the proposed Bank loan.
F. Disbursement
3.24     Disbursement of the proposed loan would be as follows:
(a) 100% foreign expenditures of the CIF cost of imported equipment and
materials, and of licensing agreements;
(b) 100% local expenditures of the ex-factory cost of locally procured
equipment and materials; and
(c) 100% of the cost of technical assistance and training.
3.25     Domestic transport from port or factory would not be eligible for
Bank financing. Any savings under the proposed loan would be cancelled unless
otherwise agreed with the Bank. Disbursements against training and contracts
for goods and services valued at less than US$200,000 each would be made on the
basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). To facilitate disbursements, a
Special Acount will be established with an initial deposit not exceeding
US$8.0 million representing about four months of expected expenditures.
Replenishment of the Special Account would be made quarterly or whenever the
Special Account is drawn down by 50% of its initial deposit, whichever occurs
first. Documentation supporting the SOEs will not be submitted to the Bank but
will be kept in the project office in Beijing and made available for review by
the Bank's supervision missions.
3.26     An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 3.22, where
a comparison is made with the Bank-wide profile for railway projects. Dis-
bursements are expected to be very similar to the standard profile. The sche-
dule is based on the assumption that the proposed loan would become effective
by September 30, 1988.
G. Environment
3.27     No negative impact on the environment is anticipated fron the pro-
ject. The electrification of the 113-km of section between Yueshan and Luoyang
(currently steam and diesel operated) will significantly reduce air pollution
in the area.

IV. ECONCMIC EVALWATION
A. Main Benefits
4.1     This project will make a direct contribution to the Government's over-
all plan for providing the increased rail transport capacity that is essential
for sustained growth of the economy. Under the Strategic Plan Study, intensive
field testing of railway modernization measures will be undertaken on the Bei-
jing-Shanghai railway corridor.  These field trials and pilot projects have the
potential of identifying substantial improvements in operating methods, even
beyond the very good level that MR has already achieved, which could then be
applied across the system. In addition, the modernization of the three locomo-
tive and rolling stock factories will not only accelerate the growth of MR's
fleet, thus directly enhancing transport capacity in all regions of the econo-
my, but will also support important experimental efforts in industrial and
process engineering to reduce costs and enhance quality. Finally, the project
will substantially increase the transport capacity of the Yueshan-Xiangfan
line, which serves one of the major coal routes out of Shanxi.
4.2     For this analysis, all inputs and outputs were evaluated in constant
1988 prices. As far as practicable, taxes were excluded from financial prices.
Virtually all of the imported materials and equipment to be used in the project
will enter the country duty free. For traded goods, CIF prices of imports and
FOB prices of exports were used in estimating the cost of materials and equip-
ment, with due adjustment for the cost of inland transportation. The official
exchange rate was used to convert foreign currency figures to Rernminbi. A con-
version factor of 0.5 was applied for unskilled labor costs, while the shadow
wage rate was calculated at four times the actual wage for highly qualified
technical and supervisory staff. The shadow prices of other input categories
are shown in Annexes 4 and 5.
B. Yueshan-Xiangfan Line Double-Tracking and Partial Electrification
4.3     South of Luoyang, the Yueshan-Xiangfan line currently carries an aver-
age of about 30 mt per year in both directions, plus 6 pairs of passenger
trains a day. When the project is completed, capacity will be 130 mt plus
about 12 passenger train pairs. Despite this large increase in capacity, real-
istic projections of traffic growth suggest that all caDacity will be used by
the mid-1990s, after which another investment (electrification of the section
south of Luoyang) would need to be undertaken. This line lies on the direct
route between the coal mines of Shanxi and Henan and the industrial cities
along the Yangtze River, and it is therefore not surprising that coal will
account for a large share (about 70%) of the projected freight traffic in the
southbound direction.
4.4      The benefits of the project are calculated in terms of the value added
of freight traffic that will be shipped on the line when additional capacity is
available, plus the value of extra passenger travel made possible. Benefits of
the freight traffic are estimated according to the value added per ton of coal
which represents about one-half of total projected freight traffic on the line.
The price per ton of average-quality coal is projected to rise from its current
level of about US$20 FOB Shanghai to US$26 in the year 2000 and hold steady



- 19 -
thereafter (in constant 1988 dollars); the combined production, rail and river
transport and handling costs between Shanxi mines and Shanghai ports are es-
timated at about US$15 per ton.
4.5       At present, coal is experiencing a very depressed world market condi-
tion and these projections reflect a rather pessimistic outlook of future ooal
prices.  The value added of coal for domestic use is undoubtedly much higher
than reflected in the depressed border price, and was therefore computed as
twice the difference between the coal price per ton FOB Shanghai and the total
transport and handling costs. Thus, the value added per ton of coal is about
US$9 in 1988, rising to about US$21 per ton by the end of the century.
4.6       The value of incremental passenger traffic has been calculated in
tenms of the value added of the freight traffic displaced, on the assumption
that passengers would oe prepared to pay this much higher price than the ta-
riffs. This method of passenger benefit evaluation reflects a severe rationing
situation and the notion that society, as distinct from individual passengers,
does indeed value the incremental passenger travel at least as much as the
economic value of the displaced commodities.
4.7      Apart from the cost of the project itself, the cost streams also
include the necessary complementary investments in electric power supply, loco-
motives and rolling stock, coal mine ,development, and production capacity in-
creases for other commodities (all adequately shadow-priced). The ERR for this
package of complementary investments is 37% and the net present value (NPV) at
12% discount rate is V 13.8 billion with a 20-year period for benefits (for
details, see Annex 4 and Table 4.1). Some of these investments have a life
expectancy well beyond 20 years, but adding such benefits to the calculations
increases the ERR only marginally. By allocating the project capital costs
between passengers and freight on a basis of equivalent freight trains, the NPV
can be broken down into components attributable to incremental passenger and
freight traffic, as follows:
--------- V billion    
Incremental passenger traffic:                         4,2  (30%)
Incremental freight traffic:
Coal                            4.5  (47%)
Other comnodities               5.1  (53%)
Subtotal freight            9.6 (100%)         9.6  (70%)
Total                                         13.8 (100%)
4.8      An alternative proposal to increase line capacity south of Luoyag
was to retain single-track operation but shift from single-head steam to
double-head diesel traction, thus permitting heavier yet faster trains. This
option was rejected as uneconomical, because of its significantly higher fuel
costs. North of Luoyang, diesel operation was considered in place of electri-
fication, but was also rejected as uneconomical (details in Annex 4).



- 20 -
C. Modernization of Three Factories
4.9      The freight traffic carried by MR has been growing at about 5% p.a.
in recent years, while passenger traffic has been increasing at an even faster
12% p. a. MR's locomotive and rolling stock factories have been unable to keep
up with this rapid growth, and much potential traffic has been turned away for
lack of fleet capacity.
4.10     The major benefits of extra rolling stock must be measured in terms
of the contribution that extra pkm and tkm make to the economy. As explained
in detail in Annex 5 and Tables 4.2 and 4.3, this has been done in terms of the
customers' willingness to pay. The factory modernization also provides modest
benefits in the form of savings in fleet operating costs (especially mainte-
nance) due to the improved quality of the rolling stock produced. The proposed
investments in the three factories, together with the necessary complementary
investments (duly shadow-priced), exhibits ERRs of 30% for pkm and 36% for tkm,
respectively, with corresponding NPVs (at 12% discount rate) of V 2.4 billion
and V 3.3 billion.
4.11     kA uia ternative way to increase the fleet size would be to import
rolling stxck, 'ather than modernize the factories. As shown in detail in
Annex 5, the imPorting option can definitely be rejected as uneconomic compared
to modernizuig the factories, for both passenger coaches and freight cars.
This is mainly because similar imports are 100% to 500% more expensive than the
domestically-r,roduced units.
D. Overall Evaluation and Risks
4.12     Overall economic evaluation shows that implementation of all project
components is well justified and should proceed without delay. The works for
electrification and track upgrading involve proven technology that is already
in wide use in China and elsewhere in the world; technological risks are there-
fore small. MR has successfully completed similar projects for a number of
years; risks from inadequate project implementation and operation are therefore
small, although prior project implementation experience (para. 2.25) does indi-
cate a risk of implementation delays. These risks are being addressed as indi-
cated in para. 2.26, and results of sensitivity analyses are discussed below.
4.13     The more innovative aspects of the Strategic Plan Study component do
involve some technological and managerial risks which can be controlled in
various ways, in particular through close collaboration with several foreign
railways that have successfully implemented such technology. However, the
potential benefits of the modernization package are enormous. Estimated for
the pilot Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor alone, the expected benefits are
already very large even under rather conservative assumptions. At present, the
Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor is being upgraded under a project expected to
last through the early 1990s.  The upgrading entails traditional iiivestments
such as lengthening stations, increasing the weight of rails and installing a
high-throughput signalling system. As a very rough order of magnitude, if the
increase in line capacity due to the modernization package alone equals 10% of
the corresponding increase due to the traditional investments, which should be
possible, the ERR of the Strategic Plan Study and related modernization mea-
sures can be estimated at 44%, and the NPV (12%) at V 850 million. Increasing
the above incremental capacity from 10% to 15% yields an ERR of 51% and a NPV



- 21 -
(12%) of V 1.4 billion (details are available in the Project File). Larger
benefits are expected from future applications of the modernization measures to
other major lines in MR's rail network.
4.14     The potential benefits of the Strategic Plan Study and related mod-
ernization measures are, of course, not limited to their contribution to the
expansion of line capacity. Indeed, the computerized Operation Information
System (OIS) (see Annex 2 for details) represents a major step toward future
improvements in the quality of rail transport service. For example, the com-
puterized OIS, which will be field-tested on the Beijing-Shanghai railway
corridor, will permit much greater flexibility than the present manually-based
system in the dispatching of freight cars to shippers, and in the advance plan-
ning of their movements.
4.15     The constraints placed on China's development by transportation bot-
tlenecks ensure that this sector will continue to receive Government attention
and priority. The evident success of the recent economic reforms, and the
rapid growth of transportation demand that has accompanied the reforms, suggest
that rail traffic is likely to grow at least as fast as projected. Thus the
overall risk is low that benefits of the project would fall substantially short
of projections, but sensitivity analysis for the project components is shown in
Annexes 4 and 5. In no case does the ERR for any component fall below 18%.
Included in the sensitivity analysis was a rather severe cpse: to delay the
incremental traffic by two years, given that all investments are timely; this
is more pessimistic than the case of delaying both complementary investments
and incremental traffic by two years.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Structure of MR
5.1      The organizational structure of MR is described in paras. 2.1 to 2.6.
From a financial point of view, MR displays come of the characteristics of both
a department of Government and a cumnercial enterprise.  Its bureaus form part
of Government and their expense is included in the central Government budget.
The administrations and the factories are self-accounting enterprises, calcu-
lating their profits/losses individually (although on somewhat artificial bases
-- see paras. 5.2 and 5.4) and maintaining their own special funds. Consolida-
tion of financial statements of these units to show the results and condition
of the system as a whole is only incompletely carried out (para. 5.9).
5.2      At present there are 12 regional administrations and within them,
48 sub-administrations, most of which participate in the revenue sharing system
of MR. Revenue is pooled as it is collected, and redistributed by MR to the
administrations in proportion to the volume of traffic they handle, times a
coefficient taking into account local cost factors such as type of motive power
and topography. Each administration is thus able to influence profit in the
short-term only through control of costs; but only certain costs are within the
administrations' control. Depreciation and provisions for major repairs, which
together comprise about 40% of total operating expenses, are in part distribut-
ed from MR. Payroll, which makes up a further 15% of total operating expenses,
is also effectively controlled by MR through its allocation of the number of
staff to each administration. In fact, the administrations control only the



- 22 -
remaining 45% of operating expenses -- though in this they appear to have been
quite effective.
5.3      Under the present financial arrangements between MR and the adminis-
trations, the latter remit about 85 to 90% of their profits to MR as contribu-
tion to the capital construction funds. These funds are pooled by MR and con-
trolled centrally. Each administration receives part of the reallocated fund
for small projects within its territory only; the greater part of the fund is
allocated to projects involving more than one administration and is adminis-
tered by MR through its construction units.
5.4      MR also controls a number of factories, the finances of which are
accounted for separately from the administrations and ar ! not included in MR's
financial statements. Each year, MR sets performance targets such as produc-
tion volume, level of retained profits and maximum unit costs for each factory.
The sales prices at which finished products are transferred to MR are also
fixed by MR; very few of the factories have any customers other than MR itself.
They are therefore for the most part tied (and wholly controlled) suppliers
whose only opportunity to influence their own financial results is through
control of manufacturing costs. The financial arrangements of the factories
are similar to those of the railway administrations. Most of the profit is
remitted to the Ministry; only a small portion is left for employee welfare and
production development. Capital expenditures are handled by MR through its
Industry Bureau except for those of the signalling factories, which are handled
through the Railway Signal and Cmrmunication Company of MR.
5.5      In theory, both the administrations and the factories are considered
as financially independent entities. In reality, however, their degree of in-
dependence is obviously limited and financial planning and capital expenditure
control only become meaningful at the ministry level. It is at this level
where all cost elements of the network are consolidated and investment deci-
sions taken. The focus of a meaningful financial evaluation of railway per-
formance should therefore be at the ministry level.
B. Financial Arrangements
5.6      Before 1983.  Until 1983, all profits were turned over to the Govern-
ment, a;id all capital construction was funded by Government grants. No rela-
tionship was recognized between these two items, each of which was a function
of the overall state planning mechanism.
5.7       1983 to 1985.  In the early 80s, the Government began selectively
granting greater autonomy to a number of state-owned enterprises in an attempt
to encourage higher productivity and efficiency. The degree of autonomy dif-
fered from one enterprise to another and the pace of transition also varied.
MR becam involved in this process starting in 1983. The basic changes to its
relationship with the Government included the introduction of income tax and
sales tax to replace the total remittance of profit to the Government, and the
replacement of grants by loan financing for its capital construction. Over the
period from 1983 to 1985, MR paid a business (sales) tax of 15% and a 55% tax
on its operating income; for a transitional period, it remitted a further part
of its after-tax profit to the Government. Capital construction was financed
from loans at 3.6% interest p.a. with a repayment period of about 20 years.



- 23 -
5.8       1986 onwards. In 1986 a further majkor step was taken in the transi-
tional process. MR assumed responsibility for funding its own capital program,
largely from retained earnings, through the "economic contract" between MR and
the Government (para. 2.5). The major features of the contract include the
following: MR is (a) to pay a business tax of about 5% of gross revenue; (b)
free from paying income tax for the entire contract period; and (c) responsible
for funding its own capital program from retained earnings.
C. Past Financial Performance
5.9      MR does not routinely prepare and report consolidated results for the
whole of its operations. However, consolidated income statements are avail-
able, since they are prepared in connection with the revenue distribution sys-
tem and (prior to 1986) to establish MR's income tax liability.  Those for the
last five years (Table 5.1) are presented below:
1982    1983    1984    1985       1986
--------- V million ----------

Operating ratio                  70       67       61       62       61
5.10     The above results need to be interpreted with some caution, in par-
ticular with respect to the value of operating expenses. The provisions for
major repairs and depreciation may be understated since a number of completed
projects have not yet been capitalized in the administrations' books. However,
even with these caveats the results indicate a satisfactory growth of profits.
While profit growth was driven chiefly by the volume of traffic and the tariff
hikes of 1983 and 1985, careful control of operating costs also contributed;
costs per traffic unit increased only from 1.03 fen in 1982 to 1.23 fen in
1986, due mainly to an increase in the depreciation rate and the inclusion of
bonus (previously paid from a special fund) in payroll costs.
5.11     At the administration level, considerable statistical and financial
information exists on railway operations. This information is used mairly for
reporting the status of specific items or accounts, e.g., particular capital
investments and the status of capital construction projects. At present, no
mechanism exists to link these accounts in all the administrations for network
consolidation. Hence, a consolidated balance sheet for the network is not



- 24 -
routinely available. However, efforts are being made towards developing the
accounting system in order to produce consolidated financial statements in the
future. In the meantime, an attempt has been made to bring up-to-date the
total fixed asset values for the network. The result, however, should be re-
garded as only indicative because of the timing of asset recording (para. 5.10)
and because it lacks the confidence of values established on the basis of full
double-entry consolidation. Nevertheless, the rates of return on fixed assets
in use (at historic cost) show a trend of improvement over the past five years.
They are as follows:

Average net fixed assets in use     48.1     49.8     52.7     56.8    62.1

fixed assets in use (X)            6.5      7.9     11.2     12.1     14.2
D. Financial Plans
5.12     The econumic contract between MR and the Government covers the period
of the 7FYP (1986-1990). For the purposes of the economic contract, MR based
its financial forecast on an extrapolation of 1985 results.  The key figures
are:
V biUion
Revenue                      130
Less business tax           ( 7)
Less  iperating expenses    ( 87)
Earnings                      36
5.13     The above figures are aggregates for the 7FYP period; there are no
details on a year-by-year basis. Cash flow has been assumed to be equal to
earnings. On this basis, the financing plan for MR appears as follows:

Capital expenditure    39

La from OBCF and IMED.
E. Future Financial Performance
5.14     The economic contract of MR provides broad performance targets to be
achieved through 1990; there are no forecasts to provide a basis for financial
planning beyond this horizon. Further, since the economic contract represents
an experiment in establishing relationships between MR and the Govenmment, the
results of this five-year plan may well modify the future financial arrange-
ments. Our analysis of MR's financial situation is therefore restricted to the
7FYP period.
5. 15    Within the 7FYP, an attempt has been made to disaggregate the con-
tract figures into annual forecasts, starting with traffic which is expected to
reach 1.6 billion tons for freight and 1.4 billion passengers by 1990, repre-
senting average annual growth rates of 4.9% and 6.8% respectively (Annex 6).
Average distances of 660 km for freight and 240 km for passengers have been
used, derived from 1986 traffic. Both passenger and freight tariffs have been
assumed constant at the 1986 level. Operating expenses have been projected by
MR based on traffic growth, with a 2-3% uplift to allow for inflation. The
total profit is allocated in two ways: capital construction, to which is ap-
plied 55% of profit plus 10% of gross sales revenue, and special funds, which
take the remaining profit. The projected income statements of MR for the 7FYP
years are then as follows:

Special fund       1,136    1,061  756  403  14    3,370    8,000
5.16     Since there appears to be little downside risk in the traffic fore-
casts, the achievement of MR's planned profit for the 7FYP looks reasonably
assured; even with the oonservative assumption that tariffs remain constant at
1986 level, a net profit of V 37.5 billion is projected, V 4.5 billion (13%)
higher than provided for in the economic contract. This surplus would be suf-
ficient to cover a substantial increase in operating costs above the levels
forecast, including in particular an increase of up to 50% in the cost of fuel
and energy, even in the unlikely event that MR were given no compensating tar-
iff increase. If MR's actual results in the early years of the 7FYP are close
to forecast, MR would be in a position to expand its investment program accord-
ingly, or alternatively, reduce its planned level of loan financing.
F. Systems Developments
5.17     The changes already effected and still ongoing in MR's relationships
with the central Government (parss. 5.6 to 5.8) have placed a considerably
greater onus on MR for the management of its own affairs. In particular, the
concept of the economic contract calls for MR to take responsibility for profit
generation, capital expenditure control, financial planning and debt manage-
ment. MR has recognized that its management systems need strengthening to
support these new responsibilities.
5.18     Financial Accounting. The availability of fully consolidated finan-
cial information now assumes increased importance. Headquarters management
will need timely and reliable system-wide reports on cash flow and balance
sheet condition as well as profits (para 5.9), and this information will need
to cover all the activities for which MR is responsible; factories and con-
struction enterprises will need to be included as well as operating units.
Such consolidated reports will be facilitated by the completion of the computer
links between headquarters, administration, and subadministration
accounting offices which are now being installed.



- 27 -
5.19     PLaniing. The five-year time horizon is too short for meaningful
strategic planning in transportation. On the other hand, an undivided period
of five years is too long as a basis of financial a..ntrol; at present, there
are no benchmarks between the one-year budget and the five-year aggregates of
the contract. The lack of a cash' flow forecast deprives MR of an important
instrument of financial control. But the rectification of these weaknesses,
and further refinement of the financial planning process, are dependent on the
development of better procedures for establishing the two most important inputs
to the financial plans: the traffic forecast, and the forecast of annual capi-
tal expenditures resulting from the overall investment plan. These procedures
have been discussed at paras. 2.9 to 2.12.
l
5.20     Control. More immediate progress is possible in the area of finan-
cial control systems, and a number of initiatives are under discussion or al-
ready under way. In 1985, MR began the development of a costing system de-
signed to analyze costs of operation by route and by class of traffic. The
Bank supported this initiative by components in the first and third railway
projects (Loans 2394-CiA and 2678-CIAWCr 1680-CMA) which financed the cost of a
study tour for Chinese officials, services of foreign experts, and the purchase
of computer equipment.  The required changes in MR's financial accounting were
introduced in 1987 and a pilot costing system is now being tested in three
subadministrations. Although the system is not expected to go live system-wide
for some years, it will eventually generate the data necessary to examine such
questions as the profitability of various types of traffic, the adequacy of
tariffs and the burden of uneconomic lines.
5.21     Other aspects of financial control of current concern to MR include'
(a) techniques for maintaining headquarters' control of administrations'
and units' financial performance while at the same time allowing
local managements increased initiative, in line with the new rela-
tionship between the Government and MR itself;
(b) systems for managing cash on a global basis;
(c) accounting methods to reflect better the cost of MR's operations
(such as replacement-cost-based depreciation); and
(d) systems for interfacing MR with other transportation enterprises,
such as interline freight billing and through ticketing of passen-
gers.
MR has requested the Bank's advice and assistance in dealing with these mat-
ters, and this will be given through ongoing discussions with MR officials and,
if necessary, by the selective financing of specialist advisory services.
Finance could be -made available from any open loan including the present one,
although no specific sum is earmarked for the purpose since needs have not yet
been defined.

VI. AGREEMENTS FEACHED AND FE(XtSIENDATION
6.1      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a) the project accounts will be audited by independent auditors accept-
able to the Bank, and the accounts audit reports will. be sent to the
Bank for review not later than six months after the end of each fis-
cal year (pra. 2.14);
(b) the strategic plan study and the plan of action for pilot-testing,
monitoring and evaluating improvement measures on the Beijing-
Shanghai railway corridor (para. 3.15 and Annex 2) will be carried
out according to a timetable and with the support of internationally
recruited specialists satisfactory to the Bank; and
(c) training and technical assistance will be carried out according to an
agreed program (para. 3.16 and Annex 3).
6.2      Subject to the above assurances, the proposed project would be suit-
able for a Bank loan of US$200.0 million to the Peoples' Republic of China.
The loan would be for a term of 20 years including a five-year grace period, at
the standard variable rate.

FOURTH RAILWAY R
Outline of a Strategic Plan StudY
I. OBJECTIVE
1. *      he objeotive of the proposed study is to develop strategic plans in
the fields of teleormunications and computerization, in order to improve oper-
ational managemsnt and transportation capacity, i.e.:
(a) improve the planning and exetption of MR's transport function; and
(b) improve operational efficiency and increase capacity on the Beijing-
Shanghai railway corridor, in the most cost-effective way.
II.  SCOPE
2.       The study should cover the areas of telecommmrications and operating
information management. It should be carried out by a project team (MR staff),
in collaboration with foreign experts where appropriate.
A. Teleoommunications
3.       The objective of this study component would be to review MR's current
telecounumications strategic plans and to update them based on new technolo-
gical developments such as digitalization, fiber optics transmission, etc.
Specifically, the data transmission alternatives should be analyzed and solu-
tions proposed. More detailed outlines of the tenms of reference for the pro-
posed studies are in the Project File. The scope of the study should include:
(a) a general overview of the existing networks operated by Mt and, if
possible, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunicatians, and an analy-
sis of the constraints associated with the use of both networks;
(b) traffic analyses and demand projections of camnimication requirements
for 5 and 10 years;
(c) a review of technological trends in voice and non-voice commnica-
tions;
(d) the formulation of overall system design principles;
(e) the elements of technibl plans;
(f) a ocparisnm of system architecture alternatives;

ANNB 2
Page 2
(g) the principles of procurement policy;
(h) a separate study, to identify the optimal data transmissions network
for MR by analyzing the opt,4ons for: (i) packet switched network;
(ii) digital switched network for integrated services (data, voice,
etc.) e.g., ISDN; (iii) point-to-point data network; and (iv) other
possibilities; and
(i) a detailed cost comparison of alternative telecomunications
approaches on the Beijing-Shanghai rcilway corridor, based on the
data transmission requirements developed for the computer network by
the OIS Project Team.
B. Operating Information ftpgement
3.       This component of the study oomprises two parts: (i) Operating Infor-
mstion Systets (OI8), and (ii) Transportation Capacity Computer Modeling.
(1) ODeratinx Information System
4.       The objective of the data processing strategic plan is to define and
obtain management agreement on a strategic approacL to developing computer-
baed, operating information systeim for M? as a whole. The system should
support a real-time, integrated data base that can be used by MI operating
management at all levels to develop, monitor sad execute transportation ad
other operating plans including rolling stock maintenance activities.
5.       In 1985, a MR working group developed a strategic plan for computer-
based operating information systems and associated telecsyszications syEtems.
This plan was based on a hierarchical computer system architectur which mir-
rors the present organizational structure of MR. Mini-computers located at the
major marshalling yards plus microoomputers located at the stations would com-
municate and update a data base maintained by mini-computers located at the
subadninistrations.  The subadministration computers would update truncated
data bases maintained by mini-computers located at the administration level,
which in turn would update an even more truncated data base at the MR level.
6.       The proposed study should re-examine the findings and conolusions of
the above study and compare the projected benefits and costs of this hierarchi-
cal computer architecture with the more common approach of building a common,
integrated data base that would support transportation decision-making at aLl
levels. Preliminary terms of reference for the proposed study are in the Pro-
ject File. The scope of the study would include:
(a) detailed analyses of the design approach and uses of computer-based,
operating information systems which have been suocessfully imple-
mented on other railroads that have significant freight operations;
(b) an analysis of -the advantages and disadvantages of these existing
systems compared with the approach developed in the 1985 study;

ANNEX 2
Page 3
(c) the development of design specifications for the recomuended system,
including:
- contents and organizations of the data base;
- functional descriptions of the major application and system
pro&rams; and
- selection of the type, locations and numbers of computer hard-
ware.
(d) a description of how the system would be used to support transporta-
tion decision-making, such as wagon and locomotive distribution,
train operations, wagon shunting in yards, etc, and also improve
standards of service offered to the railways customers, e.g., in
providing more timely information on the availability of wagons,
expected arrival time, etc.
(e) the definition of how the system would support and interface with
other important information systems, such as operating statistics,
revenue accounting, management information and the like;
(f) the development of specific plans for a pilot installation along the
Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor;
(g) projections of transmission volumes to be used in the telecou-unica-
tions strategic study;
(h) projected costs and benefits; and
(i) delineation of a system for monitoring and evaluating prospective
operational improvements, including identification of performance
indicators and experimental controls.
(ii) Transportation Capacity Computer Modeling
7.       A second objective of the Operating Information Mbnagement Study is
to demonstrate the usefulness of computer models to help evaluate the relative
benefits and costs of alternative operating investments and practices. At
present, MR has formed various project teams to study possible operating in-
vestments on important rail corridors, including the Beijing-Shanghai railway
corridor. More specifically, the purpose here is to adapt existing and power-
ful computer models to fit MR conditions so as to assist the existing MR study
teams to better evaluate the relative benefits of alternative operating invest-
ments and practices an the Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor. The objective is
to increase the capacity of this line as much as possible over the next five
years . The scope of the study includes:
(a) the analysis of existing transportation capacity of busy sections of
the Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor, such as the Xuzhou-Nanjing
section, through the use of a track caPacity computer model under
various operating onrditions and train densities.



- 33 -
ANNEX 2
Page 4
(b) the application of an existing network simulation model, to evaluate
various marshalling, blooking and direct train alternatives on the
Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor;
() a study and analysis of possible types of investments and changes in
signalling and operating practices at various traffic levels, such as:
- four-aspect, one-y runnin;
- four-aspect, tw-way running, with current dispatcher system;
- four-aspect, two-way runmning, with a co puter dispatching system;
- blocking more direct trains to by-pass intermediate marshalling
yards;
- running through locomotives on direct freight trains from Beijing
to Shanghai, with no stopping in intermediate marshalling yards;
- testing alternative uses of the three msin tracks from Beijing to
Tianjin;
- running trains of longer lengths (e.g., 850 to 2,100 m);
- using freight cars with heavier axle loads (e.g., 21 to 30 tons);
- doubling out of yards to increase yard capacity; and
- varying the length and spacing of pessing loops.
(d) the development of investment cost estimates for euch of the above
alternatives, and the formulation of least-cost solutions for in-
creasing the capacity of the Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor as
much as possible;

III. TBCHNICAL OOLLABORATION
8.       A technical collaboration component of the proposed Fourth Rai'way
Project should support the Chinese Project Team in conducting the telecommni-
cations and operating information managemnt studies.  The techniial assistance
will have the following components:
(a) study visits and training of Chinese experts abroad;
(b) use of foreign experts to provide training and technical collabora-
tion abroad and in China;
(c) transfer of know-how, including computer soft waire; and
(d) modification and use of computer planning models.
9.       The foreign exchange amount allocated for technical collaboration,
simulation models, foreign visits of Chinese experts etc. is US$2.5 million.
About US$0.5 million equivalent will be provided by MR in local currency to
cover related expeditures in Chins.
IV. APPRACH AM SCHEDLES
10.      The following approaches and schedules are proposed for each of the
two major componen4-s in the development of strategic plans:
A. Teleco.uunicatios
11.        The study would be conduoted by a small group of MR teleccunia-
tions specialists. The proposed schedule for the training and the study is:
TASKS                                         TARG  DATES
(a) form the Teleccmminications Project Team.                     CoWleted
(b) exchange information with three foreign railways.           08/88-09/88
(c) make study visits to three foreign railways.                10/88-11/88
(d) oonduct and complete thz telecc         nsication

ANNEX 2
Page 6
B. Operating Infornmation Mbnagement
12.      ahe approach and schedules for both components of the Operating
Information Managenent Study are as follows:
(i) Operating Information Systems
13.      The operating information system study would be conducted primarily
by a M OIS Project Team composed of individuals with either data processing or
transportation backgrounds. Collectively, Project Team members should have a
working knowledge of marshalling yard operations, goods station operations,
train dispatching, procedures for developing the transportation and technical
plans, as well as information management systems and computer hardware.
14.       Team members would receive detailed training on the design and use
of coaputer-based, operating information systems by two or three other rail-
roads who have successfully implemented these types of systems. Following the
training, the consulting subsidiary of one of these railroads would be selected
to provide technical collaboration during the study. The proposed schedule for
the training and the study is:
TASKS                                     TARGET DATES
(a) form the MR OIS Project Team.                                 Completed
(b) undertake intensive training programs for the MR Project
Team in Beijing, conducted by 2 to 3 foreign railroads.     08/88-09/88
(c) participate in hands-on, detailed training of small groups
from the MR OIS Project Team at each of the 2 to 3 foreign
railroads for a 6 to 8 week period.                         10/88-11/88
(d) complete the study with the technical collaboration of one
of the foreign railroads.                                   12/88-06/89
(e) obtain approval frm MR for the re    oo ended approach.           08/89
(f) initiate software development and phased procurement of
the Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor pilot installation.         08/89
(g) monitor the progress and benefits from computerization
of marshalling yards along the Beijing-Shanghai railway
corridor and in Zhengzhou.                                  06/88-12/89
(ii) Transportation Capacity Computer Modeling
15.       Part of the Operations Information Management Study team would be
composed of a small group of MR staff who have an interest in developing skills
in computer modeling. This small group would complement the existing MR team

Complementary Capital Costs
2.      The proposed project will require complementary investments of several
types. Most directly, these will include a high-voltage supply line to connect
the electrified (Yueshan-Luoyang) section of the project with the regional
power grid, replacement locomotives (electric for diesel north of Luoyang and--
more gradually--diesel for steam south of Luoyang), and additional locomotives
and rolling stock to handle traffic growth. In addition, investments will be
needed to expand the production of coal and other commodities to be carried.
These linked investments are estimated as follows:
(a) High-Voltage Power SuDDly. This will consist of the following ele-
men:ts, with economic costs as shown below spread equally over four years:

(b) Locomotives and RollinR Stock. Fleet requirements and investment
costs on a year-by-year basis (calculated separately for the electrified sec-
tion north of Luoyang and the non-electrified section to the south) were de-
rived from detailed projections of future freight and passenger traffic, plus
information on economic costs and productivity. On the electrified section,
the existing diesel locomotives (Dongfeng 4) will be replaced by electric loco-
motives (Shaoshan 3). On the non-electrified section, Qianjin steam locomo-
tives will continue to be used. Most of the diesel locomotives from the sec-
tion north of Luoyang will be used on other lines and the average salvage value
of an existing diesel locomotive is assumed to be 30% of the price of a new
unit. As to passenger coaches and freight cars, more will be required as a
result of running more frequent and longer trains. Tfhe basic data and the re-
sulting economic costs are summarized below. A factor of 1.34 has been used in
conversion from financial to economic costs based on the EAAM study data.

ANNEX 4

The year-by-year economic costs are shown in Table 4.1. Full details are
available in the Project File.
(c) Coal Mine Develoiment Costs: The cost of new mine development, in
economic prices, is currently estimated by Bank staff to be US$43 (V 160) per
ton of annual capacity. The policy of "restricting output according to trans-
port capacity" is still observed in major coal producing areas like Shanxi
province. For this reason, it is assumed in Table 4.1 that about 25% of the
extra coal traffic on the line will came from existing mine capacity, while
about 75% will come from new mine development. For each ton of additional an-
nual production capacity the development costs are assumed to be spread uni-
formly over 5 years before production. The total mine development expenditures
are spread over time according to year-to-year increases in coal traffic, as
shown in Table 4.1. For simplicity, the first year of analysis includes devel-
opment expenditures prior to it.
Project Benefits
3.       Freight traffic. At a projected share of about 51% of total freight
traffic, coal is the single most important cammodity by volume on the Yueshan-
Xiangfan line. After upgrading, the Yueshan-Xiangfan line will carry a heavy
coal traffic south from Shanxi to the Han River at Xiangfan or to the Yangtze
River at Wuhan. This coal will then feed the industrial areas along the Yang-
tze between Wuhan and Shanghai, with a small share perhaps exported. There is
no doubt that, in China's current situation of chronic energy shortage, the
economic contribution of the coal will be greater within the domestic economy
than as an export onto depressed world coal markets, but the benefit of the
extra coal traffic for this project is measured conservatively in terms of
world prices. The current export price of 6,700 kcal/kg coal with an ash con-
tent under 12% is about US$22-24 per ton/FOB at major seaports in China, rough-
ly one-half of the price level two years ago. In the future, the price of ex-
ported coal FOB Shanghai, adjusted downward by US$3 per ton to allow for pos-
sible lower quality on average, is estimated at about US$20 per ton in 1990,
rising to US$26 in year 2000, and constant thereafter. These projections, by
Bank staff, reflect a rather pessimistic long term outlook of energy prices.
Mine operating costs are V 10 per ton. Shipping and handling costs consist of
loading to rail (V 3), rail transport (V 15), river shipment (V 24), and trans-
shipment at Shanghai (V 5), for a total of V 47. The value added per ton of
coal should be much higher than suggested by the low border price, and was
therefore computed as twice the difference between the coal price per ton FOB
Shanghai and the total transport and handling costs. Thus, at an exchange rate
of V 3.7 per US$, the value added of a ton of coal is V 2 x (74 - 57), or V 34
in 1988, rising to V 79 in the year 2000 and constant thereafter.
4.       Passenger traffic. To estimate the benefits of providing additional
passenger capecity, the passengers' willingness to pay should ideally be used.
This type of information is currently not available. A second possible method
is to use rail tariffs. However, this method is clearly inappropriate in the
present situation of severe rationing, since the rail tariffs, at 2.5 fen per
hard seat passenger-km, are obviously much lower than the willingnes to pay
per km of an average passenger. A third method, which has been adopted, is
based on the notion that a passenger trip is valued by the Chinese society
equal to at least the economic value of the displaced cargo.

ANNEX 4
Page 4
5.       On a double track line, a psssenger train displaces about 2.3 freight
trains from the traffic flow, due to the turbulence cassed by differing speeds
and other operating characteristics. On the Yueshan-Xiangfan line, passenger
trains now carry an average of 1,250 passengers each, a figure that will rise
gradually to 1,650 peasengers by the year 1995 as longer trains are used.
Freight trains are now 3,000 tons gross trailing weight, which will rise to
3,500 tons by 1995. Adjusting for the difference between gross and net weight
on the freight trains, and also for partially loaded back-hal for freight
trains, one passenger trip is expected to displace about 0.8 tons of freight on
this line. The total tonnage of csplaced freight is then assigned on a year-
by-year basis an economic value equal to twice the value added calculations
developed in para. 3. for coal. The factor of two has been choseQ to reflect
the notion that the value added for other commodities is much higher than the
present estiuates of value added for coal. Summary results of these calcula-
tions are shown in Table 4.1; full details are available in the Project File.
Economic Rate of Return
6.       If the line's incremental capacity were to carry only the projected
coal traffic, and nothing else, the economic rate of return (ER) can be es-
timated at 21%. In reality, the line wiil carry passenger traffic and con-
modities other than coal. Attributing benefits to all incremental passenger
and freight traffic (coal and non-coal) the E   is estimated at 37% and the NPV
(12%) at V 13.8 billion. In the calculations, the value added of freight traf-
fic other than coal has been assumed to equal twice the value added estimated
for coal; this is about V 68 per ton in 1988, which is still a conservative
figure for the average commodity. By allonating the project capital cost be-
tween freight and passenger traffic on an equivalent freight train basis (with
one passenger train counting as 2.3 freight trains), the NFVs (12%) attribu-
table to inremental passenger and freight traffic are estimated at V 4.2 and
9.6 respectively, with corresponding shares of 30X and 70% of the total NPV.
The NPVS attributable to incremental coal and other freight traffic are V 4.5
and 5.1 billion, respectively, or 47% and 53% of the total freight NpV.

Least Cost Studies
8.       The 113 km section proposed for eleotrification is a natural link
between two major electrified corridors: the coal lines of Shared province and
the Longhai Railway. Electrifying the intervening link will permit trains to
run through, without stopping twice to change looomotives, thus increasing line
operating capacity. Even more important will be the savings on fuel tLat de-
rive from electrification. For projected 1992 traffic levels, diesel locomo-
tives on the section proposed for electrification would use about 40,000 tons
of fuel a year, worth about V 74 million at current world prices. By contrast,
electric looomotives will use about 150 million kwh of power, worth about V 17
million at the estimated long-run marginal cost of thermal power generation in
China (11.3 fen per kwh). Thus, fuel savings will be about V 57 million in
1992, and will rise over the years as traffic grows, providing an ER of about
33% on the increnental investment required for electrification works.

Economic Evaluation of Modernization of
Three Lcoonctive and Rolling Stock Factories
Introduction
1.       The demand for railway transportation, for both freight and passen-
gers, is growing rapidly as the economy grows and already exceeds MR's capacity
to provide service. A significant part of the problem is the shortage of lo-
comotives, freight cars, and passenger coaches. Broadly speaking, MR can res-
pond to this problem in one of three ways: (a) expwnd the production capacity
of domestic factories, (b) import some locomotives and rolling stock, or (c)
resign itself to carrying a lower volume of traffic than would otherwise be
possible. This situation is often referred to as a "make or buy" decision, but
in fact it is more accurately characterized as a "make, buy or do nothing" de-
cision, since it is always possible in principle that neither manufacturing nor
importing is economically justified. As the detailed calculations of this
annex show, the preferred economic choice in this case is to increase manufac-
turing capacity in the domestic factories.
2.       Although the modernization involves three factories, the analysis is
organized in only two segments (Tables 4.2 and 4.3), focused on extra passenger
traffic and extra freight traffic respectively. This is because locomotives
and rolling stock must operate jointly to provide extra transport services.
Project Capital Costs
3.       Economic costs of the factory modernization have been evaluated by
applying conversion factors (that is, ratios of economic prices to financial
prices) to domestic prices and by using estimated world market prices for im-
ported items. The conversion factors applied to particular categories are
based on the data in "Economic Analysis of Aluminum Milling in Shanghai" and in
the Staff Appraisal Report for the Shanghai Machine Tool Project (Report 5994-
CHA, Annex 8-1). The resulting overall conversion factors for local costs are
as follows:

4.       The investment costs of the new Sifang factory, in economic prices,
are shown in column (8) of Table 4.2. When fully operational, these invest-
ments will permit Sifang to produce 550 additional coaches a year. Each addi-
tional coach is assumed to contribute 8.0 million pkm per year. (MR's coaches
in 1986 produoed 11.7 million pkm per coach, but the coaches from Sifang will
be sleepers, which carry fewer passengers than day coaches do.) At an average
passenger train length of about 15 coaches, and including an extra 50% in loco-
motive requirements to cover shunting, double-heading, and other ancallary
work, these 550 coaches will require a complementary production of about 55
locomotives. As it bappenR. this is the incremental production that will be
achieved by the modernization at the February 7th factory, though of course the
coaches and loo00vtives in question will be dispersed throughout the fleet and
will not be coupled to each other. Nonetheless, the increased output of
coaches at Sifang will require a complementary investment in loomotive produc-
tion, which is based on the proposed investments at the February Uth factory,
and displayed in column (9) of Table 4.2.
5.       The investment costs of the modernization at the Qiqihar factory, in
economic prices, are shown in column (8) of Table 4.3. When fully operational,
these investments will permit Qiqihar to produce an extra 1750 cars per year.
Each extra car is assumed to produce 2.78 million tkm per year, based on actual
1986 performance of the MR fleet. At an average freight train length of 50
cars, and including an extra 50% in locomotive requirements to cover shunting,
double-heading, and other ancillary work, these 1750 cars will require a com-
plementary production of about 52 locomDtives. The modernized factory at Si-
fang will produce an extra 110 looomotives per year; the investment figures for
complementary locomotive production shown in column (9) of Table 4.3 are a pro-
portional share (52/110) of the costs, in economic prices, of the Sifang fac-
tory modernization.
Complementary Costs
6.       Factory Operating Costs. Beyond the investments in factory moder-
nization, the production of extra locomotives and rolling stock will alsc re-



- 46 -
Page 3
quire expenditures on raw materials, labor, and other current inpits. At fin-
anoial prioes, these unit costs are as follows:
Passenger ooach   V 150,Q000
Freight car       V  41,600
Locomotive        V 904,500
In the economic analysis of Tables 4.2 and 4.3, coluus (10) and (11), these
financial prices have been adjusted by the ratio of 1.34 for domestic equipjunt
explained in para. 3.
7.       Train Omeratinu Costs. These have been estimated in four broad cate-
gories and then a8gregated to yield the figures in column (12) of Tables 4.2
and 4.3:
(a) Rolling stock mantenance   For passenger coaches (Table 4.2), M's
experienoe suggests that a minor overhaul every third year (V 15,000)
and a major overhaul in the twelfth year (V 65,000) will be needed.
Over a 24-year lifespan, this averages V 7,100 per year per coach.
For freight cars (Table 4.3), the corresponding figures are V 3,100
every two years plus an extra V 6,200 every tenth year, for an annual
average of V 2,170 per car.
(b) Locomotive maintenance. For diesel-electric looomotives, which are
the type for which production will be increased at February 7th and
Sifang, MR's experience suggests that a minor overhaul every second
year (V 299,000) alternates with a major overhaul every fourth year
(V 897,000), yielding an annual average of V 299,000 per locomotive.
(c) Fuel. In its diesel locomotives, MR used 2.88 kg of fuel for each
1,000 (gross) tkm in 1985. The tkm and pkm figures of column (6) in
Tables 4.2 and 4.3 are net of tare and therefore only 65% of gross
weight. Fuel costs have been calculated on a gross weight basis,
treating one pkm as one tkm, at a world price of US$ 0.50 (V 1.85)
per kg of diesel fuel.
(d) Labor. In 1986, MR produced 1,133 billion "converted tkm" (that is,
tkm plus pym)n, with total employment of 3.2 million.  Assming that
one-half of the work force varies with output, then at the margin one
additional worker is needed for each additional 700,000 converted
tkm. The labor costs of Tables 4.2 and 4.3 are calculated on this
basis, at an economic price of V 1,200 per worker per year.
8.   Congested Track Costs. In the Seoond Railway Project, an inveatment of
V 1,259 million (at economic prices) to upgrade the Zhengzhou-Wuhan line yield-
ed an extra 26.15 billion tkm of capacity per year. *This translates into an
investment cost of 5 fen per tkm of annual capacity. The investment casts
ahown in column (13) of Tables 4.2 and 4.3 are calculated using this figure of
5 fen per tkm of new route capacity, on the assumption that one-third of all
traffic increments will travel on uncongested routes and two-thirds will travel
on routes that are congested and therefore require capacity-enhancing
investment.

Measuring the Benefits
9.       To resolve the "make or do nothing" choice, it is necessary to me-
sure the contribution that extra pkm or tkl make to the economy. If this com-
tribution is small, relative to the investment required, then the appropriate
choice is to do nothing (that is, to reject this investment proposal and use
the funds elsewhere). The measure of benefits used in this Annex can best be
explained by referring to Figure 1, which reflects the society's supply and
demwvd for phm or tkm in a given year.

10.      In Figure I, the supply of transport that will be available without
the project is the distance OA, and the supply with project is OB, takdn from
colmmns (4) and (5) respectively of Table 4.2 for phm and Table 4.3 for tku.
The price paid is the distance OP, which is 2.50 fen per hard-berth kilanater
for pessenger travel and 1.98 fen per tkm of freight, based on Ml's actual 1986
revenues. For 1986, the point H is determined by actual traffic plus 20%, as a
conservative allowmnce for unsatisfied demand (customers turned aray for lack
of capacity). For later years, point H shifts to the right by 5% per year as
the econmy grows. The prioe elasticity of the demand curve (that is, its

steeipness) is asstmed to be 1. 0.  he value of extra pkm or tkm, as shown in
column (7) of Tables 4.2 and 4.3, can now be calculated as the area of the
trapezoid ABKJ for the year in question. The rectangle ABED reflects train
operating costs, as shown in column (12), which must be deducted to arrive at a
measure of net benefits. In Tables 4.2 and 4.3, then, column (14) is equal to
column (7) minus all the columns from (8) to (13), which represent various
costs of providing the extra transport servioe. On the assumption that the new
machinery at the rolling stock factories will wear out or become obsolescent in
about fifteen years, traffic increments attributable to extra equipment are
projected only to the year 2005, although benefits continue after this because
the locomotives and rolling stock will remain in service for many years there-
after.
11.      An additional benefit that accrues from modernization of the three
factories relates to the loomotives and rolling stock that would be produoed
by these factories in future years even without the modernization. They will
be built to a higher quality with the project than without, and consequently
will require less mintenance and -- in the case of the locomotives - will
burn less fuel. These savings in operating costs, which are shown schematical-
ly in Figure 1 as the rectangle DLMN, are shown in column (14) of Tables 4.2
and 4.3.
Economic Rate of Return
12.      Extra Passenger Traffic (Table 4.2). On the assumptions just des-
cribed, the economic rate of return (ERR) to the proposed investments in the
new Sifang factory and existing February 7th factory, together with complemen-
tary investment in track capacity on congested routes, is 30%, and the net pre-
sent value (NPV) at a 12% discount rate is V 2.4 billion. These results make
it clear that the proposed investments are better than the "do nothing" option.
13.      To evaluate the import option, it is necessary to modify Table 4.2
somewhat, removing columns (8) through (11) and substituting two columns that
reflect the cost of importing coaches (US$ 216,000 per unit) and locomotives
(US$ 1.35 million per unit) respectively.  This modified analysis (not exhibi-
ted in this report) yields an ERR of 13% and a NPV of V 0.3 billion, which
means that - if the opportunity cost of capital is 12% -- importing or doing
nothing are very similar in their economic impact, because of the high cost of
importing. The third side of the computational triangle should also be men-
tioned, both for analytical completeness and because it illustrates an impor-
tant poilnt.
14.      This third computation is a direct comparison of the investmnt and
import options -- the traditional "make or buy" analysis. Arithmetically, this
comparison must yield an NPV of V 2.1 billion (that is, V 2.4 billion minus
V 0.3 billion) in favor of the domestic option.  The arithmetical outcome of
the ERR calculation is quite eye-catching, for the result is 238%. It is
tempting to interpret this extraordinary ERR as overwhelming evidence in favor
of the proposed investment, yet this would be a mistake, for such an ERR on the
"make or buy" comparison could equally well emerge in a situation where the "do
nothing" option is economically the best of the three choices.

15.      Extra Freight Traffic (Table 4.3). On the aesumptions described
above, the proposed investments in the existing Sifang and Qiqihar factories,
together with oomplementary investment in track capacity, yield an ERR of 36%
and a NPV of V 3.3 billion, which says that for freight traffic, as for pas-
senger traffic, the proposed investments are better than inaction. A modified
analysis (not exhibited), using import prices of US$ 27,000 per freight car and
US$ 1.35 million per locomotive, reveals that importing is also better than
doing nothing, with a NPV of V 2.4 billion and an FE of 27%. These results
are confirmed by a traditional "make or buy" calculation, which yields a pre-
dictable NPV of V 0.9 billion (predictable beoause the result is exactly equal
to 3.3 minus 2.4) and an ERR of 67%. As in para. 13, this ERR is eye-catching
but irrelevant.
Sensitivity Analysis
16.      The main risks are that demand for rail transport is more price sen-
sitive than assumed, or that demand will grow less rapidly than assumed. The
sensitivity of the ERR to these factors has been tested by assuming a price
elasticity of 2.0 in place of 1.0, and by assuming a growth of 3% p.a. in
place of 5%, as shown in the following table. In all cases, the ERRs remain
satisfactory. Tests were also performed on cost overruns, production short-
falls, fuel price increases, and increases in the Cost o0 providing extra capa-
city on congested routes, but as the table shows the ERRs change little when
moderate changes occur in these variables.

of the Ministry of Railways
1.       Traffic. In the 7FYP, by 1990, freight traffic will be 1.6 billion
tons and passenger traffic will be 1.4 billion passengers. In 1986, the aver-
age distance was 660 km for freight and 240 Im for passengers. Assuming that
the average distance remains constant throughout the five-year period, traffic
would be as follows:
1986       1990
Freight (bil. tkm)          875       1,058
Passengers (bil. pkm)       258         336
This represents an average growth rate of 4.9% for freight and 6.8%
for passengers.
2.       Sales revenues,  For 1987-1990, unit revenue (1986) times tkm/pkm.
In 1986, unit revenue was V 19.83/1,000 tkm for freight and 1 19.38/1,000 pkm
for passengers. Other revenue is assumed to grow by 12% p.a.
3.       Operating expenses are projected by MR based on traffic growth plus
2-3% to allow for contingencies.
A;       Dq&Dereciation is taken at 4% of gross depreciable fixed asset value of
the administrations. It is assumed that FA grows by the difference between the
increase in fixed asset transferred to the books of the administrations and the
retired assets. This amount approximtes the capital expenditures planned for
the 7FYP totalling about 1 40 billion, averaging about 1 8 billion per year.
Total fixed asset value includes both assets of the railway administrations,
which are depreciated in MR's acoounts, and that of their subsidiaries which
are depreciated in the subsidiaries' books; the latter depreciation has been
deduoted in arriving at "Profit frnm Subsidiaries."
5.       Non-operating expenses are projeoted to grow by 20% p.a.
6.       Capital construction funds are calculated as 55% of net profit plus
10% of gross sales revenue.
7.       Profit fran Subsidiaries is assmed to increase V 50 million p.a.
from 1986 to 1990.
