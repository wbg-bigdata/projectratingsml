MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the People's Republic of China for US$200 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 20 years
maturity and help finance the modernization and capacity improvement of the
railway network.   The project is expected to be co-financed by a Japan
grant fund for US$1.5 million equivalent.
2.       Backgrou_d:  The Chinese transport system has been severely taxed
by recent rapid economic development.   For example, railway transport,
which carries more traffic than all other modes combined, is now a greater
constraint on energy supplies than is coal mine development.   The Ministry
of Railways (MR) is building new railway lines and increasing the capacity
of the busiest existing lines, but it will take several years to eliminate
bottlenecks.  Operations are efficient and show a high level of track and
equipment utilization. MR runs a financially profitable operation and its
tariffs are well in excess of the unit operating costs in the aggregate,
although this may partially reflect price distortions prevailing throughout
the economy (e.g., underpricing of coal).   The most important issues
confronting the railway subsector at this time are: (a) shortages of route
capacity and rolling stock affecting both freight and passenger traffic;
(b) outdated technology in many aspects of operations; and (c) weak
management information and telecommunicatiMns systems.
3.       The Government objectives in the railway subsector are to increase
the carrying capacity of freight traffic by about 30% and of passenger
traffic by about 40% during the 1986-90 Seventh Five-Year Plan (7FYP). The
strategy for achieving these objectives has as its main thrusts: (a)
increasing line capacity through double-tracking, electrification,
signalling improvements and other upgradings; (b) improving operational
efficiency of existing assets; and (c) augmenting locomotive and rolling
stock production capacity. To expedite the effort, in 1986 the Government
and MR concluded an "economic contract" for the period of the 7FYP in which
MR has been given increased authority over its own construction program and
has been permitted to retain profits to finance it. A package of smaller
but significant reforms is included in the plan whose thrust is to increase
the responsibility and initiative of MR's central and local managers.
4.       The Bank has supported these objectives through three previous
project loans.   All three are intended to alleviate bottlenecks through
line construction and electrification; modernize manufacture of rolling
stock and signalling equipment; and modernize track maintenance.   In
addition, the first two projects initiated the design and installation of
traffic costing and management information systems.



-2-
RAtignale for Bank Involvement:  The Bank is in an excellent
position to assist KR in the technological modernization of both hardware
and software systems to meet the transportation demands generated by rapid
economic growth in the most efficlent manner. Our assistance strategy is
to continue to support the Government's urgent efforts to expand capacity
not only through physical expansion of infrastructure and rolling stock but
also through technological modernization to improve the productivity of
assets, and at the same time to shift the dialogue toward broader,
subsector-wide issues. During processing of the first three railway
projects, MR was unwilling to engage in a dialogue with the Bank that went
much beyond the narrow scope of the specific project components proposed
for Bank financing. The situation is, however, changing. In particular,
MR has recently requested the Bank's advice and assistance in the
development of new management systems appropriate to its responsibilities
under the economic contract.
6.       Project Objeitives:  The present project reflects the three main
thrusts of the Government's present development strategy for railways: (a)
increasing the capacity of key routes and terminals; (b) enhancing the
productivity of existing assets by advancing the level of technology used
in different activities within MR, e.g. in train operations, maintenance,
administration and manufacturing; and (c) expanding rolling stock
manufacturing facilities. Although the Bank has already assisted MR in
improving efficiency in the previous three railway projects, the present
project is the first in which a study will be undertaken of efficiency
measures which cover a significantly broader scope: management information,
train control, signalling and telecommunications. Moreover, the Bank and
MR have begun a serious dialogue on MR's planning process, emphasizing the
major elements of traffic forecasting and investment priorities. During
appraisal the Bank has sought commitment from the Government to establish
mechanisms to help enrich the now-expanding subsector dialogue. In
particular in connection with the Strategic Plan Study of the present
project, the Bank asked MR to set up programs to evaluate the suitability
of the Beijing-Shanghai line modernization measures for possible future
expansion on a network-wide basis. These efforts are intended to prepare
for possible sector lending in the future.
7.       Proiect Description:  The project will have four main components:
(a) the double-tracking and partial electrification of the 492 km Yueshan-
Xiangfan section of the Jiaozuo-Zhicheng (Jiaozhi) line, in the Beijing-
Guangzhou rail corridor; (b) the expansion and modernization of three
locomotive and rolling stock factories; (c) a Strategic Plan Study in the
areas of telecommunication and computerization in order to improve
operational management and transportation capacity, to be pilot-tested on
the Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor; and (d) training and consultants'
services. MR, the project's implementing agency, has set up a special unit
to facilitate the interface between the planning, operational and financial
aspects of the project.
8.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$600 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$273.1 million (46%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement



-3-
schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7148-CHA dated June 2, 1988, is being distributed
separately.
9.       Agreed Actions:  During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following: (a) the project accounts will be audited by independsnt auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and the accounts audit reports will be sent to the
Bank for review not later than six months after the end of each fiscal
year; (b) the Strategic Plan Study and the plan of action for pilot-
testing, monitoring and evaluating improvement measures on the Beijing-
Shanghai railway corridor will be carried out according to a timetable and
with the support of internationally recruited specialists satisfactory to
the Bank; and (c) training and technical assistance will be carried out
according to an agreed program.
10.      Benefits:   Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (a) increased rail transport capacity that is essential for
sustained growth of the economy; and (b) improved management and industrial
process engineering of the railway rolling stock factories.   The
quantifiable benefits include the additional freight, including coal and
timber, that can be carried and the provision of more capacity for
passenger transport; the overall economic rate of return, reflecting the
shortage of transport capacity, is 36%.
11.      Risks:   There is a risk of delay in project implementation.
However, lagging performance in earlier railway projects (SAR, para
2.25-2.26) has recently begun to improve, due both to the establishment of
a special office in MR (Foreign Capital and Technical Import Office) and
accumulation of experience.   In the present case the risk has been
minimized by requiring advanced preparation of a substantial amount of
tender documents for the first year of implementation. The strategic plan
study and related modernization measures for the Beijing-Shanghai line also
presents some risk, but it will be controlled through close collaboration
with major railways iu Europe and North America, who have extensive
experience in the technology involved.
12.      Recommendation:   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
